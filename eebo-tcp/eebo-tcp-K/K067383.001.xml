            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The BRITAINS.</head>
               <p>THE curioſity, entertained by all civilized nations, of enquiring into the exploits and adventures of their anceſtors, commonly excites a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that the hiſtory of remote ages ſhould always be ſo much involved in obſcurity, uncertainty, and contradiction. Ingenious men, poſſeſſed of leizure, are apt to puſh their reſearches beyond the period in which literary monuments are framed or preſerved, without reflecting, that the hiſtory of paſt events is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately loſt or disfigured when intruſted to memory or oral tradition, and that the adventures of barbarous nations, even if they were preſerved, could afford little or no entertainment to thoſe born in a more cultivated age. The convulſions of a civilized ſtate uſually compoſe the moſt inſtructive and moſt intereſting part of its hiſtory; but the ſudden, violent, and unprepared revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, incident to Barbarians, are ſo much guided by caprice, and terminate ſo often in cruelty, that they diſguſt us by the uniformity of their appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that they are buried in ſilence and oblivion. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0162900301:8"/>
only certain means, by which nations can indulge their curioſity in reſearches concerning their remote origin, is to conſider the language, manners and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their anceſtors, and to compare them with thoſe of the neighbouring nations. The fables, which are commonly employed to ſupply the place of true hiſtory, ought entirely to be diſregarded; and if any exception be admitted to this general rule, it can only be in favour of the antient Greek fictions, which are ſo celebrated and ſo agreeable, that they will ever be the objects of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mankind. Neglecting therefore, all traditions or rather tales con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the more early hiſtory of Britain, we ſhall only conſider the ſtate of the inhabitants, as it appeared to the Romans on their invaſion of this country: We ſhall briefly run over the events, which attended the conqueſt made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than Britiſh ſtory: We ſhall haſten thro' the obſcure and unintereſting period of Saxon annals: And ſhall reſerve a more full narration for thoſe times, when the truth is both ſo well aſcertained and ſo complete as to promiſe ſome entertainment and inſtruction to the reader.</p>
               <p>ALL antient writers agree in repreſenting the firſt inhabitants of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae, who peopled that iſland from the neighbouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Their language was the ſame, their manners, their government, their ſuperſtition; varied only by thoſe ſmall differences, which time or a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the bordering nations muſt neceſſarily introduce. The inhabitants of Gaul, eſpecially in thoſe parts which lye contiguous to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with their ſouthern neighbours, ſome refinement in the arts, which gradually diffuſed themſelves northwards, and ſpread but a very faint light over this iſland. The Greek and Roman navigators or merchants (for there were ſcarce any other travellers in thoſe ages) brought back the moſt ſhocking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the ferocity of the people, which they magnified, as uſual, in order to excite the admiration of their countrymen. The ſouth-eaſt parts, however, of Britain had already, before the age of Caeſar, made the firſt and moſt requiſite ſtep towards a civil ſettlement; and the Britains, by tillage and agriculture, had there encreaſed to a great multitude<note n="*" place="bottom">Caeſar. lib. 4.</note>. The other inhabitants of the iſland ſtill maintained themſelves by paſturage: They were cloathed with ſkins of beaſts: They dwelt in huts, which they reared in the foreſts and marſhes, with which the country was covered: They ſhifted eaſily their habitation, when actuated either by the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy: The convenience of feeding their cattle was even a ſufficient motive for removing their ſeats: And being ignorant of all the refinements of life, their wants and their poſſeſſions were equally ſcanty and limited.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0162900301:9"/>
THE Britains were divided into many ſmall nations or tribes; and being a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary people, whoſe ſole property was their ſword and their cattle, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, after they had acquired a reliſh of liberty, for their princes of chieftains to eſtabliſh any deſpotic authority over them. Their governments, tho' mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, <note n="*" place="bottom">Diod. Sic. l. 4. Mela, lib. 3. cap. 6. Strabo. lib. 4.</note> were free, as well as thoſe of all the Celtic nations; and the common people ſeem even to have enjoyed more liberty among them<note n="†" place="bottom">Don. Caſſius. lib. 75.</note>, than among the nations of Gaul<note n="‡" place="bottom">Caeſar. lib. 6.</note>, from whom they were deſcended. Each ſtate was divided into factions within itſelf<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tacit. Agr.</note>: It was agitated with emulation towards the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates: And while the arts of peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupation, and formed the chief object of ambition, among the people.</p>
               <p>THE religion of the Britains was one of the moſt conſiderable parts of their government; and the Druids, who were their prieſts, poſſeſſed great authority among them. Beſides miniſtring at the altar, and directing all religious duties, they preſided over the education of youth; they were endowed with an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from wars and taxes; they enjoyed both the civil and criminal juriſdiction; they decided all controverſies among ſtates as well as private perſons, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever refuſed to ſubmit to their decree was expoſed to the moſt ſevere penalties. The ſentence of excommunication was denounced againſt him: He was forbid acceſs to the ſacrifices or public worſhip: He was debarred all intercourſe with his fellow-citizens, even in the common affairs of life: His company was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſhunned as profane and dangerous: He was refuſed the protection of law<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Caeſar. lib. 6. Strabo. lib. 4.</note>: And death itſelf became to him an acceptable relief from the miſery and infamy to which he was expoſed. Thus, the bands of government, which were naturally looſe among that rude and turbulent people, were happily corroborated by the terrors of their ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>No ſpecies of ſuperſtition was ever more terrible than that of the Druids. Beſides the ſevere penalties, which it was in the power of the eccleſiaſtics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal tranſmigration of ſouls; and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of their timorous votaries. They practiſed their rites in dark groves or other ſecret receſſes<note n="§" place="bottom">Plin. lib. 12. cap. 1.</note>; and in order to throw a greater myſtery on their religion, they communicated their doctrines only to the initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and ſtrictly forbad the committing them to writing; leſt they ſhould at any time be expoſed to the examination of the profane vulgar. Human ſacrifices were practiſed among them: The ſpoils of war were often devoted to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities;

He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new world, then wholly unknown, he took advantage of a ſhort interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an invaſion on Britain.

THE civil wars, which enſued, and which prepared the way for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of monarchy in Rome, ſaved the Britains from that yoke, which was ready to be impoſed upon them. Auguſtus, the ſucceſſor of Caeſar, content with the victory obtained over the liberties of his own country, was little ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of acquiring ſame by foreign wars; and being apprehenſive leſt the ſame unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited extent of dominion, which had ſubverted the republic, might alſo overwhelm the empire, he recommended to his ſucceſſors never farther to enlarge the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Romans.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>A.

Finding that the iſland of Mona, now Angleſey, was the chief ſeat of the Druids, he reſolved to attack it, and to ſubject a place,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0162900301:12"/>
which was the center of their ſuperſtition, and which afforded protection to all their baffled forces. The Britains endeavoured to obſtruct his landing on this ſacred iſland, both by the force of their arms and the terrors of their religion. The women and prieſts were intermingled with the ſoldiers upon the ſhore; and running about with flaming torches in their hands, and toſſing their diſhevelled hair, they ſtruck greater terror into the aſtoniſhed Romans by their howlings, cries, and execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was able to inſpire. But Suetonius, exhorting his troops to deſpiſe the menaces of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which they deſpiſed, impelled them to the attack, drove the Britains off the field, burned the Druids in the ſame fires which they had prepared for their captive enemies, deſtroyed all the conſecrated groves and altars; and having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britains, he thought his future progreſs would be eaſy in reducing the people to ſubjection. But he was diſappointed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. The Britains, taking advantage of his abſence, were all in arms; and being headed by Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the moſt ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked with ſucceſs ſeveral ſettlements of their inſulting conquerors. Suetonius haſtened to the protection of London, which was already a flouriſhing Roman colony; but found on his arrival, that it would be requiſite for the general ſafety to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that place to the mercileſs fury of the enemy. London was reduced to aſhes; ſuch of the inhabitants, as remained in it, cruelly maſſacred; the Romans and all ſtrangers, to the number of 70,000, put to the ſword without diſtinction; and the Britains, by rendering the war thus bloody, ſeemed determined to cut off all hopes of peace or compoſition with the enemy. But this cruelty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by Suetonius in a great and deciſive battle, where 80,000 of the Britains are ſaid to have periſhed; and Boadicea herſelf, rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life by poiſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</note>. Nero ſoon after recalled Suetonius from a government; where by ſuffering and inflicting ſo many ſeverities he was judged improper for compoſing the angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After ſome interval, Cerealis received the command from Veſpaſian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman arms. Julius Frontinus ſucceeded Cerealis both in authority and reputation: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>A. D.</label> But the general, who finally eſtabliſhed the dominion of the Romans in this iſland, was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Veſpaſian, Titus, and Domitian, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf in that ſcene of action.</p>
               <p>THIS great commander formed a regular plan for ſubduing Britain, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the acquiſition uſeful to the victors. He carried his victorious arms north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0162900301:13"/>
defeated the Britains in every encounter, pierced into the inacceſſible fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and mountains of Caledonia, reduced every thing to ſubjection in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the iſland, and chaced before him all the men of fiercer and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable ſpirits, who deemed war and death itſelf leſs intolerable than ſervitude under the conquerors. He even defeated them in a deciſive action, which they fought under Galcacus, their leader; and having drawn a rampart, and fixed a train of garriſons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he thereby cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the iſland, and ſecured the Roman province from the invaſion of the barbarous inhabitants<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit.

               <p>DURING theſe military enterprizes, he neglected not the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britains, taught them to deſire and raiſe all the conveniencies of life, reconciled them to the Roman language and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, inſtructed them in letters and ſcience, and employed every expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The inhabitants, having experienced how unequal their own force was to reſiſt that of the Romans, acquieſced in the dominion of their maſters, and were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.</p>
               <p>THIS was the laſt durable conqueſt made by the Romans; and Britain, once ſubdued, gave no farther inquietude to the victor. Caledonia alone, defended by its barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Romans entertained of it, ſometimes infeſted the more cultivated parts of the iſland by the incurſions of its inhabitants. The better to ſecure the frontiers of the empire, Adrian, who viſited this iſland, built a ſtrong rampart between Tyne and the firth of Solway: Lollius Urbicus, under Antoninus Pius, repaired that of Agricola: Severus, who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his arms into the moſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of it, added new fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during all the reigns of the Roman emperors, ſuch a profound tranquillity prevailed in Britain, that little mention is made of the affairs of that iſland by any hiſtorian. The only incidents which occur, are ſome ſeditions or rebellions of the Roman legions quartered there, and ſome uſurpations of the imperial dignity by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man governors. The natives, diſarmed, diſpirited, and ſubmiſſive, had loſt all deſire and even idea of their former liberty and independance.</p>
               <p>BUT the period was now come, when that enormous fabric of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which had diffuſed ſlavery and oppreſſion, together with peace and civility, over ſo conſiderable a part of the globe, was approaching towards its final diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Italy, and the center of the empire, removed, during ſo many ages,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0162900301:14"/>
from all concern in the wars, had entirely loſt the military ſpirit, and were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by an enervated race, equally diſpoſed to ſubmit to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranhy of their own rulers. The emperors found themſelves obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit their legions from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war, though languiſhing, was not totally extinct; and theſe mer enary forces, careleſs of laws and civil inſtitutions, eſtabliſhed a military government, no leſs dangerous to the ſovereign than to the people. The farther progreſs of the ſame diſorders intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the bordering barbarians into the ſervice of the Romans; and thoſe fierce nations, having now added diſcipline and ſkill to their native bravery, could no longer be reſtrained by the impotent policy of the emperors, who were accuſtomed to employ the one in the deſtruction of the other. Senſible of their own force, and allured by the proſpect of ſo rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, aſſailed at once all the frontiers of the Roman empire; and having firſt ſatiated their avidity by plunder, began to think of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſettlement in the waſted provinces. The more diſtant barbarians, who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the deſerted habitations of the former, advanced in their acquiſitions, and preſſed with their incumbent weight the Roman ſtate, already unequal to the load which it ſuſtained. Inſtead of arming the people in their own defence, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors recalled all the diſtant legions, in whom alone they could repoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and collected the whole military force for the defence of the capital and center of the empire. The neceſſity of ſelf-preſervation had ſuperceded the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of power; and the antient point of honour, of never contracting the limits of the empire, could no longer be attended to in this deſperate extremity.</p>
               <p>BRITAIN by its ſituation was removed from the fury of theſe barbarous incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and being alſo a remote province, not much valued by the Romans, the legions, which defended it, were carried over to the protection of Italy and Gaul. But that province, though ſecured by the ſea againſt the inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians, found enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage of its preſent defenceleſs ſituation. The Picts and Scots, who dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incurſions upon their peaceable and effeminate neighbours; and beſides the temporary depredations which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, threatened the whole province with ſubjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded, with plunder and devaſtation. The former nation ſeem to have been a tribe of the native Britiſh race, who, having been chaced into the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts by the conqueſts of Agricola, had there intermingled with the antient inhabitants: The other were derived from the ſame Celtic origin, had firſt been eſtabliſhed in Ireland, had ſent over a colony to the north-weſt coaſts of this iſland, and had long been accuſtomed, as well from their old as their new ſeats, to infeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0162900301:15"/>
the Roman province by their pyracy and rapine. Theſe two tribes, finding their more opulent neighbours expoſed to invaſion, ſoon broke over the Roman wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms; and though a contemptible enemy in themſelves, met with no reſiſtance from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britains, accuſtomed to have recourſe to the emperors for defence as well as government, made ſupplications to Rome; and one legion was ſent over for their protection. This force was an over-match for the barbarians, repelled their invaſion, routed them in every engagement, and having chaced them into their antient limits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in triumph to the defence of the ſouthern provinces of the empire<note n="*" place="bottom">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Paull. Diacon. Alured. Beverl. p. 43. ex edit. Hearne.</note>. Their retreat brought on a new invaſion of the enemy. The Britains made again an application to Rome, and obtained again the aſſiſtance of a legion, which proved effectual for their relief: But the Romans, reduced to extremities at home, and fatigued with theſe diſtant expeditions, informed the Britains that they muſt no longer look to them for ſuccour, exhorted them to arm in their own defence, and urged, that as they were now their own maſters, it became them to protect by their valour that independence which their antient lords had conferred upon them<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Gul. Malm. p. 8. Ann. Beverl. p. 44.</note>. That they might leave the iſland with the better grace, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans aſſiſted them in erecting anew the wall of Severus, which was built entirely of ſtone, and which the Britains had not at that time artizans ſkilful enough to repair<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Ann. Beverl. p. 41.</note>. And having done this laſt good office to the inhabitants, they bid a final adieu to Britain, about the year 448; after being maſters of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of it during the courſe of near four centuries.</p>

               <p>THE abject Britains regarded this preſent of liberty as fatal to them; and were in no condition to put in practice the prudent advice given them by the Romans, of arming in their own defence. Unaccuſtomed both to the perils of war, and to the cares of civil government, they found themſelves incapable of forming or executing any meaſures for reſiſting the incurſions of the barbarians. Gratian alſo and Conſtantine, two Romans who had a little before aſſumed the purple in Britain, had carried over into the continent the flower of the Britiſh youth; and having periſhed in their unſucceſsful attempts on the imperial throne, had deſpoiled the iſland of thoſe, who, in this deſperate extremity, were beſt able

The Picts and Scots, finding that the Romans had finally relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed Britain, now regarded the whole as their prize, and attacked the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern wall with redoubled forces. The Britains, already ſubdued by their own fears, found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and deſerting their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left the country entirely open to the inroads of the barbarous enemy.

               <p>HENGIST and Horſa were two brothers, who poſſeſſed great credit among the Saxons, and were much celebrated both for their valour and nobility.

It is evident what fruitleſs labour it muſt be to ſearch in thoſe barbarous and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ages for the annals of a people, when their firſt leaders, known in any true hiſtory, were believed by them to be the fourth in deſcent from a fabulous deity, or from a man, exalted by ignorance into that character.

               <p>THESE two brothers, obſerving the other provinces of Germany to be occupied by a warlike and neceſſitous people, and the rich provinces of Gaul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conquered or over-run by other German tribes, found it eaſy to perſwade their countrymen to embrace the ſole enterprize, which promiſed a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſplaying their valour and gratifying their avidity.

               <p>THE Britains impelled by theſe violent extremities, and full of indignation againſt their treacherous auxiliaries, were neceſſitated to take arms; and having depoſed Vortigern, who had become odious from his vices, and from the bad event of his raſh councils, they put themſelves under the command of his ſon, Vortimer<note n="*" place="bottom">Math.

In one battle, however, fought at Eglesford, now Ailsford, Horſa, the Saxon general, was ſlain; and left the ſole command over his countrymen in the hands of Hengiſt<note n="§" place="bottom">Math.

This active general, continually re-inforced by freſh numbers from Germany, carried devaſtation into the moſt remote corners of Britain; and being chiefly anxious to ſpread the terror of his arms, he ſpared neither age, nor ſex, nor condition, wherever he marched with his victorious forces. The private and public edifices of the Britains were reduced to aſhes: The prieſts were ſlaughtered on the altars by theſe idolatrous ravagers: The biſhops and nobility ſhared the fate of the vulgar: The people flying into the mountains and deſerts, were intercepted and butchered in heaps: Some were glad to accept of life and ſervitude under their victors: Others, deſerting their native country, took ſhelter in the province of Armorica; where being chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably

               <p>THE Britiſh writers aſſign one cauſe, which facilitated the entrance of the Saxons into this iſland; the love, with which Vortigern was at firſt ſeized for Rovena, the daughter of Hengiſt, and which that artful warrior made uſe of to blind the eyes of the imprudent monarch<note n="†" place="bottom">Nennius.

But theſe ſtories ſeem to have been invented by the Welſh authors, in order to palliate the weak reſiſtance made at firſt by their countrymen, and to account for the rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and licentious devaſtations of the Saxons<note n="‖" place="bottom">Stillingfleet's Orig.

               <p>AFTER the death of Vortimer, Ambroſius, a Britain, tho' of Roman deſcent, was inveſted with the command over his countrymen, and endeavoured, not without ſucceſs, to unite them in their reſiſtance againſt the Saxons. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts increaſed the animoſity between the two nations, and rouzed the military ſpirit of the antient inhabitants which had before been ſunk into ſuch a fatal lethargy. Hengiſt, however, notwithſtanding their oppoſition, ſtill kept his ground in Britain; and in order to divide the forces and attention of the Britains, he called over a new tribe of Saxons under the command of his brother Octa, and of Ebiſſa, the ſon of Octa; and he ſettled them in Northumberland. He himſelf remained in the ſouthern parts of the iſland, and laid the foundation of the kingdom of Kent, comprehending the county of that name, Middleſex, Eſſex, and part of Surrey. He fixed his royal ſeat at Canterbury; where he governed about forty years, and he died in or near the year 488; leaving his new acquired dominions to his poſterity.</p>
               <p>THE ſucceſs of Hengiſt excited the avidity of the other inhabitants of the northern regions of Germany; and at different times, and under different leaders, they flocked over in multitudes to the invaſion of this iſland. Theſe conquerors where chiefly compoſed of three tribes, the Saxons, Angles, and Jutes<note n="§" place="bottom">Bede. lib. 1. cap. 15. Ethelwerd. p. 833. Edit. Camdeni. Chron. Sax. p. 12. Ann.

Eſſex, Middleſex, Surrey, Suſſex, and all the ſouthern counties to Cornwal, were peopled by Saxons: Mercia and other parts of the kingdom were inhabited by Angles.</note>, who paſſed, all of them, under the common appellation, ſometimes of Saxons, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Angles; and ſpeaking the ſame language, and being governed by the

ſame inſtitutions, they were naturally led, from theſe cauſes, as well as from their common intereſt, to unite themſelves againſt the antient inhabitants. The reſiſtance, however unequal, was ſtill maintained by the Britains; but became every day more feeble: And their misfortunes admitted of few intervals, till they were driven into Cornwal and Wales, and received protection from the remote ſituation or inacceſſible mountains of thoſe countries.</p>
               <p>THE firſt Saxon ſtate, after that of Kent, which was eſtabliſhed in Britain, was the kingdom of South-Saxony. In the year 477<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron.

The Britains, now armed, abandoned not tamely their poſſeſſions; nor were they expelled, till de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in many battles by their warlike invaders. The moſt memorable action, mentioned by hiſtorians, is that of Mearcredes-Burn<note n="*" place="bottom">Saxon. Chron. A D. 485. Flor.

But Aella, re-inforced by freſh num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his countrymen, again took the field againſt the Britains; and laid ſiege to Andred-Ceaſter, which was defended by the garriſon and inhabitants with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate valour<note n="†" place="bottom">

The Saxons, enraged by this reſiſtance, and by the fatigues and dangers which they had ſuſtained, redoubled their efforts againſt the place, and when maſters of it, put all their enemies to the ſword without diſtinction. This deciſive advantage ſecured the conqueſts of Aella, who aſſumed the name of King, and extended his dominion over Suſſex and a great part of Surrey.

The Britains were, by paſt experience, ſo much on their guard, and ſo well prepared to receive the enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the very day of his landing; and tho' vanquiſhed, ſtill defended, for ſome time, their liberties againſt the invaders. None of the other tribes of Saxons met with ſuch vigorous reſiſtance, or exerted ſuch valour and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in puſhing their conqueſts. Cerdic was even obliged to call for the aſſiſtance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of Kent and Suſſex, as well as from Germany, and he was thence joined by a freſh army under the command
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0162900301:23"/>
of Porte, and of his ſons Bleda and Megla<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 17.</note>. Strengthened by theſe ſuccours, he fought in the year 508 a deſperate battle with the Britains, commanded by Nazan-Leod, their leader, who was victorious in the beginning of the action, and routed the wing in which Cerdic himſelf commanded. But Kenric, who had prevailed in the other wing, brought timely aſſiſtance to his father, and reſtored the battle, which ended with a complete victory on the ſide of the Saxons<note n="†" place="bottom">H. Hunting. lib. 2. Ethelwerd. lib. 1. Chron. Sax. p. 17.</note>. Nazan-Leod periſhed with 5000 of his army: But left the Britains more weakened than diſcouraged by his death. The war ſtill continued, tho' the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was commonly on the ſide of the Saxons, whoſe ſhort ſwords and cloſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fighting, gave them great advantage over the miſſile weapons of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune; and in order to extend his conqueſts, he laid ſiege to Mount Badon or Baneſdowne near Bath, whither the moſt obſtinate of the diſcomfited Britains had retired. The ſouthern Britains in this extremity applied for aſſiſtance to Arthur, prince of the Silures, whoſe heroic valour now ſuſtained the declining fate of his country<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hunting. lib. 2.</note>. This is that Arthur ſo much celebrated by the ſongs of Thalieſſin, and the other Britiſh bards, and whoſe military atchievements have been blended with ſo many fables as to give occaſion for entertaining a doubt of his real exiſtence. But poets, tho' they disfigure the moſt certain hiſtory by their fictions, and uſe ſtrange liberties with truth where they are the ſole hiſtorians, as among the Britains, have commonly ſome foundation for their wildeſt exaggerations. Certain it is, that the ſiege of Badon was raiſed by the Britains in the year 520, and the Saxons there diſcomfited in a great battle<note n="‖" place="bottom">Gildas, Saxon Chron. H. Hunting. lib. 2.</note>. This misfortune ſtoped the progreſs of Cerdic; but was not ſufficient to wreſt from him the conqueſts, which he had already made. He and his ſon, Kenric, who ſucceeded him, eſtabliſhed the kingdom of the Weſt-Saxons or of Weſſex over the counties of Hants, Dorſet, Wilts, Berks, and the Iſle of Wight, and left their new acquired dominions to their poſterity.

               <p>WHILE the Saxons made this progreſs in the ſouth, their countrymen were not leſs active in other quarters. In the year, 527<note n="*" place="bottom">H. Hunting. lib. 2.</note>, a great tribe of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, under ſeveral leaders, landed on the eaſt-coaſt of Britain; and after fighting many battles, of which hiſtory has preſerved no particular account, they eſtabliſhed three new kingdoms in this iſland. Uffa aſſumed the title of king of the Eaſt-Angles in 575; Crida that of Mercia in 585<note n="†" place="bottom">Math. Weſt. Huntingdon, lib. 2.</note>; and Erkenwin that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0162900301:24"/>
of Eaſt-Saxony or Eſſex nearly about the ſame time; but the year is uncertain. This latter kingdom was diſmembered from that of Kent, and comprehended Eſſex, Middleſex, and part of Hertfordſhire. That of the Eaſt-Angles, the courties of Cambridge, Suffolk and Norfolk. Mercia was extended over all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the frontiers of theſe two kingdoms.</p>
               <p>THE Saxons, ſoon after the landing of Hengiſt, had been planted in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland; but meeting with an obſtinate reſiſtance, and making but ſmall progreſs in ſubduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in ſo unſettled a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that none of their princes for a long time aſſumed the appellation of king. At laſt in 547<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p 19.</note>, Ida, a Saxon prince of great merit<note n="†" place="bottom">Will. Malmſ. p. 19.</note>, who claimed a deſcent, as did all the other princes of that nation, from Woden, brought over a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement from Germany, and enabled the Northumbrians to carry on their conqueſts againſt the Britains. He entirely ſubdued the county, now called Northumberland, the biſhopric of Durham, as well as ſome of the ſouth eaſt counties of Scotland; and he aſſumed the crown under the title of King of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia. Nearly about the ſame time, Aella, another Saxon prince, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Lancaſhire, and the greateſt part of Yorkſhire, received the appellation of King of Deïri<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ann. Beverl. p. 78.</note>. Theſe two kingdoms were united in the perſon of Ethelfrid, grandſon of Ida, who married Acca, the daughter of Aella; and expelling her brother, Edwin, eſtabliſhed one of the moſt powerful of the Saxon kingdoms, under the title of Northumberland. How far his dominions extended into the country now called Scotland is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that all the lowlands, eſpecially the eaſt-coaſt of that country, were peopled in a great meaſure from Germany; tho' the expeditions, made by the ſeveral Saxon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, have eſcaped the records of hiſtory. The language, ſpoke in theſe countries, which is purely Saxon, is a ſtronger proof of this event, than can be oppoſed by the imperfect, or rather fabulous annals, which are obtruded on us by the Scots hiſtorians.</p>

               <p>THUS was eſtabliſhed, after a violent ſtruggle of near an hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or ſeven Saxon kingdoms, in Britain; and the whole ſouthern part of the iſland, except Wales and Cornwal, had totally changed its inhabitants, language, cuſtoms, and political inſtitutions. The Britains, under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0162900301:25"/>
the Roman dominion, had made ſuch advances towards arts and civil manners, that they had built twenty-eight conſiderable cities within their province, beſides a great number of villages and country-ſeats<note n="*" place="bottom">Gildas. Bede, lib. 1.</note>; but the fierce conquerors, by whom they were now ſubdued, threw every thing back into antient barbarity; and thoſe few natives, who were not either maſſacred or expelled their habitations, were reduced to the moſt abject ſlavery. None of the other northern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or Burgundians, tho' they over-ran the ſouthern provinces, like a mighty torrent, made ſuch devaſtations in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered territories, or were inflamed into ſuch a violent animoſity againſt the antient inhabitants. As the Saxons came over at intervals in ſeparate bodies, the Britains, however at firſt unwarlike, were tempted to make reſiſtance; and hoſtilities, being thereby prolonged, proved more deſtructive to both parties, eſpecially to the vanquiſhed. The firſt invaders from Germany, inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding other adventurers, who muſt ſhare with them the ſpoils and property of the antient inhabitants, were obliged to invite over freſh ſupplies from their own country; and a total extermination of the Britains became the ſole expedient for providing a ſettlement and ſubſiſtance to the new planters. Hence there have been found in hiſtory few conqueſts more ruinous than that of the Saxons; and few revolutions more violent than that which they introduced.</p>
               <p>So long as the conteſt was maintained with the natives, the ſeveral Saxon princes preſerved an union of councils and intereſts; but after the Britains were ſhut up in the barren countries of Cornwal and Wales, and gave no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude to the conquerors, the band of alliance was in a great meaſure diſſolved among the princes of the Heptarchy; and tho' one prince ſeems ſtill to have been allowed or to have aſſumed an aſcendant over the whole, his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or legal, was extremely limited; and each ſtate acted as if it had been totally ſeparate and independant of the reſt. Wars, therefore, and revolutions and diſſentions were unavoidable among a turbulent and military people; and theſe events, however intricate or confuſed, ſhould now become the objects of our attention. But, added to the difficulty of carrying on at once the hiſtory of ſeven independent kingdoms, there is a great diſcouragement to a writer, ariſing from the uncertainty, at leaſt barrenneſs, of the accounts tranſmitted to us. The Monks, who were the only annaliſts during thoſe ages, lived remote from public affairs, conſidered the civil tranſactions as entirely ſubordinate to the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, and beſides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity, which were then univerſal, were ſtrongly infected with credulity, with the love of wonder, and

with a propenſity to impoſture; vices almoſt inſeparable from their profeſſion, and manner of life. The hiſtory of that period abounds in names, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely barren of events; or the events are related ſo much without circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and cauſes, that the moſt profound or moſt eloquent writer muſt deſpair of rendering them either inſtructive or entertaining to the reader. Even the great learning and vigorous imagination of Milton ſunk under the weight; and this author ſcruples not to declare, that he eſteems the ſkirmiſhes of kites or crows equally deſerving of a particular narrative, as the confuſed tranſactions and battles of the Saxon Heptarchy<note n="*" place="bottom">Milton in Kennet, p. 50.</note>.

His death, after twenty-two years reign, made room for his ſon Hermenric in 534, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty-two years; except aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him his ſon, Ethelbert, in the government, in order the better to ſecure the ſucceſſion in his family, and prevent ſuch revolutions as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy.</p>
               <p>ETHELBERT revived the reputation of his family, which had languiſhed for ſome generations. The inactivity of his predeceſſors, and the ſituation of his country, ſecured from all hoſtility with the Britains, ſeems to have much weakened the warlike genius of the Kentiſh Saxons; and Ethelbert, in his firſt attempt to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize his country, and diſtinguiſh his own name, met with very bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 21.</note>. He was twice diſcomfited in battle by Ceaulin, King of Weſſex; and obliged to yield the ſuperiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0162900301:27"/>
preſerved no moderation in his victory, and by ſubjecting the kingdom of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, excited jealouſy in all the other princes. An aſſociation was formed againſt him; and Ethelbert, entruſted with the command of the allies, fought him in a great battle, and obtained a deciſive victory<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Ceaulin died ſoon after; and Ethelbert ſucceeded as well to his aſcendant among the Saxon ſtates, as to his other ambitious and exorbitant projects. He reduced all the princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a ſtrict dependance upon him; and even eſtabliſhed himſelf by force on the throne of Mercia, the moſt extenſive of the Saxon king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Apprehenſive, however, of a dangerous league againſt him, like that by which he himſelf had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the prudence to reſign the throne of Mercia to Webba, the rightful heir, the ſon of Crida, who had firſt founded that monarchy. But governed ſtill by ambition more than by juſtice, he gave Webba poſſeſſion of the crown on ſuch conditions, as rendered him little better than a tributary prince under his artful benefactor.</p>
               <p>BUT the moſt memorable and moſt fortunate event, which diſtinguiſhed the reign of this great prince, was the introduction of the Chriſtian religion among the Engliſh Saxons. The ſuperſtition of the Germans, particularly that of the Saxons, was of the groſſeſt and moſt barbarous kind; and being founded on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain traditional tales, received from their anceſtors, not reduced to any ſyſtem, not ſupported by political inſtitutions, like that of the Druids, it ſeems to have made little impreſſion on its votaries, and to have eaſily reſigned its place to the new doctrine, promulgated to them. Woden, whom they believed the anceſtor of all their princes, was regarded as the god of war, and, by a natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, became their ſupreme deity, and the chief object of their religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They believed, that, if they obtained the favour of this divinity by their valour, (for they made leſs account of the other virtues) they would be admitted after their death into his hall, and repoſing on couches, would ſatiate themſelves with ale from the ſkulls of their enemies, whom they had ſlain in battle. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by this idea of paradiſe, which gratified at once the paſſion of revenge and that of intemperance, the ruling inclinations of barbarians, they deſpiſed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of war, and encreaſed their native ferocity againſt the vanquiſhed by their religious prejudices. We know little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons: We only learn that they were idolaters; that they worſhiped the ſun and moon; that they adored the god of thunder, under the name of Thor; that they had images in their temples; that they practiſed ſacrifices; believed firmly in ſpells and inchantments; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

air of the wildeſt extravagance, if propounded to thoſe who are not familiarized to it from their earlieſt infancy.</p>
               <p>THE conſtant hoſtilities which the Saxons maintained againſt the Britains, would naturally indiſpoſe them from receiving the Chriſtian faith, when preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by ſuch inveterate enemies; and perhaps the Britains, as is objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over fond of communicating to their cruel invaders the doctrine of eternal life and ſalvation. But as a civilized people, however ſubdued by arms, ſtill maintain a ſenſible ſuperiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all the other northern conquerors of Europe had been already induced to embrace the Chriſtian faith, which they found eſtabliſhed in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and it was impoſſible but the Saxons, informed of this event, muſt have regarded with ſome degree of veneration a doctrine which had acquired the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over all their brethren. However limited in their views, they could not but have perceived a degree of cultivation in the ſouthern counties beyond what they themſelves poſſeſſed; and it was natural for them to yield to that ſuperior know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well as zeal, by which the inhabitants of the Chriſtian kingdoms were even at this time diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>BUT theſe cauſes might long have failed of operating their effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the means of introducing Chriſtianity into Kent. Ethelbert, in his father's lifetime, had married Bertha, the only daughter of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribert, King of Paris<note n="*" place="bottom">Greg. of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26. H. Hunting. lib. 2.</note>, one of the deſcendants of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul; but before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to ſtipulate, that the princeſs ſhould enjoy the free exerciſe of her religion; a conceſſion not difficult to be obtained from the idolatrous Saxons<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. Brompton, p. 729.</note>. Bertha brought over a French biſhop to the court of Canterbury; and being zealous for the propagation of her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſhe had been very aſſiduous in her devotional exerciſes, had ſupported the credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had employed every art of inſinuation and addreſs to reconcile her huſband to her religious principles. Her popularity in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert, had ſo well paved the way for the reception of the Chriſtian doctrine, that Gregory, ſirnamed the Great, the preſent Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of effectuating a project, which he himſelf, before he mounted the papal throne, had once embraced for converting the Britiſh Saxons.</p>
               <p>IT happened, that this prelate, being then in a private ſtation, had obſerved in the market-place of Rome ſome Saxon youths expoſed to ſale, whom the Roman merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had bought of their mercenary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0162900301:29"/>
parents. Struck with the beauty of their fair complexions and blooming coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, Gregory aſked to what country they belonged; and being told they were <hi>Angles,</hi> he replied, that they ought more properly to be denominated <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> and it was a pity that the Prince of Darkneſs ſhould enjoy ſo fair a prey, and that ſo beautiful a frontiſpiece ſhould cover a mind devoid of internal grace and righteouſneſs. Enquiring farther concerning the name of their province, he was informed, that it was Deïri, a diviſion of Northumberland: <hi>Deïri!</hi> replied he, <hi>that is good! They are called to the mercy of God from his anger,</hi> De ira. <hi>But what is the Name of the King of that province?</hi> He was told it was <hi>Aella</hi> or <hi>Alla: Alleluiah,</hi> cried he: <hi>We muſt endeavour that the praiſes of God be ſung in their country.</hi> Moved by theſe alluſions, which appeared to him ſo happy, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to undertake himſelf a miſſion into Britain; and having obtained the Pope's permiſſion, he prepared for that dangerous journey: But his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity at home was ſo great, that the Romans, unwilling to expoſe him to ſuch hazards, oppoſed his deſign; and he was obliged for the preſent to lay aſide farther thoughts of executing that pious purpoſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 1. Spell. Conc. p. 91.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE controverſy between the Pagans and the Chriſtians was not entirely cooled in that age; and no pontiff before Gregory had ever carried to greater exceſſes his intemperate zeal againſt the former religion. He had declared war againſt all the precious monuments of the antients, and even againſt their writings; which, as appears from the ſtrain of his own wit, as well as the ſtyle of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, he had not taſte nor genius ſufficient to comprehend. Ambitious to diſtinguiſh his pontificate by the converſion of the Britiſh Saxons, he pitched on Auguſtine, a Roman monk, and ſent him with forty aſſociates to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in this iſland. Theſe miſſionaries, terrified with the dangers, which might attend their propoſing a new doctrine to ſo fierce a people, of whoſe language they were entirely ignorant, ſtopped ſome time in France, and ſent back Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to lay the hazards and difficulties before the Pope, and crave his permiſſion to deſiſt from the undertaking. But Gregory exhorted them to perſevere in their purpoſe, adviſed them to chuſe ſome interpreters from among the Franks, who ſtill ſpoke the ſame language with the Saxons<note n="*" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 23.</note>, and recommended them to the good offices of Queen Brunehaut, who had at this time uſurped the ſovereign power in their country. This princeſs, tho' ſtained with every vice of treachery and cruelty, either poſſeſſed or pretended great zeal for the cauſe; and Gregory acknowledged, that to her friendly aſſiſtance was in a great meaſure owing the ſucceſs of that undertaking<note n="†" place="bottom">Greg.

AUGUSTINE, on his arrival in Kent in the year 597<note n="*" place="bottom">Higden. Polychron. lib. 5. Chron. Sax. p. 23.</note>, found the danger much leſs than he had apprehended. Ethelbert, already well diſpoſed towards the Chriſtian faith, aſſigned him a habitation in the iſle of Thanet; and ſoon after admitted him to a conference. Apprehenſive, however, that ſpells or enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be employed againſt him by prieſts, who brought an unknown wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from a diſtant country, he took the precaution of receiving them in the open air, where he believed the force of their magic would be more eaſily diſſipated<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>AUGUSTINE, encouraged by this favourable reception, and ſeeing now a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the goſpel to the Kent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Saxons. He attracted their attention by the auſterity of his manners, by the ſevere penances to which he ſubjected himſelf, by the abſtinence and ſelf-denial which he practiſed: And having excited their wonder by a courſe of life, which appeared ſo contrary to nature, he procured more eaſily their belief for miracles, which, it was pretended, he wrought for their converſion<note n="§" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26.</note>. Influenced by theſe motives, and by the declared favour of the court, numbers of the Kentiſh men were baptized; and the King himſelf was perſuaded to ſubmit to that rite of Chriſtianity. His example wrought powerfully on his ſubjects; but he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no force to bring them over to the new doctrine. Auguſtine thought proper, in the commencement of his miſſion, to aſſume the appearance of the greateſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and he told Ethelbert, that the ſervice of Chriſt muſt be entirely voluntary, and that no violence ought ever to be uſed in propagating ſo ſalutary a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26. H. Hunting. lib. 3.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE intelligence received of theſe ſpiritual conqueſts conveyed great joy to the Romans; who now exulted as much in thoſe peaceful trophies, as their anceſtors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0162900301:31"/>
had ever done in their moſt ſanguinary triumphs, and moſt ſplendid victories. Gregory wrote a letter to Ethelbert, in which, after informing him, that the end of the world was approaching, he exhorted him to diſplay his zeal in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſubjects, to exert rigor againſt the worſhip of idols, and to build up the good work of holineſs by every expedient of exhortation, terror, blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or correction<note n="*" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 32, Brompton, p. 732.

The pontiff alſo anſwered ſome queſtions, which the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary had put concerning the government of the new church of England. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other queries, which it is not neceſſary here to relate, Auguſtine aſked, <hi>Whether couſin-germans might be allowed to marry?</hi> Gregory anſwered, that that liberty had indeed been formerly granted by the Roman law; but that experience had ſhown, that no poſterity could ever come from ſuch marriages; and he therefore prohibited them. Auguſtine aſks, <hi>Whether a woman pregnant might be baptized?</hi> Gregory anſwers, that he ſees no objection. <hi>How ſoon after the birth the child might receive baptiſm?</hi> It was anſwered, Immediately, if requiſite. <hi>How ſoon a huſband might have commerce with his wiſe after her delivery?</hi> Not till ſhe had given ſuck to her child; a practice to which Gregory exhorts all women. <hi>How ſoon a man might enter the church, or receive the ſacrament, after having had commerce with his wife?</hi> It was replied, that unleſs he had approached her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſire, merely for the ſake of propagating his ſpecies, he was not free from ſin; but in all caſes it was requiſite for him, before he entered the church or communica ed, to purge himſelf by prayer and ablution; and ought not, even after uſing theſe precautions, to participate immediately of the ſacred duties<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 27.

THE more to facilitate the reception of Chriſtianity, Gregory injoined Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to remove the idols from the Heathen altars, but not to deſtroy the altars themſelves; becauſe the people, he ſaid, would be allured to frequent the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian worſhip, when they f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Mellitus and Juſtus, who had been conſecrated biſhops of London and Rocheſter, had already depart-the kingdom<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 5.</note>; when Laurentius, before he ſhould entirely abandon his dignity,

made one effort to reclaim the King. He appeared before that prince; and throwing off his veſtment, ſhowed his body all torn with bruiſes and ſtripes, which he had received. Eadbald, wondering that any man ſhould have dared to treat in that manner a perſon of his rank, was told by Laurentius, that he had received this chaſtiſement from St. Peter, the prince of the apoſtles, who had appeared to him in a viſion, and ſeverely reproving him for his intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his charge, had inflicted on him theſe viſible marks of his diſpleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2 cap. 6.

               <p>ADELFRID, King of Bernicia, having married Acca, the daughter of Aella, King of Deïri, and expelled her infant brother, Edwyn, had united all the counties north of the Humber into one monarchy, and acquired a great aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the heptarchy.

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING Adelfrid's ſucceſs in war, he lived in inquietude on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of young Edwin, whom he had unjuſtly diſpoſſeſſed of the crown of Deïri. This prince, now grown to man's eſtate, wandered from place to place, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger from the attempts of Adelfrid; and received at laſt protection in the court of Redwald, King of the Eaſt-Angles; where his engaging and gallant deportment procured him the affections of every one. Redwald, however, was ſtrongly ſollicited by the King of Northumberland to kill or deliver up his gueſt: Rich preſents were promiſed him, if he would comply; and war denounced againſt him, in caſe of his refuſal. After rejecting ſeveral meſſages of this kind, his generoſity began to yield to the motives of intereſt; and he retained the laſt ambaſſador, till he ſhould come to a reſolution in a caſe of ſuch importance. Edwin, informed of his friend's heſitation, was yet determined at all hazards to remain in Eaſt Anglia; and thought, that if the protection of that court failed him, it were better to die than prolong a life ſo much expoſed to the perſecutions of his powerful rival. This confidence in Redwald's honour and friendſhip, with his other accompliſhments, engaged the Queen on his ſide; and ſhe effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented to her huſband the infamy of delivering up to certain deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their royal gueſt, who had fled to them for protection againſt his cruel and jealous enemies<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 1. cap. 3. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Bede.</note>. Redwald, therefore, embracing more generous reſolutions, thought it ſafeſt to prevent Adelfrid, before he was aware of his intention, and to attack him while he was yet unprepared for defence. He marched ſuddenly with an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and fought a battle with Adelfrid; where that monarch was defeated and killed, after revenging himſelf by the death of Regner, ſon to Redwald<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 12.

               <p>THIS prince, who mounted the throne in 755<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 59.</note>, had ſome great qualities, and was ſucceſsful in his warlike enterprizes againſt Lothaire, King of Kent, and Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wulph, King of Weſſex. He defeated the former in a bloody battle at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced his kingdom to a ſtate of dependance: He gained a victory over the latter at Benſington in Oxfordſhire; and conquering that county, together with that of Gloceſter, annexed it to his other dominions. But all theſe ſucceſſes were ſtained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert, King of the Eaſt Angles, and his violent ſeizure of that kingdom. This young prince, who is ſaid to have poſſeſſed great merit, had made ſuit to Elfrida, the daughter of Offa, and was invited with all his retinue to Hereford, in order to ſolemnize the nuptials. Amidſt the joy and feſtivity of theſe entertainments, he was ſeized by Offa, and ſecretly beheaded: And tho' Elfrida, who abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warning to the Eaſt-Anglian nobility, who eſcaped into their own country, Offa, having extinguiſhed the royal family, ſucceeded in his project of ſubduing that country<note n="§" place="bottom">Brompton. p. 750, 751, 752.</note>. The treacherous prince, deſirous of re-eſtabliſhing his character in the world, and perhaps of appeaſing the remorſes of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, payed great court to the clergy, and practiſed all the Monkiſh devotions, which were ſo much eſteemed in that ignorant and ſuperſtitious age. He gave the tenth of all his goods to the church<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Spell. Conc. p. 308.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0162900301:41"/>
in order to raiſe the ſum, he impoſed a tax of a penny on each houſe poſſeſſed of thirty pence a year. This impoſition, being afterwards levied from all England, was commonly denominated Peter's pence<note n="*" place="bottom">Higden. lib. 5.</note>; and tho' conferred at firſt as a gift, was afterwards pretended to be a tribute by the Roman pontiff. Carrying his hypocriſy ſtill farther, Offa, feigning to be directed by viſions from heaven, found out at Verulam, the relicts of St. Alban, the martyr, and endowed a magnificent monaſtry in that place<note n="†" place="bottom">Ingulph. p. 5.

               <p>THIS prince was become ſo conſiderable in the Heptarchy, that the Emperor Charlemagne entered into an alliance and friendſhip with him; a circumſtance, which did him honour; as diſtant princes then had very little communication with each other. That emperor being a great lover of learning and learned men, in an age which was very barren of that ornament, Offa, at his deſire, ſent him over Alcuin, a clergyman, much celebrated for his knowledge, who received great honours from Charlemagne, and even became his preceptor in the ſciences. The chief reaſon, why he had at firſt deſired the company of Alcuin, was that he might oppoſe his learning to the hereſy of Felix, biſhop of Urgel in Catalonia; who maintained, that Jeſus Chriſt, conſidered in his human nature, could more properly be denominated the adoptive than the natural ſon of God<note n="§" place="bottom">Dupin. cent. 8. chap. 4.</note>.

               <p>THE kingdom of Weſſex, which finally ſwallowed up all the other Saxon ſtates, met with great oppoſition on its firſt eſtabliſhment; and the Britains, who were now enured to arms, yielded not tamely their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to theſe invaders. Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, and his ſon, Kenric, fought many ſucceſsful, and ſome unſucceſsful battles, againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and the martial ſpirit, common to all the Saxons, was by means of theſe hoſtilities, carried to the greateſt height among this tribe. Ceaulin, the ſon and ſucceſſor of Kenric, who began his reign in 560, was even more ambitious and enterprizing than his predeceſſors; and by waging continual war againſt the Britains, he added a great part of the counties of Devon and Somerſet to his other dominions. Carried away by the tide of ſucceſs, he invaded the other Saxon ſtates in his neighbourhood, and becoming terrible to all, he provoked a general confederacy againſt him.

of Ethelburga, his Queen, left by will the ſucceſſion to Adelard, her brother, who was his remote kinſman<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

Chron. Sax. p. 56.</note>. His death made way for Sigebert, his kinſman, who governed ſo ill, that his people roſe in an inſurrection, and dethroned him<note n="§" place="bottom">W.

The exiled prince found a refuge with duke Cumbran, governor of Hampſhire; who, that he might add to his other kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards Sigebert, gave him many falutary counſels for his future conduct, accompanied with ſome reprehenſions for the paſt. But theſe were ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the ungrateful prince, that he conſpired againſt the life of his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and treacherouſly murdered him.

Kynehard alſo, brother to the depoſed Sigebert, gave him diſturbance; and tho' expelled the kingdom, he hovered on the frontiers, and waited an opportunity of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his rival.

Eata, father to Alchmond, from whom ſprung Egbert<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, ſenſible of his danger from the ſuſpicions of Brithric, withdrew ſecretly into France<note n="†" place="bottom">H. Hunting, lib. 4.</note>; where he was well received by Charlemagne, the preſent monarch. By living in the court, and ſerving in the armies of that prince, the moſt able and moſt generous who had appeared in Europe during ſeveral ages, he acquired thoſe accompliſhments, which afterwards enabled him to make ſuch a ſbining figure on the throne; and familiarizing himſelf to the manners of the French, who, as Malmeſbury obſerves<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. 2. cap. 11.</note>, were eminent both for valour and civility, above all the weſtern nations, he learned to poliſh the rudeneſs and barbarity of the Saxon character: And his early misfortunes proved thus of infinite advantage to him.</p>
               <p>IT was not long before Egbert had opportunities of diſplaying his natural and acquired talents. Brithric, King of Weſſex, had married Eadburga, natural daughter <note n="‖" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 749, 750. W. Malmeſ. lib. 1. cap. 2. H.

Having great influence over her huſband, ſhe often incited him to deſtroy ſuch of the nobility as were obnoxious to her; and where this expedient failed her, ſhe ſcrupled not being herſelf active in traiterous attempts upon their life. She had mixed a cup of poiſon for a young nobleman, who had acquired her huſband's friendſhip, and had on that account become the object of her jealouſy: But unfortunately, the King drank of the fatal cup along with his favourite, and ſoon after expired<note n="§" place="bottom">Higden. lib. 5. M. Weſt. p. 152. Aſſer. in vita Alfredi, p. 3. ex edit. Camdeni.</note>. This event, joined to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga ſo odious, that ſhe was obliged to fly into France; whence Egbert was at the ſame time recalled by the nobility, in order to aſcend the throne of his anceſtors<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>IN all the kingdoms of the heptarchy, an exact rule of ſucceſſion was either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or not ſtrictly obſerved; and thence the reigning prince was continually agitated with jealouſy againſt all the princes of the blood, whom he ſtill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as rivals, and whoſe death alone could give him entire ſecurity in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the throne. From this fatal cauſe, together with the admiration of the monaſtic life, and the opinion of merit, attending the preſervation of chaſtity

even in a married ſtate, the royal families had been entirely extinguiſhed in all the kingdoms except that of Weſſex; and the emulations, ſuſpicions, and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which had formerly been confined to the princes of the blood alone, were now diffuſed among all the nobility in the ſeveral Saxon ſtates. Egbert was the ſole deſcendant of thoſe firſt conquerors who ſubdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by claiming a pedigree from Woden, the ſupreme divinity of their anceſtors. But that prince, tho' invited by this favourable circumſtance to make attempts on the neighbouring Saxons, gave them for ſome time no diſturbance, and rather choſe to turn his arms againſt the Britains in Cornwal, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in ſeveral battles<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 69.</note>. He was recalled from the conqueſt of that country by an inroad made into his dominions by Bernulf, King of Mercia.</p>
               <p>THE Mercians, before the acceſſion of Egbert, had very nearly attained the abſolute ſovereignty over the heptarchy: They had reduced the Eaſt-Angles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſubjection, and eſtabliſhed tributary princes in the kingdoms of Kent and Eſſex. Northumberland was involved in anarchy; and no ſtate of any conſequence remained but that of Weſſex, which, much inferior in extent to Mercia, was ſupported alone by the great qualities of its ſovereign. Egbert led his army againſt the invaders; and encountering them at Ellandun in Wiltſhire, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a compleat victory, and by the ſlaughter committed on them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of the Mercians, Whilſt he himſelf, in proſecution of his victory, entered their country on the ſide of Oxfordſhire, and threatened the heart of their dominions; he ſent an army into Kent, commanded by Ethelwolph, his eldeſt ſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 2.</note>; and expelling Baldred, the tributary King, ſoon made himſelf maſter of that country. The kingdom of Eſſex was conquered with equal facility; and the Eaſt-Angles, from their hatred to the Mercian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which had been eſtabliſhed over them by treachery and violence, and probably exerciſed with tyranny, immediately roſe in arms, and craved the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Egbert<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3.</note>. Bernulf, the Mercian King, who marched againſt them, was defeated and ſlain; and two years after, Ludecan, his ſucceſſor, met with the ſame fate. Theſe inſurrections and calamities facilitated the enterprizes of Egbert, who advanced into the heart of the Mercian territories, and made eaſy conqueſts over a diſheartened and divided people. In order to engage them more eaſily to ſubmiſſion, he allowed Wiglef, their countryman, to retain the title of King, whilſt he himſelf exerciſed the real powers of ſovereignty<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ingulph, p. 7, 8, 10.</note>. The anarchy, which prevailed in Northumberland, tempted him to carry ſtill
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0162900301:48"/>
farther his victorious arms; and the inhabitants, unable to reſiſt his power, and deſirous of poſſeſſing ſome eſtabliſhed form of government, were forward, on his firſt appearance, to ſend deputies, who ſubmitted to his authority, and expreſſed their allegiance to him as their ſovereign. Egbert, however, ſtill allowed to Northumberland, as he had done to Mercia and Eaſt-Anglia, the power of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, who paid him tribute, and was dependant on him.</p>
               <p>THUS were united all the kingdoms of the heptarchy in one great ſtate, near four hundred years after the firſt arrival of the Saxons in Britain; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert at laſt effectuated what had been ſo often attempted in vain by ſo many princes<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had ſucceſſively aſpired to general dominion, were now incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his empire; and the other ſubordinate kingdoms ſeemed willingly to ſhare the ſame fate. His territories were nearly of the ſame extent with what is now properly denominated England; and a favourable proſpect was afforded the Anglo-Saxons, of eſtabliſhing a civilized monarchy, poſſeſſed of tranquillity within itſelf, and ſecure againſt foreign invaſion. This great event happened in the year 827<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Saxons, tho' they had been ſo long ſettled in the iſland, ſeem not as yet to have been much improved beyond their German anceſtors, either in arts, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, knowledge, humanity, juſtice, or obedience to the laws. Even Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, tho', among other advantages, it opened the way to connexions between them and the more poliſhed ſtates of Europe, had not hitherto been very effectual, in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their ignorance, or ſoftening their barbarous manners. As they received that doctrine thro' the corrupted channels of Rome, which had ſtrongly tinctured the original purity of the Chriſtian faith, it carried along with it a great mixture of credulity and ſuperſtition, equally deſtructive to the underſtanding and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. The reverence towards ſaints and reliques ſeems to have almoſt ſupplanted the adoration of the ſupreme Being: Monaſtic obſervances were eſteemed more meritorious than the active virtues: The knowledge of natural cauſes was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected from the univerſal belief of miraculous interpoſitions and judgments: Bounty to the church atoned for all violences againſt ſociety: And the remorſes for cruelty, murder, treachery, aſſaſſination, and the more robuſt vices, were appeaſed, not by amendment of life, but by penances, ſervility to the monks, and an abject and illiberal devotion<note n="‡" place="bottom">THESE abuſes were common to all the European churches; but the prieſts in Italy, Spain, and Gaul, made ſome atonement for them by other advantages, which they rendered ſociety. For ſeveral ages, they were almoſt all Romans, or, in other words, the antient natives; and they preſerved the Roman language and laws, with ſome remains of the former civility. But the prieſts in the heptarchy, after the firſt miſſionaries, were wholly Saxon, and almoſt as ignorant and barbarous as the laity. They contributed, therefore, little to the improvement of the ſociety in knowledge or the arts.</note>. The reverence for the clergy had mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0162900301:49"/>
ſo high, that wherever a perſon appeared in a ſacerdotal habit, tho' on the high way, the people flocked around him; and ſhowing him all marks of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect, received every word he uttered as the moſt ſacred oracles<note n="*" place="bottom">Bede. lib. 3. cap. 26.</note>. Even the military virtues, ſo inherent in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected; and the nobility, preferring the ſecurity and ſloth of the cloyſter to the tumults and glory of war, valued themſelves chiefly on the endowment of monaſteries, of which they aſſumed the government<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 23. Epiſtola Bedae ad Egbert.</note>. The crown too, being extremely impoveriſhed by continual benefactions to the church, to which the ſtates of the kingdom weakly conſented, could beſtow no rewards on valour or military ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and retained not even ſufficient influence to ſupport the government<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bedae Epiſt. ad Egbert.</note>.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER inconvenience, which attended this corrupt ſpecies of Chriſtianity, was the ſuperſtitious attachment to Rome, and the gradual ſubjection of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a foreign juriſdiction. The Britains had never acknowledged any ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the Roman pontiff, and had conducted all eccleſiaſtical government by their domeſtic ſynods and councils<note n="‖" place="bottom">Append. to Bede, numb. 10. ex edit. 1722. Spelm. Conc. p. 108, 109.</note>: But the Saxons, receiving their religion from Roman monks, were taught at the ſame time a profound reverence to that ſee, and were naturally led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to Rome were repreſented as the moſt meritorious acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of rank undertook this tedious journey<note n="§" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 7.</note>; but Kings themſelves, abdicating their crowns, ſought for a ſecure paſſport to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New reliques, continually ſent from that endleſs mint of ſuperſtition, and magnified by the lying miracles, invented in convents, operated on the aſtoniſhed minds of the multitude: And every prince attained the eulogies of the monks, the only hiſtorians of thoſe ages, not in proportion to his civil and military virtues, but to his devoted attachment towards their order, and his ſuperſtitious reverence for Rome.</p>
               <p>THE ſovereign pontiff, encouraged by this blindneſs and ſubmiſſive diſpoſition of the people, advanced every day in his enterprizes on the independance of the Engliſh churches. Wilfrid, biſhop of Lindisferne, the ſole prelate of the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrian kingdom, gave the finiſhing ſtroke to this ſubjection in the eighth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, by his making an appeal to Rome againſt the deciſions of an Engliſh ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0162900301:50"/>
which had abridged his dioceſe by the erection of ſome new biſhoprics<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19. Higden. lib. 5. Matth. Weſt. p. 124. Brompton, p. 793, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</note>. Agatho, the Pope, readily embraced this precedent of an appeal to his court; and Wilfrid, though the haughtieſt and moſt luxurious prelate of his age<note n="†" place="bottom">Eddius vita Vilfr. § 24, 60.</note>, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained with the people the character of ſanctity, finally prevailed in the conteſt. The great topic, by which he confounded the imaginations of men, was, that St. Peter, to whoſe cuſtody the keys of heaven were entruſted, would certainly refuſe admittance to every one who had been wanting in reſpect to his ſucceſſor. This conceit, well calculated for vulgar conceptions, had a powerful operation on the people during ſeveral ages; and has not even at preſent loſt all influence in the catholic countries.</p>
               <p>HAD this abject ſuperſtition produced general peace and tranquillity, it had made ſome atonement for the ills attending it; but, added to the uſual avidity of men for power and riches, it engendered frivolous controverſies in theology, which were ſo much the more fatal, as they admitted not, like the others, of any final determination from eſtabliſhed poſſeſſion. The diſputes, excited in Britain, were of the moſt ridiculous kind, and entirely worthy of thoſe ignorant and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ages. There were ſome intricacies, obſerved by all the Chriſtian church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in adjuſting the day of keeping Eaſter; which depended on a complicated conſideration of the courſe of the ſun and moon: And it happened that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, who had converted the Scots and Britains, had followed a different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar from what was obſerved at Rome in the age when Auguſtine converted the Saxons. The prieſts alſo of all the Chriſtian churches were accuſtomed to ſhave part of their head; but the form given to this tonſure, was different in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from what was practiſed in the latter. The Scots and Britains pleaded the antiquity of <hi>their</hi> uſages: The Romans, and their diſciples, the Saxons, inſiſted on the univerſality of <hi>theirs.</hi> That Eaſter muſt neceſſarily be kept by a rule, which comprehended both the day of the year, and age of the moon, was agreed by all: That the ſhaving of a prieſt could not be omitted without the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, was a point undiſputed: But the Romans and Saxons called their anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts ſchiſmatics; becauſe they celebrated Eaſter on the very day of the full moon in March, if that day fell on a Sunday, inſtead of waiting till the Sunday following; and becauſe they ſhaved their whole forehead from ear to ear, inſtead of making that tonſure on the crown of the head, and in a circular form. In order to render their antagoniſts odious, they affirmed, that once in ſeven years they concurred with the Jews in the time of celebrating that feſtival<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 19.</note>: And that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0162900301:51"/>
they might recommend their own form of tonſure, they maintained, that it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated ſymbolically the crown of thorns worn by our Saviour in his paſſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the latter was invented by Simon Magus, without any regard to that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note n="*" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 21. Eddius, § 24.</note>. Theſe controverſies had from the beginning excited ſuch animoſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Britiſh and Romiſh prieſts, that, inſtead of concurring in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to convert the idolatrous Saxons, they refuſed all communion together, and each regarded his opponent as no better than a Pagan<note n="†" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2, 4, 20. Eddius. § 12.</note>. The diſpute laſted more than a century; and was at laſt finiſhed, not by men's perceiving the folly of it, which would have been too great an effort for human reaſon to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, but by the entire victory of the Romiſh ritual over the Scots and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 16, 22.</note>. Wilfrid, biſhop of Lindisferne, acquired great merit, both with the court of Rome and with all the ſouthern Saxons, by expelling the quartodeciman ſchiſm, as it was called, from the Northumbrian kingdom, into which the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Scots had formerly introduced it<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bede, lib. 3. cap. 25. Eddius, § 12.</note>.</p>
               <p>THEODORE, archbiſhop of Canterbury, called, in the year 680, a ſynod at Hatfield, conſiſting of all the biſhops in Britain<note n="§" place="bottom">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 168.</note>; where was accepted and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the decree of the Lateran council, ſummoned by Martin the firſt againſt the hereſy of the Monothelites. The council and ſynod maintained, in oppoſition to theſe heretics, that tho' the divine and the human nature in Chriſt made but one perſon; yet had they ſtill different inclinations, wills, acts, and ſentiments, and that the unity of the perſon implied not any unity in the conſciouſneſs<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 171.</note>. This opinion it ſeems ſomewhat difficult to comprehend; and no one, unacquainted with the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory of thoſe ages, could imagine the height of zeal and violence with which it was then inculcated. The decree of the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, execrable, wicked, abominable, and even dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical; and curſes and anathematizes them to all eternity<note n="*" place="bottom">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 172, 173, 174.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Saxons, from the firſt introduction of Chriſtianity among them, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the uſe of images; and perhaps, Chriſtianity, without ſome of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ornaments, had not made ſo quick a progreſs with theſe idolaters: But they had not paid any ſpecies of worſhip or addreſs to images; and this abuſe never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among Chriſtians, till it received the ſanction of the ſecond council of Nice. At that time, the practice was recommended to Offa by Charlemagne<note n="†" place="bottom">Spell.

                  </label> THE kingdoms of the Heptarchy, tho' united by ſo recent a conqueſt, ſeemed to be ſtrongly cemented into one ſtate under Egbert; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſeveral provinces had loſt all deſire of revolting from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, or of reſtoring their independent governments. Their language was every where nearly the ſame; their cuſtoms, laws, inſtitutions civil and religious; and as the race of their antient kings was totally extinct in all their ſubjected ſtates, the people readily transferred their allegiance to a prince, who ſeemed to merit it, by the ſplendor of his victories, the vigor of his adminiſtration, and the ſuperior nobility of his birth. An union alſo in government opened to them the agreeable proſpect of future tranquillity; and it appeared more probable, that they would thenceforth become terrible to their neighbours, than be expoſed to their inroads and devaſtations. But theſe flattering views were ſoon overcaſt by the appearance of the Danes, who, during ſome centuries, kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquietude, committed the moſt barbarous ravages upon them, and at laſt reduced them to the moſt grievous ſervitude.</p>
               <p>THE emperor Charlemagne, tho' naturally generous and humane, had been induced by bigotry to exerciſe great ſeverities againſt the pagan Saxons in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, whom he ſubdued; and beſides often ravaging their country by fire and ſword, he had in cold blood decimated all the inhabitants for their revolts, and had obliged them, by the moſt rigorous edicts, to make a ſeeming compliance with the chriſtian doctrine. That religion, which had eaſily made its way among the Britiſh-Saxons by inſinuation and addreſs, appeared ſhocking to their German brethren, when impoſed on them by the violence of Charlemagne; and the moſt generous and warlike of theſe pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to eſcape the fury of his perſecutions. Meeting there with a people of ſimilar manners, they were readily received among them; and they ſoon ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

the natives to concur in enterprizes, which both promiſed revenge on the haughty conquerors, and afforded ſubſiſtence to thoſe numerous inhabitants, with which the northern countries were now overburthened<note n="*" place="bottom">Ypod. Neuſtria, p. 414.</note>. They invaded the provinces of France, which were expoſed by the degeneracy and diſſenſions of Charlemagne's poſterity; and being known there under the general name of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which they received from their northern ſituation, they became the terror of all the maritime and even of the inland countries. They were alſo tempted to viſit England in their frequent excurſions; and being able by ſudden inroads to make great progreſs over a people, who were not defended by any naval force, who had relaxed their military inſtitutions, and who were ſunk into a ſuperſtition, which had become odious to the Danes and antient Saxons, they made no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in their hoſtilities between the French and Engliſh kingdoms. Their firſt appearance in this iſland was in the year 787<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 64.</note>, when Brithric reigned in Weſſex. A ſmall body of them landed in that kingdom, with a view of learning the ſtate of the country; and when the magiſtrate of the place queſtioned them concerning the reaſon of their enterprize, and cited them to appear before the king, and account for their intentions, they killed him, and flying to their ſhips, eſcaped into their own country. The next alarm was given to Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland in the year 794<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 66. Alur. Beverl. p. 108.</note>; when a body of theſe pyrates pillaged a monaſtery; but their ſhips being much damaged by a ſtorm, and their leader ſlain in a ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, they were at laſt defeated by the inhabitants, and the remainder of them put to the ſword. <label type="milestone">

They were not ſo fortunate in their next year's enterprize, when they diſembarked from thirty-five ſhips, and were encountered by Egbert, at Charmouth in Dorſetſhire. The battle was bloody; but tho' the Danes loſt great numbers, they maintained the poſt, which they had taken, and made good their retreat to their ſhips<note n="§" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 72.

               <p>His eldeſt ſon, Athelſtan, being dead; Ethelbald, the ſecond, who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamed the government, formed, in conjunction with many of the nobles, the project of excluding his father from a throne, which his weakneſs and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition ſeem to have rendered him ſo ill qualified to fill<note n="‡" place="bottom">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note>. The people were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the two princes; and a bloody civil war, joined to all the other calamities, under which the Engliſh laboured, appeared unavoidable; when Ethelwolf had the facility to yield to the greateſt part of his ſon's pretenſions<note n="‖" place="bottom">Flor. Wigorn. p. 583.</note>. He made with him a partition of the kingdom; and taking to himſelf the eaſtern part, which was always at that time eſteemed the leaſt conſiderable, as well as the moſt expoſed<note n="§" place="bottom">Aſſerius, p. 3. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 2. Math. Weſt. p. 158.</note>, he delivered over to Ethelbald the ſovereignty of the weſtern. And immediately after, he ſummoned the ſtates of the whole kingdom, and with the ſame facility, conferred a perpetual and very important donation on the church.</p>
               <p>THE eccleſiaſtics, in thoſe days of ignorance, made very rapid advances in the acquiſition of power and grandeur; and inculcating the moſt abſurd and moſt intereſted doctrines, tho' they met ſometimes, from the contrary intereſts of the laity, with an oppoſition, which it required time and addreſs to overcome, they found no obſtacle in their reaſon or underſtanding. Not content with the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of land made them by the Saxon princes and nobles, and with the temporary oblations from the devotion of the people, they had caſt a wiſhful eye on a vaſt revenue, which they claimed as belonging to them by a divine, indefeizable and inherent title. However little verſed in the ſcriptures, they had been able to diſcover, that the prieſts, under the Jewiſh law, poſſeſſed a tenth of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of land; and forgeting, what they themſelves taught, that the moral part only of that law was obligatory on chriſtians, they inſiſted, that this donation was a perpetual property, conferred by heaven on thoſe who officiated at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. During ſome centuries, the whole ſcope of ſermons and homilies was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this purpoſe; and one would have imagined, from the general tenor of theſe diſcourſes, that all the practical parts of chriſtianity were comprehended in the exact and faithful payment of tythes to the clergy<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Padre Paolo, ſopra beneficii eccleſiaſtici, p. 51, 52.

ſucceſs in inculcating theſe doctrines; they ventured farther than they were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted even by the Levitical law, and pretended to draw the tenth of all induſtry, merchandize, wages of labourers, and pay of ſoldiers<note n="*" place="bottom">Spell.

Tho' pariſhes had been inſtituted in England by Honorius, archbiſhop of Canterbury, near two centuries before<note n="‡" place="bottom">Parker, p. 77.</note>, the eccleſiaſtics had never yet been able to get poſſeſſion of the tythes; and they therefore ſeized the preſent favourable opportunity of making that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; when a weak, ſuperſtitious prince was on the throne, and when the people, diſcouraged by their loſſes from the Danes, and terrified with the fear of future invaſions, were ſuſceptible of any impreſſion, which bore the appearance of religion. So meritorious was this conceſſion deemed by the Engliſh, that, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely to ſupernatural aſſiſtances, they neglected the ordinary means of ſafety; and agreed, even in the preſent deſperate extremity, that the revenue of the church ſhould be exempted from all burthens, tho' impoſed for national de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſecurity<note n="‖" place="bottom">Aſſerius, p. 2.

               <p>ALFRED lay here concealed, but not unactive, during a twelvemonth; when the news of a proſperous event reached his ears, and called him into the field. Hubba, the Dane, having ſpread ravages, fire, and ſlaughter, over all Wales, had landed in Devonſhire from twenty-three veſſels, and laid ſiege to the caſtle of Kinwith, a place ſituated near the mouth of the ſmall river Tau<note n="†" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 10.</note>. Oddune, earl of Devonſhire, with his followers, had taken ſhelter there; and being ill ſupplied with proviſions, and even with water, he determined, by ſome vigorous blow, to prevent the neceſſity of ſubmitting to the barbarous enemy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Flor. Wigorn. 590.</note>. He made a ſudden ſally on the Danes before ſun-riſing; and taking them unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, he put them to rout, purſued them with great ſlaughter, killed Hubba himſelf, and got poſſeſſion of the famous <hi>Reafen</hi> or enchanted ſtandard, in which the Danes put great confidence<note n="‖" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 10.

It contained the figure of a raven, which had been inwove by the three ſiſters of Hinguar and Hubba with many magical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations, and which, by its different movements, prognoſticated, as the Danes believed, the good or bad ſucceſs of any enterprize<note n="§" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>WHEN Alfred obſerved this ſymptom of ſucceſsful reſiſtance in his ſubjects, he left his retreat; but before he would aſſemble them in arms, or urge them to any attempt, which, if unfortunate, might, in their preſent deſpondency, prove fatal, he reſolved, himſelf, to inſpect the ſituation of the enemy, and to judge of the probability of ſucceſs. For this purpoſe, he entered their camp under the diſguiſe of a harper, and paſſed unſuſpected thro' every quarter. He ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with his muſic and facetious humours, that he met with a welcome reception; and was even introduced to Guthrum, their prince's tent, where he remained ſome days<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">W.

The remainder of the routed army, with their prince, was beſieged by Alfred in a fortified place, to which they fled; but being reduced to extremity by want and hunger, they had recourſe to the clemency of the victor, and offered to ſubmit on any conditions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Alured Beverl. p. 105.</note>. The King, no leſs generous than brave, gave them their lives; and even formed a ſcheme for converting them, from mortal enemies, into faithful ſubjects and confederates. He knew, that the kingdoms of Eaſt-Anglia and Northumberland were left totally deſolate by the frequent inroads of the Danes; and he now purpoſed to re-people them by ſettling there Guthrum and his followers. He hoped that the new planters would at laſt betake themſelves to induſtry, when, by reaſon of his reſiſtance, and the exhauſted condit on of the country, they could no longer ſubſiſt by plunder; and that they might ſerve him as a rampart againſt any future incurſions of their countrymen.

               <p>THE King employed this interval of tranquillity in reſtoring order to the ſtate, which had been ſhaken by ſo many violent convulſions, in eſtabliſhing civil and military inſtitutions, in compoſing the minds of men to induſtry and juſtice, and in providing againſt the return of like calamities. He was, more properly than his grandfather Egbert, the ſole monarch of the Engliſh, (for ſo the Saxons were now univerſally called) becauſe the kingdom of Mercia was at laſt incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his ſtate, and was governed by Ethelbert, his brother-in-law, who bore the title of earl: And tho' the Danes, who peopled Eaſt-Anglia and Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, were, for ſome time, ruled immediately by their own princes, they all acknowledged a ſubordination to Alfred, and ſubmitted to his ſuperior autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As equality among ſubjects is the great ſource of concord, Alfred gave the ſame laws to the Danes and Engliſh, and put them entirely on the ſame footing in the adminiſtration both of civil and criminal juſtice.

               <p>IN this manner, Alfred repelied ſeveral inroads of theſe pyratical Danes, and maintained his kingdom, during ſome years, in ſafety and tranquillity.

The greater part of the enemy diſembarked in the Rother, and ſeized the ſort of Apuldore. Haſtings himſelf, commanding a fleet of eighty ſail, entered the Thames<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron.

from France. Tired of this ſituation, which muſt in the end prove ruinous to them, the Danes at Apuldore roſe ſuddenly from their encampment, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of marching towards the Thames, and paſſing over into Eſſex: But they eſcaped not the vigilance of Alfred, who encountered them at Farnham, put them to rout<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

Wigorn. p. 595.</note>, ſeized all their horſes and baggage, and chaced the runaways on board their ſhips, which carried them up the Colne to Merſey in Eſſex, where they entrenched themſelves. Haſtings, at the ſame time, and probably by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, made a like movement; and deſerting Milton, took poſſeſſion of Bamflete, near the iſle of Canvey in the ſame county<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>UNFORTUNATELY for the Engliſh, Gothrun, prince of the Eaſt-Anglian Danes, had died; as had alſo Guthred, whom the King had appointed governor of the Northumbrians; and theſe reſtleſs tribes being no longer reſtrained by the authority of their princes, and being encouraged by the appearance of ſo great a body of their countrymen, broke into rebellion, ſhook off the authority of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, and yielding to their inveterate habits of war and depredation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron.

Having left ſome forces at London to make head againſt Haſtings and the other Danes, he marched ſuddenly to the weſt<note n="§" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 93. H.

The enemy, failing next to Suſſex, began to plunder the country near Chicheſter; but the order, which Alfred had every where eſtabliſhed, ſufficed here, without his preſence, for the defence of the place; and the rebels, meeting with a new repulſe, where many of them were killed, and ſome of their ſhips taken<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>MEAN while, the Daniſh invaders in Eſſex, having united their force under the command of Haſtings, advanced into the inland country, and made ſpoil of all around them; but had ſoon reaſon to repent of their temerity. The Engliſh army, left in London, aſſiſted by a body of the citizens, attacked the enemy's entrenchments at Bamflete, overpowered the garriſon, and having committed a great ſlaughter upon them, carried off the wife and two ſons of Haſtings<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

BUT tho' the King had thus honourably rid himſelf of this dangerous enemy, he had not entirely ſubdued or expelled the invaders. The pyratical Danes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly followed in an excurſion any proſperous leader, who gave them hopes of booty, but were not ſo eaſily engaged to relinquiſh their enterprize, or ſubmit to return baffled, and without plunder, into their native country.

The King here ſurrounded them with the whole force of his dominions<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

He knew how to conciliate the boldeſt enterprize with the cooleſt moderation; the moſt obſtinate perſeverance with the eaſieſt flexibility; the moſt ſevere juſtice with the greateſt lenity; the moſt vigorous command with the greateſt affability of deportment<note n="†" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 13.</note>; the higheſt capacity and inclination for ſcience with the moſt ſhining talents for action. His civil and his military virtues are almoſt equally the objects of our admiration; excepting only, that the former, being more rare among princes, as well as more uſeful, ſeem chiefly to challenge our applauſe.

Ten neighbouring houſeholders were formed into one corporation, who, under the name of a tything, decennary, or fribourg, were anſwerable for each other's conduct, and over whom one perſon, called a tything<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, headbourg, or borſholder, was appointed to preſide.

               <p>WHEN any perſon in any tything or decennary was guilty of a crime, the borſholder was ſummoned to anſwer for him; and if he was not willing to be ſurety for his appearance and his clearing himſelf, the criminal was committed to priſon, and there detained till his trial. If he fled, either before or after finding ſureties, the borſholder and decennary became liable to enquiry, and were expoſed to the penalties of law<note n="§" place="bottom">W.

Thirty-one days were allowed them for producing the criminal; and if that time elapſed without their being able to find him, the borſholder, with two other members of the decennary, was obliged to appear, and together with three chief members of the three neighbouring decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries making twelve in all to ſwear that his decennary was free from all privity both of the crime committed, and of the eſcape of the criminal. If the borſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder could not find ſuch a number to anſwer for their innocence, the decennary was compelled by fine to make ſatisfaction to the King, according to the degree

of the crime<note n="*" place="bottom">Leges St Edw. cap. 20. apud Wilkins. p. 202.</note>. By this inſtitution every man was obliged from his own intereſt to keep a watchful eye over the conduct of his neighbours; and was in a manner ſurety for the behaviour of thoſe who were placed under the diviſion, to which he belonged: Whence theſe decennaries received the name of frank-pledges.</p>
               <p>SUCH a regular diſtribution of the people, and ſuch a ſtrict confinement in their habitation, may not be neceſſary in times, when men are more enured to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and juſtice, and might perhaps be regarded as deſtructive of liberty and commerce in a poliſhed ſtate; but were well calculated to reduce theſe fierce and licentious people under the ſalutary reſtraint of law and government. But Alfred took care to temper theſe rigors by other inſtitutions favourable to the freedom and ſecurity of the citizens; and nothing could be more popular and liberal than his plan for the adminiſtration of juſtice. The borſholder ſummoned together his whole decennary to aſſiſt him in deciding any leſſer differences, which occurred among the members of this ſmall community. In affairs of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in appeals from the decennary, or in controverſies ariſing between mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of different decennaries, the cauſe was brought before the hundred, which conſiſted of ten decennaries, or a hundred families of freemen, and which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly aſſembled once in four weeks, for the deciding of cauſes<note n="†" place="bottom">Leg.

Twelve freeholders were choſen; who having ſworn, together with the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreder or preſiding magiſtrate of that diviſion, to adminiſter impartial juſtice<note n="‡" place="bottom">Paedus Alfred, and Gothurn, apud Wilkins, cap. 3. p. 47.

And beſide theſe monthly meetings of the hundred, there was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting, appointed for a more general inſpection of the police of the diſtrict; the enquiry into crimes, the correction of abuſes in magiſtrates, and the obliging every perſon to ſhew the decennary in which he was regiſtered. The people, in imitation of their anceſtors, the antient Germans, aſſembled there in arms; whence a hundred was ſometimes called a wapentake, and its court ſerved both for the ſupport of military diſcipline, and for the adminiſtration of civil juſtice<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spellman in voce Wapentake.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE next ſuperior court to that of the hundred was the county-court, which met twice a year after Michaelmas and Eaſter, and conſiſted of all the freeholders of the county, who poſſeſſed an equal vote in the deciſion of cauſes. The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0162900301:72"/>
biſhop preſided in this court, together with the alderman; and the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the court was the receiving appeals from the hundreds and decennaries, and the deciding ſuch controverſies as aroſe between men of different hundreds. Formerly, the alderman poſſeſſed both the civil and military authority; but Alfred, ſenſible that this coalition of powers rendered the nobility dangerous and independant, appointed alſo a ſheriff in each county; who enjoyed a co-ordinate anthority with the former in the judicial function<note n="*" place="bottom">Ingulf. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THERE lay an appeal, in default of juſtice, from all theſe courts to the King himſelf in council; and as the people, ſenſible of the equity and great talents of Alfred, placed their chief confidence in him, he was ſoon over-whelmed with appeals from all parts of England. He was indefatigable in the diſpatch of theſe cauſes<note n="†" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 20.</note>; but finding that his time muſt be entirely engroſſed by this branch of duty, he reſolved to obviate the inconvenience, by correcting the ignorance or corruption of the inferior magiſtrates, from which it aroſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 18. 21.

               <p>THE better to guide the magiſtrates in the adminiſtration of juſtice, Alfred framed a body of laws; which, tho' now loſt, ſerved long as the baſis of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh juriſprudence, and is generally eſteemed the origin of what is denominated the COMMON LAW. He appointed regular meetings of the ſtates of England twice a year in London<note n="*" place="bottom">Mirroir des Juſtices.</note>; a city which he himſelf had repaired and beautified, and which he thus rendered the capital of the kingdom. The ſimilarity of many of theſe inſtitutions to the cuſtoms of the antient Germans, to the practice of the other northern conquerors, and to the Saxon laws during the Heptarchy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us from regarding Alfred as the ſole author of this plan of government; and leads us rather to think, that, like a wiſe man, he contented himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, extending, and executing the inſtitutions, which he found previouſly eſtabliſhed. But on the whole, ſuch ſucceſs attended his legiſlation, that every thing bore ſuddenly a new face in England: Robberies and iniquities of all kinds

were repreſſed by the puniſhment or reformation of the criminals<note n="*" place="bottom">Ingulf. p. 27.</note>: And ſo exact was the general police, that Alfred, it is ſaid, hung up, by way of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado, golden bracelets near the high-ways; and no man dared to touch them<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

Yet amidſt theſe rigors of juſtice, this great prince preſerved the moſt ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the liberty of his people; and it is a memorable ſentiment preſerved in his will, that it was juſt the Engliſh ſhould for ever remain as free as their own thoughts<note n="‡" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 24.</note>.</p>
               <p>As good morals and knowledge are almoſt inſeparable, in every age, tho' not in every individual; the care of Alfred for the encouragement of learning among his ſubjects was another uſeful branch of his legiſlation, and tended to reform the Engliſh from their former diſſolute and barbarous manners: But the King was guided in this purſuit leſs by his political views, than by his natural bent and propenſity towards letters. When he came to the throne, he found the Engliſh ſunk into the groſſeſt ignorance and barbariſm, proceeding from the continued diſorders in the government and from the ravages of the Danes: The monaſteries were deſtroyed, the monks butchered or diſperſed, their libraries burnt; and thus the only ſeats of erudition in thoſe ages were totally ſubverted<note n="‖" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 18.</note>.

                  </label> THE ſtain in this prince's birth was not, in thoſe times, deemed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as to exclude him from the throne; and Athelſtan, being of an age, as well as of a capacity, fitted for government, obtained the preference to Edward's younger children, who, tho' legitimate, were of too tender years to rule a nation ſo much expoſed both to foreign invaſion and to domeſtic convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Some diſcontents, however, prevailed on his acceſſion; and Alfred, a nobleman of conſiderable power, was thence encouraged to enter into a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt him. This event is related by hiſtorians with circumſtances, which the reader, according to the degree of credit he is diſpoſed to give them, may impute, either to the invention of monks, who forged them, or to their artifice, who found means to make them real. Alfred, it is ſaid, being ſeized upon ſtrong ſuſpicions, but without any certain proof, firmly denied the conſpiracy imputed to him; and in order to juſtify himſelf, he offered to ſwear to his innocence before the Pope, whoſe perſen, it was ſuppoſed, contained ſuch ſuperior ſanctity, that no one could preſume to give a falſe oath in his preſence, and yet hope to eſcape the immediate vengeance of heaven. The King accepted of the condition, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred was conducted to Rome; where, either conſcious of his innocence, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the ſuperſtition, to which he appealed, he ventured to make the oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, before John, who then filled the papal chair. But no ſooner had he pronounced the fatal words, than he fell into convulſions, of which in three days after he expired. The King, as if the guilt of the conſpirator were now fully aſcertained, confiſcated his eſtate, and made a preſent of it to the monaſtery of Malmeſbury<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 2. cap. 6. Spell. Conc. p. 407.</note>; ſecure now that no doubts would ever thenceforth be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning the juſtice of his proceedings.</p>
               <p>THE dominion of Athelſtan was no ſooner eſtabliſhed over his Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, than he endeavoured to give ſecurity to the government, by providing againſt the inſurrections of the Danes, which had created ſo much diſturbance to his predeceſſors. He marched into Northumberland; and finding, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants bore with impatience the Engliſh yoke, he thought it prudent to give Sithric, a Daniſh nobleman, the title of King, and to attach him to his intereſts, by marrying him to his ſiſter, Editha<note n="†" place="bottom">Alured Beverl p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>CONSTANTINE, whether he owed the retaining his crown to the moderation of Athelſtan, who was unwilling to employ all his advantages againſt him, or to the policy of that monarch, who eſteemed the humiliation of an enemy a greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit on than the ſubjection of a diſcontented and mutinous people, thought the behaviour of the Engliſh more an object of reſentment than of gratitude. He entered into a confederacy with Anlaf, who had collected a great body of Daniſh pyrates, whom he found hovering in the Iriſh ſeas; and with ſome Welſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who were terrified with the growing power of Athelſtan: And all theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies made by concert an irruption with a great army into England.

               <p>THERE is a circumſtance, not unworthy of notice, which hiſtorians relate with regard to the tranſactions of this war. Anlaf, on the approach of the Engliſh army, thought, that he could not venture too much to enſure a fortunate event; and employing the artifice formerly practiſed by Alfred againſt the Danes, he entered the enemy's camp in the habit of a minſtrel. The ſtratagem was for the preſent attended with a like ſucceſs. He gave ſuch ſatisfaction to the ſoldiers, who flocked about him, that they introduced him to the King's tent; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laf, having played before that prince and his nobles during their repaſt, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with a handſome reward. His prudence kept him from refuſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but his pride determined him, on his departure, to bury it, while he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that he was uneſpied by all the world. But a ſoldier in Athelſtan's camp, who had formerly ſerved under Anlaf, had been ſtruck with ſome ſuſpicion on the firſt appearance of the minſtrel; and was engaged by curioſity to obſerve all his motions. He regarded this laſt action as a full proof of Anlaf's diſguiſe; and he immediately carried the intelligence to Athelſtan, who blamed him for not ſooner giving him information, that he might have ſeized his enemy. But the ſoldier told him, that as he had formerly ſworn fealty to Anlaf, he could never have pardoned himſelf the treachery of betraying and ruining his antient maſter; and that Athelſtan himſelf, after ſuch an inſtance of his criminal conduct, would have equal reaſon to doubt of his allegiance. Athelſtan, having praiſed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of the ſoldier's principles, reflected on the incident, which he foreſaw might be attended with important conſequences. He removed his ſtation in the camp; and as a biſhop arrived that evening with a reinforcement of troops, (for the eccleſiaſtics were then no leſs warlike than the civil magiſtrates) he occupied with his train that very place which had been left vacant by the King's removal. The precaution of Athelſtan was found prudent: For no ſooner had darkneſs fallen, than Anlaf broke into the camp, and haſtening directly to the place where he had left the King's tent, put the biſhop to death, before he had time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for his de ence<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

               <p>THERE fell ſeveral Daniſh and Welſh princes in the action of Brunſbury<note n="‡" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 839. Ingulf, p. 29.</note>; and Conſtantine and Anlaf made their eſcape with difficulty, leaving the greateſt part of their army on the field of battle. After this ſucceſs, Athelſtan enjoyed

               <p>EDMUND was very young when he came to the crown; yet his reign was ſhort, as his death was violent.

                  </label> THE reign of this prince, as that of his predeceſſors, was diſturbed by the rebellions and incurſions of the Northumbrian Danes, who, tho' frequently quelled, were never entirely ſubdued, nor had ever paid a ſincere allegiance to the crown of England. The ſucceſſion of a new King ſeemed to them a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity for ſhaking off the yoke; but on Edred's appearance with an army, they made him their wonted ſubmiſſions; and the King having waſted the country with fire and ſword, as a puniſhment of their rebellion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 423. Wallingford, p. 541.</note>, obliged them to renew their oaths of allegiance; and he ſtrait returned with his forces. The obedience of the Danes laſted no longer than the preſent terror. Provoked at the devaſtations of Edred, and even reduced by neceſſity to ſubſiſt on plunder, they broke into a new rebellion, and were again ſubdued<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ethelwerd, cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423.</note>: But the King, now inſtructed by experience, took better precautions againſt their future revolt. He fixed Engliſh garriſons in their moſt conſiderable towns; and placed over them an Engliſh governor, who might watch all their motions, and ſuppreſs their inſurrections on the firſt appearance. He obliged alſo Malcolm, King of Scotland, to renew his homage for the lands which he held in England<note n="§" place="bottom">Matth. Weſt. p. 186. Higden, p. 263.</note>.</p>
               <p>EDRED, tho' not unwarlike, nor unfit for active life, lay under the influence of the loweſt ſuperſtition, and had blindly delivered over his conſcience to the guidance of Dunſtan, commonly called St. Dunſtan, abbot of Glaſtenbury<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 2. cap. 7. Brompton, p. 862.</note>, whom he advanced to the higheſt offices, and who covered, under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſanctity, the moſt violent and moſt inſolent ambition. Taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the implicit faith repoſed in him by the King, this churchman imported into England a new order of monks, who much changed the ſtate of eccleſiaſtical affairs, and excited, on their firſt eſtabliſhment, the moſt violent commotions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0162900301:83"/>
FROM the time of the firſt introduction of Chriſtianity among the Saxons, there had been monaſteries in England; and theſe eſtabliſhments had extremely multiplied, by the donations of the princes and nobles; whoſe ſuperſtition, derived from their ignorance and precarious life, and encreaſed by remorſes for the crimes into which they were ſo frequently betrayed, knew no other expedient for appeaſing the Deity than a profuſe liberality towards the eccleſiaſtics. But the monks had hitherto been a ſpecies of ſecular prieſts, who lived in the convents after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the preſent canons or prebendaries, and were both intermingled, in ſome degree, with the world, and endeavoured to render themſelves uſeful to it. They were employed in the education of youth<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſberne in Anglia Sacra, tom. 2. p 92.</note>: They had the diſpoſal of their own time and induſtry: They were not ſubjected to the rigid rules of an order: They had made no vows of implicit obedience to their ſuperiors<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 91.</note>: And they ſtill retained the choice, without quitting the convent, either of a married or a ſingle life<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Wharton's notes to Anglia Sacra, tom 2. p. 91. Gervas, p. 1645. Chron. Wint. MS. apud Spell. Conc. p. 434.</note>. But a miſtaken piety had produced in Italy a new ſpecies of monks, called Benedictines; who, carrying farther the plauſible principles of mortification, ſecluded themſelves entirely from the world, renounced all claim to liberty, and made a merit of the moſt inviolable chaſtity. Theſe practices and principles, which ſuperſtition at firſt engendered, were greedily embraced and promoted by the policy of the court of Rome. The Roman pontiff, who was making every day great advances towards an univerſal ſovereignty over the eccleſiaſtics, perceived, that the celibacy alone of the clergy could break off en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely their connexion with the civil power, and depriving them of every other object of ambition, engage them to promote, with unceaſing induſtry, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their own order. He was ſenſible, that ſo long as the monks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in marriage, and were allowed families, they never could be ſubjected to a ſtrict rule, or reduced to that ſlavery under their ſuperiors, which was requiſite to procure to the orders, iſſued from Rome, a ready and zealous obedience. Celibacy, therefore, began to be extolled, as the indiſpenſible duty of prieſts; and the Pope undertook to make all the clergy throughout the weſtern world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce at once the privilege of marriage: A fortunate policy, but at the ſame time an undertaking the moſt difficult of any, ſince he had the ſtrongeſt propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of human nature to encounter, and found, that the ſame connexions with the female ſex, which generally encourages devotion, was here unfavourable to the ſucceſs of his project. It is no wonder, therefore, that this maſter ſtroke of art ſhould have met with violent contradiction, and that the intereſts of the hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0162900301:84"/>
and the inclinations of the prieſts, being now placed in this ſingular op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhould, notwithſtanding the continued efforts of Rome, have retarded the execution of that bold ſcheme, during the courſe of near three centuries.</p>
               <p>As the biſhops and parochial clergy lived apart with their families, and were more connected with the world, the hopes of ſucceſs with them were fainter, and the pretence for making them renounce marriage was much leſs plauſible. But the pope, having caſt his eye on the monks as the baſis of his authority, was determined to reduce them under ſtrict rules of obedience, to procure them the credit of ſanctity by an appearance of the moſt rigid mortifications, and to break off all their other connections which might interfere with his ſpiritual policy. Under pretence, therefore, of reforming abuſes, which were, in ſome degree, unavoidable in the antient eſtabliſhments, he had already ſpread over the ſouthern countries of Europe the ſtrict rules of the monaſtic life, and began to form at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts towards a like innovation in England. The favourable opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered itſelf (and it was greedily ſeized) ariſing from the weak ſuperſtition of Edred, and the violent impetuous character of Dunſtan.</p>
               <p>DUNSTAN was born of noble parents in the weſt of England; and being educated under his uncle, Aldhelm, then Archbiſhop of Canterbury, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himſelf to the eccleſiaſtical life, and had acquired ſome character in the court of Edmund. He was, however, defamed to that prince as a man of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious manners<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 95. Math. Weſt. p. 187.</note>; and finding his fortune blaſted by theſe ſuſpicions, his ardent ambition prompted him to repair his indiſcretions by running into an oppoſite extreme. He ſecluded himſelf entirely from the world; he framed a cell ſo ſmall that he could neither ſtand erect in it, nor ſtretch out his limbs during his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and he here employed himſelf perpetually either in devotion or in manual labour<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 96.</note>. It is probable, that his brain became gradually crazed by theſe ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary occupations, and that he framed chimeras, which, being believed by himſelf and his ſtupid votaries, procured him the general character of ſanctity among the people. He fancied, that the devil, among the frequent viſits, which he paid him, was one day more earneſt than uſual in his temptations; till Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan, provoked at his importunity, ſeized him by the noſe with a pair of red-hot pincers, as he put his head into the cell; and he held him there, till that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſpirit made the whole neighbourhood reſound with his bellowings. This notable exploit was ſeriouſly credited and extolled by the public; it is tranſmitted to poſterity by one who, conſidering his age, may paſs for a writer of ſome ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance<note n="‡" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 97.</note>; and it inſured to Dunſtan a reputation, which no real piety, much leſs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0162900301:85"/>
virtue, could, even in the moſt enlightened period, have ever been able to procure him with the people.</p>
               <p>SUPPORTED by the character, obtained in his retreat, Dunſtan appeared again at court; and gained ſuch an aſcendant over Edred, who had ſucceeded to the crown, as made him, not only the director of his conſcience, but his counſellor in the moſt momentous affairs of government. He was placed at the head of the treaſury<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 102. Wallingford, p. 541.</note>, and being thus poſſeſſed both of power at court, and of credit with the populace, he was enabled to attempt with ſucceſs the moſt arduous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. Finding, that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of his auſterity, he profeſſed himſelf a partizan of the rigid monaſtic rules; and after introducing that reformation into the convents of Glaſtenbury and Abingdon, he endeavoured to render it univerſal in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>THE minds of men were already well prepared for this innovation. The praiſes of an inviolable chaſtity had been carried to the higheſt extravagance by ſome of the firſt preachers of chriſtianity among the Saxons: The pleaſures of love had been repreſented as incompatible with chriſtian perfection: And a total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from all commerce with the ſex was deemed ſuch a meritorious pennance, as was ſufficient to atone for the greateſt enormities. The conſequence ſeemed natural, that thoſe at leaſt who officiated at the altar ſhould be clear of this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and when the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, which was now creeping in<note n="†" place="bottom">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 452.</note>, was once fully eſtabliſhed, the reverence to the real body of Chriſt in the euchariſt, beſtowed on this argument an additional force and influence. The monks knew how to avail themſelves of all theſe popular topics, and to ſet off their own character to the beſt advantage. They affected the greateſt auſterity of life and manners: They indulged themſelves in the higheſt ſtrains of devotion: They inveighed bitterly againſt the vices and pretended luxury of the age: They were particularly vehement againſt the diſſolute lives of the ſecular clergy, their rivals: Every particular inſtance of libertiniſm in that order was repreſented as a general corruption: And where other topics of defamation were wanting, their marriage became a ſure object of invective, and their wives received the name of <hi>concubines,</hi> or other more opprobrious appellation. The ſecular clergy, on the other hand, who were numerous and rich, and poſſeſſed of the eccleſiaſtical dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, defended themſelves with vigour, and endeavoured to retaliate upon their adverſaries. The people were thrown into agitation; and few inſtances occur of more violent diſſentions, excited by the moſt material differences in religion; or rather by the moſt frivolous: Since it is a general remark, that the more

               <p>THE progreſs of the monks, which was become conſiderable, was ſomewhat retarded by the death of Edred, their partizan, who expired after a reign of nine years<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron Sax. p 115.</note>.

He would have been the favourite of his people, had he not unhappily, on the commencement of his reign, been engaged in a controverſy with the monks, whoſe rage neither the graces of the body nor virtues of the mind could mitigate, and who have purſued his memory with the ſame unrelenting vengeance, which they exerciſed againſt his perſon and dignity during his ſhort and unfortunate reign. There was a beautiful princeſs of the royal blood, called Elgiva, who had made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the tender heart of Edwy; and as he was of an age, when the force of the paſſions begins firſt to be felt, he had ventured, contrary to the advice of his graveſt counſellor, and the remonſtrances of the more dignified eccleſiaſtics<note n="‡" place="bottom">W.

As the auſterity, affected by the monks, made them particularly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent on this occaſion, Edwy entertained a ſtrong prepoſſeſſion againſt them; and ſeemed on that account determined not to ſecond their project, of expelling the ſeculars from all the convents, and of acquiring to themſelves poſſeſſion of thoſe rich eſtabliſhments. The war was therefore declared between the King and the monks; and the former ſoon found reaſon to repent him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſuch dangerous enemies.

Archbiſhop Odo ſent into the palace a party of ſoldiers, who ſeized the Queen, and having burned her face with a red hot iron, in order to deſtroy that fatal beauty, which had ſeduced Edwy, they carried her by force into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there to remain in perpetual exile<note n="‖" place="bottom">Oſberne, p. 84.

Edwy, finding it in vain to reſiſt, was obliged to conſent to his divorce, which was pronounced by Odo<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, 425.</note>; and a cataſtrophe, ſtill more diſmal, awaited the unhappy Elgiva. That amiable princeſs, being cured of her wounds, and having even obliterated the ſcars, with which Odo had hoped to deface her beauty, returned into England, and was flying to the embraces of the King, whom ſhe ſtill regarded as her huſband; when ſhe fell into the hands of a party, whom the primate had ordered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept her.

Odo is tranſmitted to us by the monks under the character of a man of piety: Dunſtan was even canonized; and is one of thoſe numerous ſaints of the ſame ſtamp, who diſgrace the Romiſh calendar.

It is agreed, that this prince had a violent paſſion for his ſecond or third conſin, Elgiva, whom he married, tho' within the degrees prohibited by the canons. It is alſo agreed, that he was dragged from a lady on the day of his coronation, and that the lady was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards treated with the ſingular barbarity abovementioned. The only difference is, that Oſberne and ſome others call her his ſtrumpet, not his wife, as ſhe is ſaid to be by Malmeſbury. But this difference is eaſily reconciled: For if Edwy married her contrary to the canons, the monks would be ſure to deny her to be his wife, and would inſiſt that ſhe could be nothing but his ſtrumpet: So that, on the whole, we may eſteem this repreſentation of the matter as certain; at leaſt, as by far the moſt probable. If Edwy had only kept a miſtreſs, it is well known, that there were methods of accommodation with the church, which would have prevented the clergy from proceeding to ſuch extremities againſt him: But his marriage, contrary to the canons, was an inſult on their authority, and called for their higheſt reſentment.</note>.</p>

               <p>IN order to complete the great work of placing the new order of monks in all the convents, Edgar ſummoned a general council of the prelates and the heads of the religious orders. He here inveighed againſt the diſſolute lives of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular clergy; the ſmallneſs of their tonſure, which, it is probable, maintained no longer any reſemblance to the crown of thorns; their negligence in attending the excreiſe of their function; their mixing with the laity in the pleaſures of gaming, hunting, dancing and ſinging; and their openly living with concubines, by which it is commonly ſuppoſed he meant their wives.

                  </gap> thoſe enormities, he thus addreſſed him. <q rend="inline">"Tis you, Dunſtan, by whoſe advice I founded monaſteries, built churches, and expended my treaſure in the ſupport of religion and religious houſes. You was my counſellor and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant in all my ſchemes: You was the director of my conſcience: To you I was obedient in all things. When did you call for ſupplies, which I refuſed you? Was my aſſiſtance ever wanting to the poor? Did I deny ſupport and eſtabliſhments to the clergy and the convents? Did I not hearken to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, who told me, that theſe charities were, of all others, the moſt grateful to my maker, and fixed a perpetual fund for the ſupport of religion? And are all our pious endeavours now fruſtrated by the diſſolute lives of the prieſts? Not that I throw any blame on you: You have reaſoned, beſought, inculcated, inveighed: But it behoves you now to uſe ſharper and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous remedies; and conjoining your ſpiritual authority with the civil power, to purge effectually the temple of God from thieves and intruders<note n="‡" place="bottom">Abbas Rieval. p 360, 361.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0162900301:91"/>
before the monks prevailed, and eſtabliſhed their new rules in almoſt all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
               <p>WE may remark, that the declamations againſt the ſecular clergy are both here and in all the hiſtorians, conveyed in general terms; and as that order of men are commonly reſtrained by the decency of their character, not to mention ſuperior motives, it is difficult to believe, that the complaints againſt their diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manners could be ſo univerſally juſt as is pretended. It is more probable, that the monks paid court to the populace by an affected auſterity of life; and, repreſenting the moſt innocent liberties, taken by the other clergy, as great and unpardonable enormities, thereby prepared the way for the increaſe of their own power and influence. Edgar, however, like a true politician, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the prevailing party; and he even indulged them in pretenſions, which, tho' they might, when complied with, engage the monks to ſupport royal authority during his own reign, proved afterwards very dangerous to his ſucceſſors, and gave diſturbance to the whole civil power. He ſeconded the policy of the court of Rome, in granting to ſome monaſteries an exemption from epiſcopal juriſdiction: He allowed the convents, even thoſe of royal foundation, to uſurp the election of their own abbot: And he admitted their forgeries of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient charters, by which, from the pretended grant of former kings, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed like privileges and exemptions<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>THESE merits of Edgar have procured him the higheſt panegyrics from tho monks; and he is tranſmitted to us not only under the character of a great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician and an active prince, praiſes to which he ſeems to have been intitled, but under that of a great ſaint and a man of virtue. But nothing could more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray both his own hypocriſy in inveighing againſt the licentiouſneſs of the ſecular clergy, and the intereſted ſpirit of his partizans, in beſtowing ſuch elogies on his piety, than the uſual tenor of his conduct, which was licentious to the higheſt degree, and violated every law, human and divine. Yet thoſe very monks, who, as we are told by Ingulf, a very antient hiſtorian, had no idea of any moral or religious merit, except chaſtity and obedience, not only connived at his enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but loaded him with the higheſt praiſes.

As he had not leiſure to employ courtſhip or addreſs for attaining his purpoſe, he went directly to her mother, ceclared the violence of his paſſion, and deſired that the young lady might be allowed to paſs that very night with him. The mother was a woman of virtue, and determined not to diſhonour her daughter and her family by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; but bring well acquainted with the impetuoſity of the King's temper, ſhe thought it would be eaſier, as well as ſafer, to deceive than refuſe him. She feigned therefore a ſubmiſſion to his will; but ſecretly ordered a waiting maid, of no diſagreeable figure, to ſteal into the King's bed, after all the company ſhould be retired to reſt. In the morning, before day break, the damſel, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the injunctions of her miſtreſs, offered to retire; but Edgar, who had no reſerve in his pleaſures, and whoſe love to his bedfollow was rather enflamed by enjoyment, refuſed his conſent, and employed force and entreaties to detain her.

                  </gap> ſhe had been educated in the country, and had never appeared at court, ſhe had filled all England with the reputation of her beauty. Edgar himſelf, who
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0162900301:93"/>
was indifferent to no accounts of this nature, found his curioſity excited by the frequent panegyrics which he heard of Elfrida; and reflecting on her noble birth, he reſolved, if he found her charms anſwerable to their fame, to obtain poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her on honourable terms. He communicated his intention to earl Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold, his favourite; but uſed the precaution, before he made any advances to her parents, to order that nobleman, on ſome pretence, to pay them a viſit, and to bring him a certain account of the beauty of their daughter. Ethelwold, when introduced to the young lady, found general report to have fallen much ſhort of the truth; and being enflamed with the higheſt love, he determined to ſacrifice to this new paſſion all his ſidelity to his maſter, and to the truſt repoſed in him. He returned to Edgar, and told him, that the riches alone, and high quality of Elfrida, had been the ground of the admiration paid her, and that her charms, far from being any wiſe extraordinary, would have been overlooked in a woman of interior ſtation. When he had, by this deceit, turned the King from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he took an opportunity, after ſome interval, of turning again the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Elfrida; and he remarked, that, tho' the parentage and fortune of the lady had not produced on him, as on others, any illuſion with regard to her beauty, he could not forbear reflecting, that ſhe would on the whole be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous match for him, and might, by her birth and riches, make him a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient compenſation for the homelineſs of her perſon. If the King, therefore, gave his approbation to the deſign, he was determined to make propoſals in his own benalf to the earl of Devonſhire, and doubted not to obtain his, as well as the young lady's, conſent to the marriage. Edgar, pleaſed with an expedient for eſtabliſhing his favourite's fortune, not only exhorted him to execute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but forwarded its ſucceſs by his recommendations to the parents of Elfrida; and Athelwold was ſoon made happy in the poſſeſſion of his miſtreſs. Dreading, however, the detection of the artifice, he employed every pretence for detaining Elfrida in the country, and for keeping her at a diſtance from Edgar.</p>
               <p>THE violent paſſion of Athelwold had concealed from him the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which muſt attend his conduct, and the advantages which the numerous enemies that always purſue a royal favourite, would, by its means, be able to make againſt him. Edgar was ſoon informed of the truth; but before he would execute vengeance on Athelwold's treachery, he reſolved to ſatisfy himſelf with his own eyes of the certainty and full extent of his guilt. He told him, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pay him a viſit in his caſtle, and be introduced to the acquaintance of his new married wife; and Athelwold, as he could not refuſe this honour, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged only leave to go before him a few hours, that he might the better prep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re every thing for his reception. He then diſcovered the whole matter to Elfrida;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0162900301:94"/>
and begged her, if ſhe had any regard, either to her own honour or to his life, to conceal from Edgar, by every circumſtance of dreſs and behaviour, that fatal beauty, which had ſeduced him from fidelity to his friend, and had betrayed him into ſo many falſehoods. Elfrida promiſed compliance, tho' nothing was farther from her intentions. She deemed herſelf little beholden to Athelwold for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which had deprived her of a crown; and knowing the force of her own charms, ſhe did not deſpair even yet of reaching that ſtation, of which her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's artifice had bereaved her. She appeared before the King with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the richeſt attire, and the moſt engaging airs, could beſtow upon her, and excited at once in his boſom the higheſt love towards herſelf, and the moſt furious deſire of revenge againſt her huſband. He knew, however, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble theſe paſſions; and ſeducing Ethelwold into a wood, under pretence of hunting, he ſtabbed him with his own hand, and ſoon after publicly eſpouſed Elfrida<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

               <p>BEFORE we conclude our account of this reign, we muſt mention two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are remarked by hiſtorians. The reputation of Edgar allured a great number of foreigners to viſit his court; and he gave them encouragement to reſide in England<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 116. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 356. Brompton, p. 865.</note>. We are told, that they imported all the vices of their reſpective countries, and contributed to corrupt the ſimple manners of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives<note n="‡" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note>: But as this ſimplicity of manners, ſo highly and often ſo injudiciouſly extolled, preſerved them not from barbarity and treachery, the greateſt of all vices, and the moſt incident to a rude uncultivated people, we ought perhaps to deem their acquaintance with foreigners rather an advantage; as it tended to enlarge their views, and to cure them of thoſe illiberal prejudices and ruſtic manners, to which iſlanders are often ſubject.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER remarkable incident of this reign was the extirpation of wolves from England. This advantage was attained by the induſtrious policy of Edgar. He took great pains in hunting and purſuing thoſe ravenous animals; and when found, that they had all taken ſhelter in the mountains and foreſts of Wales, he changed the tribute of money impoſed on the Welſh princes by Athelſtan, his predeceſſor<note n="‖" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 2. cap. 6. Brompton, p. 838.</note>, into an annual tribute of three hundred heads of wolves; which produced ſuch diligence in hunting them, that the creature has been no more ſeen in this iſland.</p>

Elfrida, his ſtep-mother, had a ſon, Ethelred, ſeven years old, whom ſhe attempted to raiſe to the throne: She affirmed, that Edgar's marriage with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Edward, was expoſed to inſuperable objections; and as ſhe had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed great credit with her huſband, ſhe had found means to acquire partizans, who ſeconded all her pretenſions. But the title of Edward was ſupported by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages. He was appointed ſucceſſor by the will of his father<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden. p. 427.

To cut off all pretenſions, Dunſtan reſolutely anointed and crowned the young prince at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton; and the whole kingdom, without farther oppoſition, ſubmitted to him<note n="‖" place="bottom">W.

               <p>IT was of great importance to Dunſtan and the monks, to place on the throne a King favourable to their cauſe: The ſecular clergy had ſtill partizans in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who deſired to keep them in poſſeſſion of the convents, and of the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical authority.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0162900301:96"/>
there were ſummoned ſeveral ſynods, which, according to the practice of thoſe times, conſiſted partly of eccleſiaſtical members, partly of the lay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The monks were able to prevail in all theſe aſſemblies; tho', as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, contrary to the ſecret wiſhes, if not the declared oppoſition, of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in the nation<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

They had more invention in forging miracles to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their cauſe; or having been ſo fortunate as to obtain, by their pretended auſterities, the character of piety, their miracles were better believed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace.</p>
               <p>IN one ſynod, Dunſtan, finding the majority of votes againſt him, roſe up, and informed the audience, that he had, in that inſtant, received an immediate revelation in behalf of the monks; and the aſſembly were ſo aſtoniſhed at this intelligence, or probably ſo overawed by the populace, that they proceeded no farther in their deliberations. In another ſynod, a voice iſſued from the crucifix, and informed the members, that the eſtabliſhment of the monks was founded on the will of heaven, and could not be oppoſed without impiety<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

               <p>EDWARD lived four years after his acceſſion, and there paſſed nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable during his reign. His death was memorable and tragical<note n="§" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 124.</note>. This young prince was endowed with the moſt amiable innocence of manners; and as his own intentions were always pure, he was incapable of entertaining any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0162900301:97"/>
againſt others. Tho' his ſtep-mother had oppoſed his ſucceſſion, and had raiſed a party in favour of her own ſon, he always ſhowed her marks of the greateſt regard, and even expreſſed, on all occaſions, the moſt tender affection towards his brother<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malmeſ. lib. 2. cap. 9. Brompton, p. 873. Matth. Weſt. p. 193. Wallingford, p. 545.</note>. He was hunting one day in a foreſt in Dorſetſhire; and being led by the chace near Corfe-caſtle, where Elfrida reſided, he took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of paying her a viſit, unattended by any of his retinue, and he thereby preſented her with the occaſion, which ſhe had long wiſhed for. After he had mounted his horſe, he deſired ſome liquor to be brought him; and while he was holding the cup to his head, a ſervant of Elfrida approached him, and gave him a ſtab behind. The prince, finding himſelf wounded, put ſpurs to his horſe; but becoming faint by loſs of blood, he fell from the ſaddle, his foot ſtuck in the ſtirrup, and he was dragged along by his unruly horſe, till he expired<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

Being tracked by the blood, his body was found, and was privately interred at Were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham by his ſervants.</p>
               <p>THE youth and innocence of this prince, with his tragical death, begot ſuch compaſſion among the people, that they believed miracles to be wrought at his tomb<note n="‡" place="bottom">W.

He was expoſed in his youth to the jealouſy of the King of Denmark, who attacked his ſmall, but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant principality; and who being foiled in every aſſault, had recourſe at laſt to perfidy for effectuating his purpoſe, which he had ſo often attempted in vain by force of arms<note n="†" place="bottom">Dudo ex edit.

Here many of his antient ſubjects, impelled partly by affection to their prince, partly by the oppreſſions of the Daniſh Monarch, ranged themſelves under his ſtandard, and offered to follow him in every enterprize. Rollo, inſtead of attempting to recover his paternal dominions, where he muſt expect a vigorous reſiſtance from the Danes, determined to purſue an eaſier, but more important undertaking, and to make his fortune, in imitation of his countrymen, by pillaging the richer and more ſouthern coaſts of Europe. He collected a body of troops, which like that of all theſe ravagers, was compoſed of Norwegians, Swedes, Friſians, Danes, and adventurers of all nations, who,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0162900301:103"/>
being accuſtomed to a roving, unſettled life, took delight in nothing but war and plunder. His reputation drew him aſſociates from all quarters; and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he pretended to have appeared to him in his ſleep, and which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his interpretation of it, prognoſticated to him the greateſt ſucceſſes, proved alſo a powerful incentive with thoſe ignorant and ſuperſtitious people<note n="*" place="bottom">Dudo, p. 71. Gul. Gem. in epiſt. ad Guil. Conq.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE firſt attempt of Rollo was on England, near the end of Alfred's reign; when that great monarch, having ſettled Guthrun and his followers in Eaſt-Anglia, and others of theſe free-booters in Northumberland, and having reſtored peace to his harraſſed country, had eſtabliſhed the moſt excellent military, as well as civil inſtitutions among the Engliſh. The prudent Dane, finding that no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages could be gained over ſuch a people, governed by ſuch a prince, ſoon turned his enterprizes againſt France, which he found more expoſed to his inroads<note n="†" place="bottom">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note>; and during the reigns of Eudes, and uſurper, and of Charles the Simple, a weak prince, he committed the moſt deſtructive ravages on the inland, as well as maritime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of that kingdom. The French, having no means of defence againſt a a chieftain, who united all the valour of his countrymen with the policy of more civilized nations, were obliged to ſubmit to the expedient practiſed by Alfred, and to offer the invaders a ſettlement in ſome of thoſe provinces, which they had depopulated by their arms<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dudſ. p. 82.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE reaſon, why the Danes for many years purſued meaſures ſo different from thoſe embraced by the Goths, Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards, and other northern conquerors, was the great difference, in the method of attack which was practiſed by theſe ſeveral nations, and to which the nature of their particular ſituations neceſſarily confined them. The latter tribes, living in an inland country, made incurſions by land upon the Roman empire; and when they entered far into the frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them their wives and families, whom they had no hopes of ſoon re-viſiting, and who could not otherwiſe participate of their plunder. This circumſtance quickly made them think of forcing a ſettlement in the provinces, which they had over-run; and theſe barbarians, ſpreading themſelves over the country, found an intereſt in protecting the property and induſtry of the people, whom they ſubdued. But the Danes and Norvegians, invited by their maritime ſituation, and obliged to ſubſiſt themſelves in their uncultivated country by fiſhing, had acquired ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of navigation; and in their military excurſions purſued the method practiſed againſt the Roman empire by the more early Saxons: They made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0162900301:104"/>
in ſmall bodies from their ſhips or rather boats, and ravaging the coaſts, returned with the booty to their families, whom they could not conveniently carry along with them in theſe hazardous enterprizes. But when they increaſed their armaments, made incurſions into the inland countries, and found it ſafe to remain longer in the midſt of the enemy, they had been accuſtomed to crowd their veſſels with their wives and children, and having no longer any temptation to return into their own country, they willingly embraced an opportunity of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in the warm climates and cultivated fields of the ſouth.</p>
               <p>AFFAIRS were in this ſituation with Rollo and his followers, when Charles propoſed to relinquiſh to them the province formerly called Neuſtria, and to purchaſe peace of them on theſe hard conditions. After all the terms were fully agreed, there appeared only one circumſtance ſhocking to the haughty Dane: He was required to do homage to Charles for his province, and to put himſelf in that humiliating poſture, impoſed on vaſſals by the rites of the feudal law. He long refuſed to ſubmit to this indignity; but being unwilling to loſe ſuch important advantages for a mere ceremony, he made a ſacrifice of his pride to his intereſt, and acknowledged himſelf in form the vaſſal of the French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch<note n="†" place="bottom">Ypod. Neuſt. p. 417.</note>. Charles gave him his daughter, Giſla, in marriage; and that he might bind him faſter to his intereſts, made him a donation of a conſiderable territory, beſides what he was obliged to ſurrender to him by his ſtipulations. When ſome of the French nobles informed him, that, in return for ſo generous a preſent, it was expected, that he ſhould throw himſelf at the King's feet, and make ſuitable acknowledgments for his bounty; Rollo replied, that he would rather break off the whole treaty; and it was with ſome difficulty they could perſuade him to make that compliment by one of his captains. The Dane, commiſſioned for this purpoſe, full of indignation at the order, and deſpiſing ſo unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he might kiſs it, overthrew him before all his courtiers. The French nation, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their preſent weakneſs, found it prudent to overlook this inſult<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>ROLLO, who was now in the decline of life, and was tired of wars and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, applied himſelf, with mature councils, to the ſettlement of his new acquired territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy; and he parcelled it out among his captains and followers. He followed in this partition the cuſtoms of the feudal law, which was then univerſally eſtabliſhed in the ſouthern countries of Europe, and which ſuited the peculiar circumſtances of that age. He treated the French ſubjects who ſubmitted to him, with mildneſs and juſtice; he reclaimed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0162900301:105"/>
his antient followers from their ferocity and violence; he eſtabliſhed law and order throughout his ſtate; and after a life, ſpent in tumults and ravages, he died peacably in a good old age, and left his dominions to his poſterity<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul.

               <p>WILLIAM I. who ſucceeded him, governed the Dutchy for twenty-five years; and during this time, the Normans were thoroughly intermingled with the French, had acquired their language, had imitated their manners, and had made ſuch progreſs towards cultivation, that, on the death of William, his ſon, Richard, tho' a minor<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vitalis, p. 459.

Richard, after a long reign of fifty-four years, was ſucceeded by his ſon of the ſame name in the year 996<note n="‡" place="bottom">Order Vitalis, p. 459.</note>; which was eighty-five years after the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Normans in France.

               <p>THE Danes had been eſtabliſhed during a longer period, in England than in France; and tho' the ſimilarity of their original language to that of the Saxons invited them to a more early coalition with the natives, they had found, as yet, ſo little example of civilized manners among the Engliſh, that they retained all their antient ferocity, and valued themſelves only on their national character of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary bravery. The recent, as well as more antient atchievements of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, tended to ſuſtain this idea; and the Engliſh princes, particularly Athelſtan and Edgar, ſenſible of that ſuperiority, had been accuſtomed to keep in pay bodies of Daniſh troops, who were quartered about the country, and committed many violences upon the inhabitants. Theſe mercenaries had attained to ſuch a height of luxury, according to the old Engliſh writers<note n="‖" place="bottom">Wallingford, p. 547.</note>, that they combed their hair once a day, bathed themſelves once a week, changed their cloaths frequently; and by all theſe arts of effeminacy, as well as by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary character, had rendered themſelves ſo agreeable to the fair ſex, that they debauched the wives and daughters of the Engliſh, and had diſhonoured many families. But what moſt provoked the inhabitants; inſtead of defending them againſt invaders, they were ever ready to betray them to the foreign Danes, and to aſſociate themſelves with all the ſtraggling parties of that nation. The animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity between the inhabitants of Engliſh and Daniſh race, had, from theſe repeated

               <p>CANUTE alſo found himſelf obliged, in the beginning of his reign, to load the people with heavy taxes, in order to reward his Daniſh followers; and he exacted from them at one time the ſum of 72,000 pounds; beſides 11,000 pounds, which he levied from London alone<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>THE removal of Edmond's children into ſo diſtant a country as Hungary, was, next to their death, regarded by Canute as the greateſt ſecurity of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he had no farther anxiety, except with regard to Alfred and Edward, who were protected and ſupported by their uncle, Richard, duke of Normandy.

Sweyn, King of Norway, the eldeſt ſon of Canute, was abſent; and as the two laſt kings had died without iſſue, there appeared none of that race, whom the Danes could ſupport as ſucceſſor to the throne. Prince Edward was fortunately at court on his brother's demiſe; and tho' the deſcendants of Edmond Ironſide were the true heirs of the Saxon family, yet their abſence in ſo remote a country as Hungary, appeared a ſufficient reaſon for their excluſion to a people like the Engliſh, ſo little accuſtomed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a regular order in the ſucceſſion of their monarchs. All delays might be dangerous; and the preſent occaſion muſt haſtily be embraced; while the Danes, without concert, without a leader, aſtoniſhed at the preſent incident, and anxious only for their perſonal ſafety, dared not to oppoſe the united voice of the whole nation.</p>
               <p>BUT this concurrence of circumſtances in Edward's favour might have failed of its effect, had his ſucceſſion been oppoſed by Godwin, whoſe power, alliances. and abilities gave him a great influence at all times, much more in thoſe ſudden

emergencies, which always attend a revolution of government, and which, either ſeized or neglected, commonly prove ſo deciſive. There were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which divided men's hopes and fears with regard to their expectations of Godwin's conduct. On the one hand, the credit of that nobleman lay chiefly in Weſſex, which was almoſt entirely peopled with Engliſh; and it was therefore preſumed, that he would ſecond the wiſhes of his people, in reſtoring the Saxon line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom he, as well as they, had reaſon to dread, as they had already felt, the moſt grievous oppreſſions. On the other hand, there ſubſiſted a declared animoſity between Edward and Godwin, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Alfred's murder; of which the latter had publicly been accuſed by the prince, and which he might believe ſo deep an offence, as could never, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any ſubſequent merits, be ſincerely pardoned. But their common friends here interpoſed; and repreſenting the neceſſity of their good correſpondence, obliged them to lay aſide all jealouſy and rancour, and concur in reſtoring liberty to their native country. Godwin only ſtipulated, that Edward, as a pledge of his ſincere reconcilement, ſhould promiſe to marry his daughter, Editha<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 80. H. Hunt. p. 365. Ingulph, p. 62.</note>; and having fortified himſelf by this alliance, he ſummoned at Gillingham a general council of the nation, and prepared every meaſure for ſecuring the ſucceſſion to Edward. The Engliſh were unanimous and zealous in their reſolutions; the Danes were divided and diſpirited: Any ſmall oppoſition, which appeared in this aſſembly, was brow-beaten and ſuppreſſed; and Edward was crowned King, with the higheſt demonſtrations of duty and affection<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 80.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE triumph of the Engliſh, upon this ſignal and deciſive advantage, was at firſt attended with ſome inſult and violence againſt the Danes; but the new King, by the mildneſs of his character, ſoon reconciled the latter to his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and the diſtinction between the two nations gradually diſappeared. They were interſperſed with the Engliſh in moſt of the provinces; they ſpoke nearly the ſame tongue; they differed little in their manners and laws; the prevalence of domeſtic diſſenſions in Denmark prevented, for a long time, any powerful inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence<note n="‡" place="bottom">In the year 1046, the Danes made an invaſion from twenty-five ſhips, the only one we read of during this reign.

               <p>THE popularity, which Edward enjoyed on his acceſſion, was not deſtroyed by the firſt act of his adminiſtration, the reſuming all the grants of his immediate predeceſſors; an attempt, which is commonly attended with the moſt dangerous conſequences. The poverty of the crown convinced the nation, that this act of violence was become abſolutely neceſſary; and as the loſs fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large grants from the late Kings, their countrymen, on account of their ſervices in ſubduing the kingdom, the Engliſh were rather pleaſed to ſee them reduced to their primitive poverty. The King's ſeverity alſo towards his mother the Queen dowager, tho' expoſed to ſome more cenſure, met not with very general diſapprobation. He had hitherto lived on very indifferent terms with that princeſs: He accuſed her of neglecting him and his brother during their adverſe fortune<note n="†" place="bottom">Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 237.</note>: He remarked, that as the ſuperior qualities of Canute, and his better treatment of her<note n="‡" place="bottom">W.

The ſame reaſons had probably made her unpopular in England; and tho' her benefactions to the monks obtained her the favour of that order, the nation was not, in general, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to ſee her ſtripped by Edward of immenſe treaſures which ſhe had amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron.

The ſtories of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing her of a participation in her ſon, Alfred's murder, and of a criminal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the biſhop of Wincheſter, and alſo of her juſtifying herſelf by treading unhurt with her bare feet over nine burning plow-ſhares, were the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the monkiſh hiſtorians, and were propagated and believed from the ſilly wonder of poſterity<note n="§" place="bottom">Higden, p. 277.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh flattered themſelves, that, by the acceſſion of Edward, they were delivered for ever from the dominion of foreigners; but they ſoon found, that that evil was not yet entirely removed. The King had been educated in Normandy; and had contracted many intimacies with the natives of that country, as well as an affection to their manners<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Ingulph, p. 62.</note>. The court of England was ſoon filled with Normans, who being diſtinguiſhed, both by the favour of Edward, and by a degree of cultivation ſomewhat ſuperior to that of the Engliſh in thoſe ages, ſoon

rendered their language, cuſtoms and laws faſhionable in the kingdom. The ſtudy of the French tongue became general among the people. The cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers affected to imitate that nation in their dreſs, equipage, and entertainments: Even the lawyers employed a foreign language in their deeds and papers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ingulph, p. 62.</note>: But above all, the church felt the influence and dominion of theſe ſtrangers: Ulf and William, two Normans, who had formerly been the King's chaplains, were created biſhops of Dorcheſter and London. Robert was promoted to the ſee of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron.

And tho' the King's prudence or his want of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, made him confer almoſt all the civil and military employments on the natives, the eccleſiaſtical preferments fell often to the ſhare of the Normans; and as the latter poſſeſſed Edward's confidence, they had ſecretly a great influence on public affairs, and excited the jealouſy of the Engliſh, particularly of earl God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win<note n="‡" place="bottom">W.

               <p>THIS powerful nobleman, beſides being duke or earl of Weſſex, had, annexed to his government, the counties of Kent and Suſſex.

The exorbitant authority of this family was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by immenſe poſſeſſions and powerful alliances; and the abilities, as well as ambition, of Godwin himſelf contributed to render it ſtill more dangerous. A prince of greater capacity and vigour than Edward would have found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſupport the dignity of the crown under ſuch circumſtances; and as the haughty temper of Godwin made him often forget the reſpect, due to his prince, Edward's animoſity againſt him was grounded on perſonal as well as political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, on recent as well as more antient injuries. The King, in purſuance of his engagements, had indeed married Editha, the daughter of Godwin<note n="§" place="bottom">Chron.

Edward's hatred of the father was transferred to that princeſs; and Editha, tho' poſſeſſed of many amiable accompliſhments, never could acquire the confidence and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her huſband.

               <p>THE moſt popular pretence, on which Godwin could ground his diſcontents againſt the King and his adminiſtration, was to complain of the influence of the Normans in the government; and a declared oppoſition had thence ariſen between him and theſe favourites. It was not long before this animoſity broke out into action.

He hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried immediately to court; complained of the uſage he had met with; the King entered zealouſly into the quarrel, and reſented that a ſtranger of ſuch diſtinction, whom he had invited over to his court, ſhould, without any juſt cauſe, as he believed, have felt ſo ſenſibly the inſolence and animoſity of his people. He gave orders to Godwin, in whoſe government Dover lay, to go immediately to the place, and to puniſh the inhabitants for the crime: But Godwin, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired rather to encourage, than repreſs, the popular diſcontent againſt foreigners, refuſed obedience, and endeavoured to throw the whole blame on the count of Boulogne, and his retinue<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81. Higden, p. 279.</note>. Edward, touched in ſo ſenſible a point, ſaw the neceſſity of exerting the royal authority; and he threatened Godwin, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his diſobedience, to make him feel the utmoſt effects of his reſentment.</p>
               <p>THE earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable, and pleaſed to embark in a cauſe, where he was likely to be ſupported by his countrymen, prepared for his own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward; and under pretence of repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome diſorders on the Welſh frontier, he ſecretly aſſembled a great army, and was approaching the King, who reſided, without any military force, and without ſuſpicion, at Gloceſter<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81.</note>. Edward then applied for protection to Siward, duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of Mercia, two powerful noblemen, whoſe jealouſy of Godwin's greatneſs, as well as their duty to the crown, engaged them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0162900301:124"/>
to defend the King in this extremity. They haſtened to him with ſuch of their followers as they could aſſemble on the ſudden; and finding the danger ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than they had apprehended, they iſſued orders for muſtering all the forces within their government, and for marching them without delay to the defence of the king's perſon and authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 441. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</note>. Edward, mean while, endeavoured to protract time by negotiation; while Godwin, who thought the King entirely in his power, and who was willing to ſave appearances, fell into the ſnare; and not ſenſible, that he ought to have no farther reſerve after he had proceeded ſo far, he loſt the favourable opportunity of rendering himſelf maſter of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>THE Engliſh, tho' they had not a very high idea of Edward's vigour and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, bore him great affection on account of his humanity, juſtice, and piety, as well as of the long race of their native kings, from whom he was deſcended; and they haſtened from all quarters to defend him from the preſent danger. His army was now ſo conſiderable, that he ventured to take the field; and marching to London, he ſummoned a great council of the kingdom, to judge of the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Godwin and his ſons. Theſe noblemen pretended at firſt that they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtand their trial; but having in vain endeavoured to make their adherents perſiſt in rebellion<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 441.

Baldwin, earl of Flanders, gave protection to Godwin and his three ſons, Gurth, Sweyn, and Toſti; the latter of whom had married the daughter of that prince: Harold and Leofwin, two others of his ſons, took ſhelter in Ireland<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p 441.

               <p>BUT Godwin had fixed his authority on too firm a baſis, and he was too ſtrongly ſupported by alliances both abroad and at home, not to occaſion farther diſturbances, and make new efforts for his re-eſtabliſhment. <label type="milestone">

The King, informed of

He put to ſea immediately, and ſailed to the Iſle of Wight, where he was joined by Harold with a ſquadron, which that nobleman had collected in Ireland. He was now maſter of the ſea; and entering every harbour in the ſouthern coaſt, he ſeized all the ſhips<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, and ſummoned his followers in thoſe counties, which had ſo long been ſubjected to his government, to aſſiſt him in procuring juſtice to himſelf, his family, and his country, againſt the tyranny of foreigners<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 442.

The King alone ſeemed reſolute to defend himſelf to the laſt extremity; but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Engliſh nobility, many of whom favoured Godwin's pretenſions, made Edward hearken to terms of accommodation; and the feigned humility of the earl, who diſclaimed all intentions of offering force to his ſovereign, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only to juſtify himſelf by a fair and open trial, paved the way for his more eaſy admiſſion<note n="§" place="bottom">Chron.

He was ſucceeded in the government of Weſſex, Suſſex, Kent, and Eſſex, and in the office of ſteward of the houſehold, a place of great power, by his ſon,

Harold, who was actuated by an ambition equal to that of his father, and was ſuperior to him in addreſs, in inſinuation, and in virtue. By a modeſt and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle demeanour, he acquired the good-will of Edward; at leaſt, ſoftened that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which the prince had ſo long borne his family<note n="*" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 948.</note>; and acquiring every day new partizans by his bounty and affability, he proceeded, in a more ſilent, and therefore a more dangerous manner, to the increaſe of his authority. The King, who had not ſufficient vigour directly to oppoſe his progreſs, knew of no other expedient than that hazardous one, of raiſing him a rival in the family of Leofric, duke of Mercia, whoſe ſon, Algar, was inveſted in the government of Eaſt-Anglia, which, before the baniſhment of Harold, had belonged to this latter nobleman. But this policy, of balancing oppoſite parties, required a more ſteady hand to manage it than that of Edward, and naturally produced faction, and even civil broils, among nobles of ſuch mighty and independent authority.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1055</label> THE death of Siward, duke of Northumberland, made the way ſtill more open to the ambition of that nobleman. Siward, beſides his other merits, had acquired honour to England, by his ſucceſsful conduct of the only foreign enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize which was undertaken during the reign of Edward. Duncan, King of Scotland, was a prince of a very gentle diſpoſition, but poſſeſſed not vigor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to govern a country ſo turbulent, and ſo much infeſted by the intrigues and animoſities of the great. Macbeth, a powerful nobleman, and nearly allied to the crown, not contented with curbing the King's authority, carried farther his peſtilent ambition: He put his ſovereign to death; chaced Malcolm Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0162900301:127"/>
his ſon and heir, into England; and uſurped the crown. Siward, whoſe daughter was married to Duncan, embraced, by Edward's orders, the protection of this diſtreſſed family: He marched an army into Scotland; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and killed Macbeth in battle, he reſtored Malcolm to the throne of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 79. Hoveden, p. 443. Chron. Mailr. p. 158. Buchanan, p. 115. edit. 1715.</note>. This ſervice, added to his former connexions with the royal family of Scotland, brought great acceſſion to the authority of Siward in the north; but as he had loſt his eldeſt ſon, Oſbern, in the action with Macbeth, it proved in the iſſue fatal to his family.

               <p>THERE are two circumſtances related of Siward, which diſcover his high ſenſe of honour and his martial diſpoſition. When intelligence was brought him of his ſon Oſbern's death, he was inconſolable; till he heard, that the wound was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the breaſt, and that he had behaved with great gallantry in the action<note n="‡" place="bottom">H. Hunt. p. 366. Higden, p. 280. Brompton, p. 946.</note>. When he found his own death approaching, he ordered his ſervants to cloathe him in a compleat ſuit of armour; and ſitting erect on the couch, with a ſpear in his hand, declared, that, in that poſture, the only one worthy of a warrior, he would patiently await the fatal moment<note n="‖" place="bottom">Higden, p. 281.

               <p>THE King, now worn with cares and infirmities, felt himſelf far advanced in the decline of life; and having no iſſue himſelf, began to think of fixing a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to the kingdom. He ſent a deputation into Hungary, to invite over his nephew, Edward, ſon to his elder brother, and the only remaining heir of the Saxon line<note n="§" place="bottom">H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 444. Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. Mailr. p. 158.</note>. That prince, whoſe ſucceſſion to the crown would have been eaſy and undiſputed, came over to England with his children, Edgar, ſirnamed Atheling, Margaret, and Chriſtina; but his death, which happened a few days after his arrival, threw the King into new difficulties. He ſaw, that the great power and ambition of Harold had tempted him to think of obtaining poſſeſſion of the throne on the firſt vacancy, and that Edgar, on account of his youth and inexperience, was very unfit to oppoſe the pretenſions of ſo popular and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing a rival. The animoſity which he had long borne earl Godwin, made him averſe to the ſucceſſion of his ſon; and he could not, without extreme reluctance, think of an increaſe of grandeur to a family, which had riſen on the ruins of royal authority, and which, by the murder of Alfred, his brother, had contributed ſo much to the weakening the Saxon line. In this uncertainty, he ſecretly caſt his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0162900301:128"/>
eye towards his kinſman, William, duke of Normandy, as the only perſon whoſe power, and character, and capacity, could ſupport any deſtination which he might make to the excluſion of Harold, and his family<note n="*" place="bottom">Ingulf. p. 68.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS famous prince was natural ſon of Robert, duke of Normandy, by Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotta, daughter of a tanner in Falaiſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 910.</note>, and was very early eſtabliſhed in that grandeur, from which his birth ſeemed to have ſet him at ſo great a diſtance. While he was but nine years of age, his father had reſolved to undertake a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to Jeruſalem; a faſhionable act of devotion, which had taken place of the pilgrimages to Rome, and which, as it was attended with more difficulty and danger, and carried theſe religious adventurers to the firſt ſources of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, appeared to them much more pious and meritorious. Before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he aſſembled the ſtates of the dutchy; and informing them of his purpoſe, he engaged them to ſwear allegiance to his natural ſon, William, whom, as he had no legitimate iſſue, he intended, in caſe he ſhould die in the pilgrimage, to leave ſucceſſor to his dominions<note n="‡" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 95.</note>. As he was a prudent prince, he could not but forſee the great inconveniencies which muſt attend his journey, and this ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſucceſſion; ariſing from the natural turbulency of the great, the claims from other branches of the ducal family, and the power of the French monarch: But all theſe views were ſuperſeded by the prevailing zeal for pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ypod. Neuſtr. p. 452.</note>; and probably, the more important they were, the more would Robert exult in ſacrificing them to what he imagined to be his religious duty.</p>
               <p>THIS prince, as he had apprehended, died in his pilgrimage; and the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his ſon was attended with all thoſe inconveniencies, which were unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his ſituation. The licentious nobles, freed from the awe of ſovereign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, broke out into perſonal animoſities againſt each other, and made the whole country a ſcene of war and devaſtation<note n="§" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 95. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 1.</note>. Roger, count of Toni, and Alain, count of Britanny, advanced pretenſions to the dominion of the ſtate; and Henry I.

Malm. p. 97.</note>. The regency eſtabliſhed by Robert found great difficulties in ſupporting the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt this complication of dangers; and the young prince, when he came to age, found himſelf reduced to a very low condition. But the great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which he ſoon diſplayed in the field and in the cabinet, gave encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his friends, and ſtruck a terror into his enemies. He oppoſed himſelf on all ſides againſt his rebellious ſubjects, and againſt foreign invaders; and by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0162900301:129"/>
and conduct prevailed in every action. He forced the French King to grant him peace on reaſonable terms; he expelled all pretenders to the ſovereignty; and he reduced his turbulent barons to pay ſubmiſſion to his authority, and to ſuſpend their mutual animoſities. The natural ſeverity of his temper appeared in a rigorous adminiſtration of juſtice; and having found the happy effects of this plan of government, without which the laws in thoſe ages became totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, he eſtabliſhed it as a fixed maxim, that an inflexible conduct was the firſt duty of a ſovereign.</p>
               <p>THE tranquillity which he had eſtabliſhed in his dominions had given Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam leiſure to pay a viſit to the King of England during the time of Godwin's baniſhment; and he was received in a manner ſuitable to the great reputation which he had acquired, to the relation by which he was connected with Edward, and to the obligations which that prince had owed to his family<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 442. Ingulf, p. 65. Chron. Mailr. p. 157. Higden, p. 279.</note>. On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Godwin, and the expulſion of the Norman favourites, Robert, archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury, had, before his departure, perſuaded Edward to think of adopting William as his ſucceſſor; a council, which was favoured by the King's averſion to Godwin, his prepoſſeſſions towards the Normans, and his eſteem of the duke. That prelate, therefore, received a commiſſion to inform William of the King's intentions in his favour; and he was the firſt perſon who opened the mind of the prince to entertain theſe ambitious hopes<note n="†" place="bottom">Ingulf, p. 68. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 31. Order. Vitalis, p. 492.</note>. But Edward, irreſolute and feeble in his purpoſe, finding that the Engliſh would more eaſily acquieſce in the reſtoration of the Saxon line, had, in the mean while, invited his brother's deſcendants from Hungary, with a view of having them recognized heirs to the throne<note n="‡" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366.</note>. The death of his nephew, and the inexperience and unpromiſing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of young Edgar, made him reſume his former intentions in favour of the duke of Normandy; though his averſion to hazardous enterprizes engaged him to poſtpone the execution, and even to keep his purpoſe ſecret from all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>HAROLD, mean while, proceeded, after a more open manner, in increaſing his popularity, in eſtabliſhing his power, and in preparing the way for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement on the firſt vacancy of the throne; an event which, from the age and infirmities of the King, appeared not very diſtant. But there was ſtill an obſtacle, which it was requiſite for him previouſly to overcome. Earl Godwin, when reſtored to his power and fortune, had given hoſtages for his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0162900301:130"/>
and among the reſt one ſon and one grandſon, whom Edward, for gr er ſecurity, had ſent over to be kept in Normandy. Harold, tho' he was not aware of the duke's being his competitor, was uneaſy, that ſuch near relations ſhould be detained priſoners in a foreign country; and he was afraid, that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam would, in favour of Edgar, retain theſe pledges as a check on the ambition of any other pretender<note n="*" place="bottom">Brompton. p. 947.</note>. He repreſented, therefore, to the King his unfeigned ſubmiſſion to royal authority, his ſteady duty to his prince, and the little neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there was, after ſuch an uniform trial of his obedience, to keep any longer thoſe hoſtages, who had been required on the firſt compoſing of civil diſcords. By theſe topics, enforced by his great power, he extorted the King's conſent to releaſe them; and he immediately proceeded, with a numerous retinue, on his journey to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 449.

A tempeſt drove him on the territory of Guy, count of Ponthieu, who, being informed of his quality, immediately detained him priſoner<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 449.</note>, and demanded an exorbitant ſum for his ranſom. Harold found means to convey intelligence of his condition to the duke of Normandy; and repreſented, that, while he was proceeding to <hi>bis</hi> court, in execution of a commiſſion from the King of England, he had met with this harſh treatment from the mercenary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the count of Ponthieu.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM was immediately ſenſible of the importance of the incident. He foreſaw, that, if he could once gain Harold, either by favours or menaces, his way to the throne of England would be open, and Edward would meet with no farther obſtacle in executing the favourable intentions which he had entertained in his behalf. He ſent, therefore, an ambaſſador to Guy, in order to demand the liberty of his priſoner; and that nobleman, not daring to refuſe ſo great a prince, put Harold into the hands of the Norman ambaſſador, who conducted him to Roüen<note n="‖" place="bottom">W.

William received him with every demonſtration of reſpect and friendſhip; and after ſhowing himſelf diſpoſed to comply with his deſire, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up the hoſtages, he took an opportunity of diſcloſing to him the great ſecret, of his pretenſions to the crown of England, and of the will which Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intended to make in his favour. He deſired the aſſiſtance of Harold in perfecting that deſign; he made profeſſions of the utmoſt gratitude in return for ſo great an obligation; he promiſed that the preſent grandeur of Harold's family, which ſupported itſelf with difficulty under the jealouſy and hatred of Edward, ſhould receive new increaſe from a ſucceſſor, who would be ſo ſenſibly beholden
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0162900301:131"/>
to him for his advancement. Harold was ſurprized with this declaration of the duke; but being ſenſible, that he could never recover his own liberty, much leſs that of his brother and nephew, if he refuſed the demand, he feigned a compliance with William, renounced all hopes of the crown for himſelf, and profeſſed his ſincere intention of ſupporting the will of Edward, and ſeconding the pretenſions of the duke of Normandy. William, to tie him faſter to his ſervice, beſides offering him his daughter in marriage<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 449. Ingulf, p. 68.</note>, required him to take an oath, that he would fulfil his promiſes; and in order to render that oath more binding, he employed an artifice, well ſuited to the ignorance and ſuperſtition of the age. He ſecretly conveyed under the altar, on which Harold agreed to ſwear, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſome of the moſt reſpected martyrs; and when Harold had taken the oath, he ſhowed him the reliques, and admoniſhed him to obſerve religiouſly an engagement, which had been ratified by ſo tremendous a ſanction<note n="†" place="bottom">Wace, p. 459, 460.

The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nobleman was aſtoniſhed; but diſſembling his concern, he renewed the ſame profeſſions, and was diſmiſſed with all the marks of mutual confidence by the duke of Normandy.</p>
               <p>WHEN Harold found himſelf at liberty, his ambition ſuggeſted caſuiſtry ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify to him the violation of an oath, which had been extorted from him by fear, and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with the ſubjection of his native country to a foreign power. He continued ſtill to practiſe every art of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity; to increaſe the number of his partizans; to reconcile the minds of the Engliſh to the idea of his ſucceſſion; to revive their hatred of the Normans; and by an oſtentation of his power and influence, to deter the timorous Edward from executing his intended deſtination in favour of William. Fortune, about this time, threw two incidents in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral favour, and to increaſe the character, which he had already obtained, of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and capacity.</p>
               <p>THE Welſh, tho' a leſs formidable enemy than the Danes, had been long accuſtomed to infeſt the weſtern borders; and after committing ſpoil on the low countries, they uſually made a haſty retreat into their mountains, where they were ſheltered from the purſuit of their enemies, and were ready to ſeize the firſt favourable opportunity of renewing their depredations. Griffith, their preſent prince, had much diſtinguiſhed himſelf in theſe incurſions; and his name had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo terrible to the Engliſh, that Harold found he could do nothing more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0162900301:132"/>
acceptable to the public, and more honourable to himſelf, than the ſuppreſſing ſo dangerous an enemy. He formed the plan of an expedition againſt Wales; and having prepared ſome light armed foot to purſue the natives into their faſtneſſes, ſome cavalry to ſcour the open country, and a ſquadron of ſhips to attack the ſea-coaſt, he employed at once all theſe forces againſt the Welſh, proſecuted his advantages with vigour, made no intermiſſion in his aſſaults, and at laſt reduced the enemy to ſuch diſtreſs, that, in order to prevent their total deſtruction, they made a ſacrifice of their prince, whoſe head they cut off, and ſent to Harold; and they were contented to receive as their ſovereigns two Welſh noblemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Edward to rule over them<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

               <p>TOSTI, the elder brother of Harold, had been created duke of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but being of a violent, tyrannical temper, had practiſed ſuch cruelty and injuſtice over the inhabitants, that they roſe in rebellion againſt him, and chaced him from his government. Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who poſſeſſed great power in thoſe quarters, and who were grandſons of the great duke, Leof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, concurred in the inſurrection; and the former, being elected duke, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with an army, to oppoſe Harold, who was commiſſioned by the King to reduce and puniſh the Northumbrians. Before the armies came to action, Morcar, well acquainted with the generous diſpoſition of the Engliſh commander, endeavoured to juſtify his conduct; and repreſented to him, that Toſti had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved in a manner unworthy of the ſtation to which he was advanced, and no one, not even a brother, could ſupport ſuch tyranny, without participating, in ſome degree, of the infamy attending it; that the Northumbrians, accuſtomed to a legal adminiſtration, and regarding it as their birth-right, were willing to ſubmit to the King, but required a governor who would pay regard to their rights and privileges; that they had been taught by their anceſtors, that death was preferable to ſervitude, and had come to the field determined to periſh, rather than bear a renewal of thoſe indignities, to which they had been ſo long expoſed; and they truſted, that Harold, on reflection, would not defend in another that violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, from which, in his own government, he had always kept at ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<note n="†" place="bottom">Higden, p. 283.</note>. This vigorous remonſtrance was accompanied with ſuch a detail of facts, ſo well ſupported, that Harold found it prudent to abandon his brother's cauſe; and returning to Edward, he perſuaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to confirm Morcar in the government<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 171. W. Malm. p. 83. H. Hunt. p. 367. Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, p. 283. Sim. Dun. p. 193.</note>. He even married the ſiſter of that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0162900301:133"/>
nobleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Order Vitalis, p. 492.</note>; and by his intereſt procured Edwin, the younger brother, to be elected into the government of Mercia.

Beverl. p. 122.</note>.</p>
               <p>By this marriage, Harold broke all meaſures with the duke of Normandy; and William clearly perceived, that he could no longer rely on the oaths and promiſes, which he had extorted from him. But the Engliſh nobleman thought himſelf now in ſuch a ſituation, that it was no longer neceſſary for him to diſſemble. He had in his conduct againſt the Northumbrians, given ſuch a ſpecimen of his moderation as had gained him the affections of his countrymen. He ſaw, that almoſt all England was under the command of himſelf or his friends; while he poſſeſſed the government of Weſſex, Morcar that of Northumberland, and Edwin that of Mercia. He now openly aſpired to the ſucceſſion; and inſiſted, that, ſince it was neceſſary, by the confeſſion of all, to ſet aſide the royal family, on account of the imbecillity of Edgar, the ſole ſurviving heir, there was no one ſo capable of filling the throne, as a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of great power, of mature age, of long experience, of approved courage and ability, who being a native of the kingdom, would effectually ſecure it againſt the dominion and tyranny of foreigners. Edward, broken with age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, ſaw the difficulties too great for him to encounter; and tho' his inveterate prepoſſeſſions kept him from ſeconding the pretenſions of Harold, he took but feeble and irreſolute ſteps for ſecuring the ſucceſſion to the duke of Normandy<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>The whole ſtory of the tranſactions between Edward, Harold, and the duke of Normandy is told ſo differently by the antient writers, that there are few important paſſages of the Engliſh hiſtory liable to ſo great uncertainty. I have followed the account, which appeared to me the moſt conſiſtent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. It does not ſeem likely, that Edward ever executed a will in the duke's favour, much leſs that he got it ratified by the ſtates of the kingdom, as is affirmed by ſome. The will would have been known to all, and would have been produced by the Conqueror to whom it gave ſo plauſible, and really ſo juſt a title; but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he ſeems always to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it, proves, that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favour, which he was deſirous to call a will. There is indeed a charter of the Conqueror, preſerved by Dr. Hickes, vol. 1. where he calls himſelf <hi>rex hereditarius,</hi> meaning heir by will; but a prince, poſſeſſed of ſo much power, and attended with ſo much ſucceſs, may employ what pretences he pleaſes: It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to refute his pretences to obſerve, that there is a great diffidence and variation among the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians with regard to a point, which, had it been real, muſt have been agreed upon by all of them.</p>
                     <p>AGAIN, ſome hiſtorians, particularly Malmeſbury and Matthew Weſtminſter, affirm that Harold had no intention of going over to Normandy, but that taking the air in a pleaſure-boat on the coaſt, he was driven over by ſtreſs of weather to the territories of Guy count of Ponthieu: But beſides that this ſtory is not probable in itſelf, and is contradicted by moſt of the antient hiſtorians, it is refuted by a very curious and authentic monument lately diſcovered. It is a tapeſtry, preſerved in the ducal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Rouen, and ſuppoſed to have been wrought by orders of Matilda, wife to the Emperor: At leaſt it is of very great antiquity. Harold is there repreſented as taking his departure from K. Edward in execution of ſome commiſſion, and mounting his veſſel with a great train. The deſign of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brother and nephew, who were hoſtages, is the moſt likely cauſe that can be aſſigned; and is accordingly mentioned by Eadmer, Hoveden, Brompton, and Simeon of Durham. For a farther account of this piece of tapeſtry, ſee Hiſtoire de l'Academie de Literature, tom. IX. page 535.</p>
                  </note>. While he continued in this uncertainty, he was ſurprized by ſickneſs, which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0162900301:134"/>
brought him to his grave, on the fifth of January 1066, in the ſixty-fifth year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</p>
               <p>THIS prince, to whom the monks gave the title of ſaint and confeſſor, was the laſt of the Saxon line, who ruled in England; and tho' his reign was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and fortunate, he owed this proſperity leſs to his own ability than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, employed in other enterprizes, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted not thoſe incurſions, which had been ſo troubleſome to all his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and fatal to ſome of them. The facility of his diſpoſition made him acquieſce under the government of Godwin and his ſon Harold; and the capacity, as well as the power of theſe noblemen, enabled them, while they were intruſted with authority, to preſerve domeſtic peace and tranquillity. The moſt commendable circumſtance of Edward's government was his attention to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, and his compiling for that purpoſe a body of laws, which he collected from the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, tho' now loſt (for the laws that paſs under Edward's name were compoſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note n="*" place="bottom">Spelm. in verbo <hi>Bailiva.</hi>
                  </note>) were long the objects of affection to the Engliſh nation.</p>
               <p>EDWARD the Confeſſor was the firſt who touched for the King's evil: The opinion of his ſanctity procured belief to this cure among the people; and his ſucceſſors regarded it as a part of their power and grandeur to uphold the ſame opinion. It has been continued down to our time; and the practice was firſt dropped by the preſent royal family, who obſerved, that it could no longer give amazement even to the populace, and was attended with ridicule in the eyes of all men of underſtanding.</p>

Many of the hiſtorians ſay, that Harold was regularly elected by the ſtates: Some, that Edward left him his ſucceſſor by will.</note>. If there were any malcontents at this reſolution, they were obliged to conceal their ſentiments; and the new prince, taking a general ſilence for conſent, and founding his title on the ſuppoſed ſuffrages of the people, which appeared unanimous, was, on the day immediately ſucceeding Edward's death, crowned and anointed King, by Aldred, archbiſhop of York. The whole nation ſeemed joyfully to ſwear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſymptoms of danger, which the King diſcovered, came from abroad, and from his own brother, Toſti, who had ſubmitted to a voluntary baniſhment in Flanders. Enraged at the ſucceſsful ambition of Harold, to which he himſelf had fallen a ſacrifice, he filled the court of Baldwin with complaints of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, which he had ſuffered: He engaged the intereſt of that family againſt his brother: He endeavoured to form intrigues with ſome malcontent nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of England: He ſent his emiſſaries to Norway, in order to rouze to arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and excite their hopes of reaping advantage from the unſettled ſtate of affairs on the uſurpation of the new King: And that he might render the combination more formidable, he made a journey to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy; in expectation, that the duke, who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin, would, in revenge of his own injuries, as well as thoſe of Toſti, ſecond, by his councils and forces, the projected invaſion of England<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vitalis, p. 492.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE duke of Normandy, when he firſt received intelligence of Harold's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and acceſſion, had been moved to the higheſt pitch of indignation; but that he might give the better colour to his pretenſions, he ſent over an ambaſſy to England, upbraiding that prince with his breach of faith, and ſummoning him to reſign immediately poſſeſſion of the kingdom. Harold replied to the Norman ambaſſadors, that the oath with which he was reproached, had been extorted by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0162900301:136"/>
the well grounded fear of violence, and could never, for that reaſon, be regarded as obligatory: That he had had no commiſſion, either from the late King or the ſtates of England, who alone could diſpoſe of the crown, to make any tender of the ſucceſſon to the duke of Normandy; and if he, a private perſon, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſo much authority, and had even voluntarily ſworn to ſupport the duke's pretenſions, the oath was unlawful, and it was his duty to ſeize the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of breaking it: That he had obtained the crown by the unanimous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the people; and ſhould ſhow himſelf totally unworthy of their favour, did he not ſtrenuouſly maintain thoſe national liberties, with which they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him: And that the duke, if he made any attempt by force of arms, ſhould experience the power of an united nation, conducted by a prince, who, ſenſible of the obligations, impoſed on him by his royal dignity, was determined, that the ſame moment ſhould put a period to his life and to his government<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 99. Higden, p. 285. M. Weſt. p. 222. Degeſt. Angl. incerto auctore, p. 331.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS anſwer was no other than William expected; and he had previouſly fixed his reſolution of making an attempt upon England. Conſulting only his courage, his reſentment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which muſt attend an attack of a great kingdom by ſuch inferior force, and he ſaw only the circumſtances, which would facilitate his enterprize. He conſidered, that England, ever ſince the acceſſion of Canute, had enjoyed a moſt profound tranquillity, during a period of near fifty years; and it would require time for its ſoldiers, enervated by long peace, to learn diſcipline, and its generals experience. He knew, that it was entirely unprovided of fortified towns, by which it could prolong the war; but muſt venture its whole fortune in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive action againſt a veteran enemy, who, being once maſter of the field, would be in a condition to over-run the kingdom. He ſaw that Harold, tho' he had given proofs of vigor and bravery, had newly mounted a throne, which he had acquired by faction, from which he had excluded a very antient royal family, and which was likely to totter under him by its own inſtability, much more if ſhaken by any violent external impulſe. And he hoped, that the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his croſſing the ſeas, quitting his own country, and leaving himſelf no hopes of retreat; as it would aſtoniſh the enemy by the boldneſs of the enterprize, would inſpirit his ſoldiers from deſpair, and rouze them to ſuſtain the reputation of the Norman arms.</p>
               <p>THE Normans, as they had long been diſtinguiſhed by valour among all the European nations, had at this time attained to the higheſt pitch of military renown and glory. Beſides acquiring by arms ſuch a noble territory in France,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0162900301:137"/>
beſides defending it againſt continual attempts of the French monarch and all its neighbours, beſides exerting many actions of vigor under their preſent ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; they had, about this very time, revived their antient fame, by the moſt hazardous exploits, and the moſt wonderful ſucceſſes, in the other extremity of Europe. A few Norman adventurers in Italy had acquired ſuch an aſcendant, not only over the Italians and Greeks, but the Germans, and Saracens, that they expelled theſe foreigners, procured to themſelves ample eſtabliſhments, and laid the foundation of the opulent kingdom of Naples and Sicily<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 30.</note>. Theſe enterprizes of men, who were all of them vaſſals in Normandy, many of them baniſhed for faction and rebellion, excited the ambition of the haughty William; who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, after ſuch examples of fortune and valour, to be deterred from making an attack on a neighbouring country, where he could be ſupported by the whole force of his principality.</p>
               <p>THE ſituation alſo of Europe inſpired William with hopes, that, beſides his brave Normans, he might employ againſt England the flower of the military force, which was diſperſed in all the other ſtates. France, Germany, and the low countries, by the progreſs of the feudal inſtitutions, were divided and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into many ſmall principalities and baronies; and the poſſeſſors, enjoying the civil juriſdiction within themſelves, as well as the right of arms, acted, in many reſpects, as independant ſovereigns, and maintained their properties and privileges, leſs by the authority of laws, than by their own force and valour. A military ſpirit had univerſally diffuſed itſelf throughout Europe; and the ſeveral leaders, whoſe minds were elevated by their princely ſituation, greedily embraced the moſt adventurous enterprizes, and being accuſtomed to nothing from their infancy but recitals of the ſucceſs attending wars and battles, they were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate thoſe adventures, which they heard ſo much celebrated, and which were ſo much exaggerated by the credulity of the age. United, however looſely, by their duty to one ſuperior lord, and by their connexions with the great body of the community, to which they belonged, they deſired to ſpread their fame each beyond his own diſtrict; and, in all aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, whether inſtituted for civil deliberations, for military expeditions, or merely for ſhow and entertainment, to outſhine each other by the reputation of ſtrength and proweſs. Hence their genius for chivalry; hence their impatience of peace and tranquillity; and hence their readineſs to embark in any hazardous enterprize, however little intereſted in its failure or ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM, by his power, his courage, and his abilities, had long maintained a pre-eminence among thoſe haughty chieftains; and every one who deſired to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0162900301:138"/>
diſtinguiſh himſelf by his addreſs in military exerciſes, or his valor in action, had been ambitions of acquiring a reputation in the court and in the armies of Normandy. Entertained with that hoſpitality and courteſy, which diſtinguiſhed the age, they had formed attachments with the prince, and greedily attended to the proſpects of glory and advantage, which he promiſed them in return for their concurrence in an expedition againſt England. The more grandeur appeared in the attempt, the more it ſuited their romantic ſpirit: The fame of the intended invaſion was already diffuſed every where: Multitudes crowded to tender to the duke their ſervice, with that of their vaſſals and retainers<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Pictavenſis, p. 198.</note>: And William found leſs difficulty in compleating his levies, than in chooſing the moſt veteran and experienced forces, and in rejecting the offers of thoſe, who were impatient to acquire fame under ſo renowned a leader.</p>
               <p>BESIDES theſe advantages, which William owed to his perſonal valor and good conduct; he was beholden to fortune for procuring him ſome aſſiſtances, and for removing many obſtacles, which it was natural for him to expect in an undertaking, where all his neighbours were ſo deeply intereſted. Conan, duke of Britanny, was his mortal enemy; and in order to throw a damp upon his enterprize, he choſe this conjuncture for reviving his claim to Normandy itſelf; and he required, that, in caſe of William's ſucceſs againſt England, the poſſeſſion of that dutchy might devolve to him<note n="†" place="bottom">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 33.</note>. But Conan died ſuddenly after making this demand; and Howel, his ſucceſſor, inſtead of adopting the malignity, or rather the prudence, of his predeceſſor, zealouſly ſeconded the duke's views, and ſent his eldeſt ſon, Alain Fergant, to ſerve under him with a force of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Britons. The counts of Anjou, and of Flanders, encouraged their ſubjects to ergage in the expedition; and even the court of France, tho' it might juſtly fear the aggrandizement of ſo dangerous a vaſſal, purſued not its intereſts on this occaſion with ſufficient vigor and reſolution. Philip I. the reigning French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, was a minor; and William, having communicated his project to the council, having deſired aſſiſtance, and offered to do homage, in caſe of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, for the crown of England, was indeed ordered to lay aſide all thoughts of the enterprize; but the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law, being at the head of the regency, favoured under-hand his levies, and encouraged the enterprizing nobility to inliſt under the ſtandard of the duke of Normandy.</p>
               <p>THE Emperor, Henry IV. beſides giving openly all his vaſſals permiſſion to embark in this expedition, which ſo much engaged the attention of Europe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his protection to the dutchy of Normandy during the abſence of the prince,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0162900301:139"/>
and thereby enabled him to draw his whole force to the attack of England<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Pict. p. 198.</note>. But the moſt important ally, whom William gained by his negotiations, was the pope, who had a mighty influence over the antient barons, no leſs devout in their religious principles than valorous in their military enterprizes. The Roman pontiff, after an inſenſible progreſs during ſeveral ages of darkneſs and ignorance, began now to lift his head openly above all the princes of Europe; to aſſume the office of a mediator, or even an arbitrator, in the quarrels of the greateſt monarchs; to interpoſe himſelf in all ſecular affairs; and to obtrude his dictates as ſovereign laws on his obſequious diſciples. It was a ſufficient motive to Alexander II. the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pope, for embracing William's quarrel, that he alone had made an appeal to his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the diſpute between him and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold; but there were other advantages, which, that pontiff foreſaw, muſt reſult from the conqueſt of England by the Norman arms. That kingdom, tho' at firſt converted by Romiſh miſſionaries, tho' it had afterwards advanced ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſteps towards ſubjection under Rome, maintained ſtill a great independance in its eccleſiaſtical adminiſtration; and forming a world within itſelf, entirely ſeparated from the reſt of Europe, it had hitherto proved inacceſſible to thoſe exorbitant claims, which ſupported the grandeur of the papacy. Alexander, therefore, hoped, that the French and Norman barons, if ſucceſsful in their enterprize, might import into that country a more devoted reverence to the holy ſee, and bring the Engliſh churches to a nearer conformity with thoſe of the reſt of Europe. He declared immediately in favour of William's claim<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 100. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285. Brompton, p. 958.</note>; pronounced Harold a perjured uſurper; denounced excommunication againſt him and his adherents; and the more to encourage the duke of Normandy in his enterprize, he ſent him a conſecrated banner, and a ring with one of St. Peter's hairs in it<note n="‡" place="bottom">Baker, p. 22. edit. 1684.</note>. Thus were all the ambition and violence of that invaſion covered over ſafely with the broad mantle of religion.</p>
               <p>BUT the greateſt difficulty, which William had to encounter in his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aroſe from his own ſubjects in Normandy. The ſtates of the dutchy were aſſembled at Liſlebonne; and ſupplies being demanded for the intended enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, which promiſed ſo much glory and advantage to their country, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a reluctance in many members, both to grant ſums ſo much beyond the common meaſure of taxes in that age, and to ſet a precedent of performing their military ſervice out of their own country. The duke finding it dangerous to ſolicit them in a body, conferred ſeparately with the richeſt perſons in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0162900301:140"/>
and beginning with thoſe whoſe affections he moſt relied on, he gradually engaged all of them to advance the ſums demanded. The count of Longueville ſeconded him in this negotiation, the count of Mortaigne, Odo biſhop of Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux, and eſpecially William Fitz-Oſberne, count of Breteüil, and conſtable of the dutchy. Every perſon, when he himſelf was once engaged, endeavoured to bring over others; and at laſt the ſtates themſelves, after ſtipulating that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould be no precedent for the future, voted, that they would aſſiſt their prince to the utmoſt in his intended enterprize<note n="*" place="bottom">Camden. Introd. ad Britann. p. 212. 2d edit. Gibſ. Verſtegan, p. 173.</note>.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM had now aſſumbled a fleet of 3000 veſſels, great and ſmall<note n="†" place="bottom">Gul Gemet lib 7. cap. 34.</note>, and had ſelected an army of 60,000 men from among thoſe numerous ſupplies, which from every quarter ſolicited to be received into his ſervice.

HAROLD, informed of this misfortune, haſtened with an army to the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people; and expreſſ d the utmoſt ardour to ſhow himſelf worthy of the crown, which had been conferred upon him. This prince, tho' he was not ſenſible of the full extent of his danger, from the great combination againſt him, had employed every art of popularity to acquire the affections of the public; and he gave ſo many proofs of an equitable and prudent adminiſtration, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh found no reaſon to repent of the choice which they had made of a ſovereign<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

Even the Daniſh fleet fell into the hands of Harold; who had the generoſity to give prince Olave, the ſon of Halfager, his liberty, and allow him to depart with twenty veſſels<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 448.

But he had ſcarce time to rejoice for this vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, when he received intelligence, that the duke of Normandy was landed with a great army in the ſouth of England.</p>
               <p>THE Norman fleet and army had been aſſembled, early in the ſummer, at the mouth of the ſmall river Dive, and all the troops had been inſtantly embarked; but the winds proved long contrary, and detained them in that harbour<note n="‖" place="bottom">Order.

The authority, however, of the duke, the good diſcipline maintained among the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſoldiers, and the great care of ſupplying them with proviſions, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented any diſorder, when the wind became favourable, and enabled them to ſail along the coaſt, till they reached St. Valori. There were, however, ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels loſt in this ſhort paſſage; and as the winds again proved contrary, the army began to imagine, that heaven had declared againſt them, and that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope's benediction, they were deſtined to certain ruin<note n="§" place="bottom">W.

Theſe bold warriors, who deſpiſed real dangers, were very ſubject to the dread of imaginary ones; and many of them began to mutiny, and ſome of them even to deſert their colours; when the duke, in order to ſupport their drooping hopes, ordered a proceſſion to be made with the reliques of St. Valori<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Higden, p. 285.

The winds inſtantly changed; and as this incident happened on the eve of the feaſt of St. Michael, the tutelar ſaint of Normandy,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0162900301:142"/>
the forces, fancying they ſaw the hand of heaven in all theſe concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſet out with the greateſt alacrity<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 100.</note>: They met with no oppoſition on their voyage: A great fleet, which Harold had aſſembled, and which had cruized all ſummer off the Iſle of Wight, had been diſmiſſed, on his receiving falſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that William, diſcouraged by the contrary winds and other accidents, had laid aſide his preparations<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden. p. 448. Sim. Dun. p. 194. Diceto, p. 479.</note>. The Norman armament, proceeding in great order, arrived, without any material loſs, at Pevenſey in Suſſex; and the army quietly diſembarked. The duke himſelf, as he leaped on ſhore, happened to ſtumble and fall; but had the preſence of mind to turn the omen to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by calling aloud, that he had taken poſſeſſion of the country<note n="‡" place="bottom">Baker, p. 22.</note>. And a ſoldier, running to a neighbouring cottage, plucked ſome thatch, which, as if giving him ſeizine of the kingdom, he preſented to his general. The joy and alacrity of William and his whole army was ſo great, that they were no wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, even when they heard of Harold's great victory over the Danes; and they ſeemed rather to wait with impatience for the arrival of the enemy<note n="‖" place="bottom">Gul. Pict. p. 199.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE victory of Harold, tho' great and honourable, had proved in the main prejudicial to his intereſts, and may be regarded as the immediate cauſe of his ruin. He loſt many of his braveſt officers and ſoldiers in the action; and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted the reſt, by refuſing to diſtribute the Daniſh ſpoils among them<note n="§" place="bottom">W. Walm. p. 94. Higden, p. 285.</note>: A conduct which was little agreeable to his uſual generoſity of temper; but which his deſire of ſparing the people, in the war which impended over him from the duke of Normandy, had probably occaſioned. He haſtened by quick marches to reach this new invader; but tho' he was reinforced at London and other places with freſh troops, he found himſelf alſo weakened by the deſertion of his old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who from fatigue and diſcontent ſecretly withdrew from their colours. His brother Gurth, a man of bravery and conduct, began to entertain apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the event; and remonſtrated with the King, that it would be better po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to prolong the war, or, at leaſt, to ſpare his own perſon in the action. He urged to him, that the deſperate ſituation of the duke of Normandy made it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for that prince to bring matters to a ſpeedy deciſion, and put his whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on the iſſue of a battle; but that the King of England, in his own country, beloved by his ſubjects, provided of every ſupply, had more infallible and leſs dangerous methods of enſuring to himſelf the victory: That the Norman troops, elevated on the one hand with the higheſt hopes, and ſeeing, on the other, no reſource in caſe of a diſcomfiture, would fight to the laſt extremity; and being the flower of all the warriors of the continent, muſt be regarded as formidable to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0162900301:143"/>
the Engliſh: That if their firſt fire and ſpirit, which is always moſt dangerous, were allowed to languiſh for want of action; if they were haraſſed with ſmall ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, ſtraitened in proviſions, and fatigued with the bad weather and deep roads during the winter-ſeaſon, which was approaching, they muſt fall an eaſy and a bloodleſs prey to their enemy: That if a general action was delayed, the Engliſh, ſenſible of the imminent danger, to which their properties, as well as liberties, were expoſed from theſe rapacious invaders, would haſten from all quarters to his aſſiſtance, and would render his army invincible: That at leaſt, if he thought it neceſſary to hazard a battle, he ought not to expoſe his own perſon; but reſerve, in caſe of diſaſtrous accidents, ſome reſource to the liberty and independance of the kingdom: And that having once been ſo unfortunate, as to be conſtrained to ſwear, and that upon the holy reliques, to ſupport the pretenſions of the duke of Normandy, it were better that another perſon ſhould command the army, who, not being bound by theſe ſacred ties, might give the ſoldiers more certain hopes of a proſperous iſſue to the quarrel<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

               <p>HAROLD was deaf to all theſe remonſtrances; and being elated with his paſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, as well as ſtimulated by his native courage, he reſolved to give battle in perſon; and for that purpoſe, he drew near to the Normans, who had removed their camp and fleet to Haſtings, where they fixed their quarters. He was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of ſucceſs, that he ſent a meſſage to the duke, promiſing him a ſum of money, if he would depart the kingdom without effuſion of blood: But his offer was rejected with diſdain; and William, not to be behind with his enemy in vaunting, ſent him a meſſage by ſome monks, requiring him either to reſign the kingdom, or to hold it of him in fealty, or to ſubmit their cauſe to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Pope, or to fight him in ſingle combat<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

He repreſented to them, that the event which they and he had long wiſhed for, was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the whole fortune of the war now depended on their ſword, and would

               <p>HAROLD had ſeized the advantage of a riſing ground, and having beſides crawn ſome trenches to ſecure his flanks, reſolved to ſtand upon the defenſive, and to avoid all action with the cavalry, in which he was inferior<note n="‖" place="bottom">Gul.

William gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that at once the infantry ſhould face about upon their purſuers, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry make an aſſault upon their wings, and both of them purſue the advantage, which the ſurpriſe and terror of the enemy muſt give them in that critical and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive moment.

            </argument>
            <p>THE government of the Germans, and that of all the northern nations who eſtabliſhed themſelves on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free; and thoſe fierce people, accuſtomed to independance and enured to arms, were more guided by perſuaſion than authority, in the ſubmiſſion which they paid their princes. The military deſpotiſm, which had taken place in the Roman empire, and which, previouſly to the irruption of theſe conquerors, had ſunk the genius of men, and deſtroyed every noble principle of ſcience and virtue, was unable to reſiſt the vigorous efforts of a free people; and Europe, as from a new epoch, rekindled her antient ſpirit, and ſhook off the baſe ſervitude to arbitrary will and authority, under which it had ſo long laboured. The free conſtitutions then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, however impaired by the encroachments of ſucceeding princes, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an air of independance and legal adminiſtration, which diſtinguiſh the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations; and if that part of the globe maintain ſentiments of liberty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, equity, and valour, ſuperior to the reſt of mankind, it owes theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages chiefly to the ſeeds implanted by thoſe generous barbarians.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Saxon government.</note> THE Saxons, who ſubdued Britain, as they enjoyed great liberty in their own country, obſtinately retained that invaluable poſſeſſion in their new ſettlement; and they imported into this iſland the ſame principles of independance, which they had inherited from their anceſtors. The chieftains (for ſuch they were more properly than kings or princes) who commanded them in thoſe military expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtill poſſeſſed a very limited authority; and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than ſubdued, the antient inhabitants, they were indeed tranſplanted into a new territory, but preſerved unaltered all their civil and military inſtitutions. The language was pure Saxon; even the names of places, which often remain while the tongue entirely changes, were almoſt all affixed by the new conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; the manners and cuſtoms were wholly German; and the ſame picture of a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0162900301:148"/>
fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the maſterly pencil of Tacitus, will apply to theſe founders of the Engliſh government. The King, ſo far from being entitled to an arbitrary power, was only conſidered as the firſt among the citizens; his authority depended more on his perſonal qualities than on his ſtation; he was even ſo far on a level with the other inhabitants, that a ſtated price was affixed to his head, and a legal fine was levied from his murderer, which, tho' proportioned to his ſtation, and ſuperior to that paid for the life of a ſubject, was a ſenſible mark of his ſubordination to the community.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Succeſſion of the Kings.</note> IT is eaſy to imagine, that an independant people, ſo little reſtrained by laws, and cultivated by ſcience, would not be very ſtrict in maintaining a regular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of their princes. Tho' they paid a great reſpect to the royal family, and aſcribed to them an undiſputed ſuperiority, they either had no rule, or none that was ſteadily obſerved, in filling the vacant throne; and preſent convenience in that emergency was more attended to than general principles. We are not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſuppoſe, that the crown was conſidered as altogether elective; and that a regular plan was traced by the conſtitution for ſupplying, by the ſuffrages of the people, every vacancy made by the deceaſe of the firſt magiſtrate. If any King on his death left a ſon of an age and capacity fit for government, the young prince naturally ſtepped into the throne: If he was a minor, his uncle, or the next prince of the blood, was promoted to the government, and left the ſceptre to his poſterity: Any ſovereign, by taking previous meaſures with the leading men, had it greatly in his power to appoint his ſucceſſor: All theſe changes, and indeed the ordinary adminiſtration of government, required the expreſs concurrence, or at leaſt the tacit conſent of the people; but preſent poſſeſſion, however obtained, went far towards procuring their obedience, and the idea of any right which was once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is ſo much the caſe in all barbarous monarchies, and occurs ſo often in the hiſtory of the Anglo Saxons, that we cannot conſiſtently entertain any other notion of their government. The idea of an hereditary ſucceſſion in authority is ſo natural to men, and is ſo much fortified by the uſual rule in tranſmitting private poſſeſſions, that it muſt retain a great influence on every ſociety, who do not exclude it by the refinements of a republican conſtitution. But as there is a ſenſible difference between government and private poſſeſſions, and every one is not equally qualified for the one as for the other, a people, who are not ſenſible of the general advantages attending a fixed rule, are apt to make great leaps in the ſucceſſion, and frequently to paſs over the perſon, who, had he poſſeſſed the requiſite years and abilities, would have been thought entitled to the authority. Thus, theſe monarchies are not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, either elective or hereditary; and tho' the deſtination of a prince may
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0162900301:149"/>
often be followed in appointing his ſucceſſor, they can as little be regarded as wholly teſtamentary.

               <note place="margin">The Wittena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemot.</note> IT is confeſſed, that our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon hiſtory and antiquities is too imperfect to afford us means of determining with certainty all the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the crown and privileges of the people, or of giving an exact delineation of that government. It is probable alſo, that the conſtitution might be ſomewhat different in the different nations of the Heptarchy, and that it changed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably during the courſe of ſix centuries, which elapſed from the firſt invaſion of the Saxons till the Norman conqueſt<note n="*" place="bottom">We know of one change, not inconſiderable in the Saxon conſtitution. The Saxon annals, p. 49. inform us, that it is the prerogative of the King to name the dukes, earls, alderman and ſheriffs of the counties. Affer, a contemporary writer, informs us, that Alfred depoſed all the ignorant aldermen, and appointed men of more capacity in their place: Yet the laws of Edward the Confeſſor § 35. ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the ſheriffs, were choſen by the freeholders in the folkmote, a county court, which was aſſembled once a year, and where all the freeholders ſwore allegiance to the King.</note>. But moſt of theſe differences and changes, with their cauſes and effects, are unknown to us: It only appears, that, at all times, and in all the kingdoms, there was a national council, called a Wittenagemot or aſſembly of the wiſe men, (for that is the import of the term) whoſe conſent was requiſite for the enacting laws, and for ratifying the chief acts of public ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. The preambles to all the laws of Ethelbert, Ina, Alfred, Edward the elder, Athelſtan, Edmond, Edgar, Ethelred, and Edward the Confeſſor; even thoſe to the laws of Canute, tho' a kind of conqueror, put this matter beyond controverſy, and carry proofs every where of a limited and legal government. But who were the conſtituent members of this Wittenagemot has not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with certainty by antiquarians. It is agreed, that the biſhops and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots <note n="†" place="bottom">Sometimes abbeſſes were admitted; at leaſt, they often ſign the King's charters of grants. Spellm.

Conc. p. 406) which has ſtumbled ſome antiquarians, and has made them imagine that an earl was ſuperior to an alderman. The weregild or the price of an earl's blood is there fixed at 15,000 thrimſas, equal to that of an archbiſhop; whereas that of a biſhop and alderman is only 8000 thrimſas. To ſolve this difficulty we muſt have recourſe to Selden's conjecture, (ſee his Titles of Honour, chap. 5. p. 603, 604) that the term of earl was in the age of Athelſtan juſt beginning to be of uſe in England, and ſtood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of Canute, § 55. where an atheling and an archbiſhop are put upon the ſame footing. In another law of the ſame Athelſtan the weregild of the prince or atheling is ſaid to be 15,000 thrimſas. See Wilkins, p. 71. He is therefore the ſame who is called earl in the former law.</note>, were admitted into this council, and gave their conſent to the public ſtatutes. But beſides the prelates and alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there is alſo mention of the wites or wiſe-men, as a diſtinct branch of the Wittenagemot; but who <hi>theſe</hi> were is not ſo clearly aſcertained by the laws or the hiſtory of that period. The matter would probably be of difficult diſcuſſion, even were it examined impart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ally; but as our parties have choſen to divide on this head, the queſtion has been diſputed with the greater acrimony, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both ſides have become, on that account, the more captious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. Our monarchical faction maintain, that theſe <hi>wites</hi> or <hi>ſapientes</hi> were the judges or men learned in the law: The popular party aſſert them to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the boroughs, or what we now call the commons.</p>
            <p>THE expreſſions, employed by all the antient hiſtorians in mentioning the Wittenagemot, ſeem to contradict the latter ſuppoſition. The members are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always called the <hi>principes, ſatrapae, optimates, magnates, proceres;</hi> terms which ſeem to ſuppoſe an ariſtocracy, and to exclude the commons. The boroughs alſo, from the low ſtate of commerce, were ſo ſmall and poor, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants lived in ſuch dependance on the great men<note n="†" place="bottom">Brady's treatiſe of Engliſh boroughs, p. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</note>, that it ſeems nowiſe probable they would be admitted as a part of the national councils. The commons are well known to have had no ſhare in the governments eſtabliſhed by the Franks, Burgundians, and other northern nations; and we may conclude, that the Saxons, who remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than theſe tribes, would never think of conferring ſuch an extraordinary privilege on trade and induſtry. The military profeſſion alone was honourable among all thoſe conquerors: The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors ſubſiſted by their poſſeſſions in land: They became conſiderable by their influence over their vaſſals, retainers, tenants, and ſlaves: And it had need of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0162900301:151"/>
ſtrong proofs to convince us that they would admit any of a rank ſo much inferior as the burgeſſes, to ſhare with them in the legiſlative authority. Tacitus indeed affirms, that, among the antient Germans, the conſent of all the members of the community was required in every important deliberation; but he ſpeaks not of repreſentatives; and this antient practice, mentioned by the Roman hiſtorians, could only have place in ſmall tribes, where every citizen might without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience be aſſembled upon any extraordinary emergency. After principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities became more extenſive; after the differences of property had formed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions more important than thoſe ariſing from perſonal ſtrength and valor; we may conclude, that the national aſſemblies muſt have been more limited in their number, and compoſed only of the more conſiderable citizens.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' we muſt exclude the burgeſſes or commons from the Saxon Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinagemot; there is ſome neceſſity for ſuppoſing, that this aſſembly conſiſted of other members beſide the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the judges or privy council. For as all theſe, excepting ſome of the eccleſiaſtics<note n="*" place="bottom">There is ſome reaſon to think, that the biſhops were ſometimes choſen by the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the King. Eddius, cap. 2. The abbots in the monaſteries of the royal foundation were antiently named by the King; tho' Edgar gave the monks the election, and only reſerved to himſelf the ratification. This deſtination was afterwards frequently violated; and the abbots as well as biſhops were afterwards all appointed by the court; as we learn from Ingulf, a writer contemporary to the conqueſt.</note>, were antiently appointed by the King, had there been no other legiſlative authority, the royal power had been in a great meaſure deſpotic, contrary to the tenor of all the hiſtorians, and to the practice of all the northern nations. We may, therefore, conclude, that the more conſiderable proprietors of land were, without any election, conſtituent mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the national aſſembly; and there is reaſon to think, that forty hides, or about four or five thouſand acres, was the eſtate requiſite for intitling the poſſeſſor to this honourable privilege. There is a paſſage of an antient author <note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. Elienſis, cap. 36. 40.

Nor need we imagine, that the public council would become diſorderly or confuſed by admitting ſo great a multitude. The landed property of England was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in few hands during the Saxon times; at leaſt, during the latter part of that period: And as men had ſmall ambition of attending theſe public councils, there was no danger of the aſſembly's becoming too numerous for the diſpatch of the little buſineſs, which was brought before them.</p>

               </note> IT is certain, that, whatever we may determine concerning the conſtituent members of the Wittenagemot, in whom the legiſlature reſided, the Anglo-Saxon government, in the period preceding the Norman conqueſt, was become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ariſtocratical: The royal authority was very limited; the people, even if admitted to that aſſembly, were of little or no weight or conſideration. We have hints given us in the hiſtorians of the great power and riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but happen, after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the King lived at a diſtance from the provinces, that theſe great proprietors, who reſided on their eſtates, would much augment their authority over their vaſſals and retainers, and over all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence the immeaſurable power aſſumed by Harold, Godwin, Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Edric and Alfric, who controlled the authority of the kings, and rendered themſelves quite neceſſary in the government. The two latter, tho' deteſted by the people, on account of their joining a foreign enemy, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their power and influence; and we may therefore conclude, that their authority was founded, not on popularity, but on family rights and poſſeſſions. There is one Atheſtan, mentioned in the reign of the king of that name, who is called alderman of all England, and is ſaid to be half-king; tho' the monarch himſelf was a prince of great valour and ability<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt Rameſ § 3. p. 387.</note>.

            <p>THE circumſtances, attending the invaſions of the Danes, would alſo ſerve much to increaſe the power of the principal nobility. Theſe freebooters made unexpected inroads on all quarters; and there was a neceſſity, that each county ſhould reſiſt them by its own force, and under the conduct of its own magiſtrates, and nobility. For the ſame reaſon, that a general war, managed by the united efforts of the whole ſtate, commonly increaſes the power of the crown; theſe private wars and inroads turned to the advantage of the aldermen and nobles.</p>
            <p>AMONG that military and turbulent people, ſo averſe to commerce and the arts, ſo little enured to induſtry, juſtice was commonly very ill executed, and great oppreſſion and violence ſeem to have prevailed. Theſe diſorders would be increaſed by the exorbitant power of the ariſtocracy; and would, in their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0162900301:153"/>
turn, contribute to increaſe it. Men, not daring to rely on the guardianſhip of the laws, were obliged to devote themſelves to the ſervice of ſome chieftain, whoſe orders they followed even to the diſturbance of the government or the injury of their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them in return protection from any inſult or injuſtice by ſtrangers. Hence we find, by the extracts which Dr. Brady has given us from Domeſday, that almoſt all the inhabitants even of boroughs, had placed themſelves in the clientſhip of ſome particular nobleman, whoſe patronage they purchaſed by annual payments, and whom they were obliged to conſider as their ſovereign, more than the King himſelf, or even the legiſlature<note n="*" place="bottom">Brady's Treatiſe of Boroughs, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. The caſe was the ſame with the freemen in the country. See pref. to his hiſt. p. 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</note>. A client, tho' a freeman, was ſuppoſed ſo much to belong to his patron, that his murderer was obliged by law to pay a fine to the latter, as a compenſation for his loſs; in like manner as he paid a fine to the maſter for the murder of his ſlave<note n="†" place="bottom">LL. Edw. Conf. § 8. apud Ingulf.</note>. Men, who were of a more conſiderable rank, but not powerful enough, each to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf by his own independent authority, entered into formal confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies together, and compoſed a kind of ſeparate republic, which rendered itſelf formidable to all aggreſſors. Dr. Hickes has preſerved a very curious Saxon bond of this kind, which he calls a <hi>Sodalitium,</hi> and which contains many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, characteriſtical of the manners and cuſtoms of the times<note n="‡" place="bottom">Diſſert.

                  </gap>.</note>. The aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates are there ſaid to be all of them gentlemen of Cambridgeſhire; and they ſwear before the holy reliques to obſerve their confederacy, and to be faithful to each other: They promiſe to bury any of the aſſociates who dies, in whatever place he had appointed; to contribute to his funeral charges, and to attend at his interment; and whoever is wanting to this laſt duty, binds himſelf to pay a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of honey. When any of the aſſociates is in danger, and calls for the aſſiſtance of his fellows, they promiſe, beſides flying to his ſuccour, to give information to the ſheriff; and if he be negligent in protecting the perſon expoſed to hazard, they engage to levy a fine of one pound from him: If the preſident of the ſociety himſelf be wanting in this particular, he binds himſelf to pay one pound; unleſs he has the reaſonable excuſe of ſickneſs, or of duty to his ſuperior. When any of the aſſociates is murdered, they are to exact eight pounds from the murderer; and if he refuſes to pay it, they are to proſecute him for the ſum at their joint expence. If any of the aſſociates, who happens to be poor, kills a man, the ſociety are to contribute by a certain proportion to pay his fine: A mark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, if the fine be 700 ſhillings; leſs, if the perſon killed be a clown or ceorle; the half of that ſum, again, if he be a Welſhman. But where any of the aſſociates
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0162900301:154"/>
kills a man, wilfully and without provocation, he muſt himſelf pay the fine. If any of the aſſociates kills a fellow, in a like criminal manner, beſides paying the uſual fine to the relations of the deceaſed, he muſt pay eight pounds to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or renounce the benefit of it: In which caſe they bind themſelves, under the penalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with him, except in the preſence of the King, biſhop, or alderman. There are other regulations to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſervants from all injuries, to revenge ſuch as are committed, and to prevent their giving abuſive language to each other, and the fine, which they engage to pay for that offence, is a meaſure of honey.</p>
            <p>IT is not to be doubted, but a confederacy of this kind muſt have been a great ſource of friendſhip and attachment, when men lived in perpetual danger from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, robbers, and oppreſſors, and received protection chiefly from their perſonal valor, and from the aſſiſtance of their friends or patrons. As animoſities were then more violent, connexions were alſo more intimate, whether voluntary or derived from blood: The moſt remote degree of propinquity was regarded: An inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible memory of benefits was preſerved: Severe vengeance was taken of injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the beſt means of future ſecurity: And the civil union being weak, many private confederacies were entered into to ſupply its place, and to procure men that ſafety, which the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to inſure them.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, notwithſtanding the ſeeming liberty or rather licentiouſneſs of the Anglo-Saxons, the great body of the people, in theſe ages, really enjoyed much leſs true liberty, than where the execution of the laws is the moſt ſevere, and where ſubjects are reduced to the ſtricteſt ſubordination and dependance on the civil magiſtrate. The reaſon is derived from the exceſs itſelf of that liberty. Men muſt guard themſelves at any price againſt inſults and injuries; and where they receive not protection from the laws and magiſtrate, they will ſeek it by ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuperiors, and by herding in ſome inferior confederacy, which acts under the direction of a powerful chieftain. And thus all anarchy is the immediate cauſe of tyranny, if not over the ſtate, at leaſt over many of the individuals.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſeveral orders of men.</note> THE German Saxons, as the other nations of that continent, were divided into three ranks of men, the noble, the free, and the ſlaves<note n="†" place="bottom">Nithard. hiſt. lib. 4.</note>. This diſtinction they brought over with them into Britain.</p>
            <p>THE nobles were called thanes; and were of two kinds, the King's thanes and leſſer thanes. The latter ſeem to have been dependant on the former; and to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0162900301:155"/>
have received lands, for which they paid rent, ſervices, or attendance in peace and war<note n="*" place="bottom">Spelm. Feuds and Tenures, p. 40.</note>. We know of no other title, which raiſed any one to the rank of thane, except noble birth and the poſſeſſion of land. The former was always much regarded by all the German nations even in their moſt barbarous ſtate; and as the Saxon nobility had few expenſive pleaſures to diſſipate their fortune, and the commons little trade or induſtry by which they could accumulate riches, theſe two ranks of men, even tho' they were not ſeparated by poſitive laws, might remain long diſtinct, and the noble families continue many ages in opulence and ſplendor. There were no middle rank of men, who could mix gradually with their ſuperiors, and procure to themſelves inſenſibly honour and diſtinction. If by any extraordinary accident, a mean perſon acquired riches, a circumſtance ſo ſingular made him be known and remarked; he became the object of envy, as well as indignation, to all the nobles; he would have great difficulty to defend what he had acquired; and he would find it impoſſible to protect himſelf from oppreſſion, except by courting the patronage of ſome great chieftain, and paying a large price for his ſafety.</p>
            <p>There are two ſtatutes among the Saxon laws, which ſeem calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found theſe different ranks of men; that of Athelſtan, by which a merchant, who had made three long ſea voyages on his own account, was intitled to the quality of thane<note n="†" place="bottom">Wilkins, p. 71.</note>; and that of the ſame prince, by which a ceorle or huſbandman, who had been able to purchaſe five hides of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall and bell, was raiſed to the ſame diſtinction<note n="‡" place="bottom">Selden Titles of Honour, p. 515. Wilkins, p. 70.</note>. But the opportunities were ſo few, by which a merchant or ceorle could thus exalt himſelf above his rank, that the law could never overcome the reigning prejudices; the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween noble and baſe blood would ſtill be indelible; and the well-born thanes would entertain the higheſt contempt for thoſe legal and factitious ones. Tho' we are not informed of any of theſe circumſtances by antient hiſtorians, they are ſo much founded on the nature of things, that we may admit them as a neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible conſequence of the ſituation of the Kingdom during thoſe ages.</p>
            <p>THE cities appear by Domeſday-book to have been at the conqueſt little better than villages<note n="‖" place="bottom">Wincheſter, being the capital of the Weſt-Saxon monarchy, was antiently a conſiderable city.

There were ſix wards, beſides the archbiſhop's palace; and five of theſe wards contained the number of families here mentioned, which at the rate of five perſons to a family makes about 7000 ſouls. The ſixth ward was laid waſte.</note>. Malmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury tells us<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 122. See alſo de Geſt. Angl. p. 333.</note>, that the great diſtinction between the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the French or Norman, was that the latter built magnificent and ſtately caſtles; whereas the former conſumed their immenſe fortunes on riot and hoſpitality in mean houſes. We may thence infer, that the arts in general were much leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in England than in France; a greater number of idle ſervants and retainers lived about the great families; and as theſe, even in France, were powerful enough to diſturb the execution of the laws, we may judge of the authority, acquired by the ariſtocracy in England. When earl Godwin beſieged the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in London, he ſummoned together from all parts his huſcarles, or houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coerles and retainers, and obliged his ſovereign to accept of the conditions, which he was pleaſed to impoſe upon him.</p>
            <p>THE lower rank of free-men were denominated coerles among the Anglo-Saxons; and where they were induſtrious, they were chiefly employed in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: Whence a coerle, and a huſbandman, became in a manner ſynonimous terms. They cultivated the farms of the nobility or thanes, for which they paid rent; and they ſeem to have been removeable at pleaſure. For there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leaſes among the Anglo-Saxons: The pride of the nobility, together with the general ignorance of writing, muſt have rendered theſe contracts very rare, and muſt have kept the huſbandmen in a very dependant condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in kind<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL. Inae. § 70. Theſe laws fixed the rents for a hide; but it is difficult to convert it into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern meaſures.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the moſt numerous rank by far in the community ſeems to have been the ſlaves or villains, who were the property of their lords, and were conſequently incapable, themſelves, of all property. Dr. Brady aſſures us, from a ſurvey of Domeſday-book<note n="‖" place="bottom">General preface to his hiſt. p. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</note>, that, in all the counties of England, the far greater part of the land was occupied by them, and that the huſbandmen, and ſtill more the ſocmen, who were tenants, that could not be removed at pleaſure, were very few in compariſon. This was not the caſe with the German nations, as far as we can collect from the account given us by Tacitus. The perpetual wars in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0162900301:157"/>
heptarchy, and the depredations of the Danes, ſeem to have been the cauſe of this great alteration with the Anglo-Saxons. The priſoners taken in battle, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off in the frequent inroads, were reduced to ſlavery; and became, by right of war<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Edg. § 14. apud Spellm. Conc. vol. 1. p. 471.</note>, entirely at the diſpoſal of their lords. Great property in the nobles, eſpecially if joined to an irregular adminiſtration of juſtice, naturally favours the power of the ariſtocracy; but ſtill more ſo, if the practice of ſlavery be admitted, and has become very common. The nobility not only poſſeſs the influence which always attend riches, but alſo the power which the laws give them over their ſlaves and villains. It becomes then difficult, and almoſt impoſſible, for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to remain altogether free and independant.</p>
            <p>THERE were two kinds of ſlaves among the Anglo-Saxons; houſehold ſlaves, after the manner of the antients, and praedial or ruſtic, after the manner of the Germans<note n="†" place="bottom">Spellm. Gloſſ. in verb. Servus.</note>. Theſe latter reſembled the ſerfs, which are at preſent met with in Poland, Denmark, and ſome places in Germany. The power of a maſter over his ſlaves was not unlimited among the Anglo-Saxons, as it was among their anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. If a man beat out his ſlave's eye or teeth, the ſlave recovered his liberty<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL.

               <note place="margin">Courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</note> But tho' the general ſtrain of the Anglo-Saxon government ſeems to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ariſtocratical, there were ſtill conſiderable remains of the antient democracy, which were not indeed ſufficient to protect the loweſt of the people, without the patronage of ſome great lord, but might give ſecurity, and even ſome degree of dignity, to the gentry or inferior nobility. The adminiſtration of juſtice, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, by the courts of the Decennary, the Hundred, and the County, were well calculated to defend general liberty, and to reſtrain the exorbitant power of the nobles. In the county-courts or ſhiremotes, all the freeholders were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

twice a-year, and received appeals from the other inferior courts. They there decided all cauſes, eccleſiaſtical as well as civil; and the biſhop, together with the alderman or earl, preſided over them<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Edg. § 5. Wilkins, p. 78. LL. Canut. § 17. Wilkins, p. 136.</note>. The affair was determined in a ſummary manner, without much pleading, formality, or delay, by a majority of voices; and the biſhop and alderman had no further authority than to keep order among the treeholders, and interpoſe with their opinion<note n="†" place="bottom">Hickes Diſſert. Epiſt. p 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>. Where juſtice was denied during three ſeſſions by the Hundred, and then by the County-court, there lay an appeal to the King's court<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL. Edg. § 2. Wilkins, p. 77. LL. Canut. § 18. apud Wilkins, p. 136.</note>; but this was not practiſed on ſlight occaſions. The alderman had a third of the fines levied in theſe courts<note n="‖" place="bottom">LL. Edw. Conf. § 31.</note>; and as moſt of the puniſhments were then pecuniary, this perquiſite formed a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the profits belonging to his office. The two thirds alſo, which went to the King, made no contemptible ſhare of the public revenue. Any free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder was fined who abſented himſelf thrice from theſe courts<note n="§" place="bottom">LL. Aethelſt. § 20.</note>.</p>
            <p>AS the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and writings very rare, the County or Hundred court was the place where the moſt remarkable civil tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were finiſhed, in order to preſerve a memorial of them, and prevent all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſputes. Here teſtaments were promulgated, ſlaves manumitted, bargains of ſale concluded; and ſometimes, for greater ſecurity, the moſt conſiderable of theſe deeds were inſerted in the blank leaves of the pariſh bible, which thus became a kind of regiſter, too ſacred to be falſified. It was not unuſual to add to the deed an imprecation on all ſuch as ſhould be guilty of that crime<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Hickes Diſſert. Epist.</note>.</p>
            <p>AMONG a people, who lived in ſo ſimple a manner as the Anglo-Saxons, the judicial power is always of greater importance than the legiſlative. There were few or no taxes impoſed by the ſtates: There were few ſtatutes enacted; and the nation was leſs governed by laws, than by cuſtoms, which admitted a great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of interpretation. Tho' it ſhould, therefore, be allowed, that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenagemot was altogether compoſed of the principal nobility, the county-courts, where all the freeholders were admitted, and which regulated all the daily occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of life, formed a very wide baſis for the government, and were no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible check on the ariſtocracy. But there is another power ſtill more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than either the judicial or legiſlative; and that is the power of injuring or ſerving by immediate force and violence, for which it is difficult to obtain redreſs in courts of juſtice. In all extenſive governments, where the execution of the laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of the principal nobility;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0162900301:159"/>
and the degree of it which prevails, cannot be determined ſo much by the public ſtatutes, as by ſmall ſtrokes of hiſtory, by particular cuſtoms, and ſometimes by the reaſon and nature of things. The highlands of Scotland have been long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by law to every privilege of Britiſh ſubjects; but it was not till very lately that the common people could in fact enjoy theſe privileges.</p>
            <p>THE powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon government are diſputed among hiſtorians and antiquarians; and the extreme obſcurity of the ſubject, even tho' faction had never entered into the queſtion, would naturally have begot thoſe controverſies. But the great influence of the lords over their ſlaves and tenants, the clientſhip of the burghers, the total want of a middling rank of men, the total want alſo of lawyers who did not then form a ſeparate profeſſion, the extent of the monarchy, the looſe execution of the laws, the continued diſorders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the ſtate; all theſe circumſtances evince, that the Anglo-Saxon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment became at laſt extremely ariſtocratical; and the events, during the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod immediately preceding the conqueſt, confirm this inference or conjecture.</p>

               </gap>le removed from the original ſtate of nature: The ſocial confederacy among them was more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial than civil: They had chiefly in view the means of attack or defence againſt public enemies, not thoſe of protection againſt their fellow citizens: Their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions were ſo ſlender and ſo equal, that they were not expoſed to great danger; and the natural bravery of the people made every man truſt to himſelf and to his particular friends for his defence or vengeance. This defect in the political union drew much cloſer the knot of particular conſederacies: An inſult upon any man was regarded by all his relations and aſſociates as a common injury: They were bound, by honour as well as by a ſenſe of general intereſt, to revenge his death, or any violence which he had ſuffered: They retaliated on the aggreſſor by like violences; and if he was protected, as was natural and uſual, by his own clan, the quarrel was ſpread ſtill wider, and bred endleſs diſorders in the nation.</p>
            <p>The Friſians, a tribe of the Germans, had never advanced beyond this wild and imperfect ſtate of ſociety; and the right of private revenge ſtill remained among them unlimited and uncontrouled<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Friſ. tit. 2. apud Lindenbrog. p. 491.</note>. But the other German nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one ſtep farther towards completing the political or
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0162900301:160"/>
civil union. Tho' it ſtill continued to be an indiſpenſible point of honour for every clan to revenge the death or injury of their fellow, the magiſtrate had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a right of interpoſing in the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference. He obliged the perſon maimed or injured, and the relations of one killed, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a preſent from the aggreſſor and his relations<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Aethelb. § 23. LL. Aelf. § 27.</note>, as a compenſation for the injury<note n="†" place="bottom">Called by the Saxons <hi>maegbota.</hi>
               </note>, and to drop all farther proſecution of revenge. That the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of one quarrel might not be the ſource of more, this preſent was fixed and certain, according to the rank of the perſon killed or injured, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly paid in cattle, the chief property of thoſe rude and uncultivated nations. A preſent of this kind gratified the revenge of the injured clan by the loſs which the aggreſſor ſuffered: It ſatisfied their pride by the ſubmiſſion which it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: It diminiſhed their regret for the loſs or injury of a kinſman by their acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new property: And thus general peace was for a moment reſtored to the ſociety<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tacit. de mor. Germ. The author ſays, that the price of the compoſition was fixed; which muſt have been by the laws and the interpoſition of the magiſtrate.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT when the German nations had been ſettled ſome time in the provinces of the Roman empire, they made ſtill a new ſtep towards a more cultivated life, and their criminal juſtice gradually improved and refined itſelf. The magiſtrate, whoſe office it was to guard public peace and to ſuppreſs private animoſities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf to be injured by every injury done to any of his people; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the compenſation to the perſon who ſuffered, or to his clan, he thought himſelf entitled to exact a fine, called the Fridwit, as an atonement for the breach of peace, and as a reward for the pains which he had taken in accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the quarrel. When this idea, which is ſo natural, was once ſuggeſted, it was readily received both by magiſtrate and people. The numerous fines which were levied, augmented the profits of the King: And the people were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he would be more vigilant in interpoſing with his good offices, when he reaped ſuch immediate advantage by them; and that injuries would be leſs frequent, when, beſides compenſation to the perſon injured, they were expoſed to this additional penalty<note n="‖" place="bottom">Beſides paying money to the relations of the deceaſed and to the King, the murderer was alſo obliged to pay the maſter of a ſlave or vaſſal a ſum as a compenſation for his loſs.

            <p>THIS ſhort abſtract contains the hiſtory of the criminal juriſprudence of the northern nations for ſeveral centuries. The ſtate of England in this particular, during the period of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the collection of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0162900301:161"/>
antient laws, publiſhed by Lambard and Wilkins. The chief purport of theſe laws is not to prevent or ſuppreſs entirely private quarrels, which the legiſlators knew to be impoſſible, but only to regulate and moderate them. The laws of Alfred enjoin, that if any one knows, that his enemy or aggreſſor, after doing him an injury, reſolves to keep within his own houſe <hi>and his own lands</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The addition of theſe laſt words in Italics appears neceſſary from what follows in the ſame law.</note>, he ſhall not fight him, till he require compenſation for the injury. If he be ſtrong enough to beſiege him in his houſe, he may do it for ſeven days without attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; and if the aggreſſor is willing, during that time, to ſurrender himſelf and his arms, his adverſary may detain him thirty days, but is afterwards obliged to reſtore him ſafe to his kindred, <hi>and be contented with the compenſation.</hi> If the criminal fly to the temple, that ſanctuary muſt not be violated. Where the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant has not force ſufficient to beſiege the criminal in his houſe, he muſt apply to the alderman for aſſiſtance; and if he refuſes aid, the aſſailant muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the King: And he is not allowed to aſſault the houſe, till after a refuſal of aſſiſtance from this ſupreme magiſtrate. If any one meets with his enemy, and is ignorant that he was reſolved to keep within his own lands, he muſt, before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks him, require him to ſurrender himſelf a priſoner, and deliver up his arms; in which caſe he may detain him thirty days: But if he refuſes to deliver up his arms, it is then lawful to fight him. A ſlave may fight in his maſter's quarrel: A father may fight in his ſon's with any one, except with his maſter<note n="†" place="bottom">LL. Aelfr. § 28. Wilkins, p. 43.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT was enacted by King Ina, that no man ſhould take revenge of an injury till he had firſt demanded compenſation, and had been refuſed it<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL. Inae, § 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>KING Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions the general diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, occaſioned by the multiplicity of private feuds and battles; and he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes ſeveral expedients to remedy this grievance. He ordains, that if any one murders another, he may, with the aſſiſtance of his kindred, pay within a twelve-month the fine of his crime; and if they abandon him, he ſhall alone ſuſtain the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the murdered perſon: His own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are free from the feud, but on condition that they neither converſe with the criminal, nor ſupply him with meat <hi>or other neceſſaries:</hi> If any of them, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him, receive him into their houſe, <hi>or give him aſſiſtance,</hi> they are finable to the King, and are involved in the feud. If the kindred of the murdered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon take revenge of any but the criminal himſelf, <hi>after he is abandoned by his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> all their property is forfeited, and they are declared to be enemies to the King and all his friends<note n="‖" place="bottom">LL. Edm. § 1. Wilkins, p. 73.</note>. It is alſo ordained, that the fine for murder ſhall
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0162900301:162"/>
never be remitted by the King<note n="*" place="bottom">LL Edm. § 3.</note>; and that no criminal ſhall be killed who flies to the church, or any of the King's towns<note n="†" place="bottom">LL. Edm. § 2.</note>; and the King himſelf declares, that his houſe ſhall give no protection to murderers, till they have ſatisfied the church by their penance, and the kindred of the deceaſed by making compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL. Edm. § 4.</note>. There follows the method appointed for tranſacting this compoſition<note n="‖" place="bottom">LL. Edm. § 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>THESE attempts of Edmond to contract and diminiſh the feuds, were contrary to the antient ſpirit of the northern barbarians, and were an advance towards a more regular adminiſtration of juſtice. By the Salic law, any man might, by a public declaration, exempt himſelf from his family-quarrels: But then he was conſidered by the law as no longer belonging to the family; and he was deprived of all right of ſucceſſion, as a puniſhment of his cowardice<note n="§" place="bottom">Tit. 63.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE price of the king's head, or his weregild, as it was then called, was by law 30,000 th imſas, a ſpecies of coin whoſe value is uncertain. The price of the prince's head was 15,000 thrimſas; that of a biſhop's or alderman's 8000; a ſherin's 4000; a thane's or clergyman's 2000; a ceorle's 266. Theſe prices were fixed by the laws of the Angles. By the Mercian law, the price of a ceorle's head was 200 ſhillings; that of a thane's ſix times as much; that of a King's ſix times more<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Wilkins, p. 71, 72.</note>. By the laws of Kent, the price of the archbiſhop's head was higher than that of the King's<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Elthredi, apud Wilkins, p. 110.</note>. Such reſpect was then paid to the eccleſiaſtics! It muſt be underſtood, that where a perſon was unable to pay the fine, he was put out of the protection of law, and the kindred of the deceaſed had liberty to puniſh him as they thought proper.</p>
            <p>SOME antiquarians <note n="†" place="bottom">Tyrrel Introduct. vol. 1. p. 126. Carte vol. 1. p. 366.</note> have thought, that theſe compenſations were only given for man-ſlaughter, not for wilful murder: But no ſuch diſtinction appears in the laws; and it is contradicted by the practice of all the other barbarous nations<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lindenbrogius, paſſim.</note>, by that of the antient Germans<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tac. de mor.

There is indeed a law of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred's, making wilful murder capital<note n="§" place="bottom">LL. Aelf § 12. Wilkins, p. 29.

THE price of all kinds of wounds was likewiſe fixed by the Saxon laws: An wound of an inch long under the hair was paid with one ſhilling: One of a like ſize on the face, two ſhillings: Thirty ſhillings for the loſs of an ear; and ſo forth<note n="*" place="bottom">LL Aelfr. § 40. See alſo LL. Ethelb. § 34, &amp;c.</note>. There ſeems not to have been any difference made, according to the dignity of the perſon.

            <p>THESE inſtitutions are not peculiar to the antient Germans. They ſeem to he the neceſſary progreſs of criminal juriſprudence among every free people, where the will of the ſovereign is not implicitly obeyed.

            <p>THEFT and robbery were very frequent among the Anglo Saxons.

Gangs of robbers much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the peace of the country; and the law determined, that a tribe of banditti, conſiſting of between ſeven and thirty-five perſons, was to be called a <hi>turma,</hi> or troop: Any greater company was denominated an army<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">LL.

               <note place="margin">Rules of proof.</note> IF the puniſhments of crimes among the Anglo-Saxons appear ſingular, the proofs were no leſs ſo; and were alſo the natural reſult of the ſituation of theſe people. Whatever we may imagine concerning the uſual truth and ſincerity of men, who live in a rude and barbarous ſtate, there is much more falſehood, and even perjury, among them than among civilized nations; and virtue, which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cultivated reaſon, never flouriſhes to any degree, nor is founded on ſteady principles of honour, except where a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation becomes general; and men are taught the pernicious conſequences of vice, treachery, and immorality. Even ſuperſtition, tho' more prevalent among ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant nations, is but a poor ſupply for the defects of knowledge and education; and our European anceſtors, who employed every moment the expedient of ſwearing on extraordinary croſſes and reliques, were leſs honourable in all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements than their poſterity, who from experience have omitted thoſe ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſecurities. This general proneneſs to perjury was much increaſed by the uſual want of diſcernment in judges, who could not diſcuſs an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number, not weigh, the teſtimony of the witneſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Sometimes the laws fixed eaſy general rules for weighing the credibility of witneſſes. A man whoſe life was eſtimated at 120 ſhillings counterbalanced fix ceorles, each of whoſe lives was only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at 20 ſhillings, and his oath was eſteemed equivalent to that of all the ſix. See Wilkins, p. 72.</note>. Hence the ridiculous practice of obliging men to bring compurgators, who pretended not to know any thing of the fact, but expreſſed upon oath that they believed the perſon ſpoke true; and theſe compurgators were in ſome caſes multiplied to the number of three hundred<note n="†" place="bottom">Praef.

            <p>WHEN any controverſy about a fact became too intricate for theſe ignorant judges to unravel, they had recourſe to what they called the judgment of God, that is, to fortune; and their methods for conſulting this oracle were various.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0162900301:165"/>
One of them was the deciſion by the <hi>croſs;</hi> and it was practiſed in this manner. When a perſon was accuſed of any crime, he firſt cleared himſelf by oath, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by eleven compurgators: He next took two pieces of wood, one of which was marked with the ſign of the croſs; and wrapping both up in wool, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them on the altar, or on ſome celebrated relique. After ſolemn prayers for the ſucceſs of the experiment, a prieſt, or in his ſtead ſome unexperienced youth, took up one of the pieces of wood, and if he happened upon that marked with the figure of the croſs, the perſon was pronounced innocent; if otherwiſe, guilty<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Friſon. tit. 14. apud Lindenbrogium, p. 496.</note>. This practice, as it aroſe from ſuperſtition, was aboliſhed by it in France.

            <p>THE ordeal was another eſtabliſhed method of trial among the Anglo Saxons. It was practiſed either by boiling water or red-hot iron. The water or iron was conſecrated by many prayers, maſſes, faſtings, and exorciſms<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spellm. in verb. Ordeal. Parker, p. 155. Lindenbrog. p. 1299.</note>; after which, the perſon accuſed either took up a ſtone ſunk into the water <note n="‖" place="bottom">LL. Inae, § 77.</note> to a certain depth, or carried the iron a certain diſtance; and his hand being wrapped up, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſealed for three days, if there appeared on examining it no marks of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was pronounced innocent; if otherwiſe, guilty<note n="§" place="bottom">Sometimes the perſon accuſed walked barefoot over red-hot iron.</note>. The trial by cold water was different: The perſon was thrown into conſecrated water; if he ſwam, he was guilty; if he ſunk, innocent<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Spellman in verb.

If we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the cattle in that age, from the defects of huſbandry, were not ſo large as they are at preſent in England, we may compute that money was then near ten times of greater value. A horſe was valued at about thirty-ſix ſhillings of our money, or thirty Saxon ſhillings<note n="‡" place="bottom">Wilkins, p. 126.</note>; a mare a third leſs.

Conſequently it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0162900301:168"/>
was as dear as if it now coſt ſeven pounds ten ſhillings ſterling. This much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the great famine in the end of Queen Elizabeth; when a quarter of wheat was ſold for four pounds. Money in this laſt period was nearly of the ſame value as in our time. Theſe enormous famines are a certain proof of bad huſbandry.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, there are three things to be conſidered, wherever a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is mentioned in antient times. Firſt, the change of denomination, by which a pound has been reduced to the third part of its antient weight in ſilver. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the change in value by the greater plenty of money, which has reduced the ſame weight of ſilver to ten times leſs value, compared to commodities; and conſequently, a pound ſterling to the thirtieth part of the antient value. Thirdly, the fewer people and leſs induſtry, which were then to be found in every European kingdom. This circumſtance made even the thirtieth part of the ſum more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to levy, and cauſed any ſum to have more than thirty times more weight and influence both abroad and at home, than in our times; in the ſame manner that a ſum, an hundred thouſand pounds for inſtance, is at preſent more difficult to levy in a ſmall ſtate, ſuch as Bavaria, and can operate greater effects on ſuch a ſmall community, than on England. This laſt difference is not eaſy to be calculated: But allowing, that England has now above five times more induſtry, and three times more people than it had at the conqueſt and for ſome reigns after it, we are, upon that ſuppoſition, to conceive, taking all circumſtances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, every ſum of money mentioned by hiſtorians, as if it were multiplied more than an hundred-fold above a ſum of the ſame denomination at preſent.</p>
            <p>IN the Saxon times, land was divided equally among all the male-children of the deceaſed, according to the cuſtom of Gavelkind. Entails were ſometimes practiſed in thoſe times<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Aelf. § <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>THE firſt attempt, which we find in England to ſeparate the eccleſiaſtical from the civil juriſdiction, was that law of Edgar, by which all diſputes among the clergy were ordered to be carried before the biſhop<note n="†" place="bottom">Wilkins, p 83.</note>.

               <note place="margin">Conſequences of the battle of Haſtings.</note> NOTHING could exceed the conſternation, which ſeized the Engliſh, when they received intelligence of the unfortunate battle of Haſtings, the death of their King, the ſlaughter of their principal nobility, and of their braveſt warriors, and the rout and diſperſion of the remainder. But tho' the loſs, which they had ſuſtained in that fatal action, was conſiderable, it might eaſily have been repaired by a great nation; where the people were generally armed, and where there reſided ſo many powerful noblemen in every province, who could have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their retainers, and have obliged the duke of Normandy to divide his army, and probably to waſte it in a multitude of actions and rencounters. It was thus, that the kingdom had formerly reſiſted, for many years, its invaders, and had been gradually ſubdued, by the continued efforts of the Romans, Saxons, and Danes; and equal difficulties might have been apprehended by William in this bold and hazardous enterprize. But there were ſeveral vices in the Anglo-Saxon conſtitution which rendered it difficult for the Engliſh to defend their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in ſo critical an emergency. The people had in a good meaſure loſt all national pride and ſpirit, by their recent and long ſubjection to the Danes; and as Canute had, in the courſe of his adminiſtration, much abated the rigors of conqueſt, and had governed them equitably by their own laws, they regarded with the leſs terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke, and deemed the inconveniences of ſubmiſſion leſs formidable than thoſe of bloodſhed, war, and reſiſtance. Their attachment alſo to the antient royal family had been much weakened by their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0162900301:171"/>
habitude of ſubmiſſion to the Daniſh princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their acquieſcence in his uſurpation. And as they had long been accuſtomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the only heir of the Saxon line, as unfit to govern them even in times of order and tranquillity; they could entertain ſmall hopes of his being able to repair ſuch great loſſes as they had ſuſtained, or to reſiſt the victorious arms of the duke of Normandy.</p>
            <p>THAT they might not, however, be altogether wanting to themſelves in this extreme neceſſity, the Engliſh took ſome ſteps towards adjuſting their disjointed government, and uniting themſelves againſt the common enemy. The two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who had fled to London with the remains of the broken army, took the lead on this occaſion; and in concert with Stigand, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, a man poſſeſſed of great authority, and of ample revenues, proclaimed Edgar King, and endeavoured to put the people in a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and encourage them to reſiſt the Normans<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order Vitalis, p. 502. Hoveden. p. 449. Knyghton, p. 2343.</note>. But the terror of the late defeat, and the near neighbourhood of the invaders, increaſed the confuſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from great revolutions; and every reſolution propoſed was haſty, fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating, variable; diſconcerted by fear or faction; ill planned, and worſe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>WILLIAM, that his enemies might not have leizure to recover their conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or unite their councils, immediately put himſelf in motion after his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and reſolved to proſecute an enterprize, which nothing but celerity and vigor could render finally ſucceſsful. His firſt attempt was againſt Romney, whoſe inhabitants he ſeverely puniſhed on account of their cruel treatment of ſome Norman ſeamen and ſoldiers, who had been carried thither by ſtreſs of weather or by a miſtake in their courſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Gul Pictav. p. 204.</note>: And foreſeeing that his conqueſt of England might ſtill be attended with many difficulties and with much oppoſition, he thought it neceſſary, before he ſhould advance farther into the country, to make himſelf maſter of Dover, which would both ſecure him a retreat in caſe of adverſe fortune, and afford him a ſafe landing-place for ſuch ſupplies as might be requiſite for aſſiſting him to puſh his advantages. The terror, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by his victory at Haſtings, was ſo great, that the garriſon of Dover, tho' numerous and well provided of every thing, immediately capitulated; and as the Normans, ruſhing in to take poſſeſſion of the town, haſtily ſet fire to ſome of the houſes, William, who was deſirous to conciliate the minds of the Engliſh by an appearance of lenity and juſtice, made reparation to the inhabitants for their loſſes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

THE Norman army, being much diſtreſſed with a dyſentery, was obliged to remain here for eight days; and the duke, on their recovery, advanced with quick marches towards London, and by his approach increaſed the confuſions, which were already ſo prevalent in the Engliſh councils. The eccleſiaſtics in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whoſe influence was great over the people, began to declare in his favour; and as moſt of the biſhops and dignified clergymen were even then French or Norman, the pope's bull, by which his enterprize was avowed and conſecrated, was now openly inſiſted on as a reaſon for general ſubmiſſion. The ſuperior learning of theſe prelates, by which, during the Confeſſor's reign, they had raiſed themſelves above the ignorant Saxons, made their opinions be received with implicit faith; and a young prince, like Edgar, whoſe perſonal qualities were ſo mean, was but ill qualified to reſiſt the impreſſion, which they made on the minds of the people. A repulſe, which a body of Londoners received from five hundred Norman horſe, renewed the terror of the great defeat at Haſtings<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Ord.

But tho' every thing bore the face of joy and feſtivity, and William himſelf treated his new courtiers with great appearance of kindneſs, it was impoſſible to prevent altogether the inſolence of the Normans; and the Engliſh nobles received ſmall pleaſure from thoſe entertainments, where they conſidered themſelves as led in triumph by their oſtentatious conqueror.</p>

William on the throne. The hiſtorian above-mentioned, who is a panegyriſt of his maſter, throws the blame entirely on the fickle and mutinous diſpoſition of the Engliſh, and highly celebrates the juſtice and lenity of Odo's and Fitz Oſbern's adminiſtration<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 212.</note>. But other hiſtorians, with more probability, impute the cauſe chiefly to the Normans, who, deſpiſing a people that had ſo eaſily ſubmitted to the yoke, envying their riches, and grudging the reſtraints impoſed upon their own rapine, were deſirous of provoking them to a rebellion, by which they hoped to acquire new confiſcations and forfeitures, and to ſatisfy thoſe unbounded hopes, which they had formed in entering on this enterprize<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vital. p. 507.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT is evident, that the chief reaſon of this alteration in the ſentiments of the Engliſh, muſt be aſcribed to the departure of William, who was alone capable of curbing the violence of his captains, and of overawing the mutinies of the people. Nothing indeed appears more ſtrange, than that this prince, in leſs than three months after the conqueſt of a great, warlike, and turbulent nation, ſhould abſent himſelf, in order to reviſit his own country, which remained in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found tranquillity, and was not menaced by any of its neighbours; and ſhould leave ſo long his jealous ſubjects at the mercy of an inſolent and licentious army. Were we not aſſured of the ſolidity of his genius, and the good ſenſe diſplayed in all other circumſtances of his conduct, we might aſcribe this meaſure to a vain oſtentation, which rendered him impatient to diſplay his pomp and magnificence among his antient courtiers. It is therefore more natural to believe, that in ſo extraordinary a ſtep, he was guided by a concealed policy; and that tho' he had thought proper at firſt to allure the people to ſubmiſſion by the ſemblance of a legal adminiſtration, he found, that he could neither ſatisfy his rapacious captains nor ſecure his unſtable government, without exerting farther the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſeizing the poſſeſſions of the Engliſh. In order to give a pretence for this violence, he endeavoured, without diſcovering his intention, to provoke and allure them into inſurrections, which, he thought, could never prove dangerous, while he detained all the principal nobility in Normandy, while a great and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious army was quartered in England, and while he himſelf was ſo near to ſuppreſs any tumult or rebellion. But as no antient writer has aſcribed this tyrannical purpoſe to William, it ſcarce ſeems allowable, from conjecture alone, to throw ſuch an imputation upon him.</p>

William, in order to inſure them to his intereſts, had, on his acceſſion, promiſed his daughter in marriage to Edwin; but either he had never ſeriouſly intended to perform this engagement, or having changed his plan of adminiſtration in England from clemency to rigor, he thought it was to little purpoſe, if he gained one family, while he enraged the whole nation. When Edwin, therefore, renewed his application, he gave him an abſolute refuſal<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vital. 511.</note>; and this diſappointment, added to ſo many other reaſons of diſguſt, induced that nobleman and his brother to concur with their enraged countrymen, and to make one effort for the recovery of their antient liberties. William knew the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of celerity in quelling an inſurrection, ſupported by ſuch powerful leaders, and ſo agreeable to the wiſhes of the people; and having his troops always in readineſs, he advanced by great journeys to the north. On his march, he gave orders to fortify the caſtle of Warwick, of which he left Henry de Beaumont governor, and that of Nottingham, which he committed to the cuſtody of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Peverell, another Norman captain<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. He reached York before the rebels were in any condition for reſiſtance, or were joined by any of the foreign ſuccours, which they expected, except a ſmall reinforcement from Wales<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; and the two earls found no other means of ſafety, but having recourſe to the clemency of the victor. Archil, a potent nobleman in thoſe parts, imitated their example, and de ivered his ſon as a hoſtage of his fidelity<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; nor were the people, thus deſerted by their leaders, able to make any farther reſiſtance. But the treatment, which William gave the chieftains and their followers, was very different. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved religiouſly the terms, which he had granted the former; and allowed them, for the preſent, to keep poſſeſſion of their eſtates; but he extended the rigors of his confiſcations over the latter, and gave away their lands to his foreign

Tho' the early confiſcation of Harold's followers might ſeem ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous; being extended toward men who had never ſworn fidelity to the duke of Normandy, who were ignorant of his pretenſions, and who only fought in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the government, which they themſelves had eſtabliſhed in their own country: Yet were theſe rigors, however contrary to the antient Saxon laws, excuſed on account of the urgent neceſſities of the prince; and thoſe who were not involved in the preſent ruin, hoped that they would thenceforth enjoy without moleſtation their poſſeſſions and their dignities. But the ſucceſſive deſtruction of ſo many other families convinced them, that the King intended to rely entirely on the ſupport and affections of foreigners; and they foreſaw new forfeitures, attainders, and violences as the neceſſary reſult of this deſtructive plan of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. They obſerved, that no Engliſhman poſſeſſed his confidence, or was intruſted with any command or authority; and that the ſtrangers, whom a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous diſcipline could have but ill contained, were encouraged in every act of inſolence and tyranny againſt them.

He introduced into England the feudal law, which he found eſtabliſhed in France and Normandy, and which, during that age, was the foundation both of the ſtability and of the diſorders in moſt of the monarchical governments of Europe. He divided all the lands of England, with very few exceptions, except the royal demeſnes, into baronies; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred theſe, with the reſervation of ſtated ſervices and payments, on the moſt conſiderable of his adventurers.

The biſhops and abbots
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0162900301:187"/>
were obliged, when required, to furniſh to the King during war a number of knights or military tenants, proportioned to the extent of property poſſeſſed by each ſee or abbey; and they were liable, in caſe of failure; to the ſame penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were exacted from the laity<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

            <p>BUT as the great body of the clergy were ſtill natives, the King had much reaſon to dread the effects of their reſentment; and he therefore uſed the precaution of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Engliſh from all the conſiderable dignities, and of advancing foreigners in their place. The partiality of the Confeſſor towards the Normans had been ſo great, that, aided by their ſuperior learning, it had promoted them to many of the ſees of England; and even before the period of the conqueſt, ſcarce more than ſix or ſeven of the prelates were natives of the country. But among theſe was Stigand, archbiſhop of Canterbury; a man, who, by his addreſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, by the greatneſs of his family and alliances, by the extent of his poſſeſſions, as well as by the dignity of his office, and his authority over the Engliſh, gave great jealouſy to the King<note n="†" place="bottom">Parker, p. 161.</note>. Tho' William had, on his acceſſion, affronted this prelate, by employing the archbiſhop of York to officiate at his conſecration, he continued to load him with honours and careſſes, and to avoid every occaſion of giving him farther offence, till the opportunity ſhould offer of effectuating his final deſtruction<note n="‡" place="bottom">Parker, p. 164.

The ſuppreſſion of the late rebellions, and the total ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Engliſh, made him hope, that this attempt, however violent, would be covered by his great ſucceſſes, and be overlooked amidſt the other important revolutions, which affected ſo deeply the property and liberty of the kingdom. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe mighty advantages, he did not think it ſafe to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the reverence uſually paid the primate, but under cover of a new ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he was the great inſtrument of introducing into England.</p>

As ſoon, therefore, as the Norman prince ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully eſtabliſhed on the throne, the Pope diſpatched Ermenfroy, biſhop of Sion, as his legate into England; and this prelate was the firſt, who had ever appeared with that character in any part of the Britiſh iſlands. The King, tho' he was probably led by principle to pay this ſubmiſſion to Rome, determined, as is uſual, to employ the incident as a means of ſerving his political purpoſes, and of degrading thoſe Engliſh prelates, who were become obnoxious to him. The legate ſubmitted to become the inſtrument of his tyranny; and naturally thought, that the more violent the exertion of power, the more certainly did it confirm the authority of that court from which he derived his commiſſion. He ſummoned, therefore, a council of the prelates and abbots at Wincheſter; and being aſſiſted by two cardinals, Peter and John, he cited before him Stigand, archibiſhop of Canterbury, to anſwer for his conduct<note n="*" place="bottom">Flor. Wigorn. p 636.</note>. The primate was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of three crimes; the holding the ſee of Wincheſter together with that of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury; the officiating in the pall of Robert, his predeceſſor; and the having received his own pall from Benedict IX. who was afterwards depoſed for ſimony, and for intruſion into the papacy<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 453. Diceto, p. 482. Knyghton, p. 2345. Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p 5, 6. Ypod. Neuſt. p. 438.</note>. Theſe crimes of Stigand were mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; ſince the firſt had been a practice not unuſual in England, and was never any where ſubjected to a higher penalty than a reſignation of one of the ſees; the ſecond was a pure ceremonial; and as Benedict was the only Pope who then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated, and his acts were never reſcinded, all the prelates of the church, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe who lay at a diſtance, were very excuſable for making their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him. Stigand's ruin, however, was reſolved on, and was proſecuted with great ſeverity. The legate degraded him from his dignity, and the King confiſcated his eſtate, and caſt him into priſon, where he continued, in great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and want, during the remainder of his life. Like rigor was exerciſed againſt the other Engliſh prelates: Agelric, biſhop of Seleſey, and Agelmare, of Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, were depoſed by the legate, and impriſoned by the King<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden. p. 453.

            <p>THE conſpirators, hearing of Waltheof's departure, immediately concluded their deſigns to be betrayed; and they flew to arms, before their ſchemes were ripe for execution, and before the arrival of the Danes, in whoſe aid they placed their chief confidence. The earl of Hereford was checked by Walter de Lacy, a great baron in thoſe parts, who, ſupported by the biſhop of Worceſter and the abbot of Eveſham, raiſed ſome forces, and prevented the earl from paſſing the Severne, or advancing into the heart of the kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 456.

All this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſtore of ſpiritual and civil authority was now devolved on Gregory VII. of the name of Hildebrand, the moſt enterprizing pontiff who had ever filled that chair, and the leaſt reſtrained by fear, decency, or moderation. Not contented with ſhaking off the yoke of the Emperors, who had hitherto exerciſed the power of appointing the Pope on every vacancy, or at leaſt of ratifying his election; he undertook the arduous taſk of disjoining entirely the eccleſiaſtical from the civil power, and of excluding profane laymen from the right, which they had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0162900301:197"/>
of filling the vacancies of biſhoprics, abbies, and other ſpiritual dignities<note n="*" place="bottom">L'Abbe Conc. tom. x. p. 371, 372. con. 2.</note>. The ſovereigns, who had long exerciſed this power, and who had attained it, not by encroachments on the church, but on the people, to whom it originally belonged<note n="†" place="bottom">Padre Paolo ſopra benef. eccleſ. p. 30:</note>, made great oppoſition to this claim of the court of Rome; and Henry IV. the preſent Emperor, defended the prerogative of his crown with a vigour and reſolution ſuitable to its importance. The few offices, either civil or military, which the feudal inſtitutions left the ſovereign the power of beſtowing, made the prerogative of conferring the paſtoral ring and ſtaff the moſt invaluable jewel of the royal diadem; eſpecially as the general ignorance of the age beſtowed a weight on the eccleſiaſtical offices, even beyond the great extent of power and property which belonged to them. Superſtition, the child of ignorance, inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the clergy with an authority almoſt ſacred; and as they poſſeſſed the little learning of the age, their interpoſition became requiſite in all civil buſineſs, and a real uſefulneſs in common life was thus ſuperadded to the ſpiritual ſanctity of their character.</p>
            <p>WHEN the uſurpations, therefore, of the church had come to ſuch a maturity as to embolden her to attempt extorting the right of inveſtitures from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power, Europe, eſpecially Italy and Germany, was thrown into the moſt violent convulſions, and the Pope and Emperor waged implacable war againſt each other. Gregory even dared to fulminate the ſentence of excommunication againſt Henry and his adherents, to pronounce him rightfully depoſed, to free his ſubjects from their oaths of allegiance; and inſtead of ſhocking mankind with this groſs incroachment on the civil authority, he found the ſtupid people ready to ſecond his moſt exorbitant pretenſions. Every miniſter, ſervant, or vaſſal of the Emperor, who received any diſguſt, covered his rebellion under the pretence of principle; and even the mother of this monarch, forgetting all the ties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was ſeduced to countenance the inſolence of his enemies. Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unattentive to the pernicious conſequences of theſe papal claims, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their preſent purpoſes; and the controverſy, ſpreading into every city of Italy, engendered the parties of Guelf and Ghibbelin; the moſt durable and inveterate ſactions that ever aroſe from the mixture of ambition and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. Beſides numberleſs aſſaſſinations, tumults, and convulſions, to which they gave riſe, it is computed that the quarrel occaſioned no leſs than ſixty bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the reign of Henry IV. and eighteen in that of his ſucceſſor, Henry V. when the claims of the ſovereign pontiff finally prevailed<note n="‡" place="bottom">Padre Paolo, ibid. p. 113.</note>.</p>

BUT the bold ſpirit of Gregory, not diſmayed with the vigorous oppoſition, which he met with from the Emperor, extended his uſurpations all over Europe; and well knowing the nature of mankind, whoſe aſtoniſhment ever inclines them to yield to the moſt impudent pretenſions, he ſeemed determined to ſet no bounds to the ſpiritual, or rather temporal monarchy, which he had undertaken to erect. He pronounced the ſentence of excommunication againſt Nicephorus, Emperor of the Eaſt: Robert Guiſcard, the adventurous Norman, who had acquired the dominion of Naples, was attacked by the ſame dangerous weapon: He degraded Boleſlas, King of Poland, from the rank of King; and even deprived Poland of the title of a kingdom: He attempted to treat Philip, King of France, with the ſame rigor, which he had employed againſt the Emperor<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. Greg.

Epiſt. lib. 2. epiſt. 55.</note>.</p>
            <p>WILLIAM the Conqueror, the moſt potent, the moſt haughty, and the moſt vigorous prince in Europe, was not, amidſt all his ſplendid ſucceſſes, ſecured from the attacks of this enterprizing prelate. Gregory wrote him a letter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring him to fulfil his promiſe in doing homage for the kingdom of England to the ſee of Rome, and to ſend him over that tribute, which all his predeceſſors had been accuſtomed to pay to the vicar of Chriſt. By the tribute, he meant Peter's pence; which, tho' at firſt a charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was interpreted, according to the uſual practice of the Romiſh court, to be a badge of ſubjection acknowledged by the kingdom. William replied, that the money ſhould be remitted as uſual; but that he neither had promiſed to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to Rome, nor was it in the leaſt his purpoſe to impoſe that ſervitude on his ſtate<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spileg. Seldeni ad Eadmer, p. 164.</note>. And the better to ſhow Gregory his independance, he refuſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the frequent complaints of the Pope, the Engliſh biſhops liberty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a general council, which that pontiff had ſummoned againſt his enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the King ſhowed this vigor in ſupporting the royal dignity, he was infected with the general ſuperſtition of the age, and he did not diſcover the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſcope of thoſe inſtitutions, which, under the cover of ſtrictneſs in religion,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0162900301:199"/>
were introduced or prompted by the Roman pontiff, Gregory, while he was throwing all Europe into combuſtion by his violence and impoſtures, affected an anxious care for the purity of manners; and even the chaſte pleaſures of the marriage-bed were inconſiſtent, in his opinion, with the ſanctity of the ſacerdotal character. He had iſſued a decree prohibiting the marriage of prieſts, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating all clergymen who retained their wives, declaring all ſuch unlawful commerce to be fornication, and rendering it criminal in the laity to attend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip when ſuch profane prieſts officiated at the altar<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 455. 457. Flor. Wigorn, p. 638. Spell. Concil. fol. 13. A. D. 1076.</note>. This point was a great object in the politics of the Romiſh court; and it coſt them infinitely more pains to eſtabliſh it, than the propagation of any ſpeculative abſurdity, which they had ever attempted to introduce. Many ſynods were ſummoned in different parts of Europe, before it was finally ſettled; and it was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remarked, that the younger clergymen complied chearfully with the Pope's decrees in this particular, and that the chief reluctance appeared in thoſe who were more advanced in years: An event ſo little conformable to men's firſt expectations, that it could not fail to be gloſſed on, even in that blind and ſuperſtitious age. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam allowed the Pope's legate to aſſemble, in his abſence, a ſynod at Wincheſter, in order to ſettle the celibacy of the clergy; but the church of England could not yet be carried the whole length expected; and the ſynod was content with decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the biſhops ſhould not thenceforth ordain any prieſts or deacons without exacting from them a promiſe of celibacy; but that none, except thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to collegiate or cathedral churches, ſhould be obliged to ſeparate from their wives.</p>

               <note place="margin">Revolt of prince Robert.</note> THE King paſſed ſome years in Normandy; but his long reſidence there was not entirely owing to his declared preference of that dutchy: His preſence was alſo neceſſary for compoſing thoſe diſturbances, which had ariſen in that favourite territory, and which had even originally proceeded from his own family. Robert, his eldeſt ſon, ſirnamed Gambaron or Courthoſe, from his ſhort legs, was a prince, who inherited all the bravery of his family and nation; but without that policy and diſſimulation, by which his father was ſo much diſtinguiſhed; and which, no leſs than his military valor, had contributed to his great ſucceſſes. Greedy of fame, impatient of contradiction, without reſerve in his friendſhips, declared in his enmities, this prince could endure no controul even from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious father, and openly aſpired to that independance, to which his temper, as well as ſome circumſtances in his ſituation, ſtrongly invited him<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vital. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 457. Flor. Wigorn, p. 639.</note>. When Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam firſt received the ſubmiſſions of the province of Maine, he had promiſed the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0162900301:200"/>
inhabitants that Robert ſhould be their prince; and before he undertook the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt England, he had, on the application of the French court, declared him his ſucceſſor in Normandy, and had obliged the barons of that dutchy to do him homage as their future ſovereign. By this artifice, he had endeavoured to appeaſe the jealouſy of his neighbours, as affording them a proſpect of ſeparating England from his dominions on the continent; but when Robert demanded of him the execution of theſe engagements, he gave him an abſolute refuſal, and told him, according to the homely ſaying, that he never intended to throw off his cloaths, till he went to bed<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. de Malr. p. 160.</note>. Robert openly declared his diſcontent; and was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of ſecretly inſtigating the King of France and the earl of Brittanny to the oppoſition which they made to William, and which had formerly fruſtrated his attempts upon the town of Dol. And as the quarrel ſtill augmented, Robert proceeded to entertain a ſtrong jealouſy of his two ſurviving brothers, William and Henry (for Richard was killed in hunting by a ſtag) who, by greater ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and complaiſance, had acquired the affections of their father. In this diſpoſition, the greateſt trifle ſufficed to produce a rupture between them.</p>
            <p>THE three princes, reſiding with their father in the caſtle of l'Aigle in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, were one day engaged in ſport together; and after much frolic, the two younger took it in their head to throw over ſome water on Robert as he paſſed thro' the court on leaving their apartment<note n="†" place="bottom">Order Vital. p. 545.</note>; a paſtime, which he would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have regarded as innocent, had it not been for the ſuggeſtions of Alberic de Grentmeſnil, ſon of that Hugh de Grentmeſnil, whom William had formerly deprived of his fortunes, when that baron deſerted him during his greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in England. This young nobleman, mindful of the injury, perſuaded the prince, that this action was meant as a public affront, which it behoved him in honour to reſent; and the choleric Robert, drawing his ſword, ran up ſtairs, with an intention of taking revenge on his brothers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The whole caſtle was full of tumult, which the King himſelf, who haſtened from his apartment, found ſome difficulty to appeaſe. But he could by no means appeaſe the reſentment of his eldeſt ſon, who, complaining of his partiality, and fancying that no proper atonement had been made him for the infult, left the court that very evening, and haſtened to Roüen, with an intention of ſeizing the citadel of that place<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. But being diſappointed in this view by the precaution and vigilance of Roger de Ivery, the governor, he fled to Hugh de Neufchatel, a powerful Norman ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, who gave him protection in his caſtles; and he openly levied war againſt his father<note n="§" place="bottom">Order Vital. p. 545.

engaged all the young nobility of Normandy and Maine, as well of Anjou and Brittanny, to take part with him; and it was ſuſpected, that Matilda, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe favourite he was, ſupported him in his rebellion by ſecret remittances of money, and by the encouragement, which ſhe gave his partizans.</p>

He called over an army of Engliſh under his antient captains, who ſoon expelled Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and reſtored the ſovereign's authority in all his dominions. The young prince was obliged to take ſhelter in the caſtle of Gerberoy in the Beauvoiſis, which the King of France, who ſecretly fomented all theſe diſcords, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him. In this fortreſs he was cloſely beſieged by his father, againſt whom, having a ſtrong garriſon, he made a gallant defence. There paſt under the walls of this place many rencounters, which reſembled more the ſingle combats of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, than the military actions of armies; but one of them was remarkable for its circumſtances and its event. Robert happened to encounter with the King, who was concealed by his helmet; and both being valiant, a fierce combat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, till at laſt the young prince wounded his father in the arm, and threw him from his horſe. Calling for aſſiſtance, his voice diſcovered him to his ſon; who ſtruck with remorſe for his paſt crime, and aſtoniſhed with the apprehenſions of one much greater, which he had ſo nearly incurred, inſtantly threw himſelf at his father's feet, craved pardon for his offences, and offered to purchaſe forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by any atonement<note n="*" place="bottom">Malmeſ. p. 106.

A pound in that age, as we have before obſerved, contained three times the weight of ſilver that it does at preſent; and the ſame weight of ſilver, by the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable computation, would purchaſe ten times more of the neceſſaries of life, tho' not in the ſame proportion of the finer manufactures.

His ſpirit was bold and enterpriſing, yet
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0162900301:206"/>
guided with prudence: His ambition, which was exorbitant, and lay little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſtraint of juſtice, and ſtill leſs under that of humanity, ſtill ſubmitted to the dictates of reaſon and ſound policy. Born in an age when the minds of men were intractable and unacquainted with ſubmiſſion, he was yet able, to direct them to his purpoſes; and partly from the aſcendant of his vehement character, partly from art and diſſimulation, to eſtabliſh an unlimited authority. Tho' not inſenſible to generoſity, he was hardened againſt compaſſion; and he ſeemed equally oſtentatious and ambitious of eclat in his clemency and in his ſeverity. The maxims of his adminiſtration were auſtere; but might have been uſeful, had they been ſolely employed in preſerving order in an eſtabliſhed government<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Weſt. p. 230. Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 258.</note>: They were ill calculated for ſoftening the rigors, which, under the moſt gentle manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are inſeparable from conqueſt. His attempt againſt England was the laſt great enterprize of the kind, which, during the courſe of ſeven hundred years, has fully ſucceeded in Europe; and the greatneſs of his genius broke thro' thoſe limits, which firſt the feudal inſtitutions, then the refined policy of princes, have fixed to the ſeveral ſtates of Chriſtendom. Tho' he rendered himſelf infinitely odious to his Engliſh ſubjects, he tranſmitted his power to his poſterity, and the throne is ſtill filled by his deſcendants: A proof, that the foundations which he laid were firm and ſolid, and that, amidſt all his violences, while he ſeemed only to gratify the preſent paſſion, he had ſtill an eye towards futurity.</p>
            <p>SOME writers have been deſirous of refuſing to this prince the title of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, in the ſenſe in which it is commonly underſtood; and under pretence, that that word is ſometimes in old books applied to ſuch as make an acquiſition of territory by any means, they are willing to reject William's title, by right of war, to the crown of England. It is needleſs to enter into a controverſy, which, by the terms of it, muſt neceſſarily degenerate into a diſpute of words. It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to ſay, that the duke of Normandy's firſt invaſion of the iſland was hoſtile; that his ſubſequent adminiſtration was entirely ſupported by arms; that in the very frame of his laws he made a diſtinction between the Normans and Engliſh, to the advantage of the former<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 600.</note>; that he acted in every thing as abſolute maſter over the natives, whoſe intereſts and affections he totally diſregarded; and that if there was an interval when he aſſumed the appearance of a legal magiſtrate, the period was very ſhort, and was nothing but a temporary ſacrifice, which he, as has been the caſe with moſt conquerors, was obliged to make of his inclination to his preſent policy. Scarce any of thoſe revolutions, which, both in hiſtory and in common language, have always been denominated conqueſts, appear equally vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0162900301:207"/>
or have been attended with ſo ſudden an alteration both of power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. The Roman ſtate, which ſpread its dominion over Europe, left the rights of individuals, in a great meaſure, untouched; and thoſe civilized conquerors, while they made their own country the ſeat of empire, found, that they could draw moſt advantage from the ſubject provinces, by beſtowing on the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of their private poſſeſſions. The barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who ſubdued the Roman empire, tho' they ſettled in the conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yet being accuſtomed to a rude uncultivated life, found a ſmall part of the land ſufficient to ſupply all their wants; and they were not tempted to ſeize ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive poſſeſſions, which they neither knew how to cultivate nor employ. But the Normans, and other foreigners, who followed the ſtandard of William, while they made the vanquiſhed kingdom the ſeat of empire, were yet ſo far advanced in arts as to be acquainted with the advantages of a large property; and having totally ſubdued the natives, they puſhed the rights of conqueſt (very extenſive in the eyes of avarice and ambition, however narrow in thoſe of reaſon) to the utmoſt extremity againſt them. Except the former conqueſt of England by the Saxons themſelves, who were induced, by peculiar circumſtances, to proceed even to the extermination of the natives, it would be difficult to find in all hiſtory a revolution more deſtructive, or attended with a more compleat ſubjection of the antient inhabitants. Contumely ſeems even to have been wantonly added to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">H. Hunt. p. 370.

After Mahomet had, by means of his pretended revelations, united the diſperſed Arabians under one head, they iſſued forth from their deſarts in great multitudes; and being animated with zeal for their new religion, and ſupported by the vigor of their new government, they made deep impreſſions on the eaſtern empire, which was far in the decline, with regard both to military diſcipline and to civil policy. Jeruſalem, by its ſituation, became one of their moſt early conqueſts; and the Chriſtians had the mortification to ſee the holy ſepulchre, and the other places, made famous by the preſence of their religious founder, fallen into the poſſeſſion of infidels. But the Arabians or Saracens were ſo employed in military enterprizes, by which they ſpread their empire, in a few years, from the banks of the Ganges to the ſtraits of Gibraltar, that they had no leiſure for theological controverſy; and tho' the alcoran, the original monument of their faith, ſeems to contain ſome violent precepts, they were much leſs infected with the ſpirit of bigotry and proſecution than the ſpeculative Greeks, who were continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining on the ſeveral articles of their religious ſyſtem. They gave little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to thoſe zealous pilgrims, who daily flocked to Jeruſalem; and they allowed every man, after paying a moderate tribute, to viſit the holy ſepulchre, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his religious duties, and to return in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometaniſm, having wreſted Syria from the Saracens, and having in the year 1065, made themſelves maſters of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult and dangerous to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The barbarity of their manners, and the confuſions attending their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled government, expoſed the pilgrims to many inſults, robberies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions; and theſe zealots, returning from their meritorious fatigues and ſufferings, filled all Chriſtendom with indignation againſt the infidels, who profaned the holy city by their preſence, and derided the ſacred myſteries in the very place of their completion. Gregory VII. among the other vaſt ideas, which he entertained, had formed the deſign of uniting all the weſtern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt the Mahometans; but his exorbitant enterprizes againſt the civil power of princes, had created him ſo many enemies, and had rendered his ſchemes ſo ſuſpicious, that he was not able to make great progreſs in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.

He ſummoned a council at Placentia, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of four thouſand eccleſiaſtics and thirty thouſand ſeculars; and which was ſo numerous, that no hall could contain the multitude, and it was neceſſary to hold the aſſembly in a plain. The harangues of the pope, and of Peter himſelf, repreſenting the diſmal ſituation of their brethren in the eaſt, and the indignity, ſuffered by the Chriſtian name, in allowing the holy city to remain in the hands of the infidels, here found the minds of men ſo well prepared, that the whole multitude, as if actuated by a ſupernatural inſtinct, declared for the war, and ſolemnly devoted themſelves to perform this ſervice, ſo meritorious, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, towards God and religion.</p>

But amidſt the abject ſuperſtition, which now prevailed, the military ſpirit alſo had univerſally diffuſed itſelf; and tho' not ſupported by art or diſcipline, was become the general paſſion of the nations, governed by the feudal law. All the great lords poſſeſſed the right of peace and war: They were engaged in continual hoſtilities with each other: The open country was become a ſcene of outrage and diſorder: The cities, which were ſtill mean and poor, were neither guarded by walls, nor protected by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and were expoſed to each inſult: Every man was obliged to depend for ſafety on his own force, or his private alliances: And valor was the only excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which was held in eſteem, or gave one man the pre-eminence above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When all the particular ſuperſtitions, therefore, were here united in one great object, the ardor for private hoſtilities took the ſame direction; and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, impelled by its two ruling paſſions, was looſened, as it were, from its foundations, and ſeemed to precipitate itſelf in one united body upon the eaſt.</p>

            <p>AMIDST this univerſal madneſs, which ſpread itſelf by contagion throughout all Europe, eſpecially in France and Germany, men were not entirely forgetful of their preſent intereſts; and both thoſe who went on this expedition, and thoſe who ſtaid behind, entertained ſchemes of gratifying, by its means, their avarice or their ambition. The nobles who inliſted themſelves were moved by the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic ſpirit of the age to hope for opulent eſtabliſhments in the eaſt, the chief ſeat of arts and commerce during thoſe ages; and in purſuit of theſe chimerical projects, they ſold at the loweſt price their antient caſtles and inheritances, which had now loſt all value in their eyes. The greater princes, who remained at home, beſides eſtabliſhing peace in their dominions by giving occupation abroad to the inquietude and martial diſpoſition of their ſubjects, took the opportunity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing to their crown many conſiderable fieſs, either by purchaſe or by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the heirs.

He reſolved, therefore, to mortgage or rather to ſell his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which he had not talents to govern; and he offered them to his brother William, for no greater ſum than ten thouſand marks<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

The bargain was ſoon concluded: The King raiſed the money by violent extortions on his ſubjects of all ranks, even on the convents, who were obliged to melt their plate in order to furniſh the quota demanded of them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 35. W. Malm. p. 123. W.

            <p>THE ſmallneſs of this ſum, with the difficulties which William found in raiſing it, ſuffices alone to refute the account, which is heedleſsly adopted by hiſtorians, of the enormous revenue of the Conqueror. Is it credible, that Robert would conſign into the rapacious hands of his brother ſuch conſiderable dominions, for a ſum, which, according to that account, made not a week's income of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's treaſury? Or that the King of England could not on demand, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his ſubjects, have been able to pay him the money? The Conqueror, it is agreed, was frugal as well as rapacious; and yet his treaſure, at his death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not 60,000 pounds, which would have been no more than his income for two months: Another certain refutation of that exaggerated account.</p>
            <p>THE fury of the croiſades, during this age, leſs infected England than the neighbouring kingdoms; probably becauſe the Norman conquerors, finding their ſettlement in that kingdom ſtill ſomewhat precarious, dared not to abandon their own houſes, in queſt of diſtant adventures. The ſelfiſh intereſted humour alſo
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0162900301:220"/>
of the King, which kept him from kindling in the general flame, checked its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs among his ſubjects; and as he is accuſed of open profaneneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">G. Neubr. p. 358. W. Gemet. p. 292.</note>, and was endowed with a ſharp wit<note n="†" place="bottom">Malm. p. 122.</note>, it is likely that he made the romantic chivalry of the croiſes the object of his perpetual ridicule. As an inſtance of his irreligion, we are told, that he once accepted of ſixty marks from a Jew, whoſe eldeſt ſon had been converted to Chriſtianity, and who engaged him by that preſent to aſſiſt him in bringing back the youth to Judaiſm. William employed both menaces and perſuaſion to that purpoſe; but finding the new convert obſtinate in his faith, he ſent for the father, and told him, that as he had not ſucceeded, it was not juſt that he ſhould keep the preſent; but as he had done his utmoſt, it was but equitable that he ſhould be paid for his pains; and he would therefore only retain thirty marks of the money<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 47.</note>. At another time, it is ſaid he ſent for ſome learned Chriſtian theologians and ſome rabbies, and bade them fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the queſtion of their religion in his preſence: He was perfectly indifferent between them, had his ears open to reaſon and conviction, and would embrace that doctrine, which upon compariſon ſhould be found ſupported by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid arguments<note n="‖" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 123.</note>. If this ſtory be true, it is probable that he meant only to amuſe himſelf by turning both into ridicule: But we muſt be cautious of admitting every thing related by the monkiſh hiſtorians to the diſadvantage of this prince: He had the misfortune to be engaged in quarrels with the eccieſiaſtics, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with Anſelm, commonly called St. Anſelm, archbiſhop of Canterbury; and it is no wonder his memory ſhould be blackened by the hiſtorians of that order.</p>

The abbot refuſed earneſtly the dignity, fell on his knees, wept, and entreated the King to change his purpoſe<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 17.

to receive that enſign of ſpiritual dignity<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 18.</note>. William ſoon after recovered his health; and his paſſions regaining their uſual force and vigour, he returned to his former violence and rapine<note n="†" place="bottom">H. Hunt. p. 373. M. Paris, p. 12. Diceto, p. 494.</note>. He retained in priſon ſeveral perſons whom he had ordered to be freed during the time of his penitence; he ſtill preyed upon the eccleſiaſtical benefices; the ſale of ſpiritual dignities continued as open as ever; and he retained poſſeſſion of a conſiderable part of the revenues belonging to the ſee of Canterbury<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 19, 43.

But he found in Anſelm that perſevering oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he had reaſon to expect from the oſtentatious humility, which that prelate had employed in refuſing his promotion.</p>
            <p>THE oppoſition of Anſelm was the more dangerous on account of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of piety, which he ſoon acquired in England, by his great zeal againſt all abuſes, particularly thoſe in dreſs and ornament. There was a mode, which, in that age, prevailed throughout Europe, both among men and women, to give an enormous length to their ſhoes, to draw the toe to a ſharp point, and to affix to it the figure of a bird's bill, or ſome ſuch ornament, which was turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and which was often ſuſtained by gold or ſilver chains tied to the knee<note n="‖" place="bottom">Order. Vital. p. 682. W. Malmeſ. p. 123. Knyghton, p. 2369.</note>. The eccleſiaſtics took exception at this ornament, which, they ſaid, was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bely the ſcripture, where it is affirmed, that no man can add a cubit to his ſtature; and they declaimed againſt it with great vehemence, nay aſſembled ſome ſynods, who abſolutely condemned it. But ſuch are the ſtrange contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in human nature! tho' the clergy, at that time, could overturn thrones, and had authority ſufficient to ſend above a million of men on <hi>their</hi> errand to the deſarts of Aſia, they never could prevail againſt theſe long-pointed ſhoes: On the contrary, that caprice, contrary to all other modes, maintained its ground during ſeveral centuries; and if the clergy had not at laſt deſiſted from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of it, it might ſtill have been the prevailing faſhion in Europe.</p>
            <p>BUT Anſelm was more fortunate in decrying the particular mode, which was the object of his averſion, and which probably had not taken ſuch faſt hold of the affections of the people. He preached zealouſly againſt the long hair and curled locks, which were then faſhionable among the courtiers; he refuſed the aſhes on Aſh-Wedneſday to thoſe who were ſo accoutered; and his authority and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had ſuch influence, that the young men univerſally abandoned that orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and appeared in the cropt hair, which was recommended to them by the ſermons of the primate. The noted hiſtorian of Anſelm, who was alſo his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and ſecretary, celebrates highly this effort of his zeal and piety<note n="§" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 23.</note>.</p>

WHEN William's profaneneſs therefore returned to him with his health, he was ſoon engaged in controverſies with this auſtere prelate. There was at that time a ſchiſm in the church, between Urban and Clement, who both pretended to the papacy<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 463.</note>; and Anſelm, who, as abbot of Bec, had already acknowledged the former, was determined, without the King's conſent, to introduce his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into England<note n="†" place="bottom">Eadmer. p. 25.

William, who, imitating his father's example, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited his ſubjects from recognizing any Pope, whom he had not previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was enraged at this pretenſion; and ſummoned a ſynod at Rockingham, with an intention of depoſing Anſelm; but that prelate's ſuffragans declared, that, without the papal authority, they knew of no expedient for inflicting that cenſure on their primate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p 30.</note>. The King was at laſt engaged by other motives to give the preference to Urban's title; Anſelm received the pall from him; and matters ſeemed to be tolerably compoſed between the King and the primate<note n="‖" place="bottom">Diceto, p. 495.</note>, when the quarrel broke out afreſh from a new cauſe. William had undertaken an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Wales, and required the archbiſhop to furniſh his quota of ſoldiers for that ſervice; but Anſelm, who regarded the demand as an oppreſſion on the church, and yet durſt not refuſe compliance, ſent them ſo miſerably equipped, that the King was extremely diſpleaſed, and threatened him with a proſecution<note n="§" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 37, 43.</note>. Anſelm, on the other hand, demanded poſitively, that all the revenues of his ſee ſhould be reſtored to him; appealed to Rome againſt the King's injuſtice<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <note place="margin">The croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades.</note> AFTER the croiſes were aſſembled on the banks of the Boſphorus, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Conſtantinople, they proceeded on their enterprize; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately experienced thoſe difficulties, which their zeal had hitherto concealed from them, and for which, even if they had forſeen them, it would have been almoſt impoſſible to provide a proper remedy. The Greek Emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to the weſtern Chriſtians for ſuccour againſt the Turks, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained hope, and that but a feeble one, of only obtaining ſuch a moderate ſupply, as, acting under his command, might enable him to repulſe the enemy: But he was extremely aſtoniſhed to ſee his dominions overwhelmed, on a ſudden, with ſuch an inundation of licentious barbarians, who, tho' they pretended friendſhip, deſpiſed his ſubjects as unwarlike, and deteſted them as heretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he endeavoured to divert the torrent; but while he employed profeſſions, careſſes, civilities, and ſeeming ſervices towards the leaders of the croiſade, he ſecretly regarded thoſe imperious allies as more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the open enemies, by whom his empire had been formerly invaded. Having effectuated that difficult point of diſembarking them ſafely in Aſia, he entered into a private correſpondence with Soliman, Emperor of the Turks; and practiſed every inſidious art, which his genius, his power, or his ſituation enabled him to employ, for diſappointing the enterprize, and diſcouraging the Latins from making thenceforward any ſuch prodigious migrations. His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous policy was ſeconded by the diſorders, inſeparable from ſo vaſt a multitude, who were not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders of the moſt independant, intractable ſpirits, unacquainted with military diſcipline, and ſtill more enemies to civil authority and ſubmiſſion. The ſcarcity of proviſions, the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0162900301:227"/>
exceſſes of fatigue, the influence of unknown climates, joined to the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert in their operations, and the ſword of a warlike enemy, deſtroyed the croiſes by thouſands, and would have abated the ardor of men, impelled to war by leſs powerful motives. Their zeal, however, their bravery, and their irreſiſtible force ſtill carried them forward, and continually advanced them to the great end of their enterprizes. After an obſtinate ſiege, they took Nice, the ſeat of the Turkiſh empire; they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of Antioch; and entirely broke the force of the Turks, who had ſo long retained theſe countries in ſubjection. The ſoldan of Egypt, whoſe alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall of the Turkiſh power, his former authority in Jeruſalem; and informed them by his ambaſſadors, that, if they came diſarmed to that city, they might now perform their religious vows, and that all Chriſtian pilgrims, who ſhould thenceforth viſit the holy ſepulchre, might expect the ſame good treatment, which they had ever received from his predeceſſors. This offer was rejected; the ſoldan was required to yield up the city to the Chriſtians; and on his refuſal, the croiſes advanced to the ſiege of Jeruſalem, which they regarded as the conſummation of their labours. By the detachments, which they had made, and the diſaſters, which they had undergone, they were diminiſhed to the number of twenty thouſand foot and fifteen hundred horſe; but theſe were ſtill formidable from their valor, their experience, and the obedience, which, at the price of paſt calamities, they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a ſiege of five weeks, they took Jeruſalem by aſſault; and, impelled by a mixture of military and religious rage, they put the numerous garriſon and inhabitants to the ſword without diſtinction. Neither arms defended the valiant, nor ſubmiſſion the timorous: No age nor ſex was ſpared: Infants on the breaſt were pierced by the ſame blow with their mothers, who implored for mercy: Even a multitude, to the number of ten thouſand perſons, who had ſurrendered themſelves priſoners, and were promiſed quarter, were butchered in cold blood by theſe ferocious conquerors<note n="*" place="bottom">Vertot, vol. 1. p. 57.</note>. The ſtreets of Jeruſalem were covered with dead bodies<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 34. Order. Vital. p. 756. Diceto, p. 498.</note>; and the triumphant croiſes, after every enemy was ſubdued and ſlaughtered, immediately turned themſelves, with the ſentiments of humiliation and contrition, towards the holy ſepulchre. They threw aſide their arms, ſtill ſtreaming with blood: They advanced with reclined bodies, and naked feet and head to that ſacred monument: They ſung anthems to their Saviour who had purchaſed their ſalvation by his death and agony: And their devotion, enlivened by the preſence of the place where he had ſuffered, ſo overcame their fury, that they diſſolved in tears, and bore the appearance of every ſoft and tender ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

So inconſiſtent is human nature with itſelf! And ſo eaſily does the moſt effeminate ſuperſtition ally both with the moſt heroic courage, and with the fierceſt barbarity!</p>
            <p>THIS great event happened on the fifth of July in the laſt year of the eleventh century. The Chriſtian princes and nobles, after chooſing Godfrey of Boulogne King of Jeruſalem, began to ſettle themſelves in their new conqueſts; while ſome of them returned to Europe, in order to enjoy at home that glory which their valor had acquired them in this popular and meritorious enterprize. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, was Robert, duke of Normandy, who, as he had abandoned the greateſt dominions of any prince, that attended the croiſade, had all along diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf by the moſt intrepid courage<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 35. W. Heming. p. 467. G. Newbrig, p 358.</note>, as well as by that affable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and unbounded generoſity, which gain the hearts of ſoldiers, and qualify a prince to ſhine in a military life. In paſſing thro' Italy, he became acquainted with Sibylla, daughter of the count of Converſana, a young lady of great beauty and merit, whom he eſpouſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 153. Gul. Gemet. p. 299.</note>; and indulging himſelf in this new paſſion, as well as fond of enjoying eaſe and pleaſure, after the fatigues of ſo many rough campaigns, he lingered a twelvemonth in that delicious climate; and tho' his friends in the north looked every moment for his arrival, none of them knew when they could with certainty expect it. By this delay, he loſt the kingdom of England, which the great fame he had acquired during the croiſades, as well as his undoubted title, both by birth, and by the preceding agreement with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed brother, would, had he been preſent, have infallibly ſecured to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Acceſſion of Henry.</note> PRINCE Henry was hunting with Rufus in the new foreſt, when intelligence of that prince's death was brought him; and being ſenſible of the advantage, attending the conjuncture, he immediated galloped to Wincheſter, in order to ſecure the royal treaſure, which he knew to be a neceſſary implement for facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating his deſigns on the crown. He had ſcarcely reached the place when Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Breteuil, keeper of the treaſure, arrived, and oppoſed himſelf to Henry's pretenſions. This nobleman, who had been engaged in the ſame party of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had no ſooner heard of his maſter's death, than he haſtened to take care of his charge; and he told the prince, that this treaſure, as well as the crown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his elder brother, who was now his ſovereign; and that he himſelf, for his part, was determined, in ſpite of all other pretenſions, to maintain his allegiance to him. But Henry, drawing his ſword, threatened him with inſtant death, if he dared to diſobey him; and as others of the late King's retinue, who came
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0162900301:229"/>
every moment to Wincheſter, joined the prince's party, Breteuil was obliged to withdraw his oppoſition, and to acquieſce in this violence<note n="*" place="bottom">Order. Vital. p. 782.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY, without loſing a moment, haſtened with his money to London; and having aſſembled ſome noblemen and prelates, whom his addreſs, or abilities, or preſents, gained to his ſide, he was ſuddenly elected, or rather ſaluted King; and immediately proceeded to the exerciſe of the royal dignity. In leſs than three days after his brother's death, the ceremonial of his coronation was performed by Maurice, biſhop of London, who was perſuaded to officiate on that occaſion<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783.</note>; and thus, by his courage and celerity, he intruded himſelf into the vacant throne. No one had ſufficient ſpirit or ſenſe of duty to appear in defence of the abſent prince: All men were ſeduced or intimidated: Preſent poſſeſſion ſupplied the apparent deficiencies of Henry's title, which was indeed founded on plain uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: And the barons, as well as the people, acquieſced in a claim, which, tho' it could neither be juſtified nor comprehended, could now, they found, be oppoſed only thro' the perils of civil war and rebellion.</p>
            <p>BUT as Henry eaſily foreſaw, that a crown, uſurped againſt all rules of juſtice, would ſit very unſteady on his head, he reſolved, by fair profeſſions at leaſt, to gain the affections of all his ſubjects. Beſides taking the uſual coronation-oath to maintain the laws and execute juſtice, he paſſed a charter, which was calculated to remedy many of the grievous oppreſſions, which had been complained of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reign of his father and brother<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Sim. Dunelm. p. 225. Brompton, p. 997.</note>. He there promiſed, that, upon the death of any biſhop or abbot, he never would ſeize the revenues of the ſee or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey during the vacancy, but would leave the whole to be reaped by the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; and that he would never let to farm any eccleſiaſtical benefice, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it for money. After this conceſſion to the church, whoſe favour was of ſo great conſequence, he proceeded to enumerate the civil grievances, which he purpoſed to redreſs. He promiſed, that, upon the death of any earl, baron, or military tenant, his heir ſhould be admitted to the poſſeſſion of his eſtate, on paying a juſt and lawful relief; without being expoſed to ſuch exorbitant exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as had been required during the late reigns: He remitted the wardſhip of minors, and allowed guardians to be appointed, who ſhould be anſwerable for the truſt: He promiſed not to diſpoſe of any heireſs in marriage, but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of all the barons; and if any baron intended to give his daughter, ſiſter, niece, or kinſwoman, in marriage, it ſhould only be neceſſary for him to conſult the King, who promiſed to take no money for his conſent, nor ever to refuſe permiſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the perſon to whom it was propoſed to marry her ſhould happen to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0162900301:230"/>
He granted his barons and military tenants the power of bequeathing by will their money or perſonal eſtates; and if they neglected to make a will, he promiſed, that their heirs ſhould ſucceed to them: He remitted the right of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing moneyage, and of levying taxes at pleaſure on the farms, which the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons retained in their own hands<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix II.</note>: He made ſome general profeſſions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating fines; he offered a pardon for all offences; and he remitted all debts due to the crown: He required, that the vaſſals of the barons ſhould enjoy the ſame privileges, which he granted to his own barons; and he promiſed a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and obſervance of the laws of King Edward. This is the ſubſtance of the chief articles contained in that famous charter<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. Paris, p. 38. Hoveden, p. 468. Brompton, p. 1021. Hagulſtad. p. 310.</note>.</p>
            <p>To give greater authenticity to theſe conceſſions, Henry lodged a copy of his charter in ſome abbey of each county; as if deſirous, that it ſhould be expoſed to the eyes of all his ſubjects, and remain as a perpetual rule for the limitation and direction of his government: Yet is it certain, that, after the preſent turn was ſerved, he never once thought, during his reign, of obſerving one ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of it; and the whole fell ſo much into neglect and oblivion, that, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing century, when the barons, who had heard an obſcure tradition of it, deſired to make it the model of the great charter, which they exacted from King John, they could only find one copy of it in the whole kingdom. But as to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances here propoſed to be redreſſed, they were ſtill continued in their full extent; and the royal authority, in all theſe heads, lay under no manner of reſtriction. Reliefs of heirs, ſo capital an article, were never effectually fixed till the time of Magna Charta<note n="‡" place="bottom">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 36. What is called a relief in the Conqueror's laws, preſerved by Ingulf, ſeems to have been the herriot; ſince reliefs, as well as the other burdens of the feudal law, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the age of the Confeſſor, whoſe laws theſe originally were.</note>; and it is evident, that the general promiſe here given, of accepting a juſt and lawful relief, ought to have been reduced to more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, in order to give ſecurity to the ſubject. The oppreſſion of wardſhip and marriage was perpetuated even till the age of Charles II.: And it appears from Glanville<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lib. 7. cap. 16. This practice was contrary to the laws of King Edward, ratified by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, as we learn from Ingulf, p. 91. But laws had at that time very little influence: Power and violence governed every thing.</note>, the famous juſticiary of Henry II. that in his time, where any man died inteſtate, an accident which muſt be very frequent, when the art of writing was ſo little known, the King, or the lord of the fief, pretended to ſeize all the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0162900301:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moveables, and to exclude every heir, even the children of the deceaſed: A ſure mark of a tyrannical and arbitrary government.</p>
            <p>THE Normans indeed, ſettled in England, were, during this age, ſo violent and licentious a people, that they may be pronounced incapable of any true or regular liberty; which requires ſuch a refinement of laws and inſtitutions, ſuch a comprehenſion of views, ſuch a ſentiment of honour, ſuch a ſpirit of obedience, and ſuch a ſacrifice of private intereſts and connexions to public order, as can only be the reſult of great reflection and experience, and muſt grow to perfection du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral ages of a ſettled and eſtabliſhed government. A people, ſo inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the rights of their ſovereign, as to disjoint, without neceſſity, the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary ſucceſſion, and permit a younger brother to intrude himſelf into the place of the elder, whom they eſteemed, and who was guilty of no crime but being abſent, could not expect, that that prince would pay any greater regard to their privileges, or allow his engagements to fetter his power, and debar him from any conſiderable intereſt or convenience. They had indeed arms in their hands, which prevented the eſtabliſhment of a total deſpotiſm, and left their poſterity ſufficient power, whenever they ſhould attain a ſufficient degree of reaſon, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire true liberty: But their turbulent diſpoſition prompted them frequently to make ſuch uſe of their arms, that they were more fitted to obſtruct the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of juſtice, than to ſtop the career of violence and oppreſſion. The prince, finding, that greater oppoſition was often made to him when he enforced the laws, than when he violated them, was apt to render his own will and pleaſure the ſole rule of government, and on every emergence to conſider more the power of the perſons whom he might offend, than the rights of thoſe whom he might injure. The very form of this charter of Henry proves, that the Norman ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons (for they, rather than the people of England, are chiefly concerned in it) were totally ignorant of the nature of limited monarchy, and were ill qualified to conduct, in conjunction with their ſovereign, the machine of government. It is an act of his ſole power, is the reſult of his free grace, implies ſeveral articles which bind others as well as himſelf, and is therefore unfit to be the deed of any one who poſſeſſes not the whole legiſlative power, and who may not at pleaſure revoke all his conceſſions.</p>
            <p>KING Henry, farther to increaſe his popularity, degraded and committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Ralph Flambard, biſhop of Durham, who had been the chief inſtrument of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion employed by his brother<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 208. W. Malm. p. 156. Matth. Paris, p. 39. Alur. Beverl. p. 144.</note>: But this act was followed by another, which was a direct violation of his own charter, and was a bad prognoſtic of his ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0162900301:232"/>
to obſerve it: He kept the ſee of Durham vacant for five years, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time retained poſſeſſion of all its revenues. Senſible of the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which Anſelm had acquired by his character of piety, and by the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which he had undergone from William, he ſent repeated meſſages to him at Lyons, where he reſided, and invited him to return and take poſſeſſion of his dign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

On the arrival of the prelate, he propoſed to him the renewal of that homage which he had done his brother, and which had never been refuſed by any Engliſh biſhop: But Anſelm had acquired other ſentiments by his journey to Rome, and gave the King an abſolute refuſal. He objected the decrees of the council of Bari, at which he himſelf had aſſiſted; and he declared, that, ſo far from doing homage for his ſpiritual dignity, he would not ſo much as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate withh any eccleſiaſtic who paid that ſubmiſſion, or who accepted of inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from laymen. Henry, who propoſed, in his preſent delicate ſituation, to reap great advantages from the authority and popularity of Anſelm, dared not to quarrel with him by inſiſting on his demand<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>: He only deſired that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy might be ſuſpended; and that meſſengers might be ſent to Rome, to accommodate matters with the Pope, and to obtain his confirmation of the laws and cuſtoms of England.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Marriage of the King.</note> THERE immediately occurred an important affair, in which the King was obliged to have recourſe to the authority of Anſelm. Matilda, daughter of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm III. King of Scotland, and niece to Edgar Atheling, had, on her father's death, and the ſubſequent revolutions of the Scottiſh government, been brought up to England, and educated under her aunt, Chriſtina, in the nunnery of Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey. This princeſs Henry propoſed to marry; but as ſhe had worn the veil, tho' never taken the vows, doubts might ariſe concerning the lawfulneſs of the act; and it behoved him to be very careful not to ſhock, in any particular, the religious prejudices of his ſubjects. The affair was examined by Anſelm in a council of the prelates and nobles, which was ſummoned at Lambeth; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda there proved, that ſhe had put on the veil, not with a view of entering into a religious life, but merely in imitation of a cuſtom, familiar to the Engliſh la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who protected their chaſtity from the brutal violence of the Normans, by taking ſhelter under that habit<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 57.</note>, which, amidſt the horrible licentiouſneſs of the times, was generally revered. The council, ſenſible that even a princeſs had otherwiſe no ſecurity for her honour, admitted this reaſon as valid: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that Matilda was ſtill free to marry<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; and her eſpouſals with Henry were celebrated by Anſelm with great pomp and ſolemnity<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 468.</note>. No act of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0162900301:233"/>
King's reign rendered him equally popular with his Engliſh ſubjects, and tended more to eſtabliſh him on the throne. Tho' Matilda, during the life of her uncle and brothers, was not the heir of the Saxon line, ſhe was become very dear to the Engliſh, on account of her connexions with it: And that people, who, before the conqueſt, had fallen into a kind of indifference towards their antient royal family, had felt ſo ſeverely the tyranny of the Normans, that they reflected with infinite regret on their former liberty, and hoped for a more equal and mild ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, when the blood of their native princes ſhould be united with that of their new ſovereigns<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Invaſion by duke Robert.</note> BUT the policy and prudence of Henry, which, if time had been allowed for theſe virtues to operate their full effect, would have ſecured him poſſeſſion of the crown, ran great hazard of being fruſtrated by the ſudden appearance of Robert, who returned to Normandy about a month after the death of his brother Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. He took poſſeſſion, without reſiſtance, of that dutchy; and immediately made preparations for recovering England, of which, during his abſence, he had, by Henry's intrigues, been ſo unjuſtly defrauded. <label type="milestone">

Robert de Beleſme, earl of Shrewſbury and Arundel, William de la Warenne, earl of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, Arnulf de Montgomery, Walter Giffard, Robert de Pontefract, Robert de Mallet, Yvo de Grentmeſnil, and many others of the principal nobility<note n="†" place="bottom">Order.

Even the ſeamen were affected with the general popularity of his name, and they carried over to him the greateſt part of a fleet, which had been equipped to oppoſe his paſſage<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chron Sax p. 209. Hoveden, p. 469. M. Paris, p. 40. Ann. Waverl. p. 142. Brompton, p. 998. Flor. Wigorn. p. 650.</note>. Henry, in this extremity, began to be apprehenſive for his life, as well as for his crown; and had recourſe to the ſuperſtition of the people, in order to oppoſe their ſentiment of juſtice. He paid diligent court to Anſelm, whoſe ſanctity and wiſdom he pretended to revere. He conſulted him in all difficult emergencies; ſeemed to be governed by him in every meaſure; promiſed a ſtrict regard to eccleſiaſtical privileges; profeſſed a great attachment to Rome, and a reſolution of perſevering in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience to the decrees of councils, and to the will of the ſovereign pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. By theſe careſſes and declarations, he gained entirely the confidence of the primate, whoſe influence over the people, and authority with the barons, was of

the higheſt ſervice to him, in his preſent ſituation.

This victory was followed by the final reduction of Normandy: Roüen immediately ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the conqueror: Falaiſe, after ſome negotiation, opened its gates; and by this acquiſition, beſides rendering himſelf maſter of an important fortreſs, he got into his hands prince William, the only ſon and heir of Robert: He aſſembled the ſtates of Normandy; and having received the homage of all the vaſſals of the dutchy, ſettled the government, revoked his brother's donations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled the caſtles, lately built, he returned into England, and carried along with him the duke as a priſoner.

Henry gave him his liberty, and ſettled a ſmall penſion on him, with which he retired; and he lived to a good old age in England, totally neglected and forgotten.

               <note place="margin">Continuation of the quarrel with Anſelm, the primate.</note> A little after Henry had compleated the conqueſt of Normandy, and ſettled the government of that province, he finiſhed a controverſy, which had been long depending, between him and the Pope, with regard to the inveſtitures in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical benefices; and tho' he was here obliged to relinquiſh ſome of the antient rights of the crown, he extricated himſelf on eaſier terms than moſt princes, who in that age were ſo unhappy as to be engaged in diſputes with the apoſtolic ſee. The King's ſituation, in the beginning of his reign, obliged him to pay great court to Anſelm; and the advantages, which he had reaped from the zealous friendſhip of that prelate, had made him ſenſible how prone the minds of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to ſuperſtition, and what an aſcendant the eccleſiaſtics had been able to aſſume over them. He had ſeen, on the acceſſion of his brother Rufus, that, tho' the rights of primogeniture were then violated, and the inclinations of almoſt all the barons oppoſed, yet the authority of Lanfranc had prevailed over all other conſiderations; and his own caſe, which was ſtill more unfavourable, afforded an inſtance, in which the clergy could ſhow more evidently their influence and authority. Theſe recent examples, while they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body, convinced him, at the ſame time, that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely his intereſt, to retain the former prerogative of the crown in filling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſuch vaſt importance, and to check the eccleſiaſtics in that independance, to which they evidently aſpired. The choice, which his brother, in a fit of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, had made of Anſelm, was ſo far unfortunate to the King's pretenſions, that that prelate was celebrated for his piety and zeal and auſterity of manners; and tho' his monkiſh devotion and narrow principles prognoſticated no great knowledge of the world nor depth of policy, he was, on that very account, a more dangerous inſtrument in the hands of politicians, and retained a greater

aſcendant over the bigotted populace. The prudence and temper of the King appear in nothing more conſpicuous than in the management of this delicate affair; where he was always ſenſible that it had become neceſſary for him to riſque his whole crown, in order to preſerve the moſt invaluable jewel of it<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer. p. 56.</note>.</p>
            <p>ANSELM had no ſooner returned from baniſhment, than his refuſal to do homage to the King excited a diſpute, which Henry evaded at that critical junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by promiſing to ſend a meſſenger, in order to compound the matter with Paſcal the ſecond, who then filled the papal chair. The meſſenger, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably foreſeen, returned with an abſolute refuſal of the King's demands<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 225.</note>; and that fortified by many reaſons, which were well qualified to operate on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men in thoſe ages. Paſcal quoted the ſcriptures to prove that Chriſt was the door; and he thence inferred, that all eccleſiaſtics muſt enter into the church thro' Chriſt alone, not thro' the civil magiſtrate or any profane lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p 60.

            <p>BUT however convincing theſe agreements, they could not perſuade Henry to reſign ſo important a prerogative; and perhaps, as he was poſſeſſed of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and learning, he thought, that the abſurdity of a man's creating his God, even allowing prieſts to be gods, was not urged with the beſt grace by the Roman pontiff. But as he deſired ſtill to avoid, or at leaſt to delay, the coming to any dangerous extremity with the church, he perſuaded Anſelm, that he would be able, by farther negociation, to attain ſome compoſition with Paſcal; and for that purpoſe, he diſpatched three biſhops to Rome, while Anſelm ſent two meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of his own, to be more fully aſſured of the Pope's intentions<note n="§" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 62.

Paſcal wrote back letters equally poſitive and arrogant both to the King and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; urging to the former, that, by aſſuming the right of inveſtitures, he committed a kind of ſpiritual adultery with the church, who was the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and who muſt not admit of ſuch a commerce with any other perſon<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 63.</note>; and inſiſting with the latter, that the pretenſions of Kings to confer benefices was the ſource of all ſimony; a topic which had but too much foundation in thoſe ages<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 64. 66.</note>.</p>

HENRY had now no other expedient than to ſuppreſs the letter addreſſed to himſelf, and to perſuade the three biſhops to prevaricate, and aſſert, upon their epiſcopal faith, that Paſcal had aſſured them in private of his good intentions towards Henry, and of his reſolution not to reſent any future exertion of his prerogative in granting inveſtitures; tho' he himſelf ſcrupled to give this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance under his hand, leſt other princes ſhould copy the example and aſſume a like privilege<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 65.

Anſelm's two meſſengers, who were monks, affirmed to him, that it was impoſſible this ſtory could have any foundation; but their word was not eſteemed equivalent to that of three biſhops; and the King, as if he had finally gained his cauſe, proceeded to fill the ſees of Hereford and Saliſbury, and to inveſt the new biſhops in the uſual manner<note n="†" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 66. W. Malm. p. 225. Hoveden, p. 469. Sim. Dunelm, p. 228.</note>. But Anſelm, who, as he had good reaſon, gave no credit to the aſſeveration of the King's meſſengers, refuſed not only to conſecrate them, but even to communicate with them; and the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves, finding how odious they had become, returned back to Henry the enſigns of their dignity<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 470. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 59. Flor. Wigorn. p. 651.</note>. The quarrel every day encreaſed between the King and the primate: The former, notwithſtanding the great prudence and moderation of his temper, threw out menaces againſt all ſuch as ſhould pretend to oppoſe him in exerting the antient prerogatives of his crown: And Anſelm, ſenſible of his diſagreeable and dangerous ſituation, deſired leave to make a journey to Rome, in order to lay the caſe before the ſovereign pontiff<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 70. W. Malm. p 226.</note>. Henry, well pleaſed to rid himſelf without violence of ſo inflexible an antagoniſt, readily granted him permiſſion; and Anſelm ſet out on his journey. He was attended to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt by inſinite multitudes, not only monks and clergymen, but people of all ranks, who ſcrupled not in this manner to declare for their primate againſt their ſovereign, and who regarded his departure as the final abolition of religion and true piety in the kingdom<note n="§" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 71.</note>.

            <p>THE policy of the court of Rome has been commonly much admired; and men, judging by ſucceſs, have beſtowed the higheſt eulogies on that prudence; by which a power, from ſuch ſlender beginnings, could advance, without force of arms, to eſtabliſh an univerſal and almoſt abſolute monarchy in Europe. But the wiſdom of ſuch a long ſucceſſion of men, who filled the papal throne, and who were of ſuch different ages, tempers, and intereſts, is not intelligible, and could never have place in nature. The inſtrument, indeed, with which they wrought, the ignorance and ſuperſtition of the people, is ſo groſs an engine, of ſuch univerſal prevalence, and ſo little liable to accident or diſorder, that it may be ſucceſsful even in the moſt unſkilful hands; and ſcarce any indiſcretion can fruſtrate its operations. While the court of Rome was openly abandoned to the moſt flagrant diſorders, even while it was torne with ſchiſms and factions, the power of the church made daily a ſenſible progreſs in Europe; and the temerity of Gregory and the caution of Paſcal were equally fortunate in promoting it. The clergy, feeling the neceſſity of protection againſt the violence of princes, or vigor of the laws, were well pleaſed to adhere to a foreign head, who, being removed from the fear of the civil authority, could freely employ the power of the whole church to defend their antient or uſurped properties and privileges, when invaded in any particular country: The monks, deſirous of an independance on their dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans, profeſſed ſtill a more devoted attachment to the triple crown; and the ſtupid people poſſeſſed no ſcience nor reaſon, which they could oppoſe to the moſt exorbitant pretenſions. Nonſenſe paſſed for demonſtration: The moſt criminal

means were ſanctified by the piety of the end: Treaties were not ſuppoſed to be binding where the intereſts of God were concerned: The antient laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſtates had no authority againſt a divine right: Impudent forgeries were received as authentic monuments of antiquity: And the champions of holy church, if ſucceſsful, were celebrated as heroes; if unfortunate, were worſhiped as martyrs; and all events thus turned out equally to the advantage of clerical uſurpations. Paſcal himſelf, the preſent Pope, was, in the courſe of this very controverſy concerning inveſtitures, involved in circumſtances, and neceſſitated to follow a conduct, which would have drawn diſgrace and ruin on any temporal prince, that had been ſo unfortunate as to fall into a like ſituation. His perſon was ſeized by the Emperor Henry V. and he was obliged, by a formal treaty, to reſign to that monarch the right of granting inveſtitures, for which they had ſo long contended<note n="*" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 167.</note>. In order to add greater ſolemnity to this agreement, the Emperor and Pope communicated together on the ſame hoſtie; one half of which was given to the prince, the other taken by the pontiff: The moſt tremendous imprecations were publicly denounced on either of them who ſhould violate the treaty: Yet no ſooner did Paſcal recover his liberty, than he recalled all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and pronounced the ſentence of excommunication againſt the Emperor, who, in the end, was obliged to ſubmit to the terms required of him, and to yield up all his pretenſions, which he could never recall<note n="†" place="bottom">Padre Paolo ſopra benef. eccleſ. p. 112.

            <p>THE King of England had very nearly fallen into the ſame dangerous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Paſcal had already excommunicated the earl of Meulent, and the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Henry, who were inſtrumental in ſupporting his pretenſions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 79.</note>: He daily menaced the King himſelf with a like ſentence; and he ſuſpended the blow only to give him leiſure to eſcape it by a timely ſubmiſſion. The malecontents waited impatiently for the opportunity of diſturbing his government by conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and inſurrections<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 80.</note>: The King's greateſt friends were ſolicitous at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of an incident, which would ſet their religious and civil duties at variance with each other: And the counteſs of Blois, his ſiſter, a princeſs of piety, who had great influence over him, was affrighted with the danger of her brother's eternal damnation<note n="§" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 79.</note>. Henry, on the other hand, ſeemed determined to run all hazards, rather than reſign a prerogative of ſuch importance, which had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by all his predeceſſors; and it ſeemed probable, from his great prudence and ability, that he might be able to ſuſtain his rights, and finally prevail in the conteſt.

The pontiff was well pleaſed to have made this acquiſition, which, he hoped, would in time involve the whole: And the King, anxious to procure an eſcape from a very dangerous ſituation, was contented to retain ſome, tho' a more precarious authority, in the election of prelates.</p>
            <p>AFTER the principal controverſy was accommodated, it was not difficult to adjuſt the other differences. The Pope allowed Anſelm to communicate with the prelates, who had already received inveſtitures from the crown; and he only required of them ſome ſubmiſſions for their paſt miſconduct<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 87.</note>. He alſo granted Anſelm a plenary power of remedying every other diſorder, which, he ſaid, might ariſe from the barbarouſneſs of the country<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 91.</note>. Such was the idea which the Popes then entertained of the Engliſh; and nothing can be a ſtronger proof of the miſerable ignorance in which that people were then plunged, than that a man, who ſat on the papal throne, and who ſubſiſted by abſurdities and nonſenſe, ſhould think himſelf intitled to treat them as barbarians.</p>
            <p>DURING the courſe of theſe controverſies, a ſynod was held at Weſtminſter, where the King, intent only on the main diſpute, allowed ſome canons of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0162900301:243"/>
to be enacted, which tended to promote the uſurpations of the clergy. The marriage of prieſts was prohibited; a point which it was ſtill found very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to carry into execution: And even laymen were not allowed to marry within the ſeventh degree of affinity<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 67, 68. Spelm. Conc. vol. 2. p. 22.</note>. By this contrivance, the Pope aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the profits, which he reaped from granting diſpenſations; and likewiſe thoſe from divorces. For as the art of writing was then rare, and pariſh-regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not regularly kept, it was n t eaſy to aſcertain the degrees of affinity even among people of rank; and any man, who had money ſufficient to pay for it, might obtain a divorce, under pretence that his wife was more nearly related to him than was permitted by the canons. The ſynod alſo paſſed a vote, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the laity to wear long hair<note n="†" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 68.</note>. The averſion of the clergy to this mode was not confined to England. When the King went over to Normandy, before he had conquered that province, the biſhop of Seez, in a formal harangue, earneſtly applied to him to redreſs the manifold diſorders under which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laboured, and to oblige the people to poll their hair in a decent form. Henry, tho' he would not reſign his prerogatives to the church, was very will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with his hair: He cut it in the form which they required of him, and obliged all the courtiers to imitate his example<note n="‡" place="bottom">Order.

Lewis the Groſs, ſon of Philip, was

at this time King of France, a brave and generous prince, who having been obliged, during the lifetime of his father, to fly into England, in order to eſcape the perſecutions of his ſtepmother, Bertrude, had been protected by Henry, and had thence conceived a perſonal friendſhip for him. But theſe ties were ſoon diſſolved after the acceſſion of Lewis, who found his intereſts to be in ſo ma y particulars oppoſite to thoſe of the Engliſh monarch, and who became ſenſible of the danger attending the annexation of Normandy to England. He joined, therefore, the counts of Anjou and Flanders in giving diſquiet to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's government; and this monarch, in order to defend his foreign dominions, found himſelf obliged to go over to Normandy, where he reſided two years. The war which enſued among theſe princes was attended with no memorable tranſaction, and produced only ſlight ſkirmiſhes on the ſrontiers, agreeable to the weak condition of the ſovereigns in that age, whenever their ſubjects were not rouzed by ſome great and urgent occaſion.

            <p>LEWIS, finding himſelf unable to wreſt Normandy from the King by force of arms, had recourſe to the dangerous expedient, of applying to the ſpiritual power, and of affording the eccleſiaſtics a pretence to interpoſe in the temporal intereſts of princes. <label type="milestone">

The complaints of the Norman prince were thenceforth heard with great coldneſs by the council; and Calixtus confeſſed, after a conference, which he had the ſame ſummer with Henry, that, of all men, whom he had ever yet been acquainted with, he was beyond compariſon the moſt eloquent and perſuaſive.</p>
            <p>THE warlike meaſures of Lewis proved as ineffectual as his intrigues. He had laid a ſcheme for ſurprizing Noyon; but Henry, having received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the deſign, marched to the relief of the place, and ſuddenly attacked the French at Andeley, as they were advancing to Noyon. A ſharp action en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; where William, the ſon of Robert, behaved with great bravery, and the King himſelf was in the moſt imminent danger.

The dignity of the perſons, engaged in this ſkirmiſh, rendered it the moſt memorable action of the war: For in other reſpects, it was not of great importance.

The Pope, in the year 1101, had ſent Guy, archbiſhop of Vienne, as legate into Britain; and tho' he was the firſt that for many years had appeared there in that character, and his commiſſion gave general ſurprize<note n="*" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 58.</note>, the King, who was then in the commencement of his reign, and was attended with many difficulties, was obliged to ſubmit to this incroachment on his authority. But in the year 1116, Anſelm, abbot of St. Sabas, who was coming over with a like legatine commiſſion, was prohibited to enter the kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 474.</note>; and Pope Calixtus, who in his turn was then labouring under many difficulties, by reaſon of the pretenſions of Gregory, an anti-pope, was obliged to promiſe, that he never would for the future, except when ſolicited by the King himſelf, ſend any legate into England<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eadmer, p. 125, 137, 138.</note>. Notwithſtanding this engagement, the Pope, ſo ſoon as he had ſuppreſſed his antagoniſt, granted the Cardinal de Crema a legatine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for that kingdom; and the King, who, by reaſon of his nephew's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and invaſions, found himſelf at that time in a dangerous ſituation, was obliged to ſubmit to the exerciſe of this commiſſion<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron. Sax. p. 229.</note>. A ſynod was called by the legate at London; where, among other canons, a vote paſſed, enacting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties on the marriage of the clergy<note n="§" place="bottom">Spelm. Conc. vol. 2. p. 34.</note>; and the Cardinal, in a public ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, declared it to be an unpardonable enormity, that a prieſt ſhould dare to conſecrate and touch the body of Chriſt immediately after he had riſen from the ſide of a ſtrumpet: For that was the decent appellation which he gave to the wives of the clergy. But it happened, that, the very next night, the officers of juſtice, breaking into a diſorderly houſe, found the Cardinal in bed with a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 478.

            <p>HENRY, in order to prevent this alternate revolution of conceſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, ſent William, then archbiſhop of Canterbury, to remonſtrate with the court of Rome againſt theſe abuſes, and to aſſert the liberties of the Engliſh churches. It was an uſual maxim with every Pope, when he found that he could not prevail in any pretenſion, to grant princes or ſtates a power which they had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0162900301:250"/>
always exerciſed, to reſume at a proper ſeaſon the claim which ſeemed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and to pretend, that the civil magiſtrate had poſſeſſed the authority only from a ſpecial indulgence of the Roman pontiff. After this manner, the Pope, finding that the French nation would not admit his claim of granting inveſtitures, had paſſed a bull, giving the king that authority; and he now practiſed a like invention to elude the complaints of the King of England. He made the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury his legate, renewed his commiſſion from time to time, and ſtill pretended, that the rights, which that prelate had ever exerciſed as metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, were entirely derived from the indulgence of the apoſtolic ſee. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh princes, and Henry in particular, who were glad to avoid any preſent conteſt of ſo dangerous a nature, commonly acquieſced by their ſilence in theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the court of Rome<note n="*" place="bottom">The legates <hi>a latere,</hi> as they were called, were a kind of delegates, who poſſeſſed the full power of the Pope in all the provinces committed to their charge, and were very buſy in extending, as well as exerciſing it. They nominated to all vacant benefices, aſſembled ſynods, and were anxious to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eccleſiaſtical privileges, which never could be fully protected without incroachments on the civil power. If there was the leaſt concurrence or oppoſition, it was always ſuppoſed that the civil power was to give way: Every deed, which had the leaſt pretence of holding of any thing ſpiritual, as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, teſtaments, promiſſory oaths, were brought into the ſpiritual court, and could not be canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before a civil magiſtrate. Theſe were the eſtabliſhed laws of the church; and where a legate was ſent immediately from Rome, he was ſure to maintain the papal claims with the utmoſt rigor: But it was an advantage to the King to have the archbiſhop of Canterbury appointed legate, becauſe the connexions of that prelate with the kingdom tended to moderate his meaſures.</note>.</p>

His perſon was manly, his countenance engaging, his eyes clear, ſerene, and penetrating. The affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his addreſs encouraged thoſe who might be overawed by the ſenſe of his dignity or of his wiſdom; and tho' he often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how to temper it with diſcretion, and ever kept at a diſtance from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent familiarities with his courtiers. His ſuperior eloquence and judgment would have given him an aſcendant even had he been born in a private ſtation; and his perſonal bravery would have procured him reſpect, even tho' it had been leſs ſupported by art and policy. By his great progreſs in literature, he acquired the name of <hi>Beau-clerc</hi> or the ſcholar; but his application to theſe ſedentary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits abated nothing of the activity and vigilance of his government; and tho' the learning of that age was better fitted to corrupt than improve the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his natural good ſenſe preſerved itſelf untainted both from the pedantry and ſuperſtition, which were then ſo prevalent among men of letters. His temper was very ſuſceptible of the ſentiments as well of friendſhip as of reſentment<note n="†" place="bottom">Order. Vital. p. 805.</note>; and his ambition, tho' high, might be eſteemed moderate and reaſonable; had not his conduct towards his brother and nephew ſhowed that he was too much diſpoſed to ſacrifice to it all the maxims of juſtice and equity. But the total incapacity of Robert for government afforded his younger brother a reaſon or pretence for ſeizing the ſcepter both of Normandy and England; and when vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and uſurpation are once begun, neceſſity obliges a prince to continue in the ſame criminal courſe, and engages him in meaſures, which his better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſounder principles would otherwiſe have induced him to reject with warmth and indignation.</p>
            <p>KING Henry was much addicted to women; and hiſtorians mention no leſs than ſeven illegitimate ſons and ſix daughters, who were born to him<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gul.

Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was alſo one of his favourite amuſements; and he exerciſed great rigor on thoſe who encroached on the royal foreſts, which were augmented during this reign<note n="‖" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 179.</note>, tho' their number and extent were already enormous. To kill a ſtag was as criminal as to murder a man: He made all the dogs be mutilated, which were kept on the borders of his foreſts: And he ſometimes deprived his ſubjects of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0162900301:252"/>
liberty of hunting on their own lands, or even cutting their own woods. In other reſpects, he executed juſtice, and that with rigor; the beſt maxim which a prince in that age could follow. Stealing was firſt made capital in this reign<note n="*" place="bottom">Sim. Dunelm. p. 231. Brompton, p. 1000. Flor. Wigorn, p. 653.

Dunelm. p. 231. Brompton, p. 1000. Hoveden, p. 471. Annal. Waverl. p. 149.</note>. Near fifty criminals of this kind were at one time hanged or mutilated; and tho' theſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments ſeem to have been exerciſed in ſomewhat an arbitrary manner, they were grateful to the people, more attentive to preſent advantages, than jealous of general laws. There is a code, which paſſes under the name of Henry I. but the beſt antiquarians have agreed not to think it genuine. It is however a very antient compilation, and may be uſeful to inſtruct us in the manners and cuſtoms of the times. It appears from it, that a great diſtinction was then made between the Engliſh and Normans, much to the advantage of the latter<note n="‡" place="bottom">LL. Hen. 1. § 18, 75.</note>.

            <p>HENRY, on his acceſſion, granted a charter to London, which ſeems to have been the firſt ſtep towards rendering that city a corporation.

Theſe, with a confirmation of the privileges of their court of Huſtings, wardmotes, and common halls, and their liberty of hunting in Middleſex and Surrey, are the chief articles of this charter<note n="§" place="bottom">Lambardi Archaionomia ex edit.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1135</label> IN the progreſs and ſettlement of the feudal law, the male ſucceſſion to fiefs had taken place ſome time before the female was admitted; and eſtates, being conſidered as military benefices, not as property, were tranſmitted to ſuch only as could ſerve in the armies, and perform in perſon the conditions upon which they were originally granted. But after that the continuance of rights, during ſome generations, in the ſame family, had, in ſome meaſure, obliterated the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive idea, the females were gradually admitted to the poſſeſſion of feudal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and the ſame revolution of principles, which procured them the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of private eſtates, naturally introduced their ſucceſſion to government and authority. The failure, therefore, of male-heirs to the kingdom of England and dutchy of Normandy, ſeemed to leave the ſucceſſion open, without a rival, to the empreſs, Matilda; and as Henry had made all his vaſſals in both ſtates ſwear fealty to her, he preſumed, that they would not eaſily be induced to depart at once from her hereditary right, and from their own reiterated oaths and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. But the irregular manner, in which he himſelf had acquired the crown, might inſtruct him, that neither his Norman nor Engliſh ſubjects were as yet capable of adhering to a ſtrict rule of government; and as every precedent of this kind ſeems to give authority to new uſurpations, he had reaſon to dread, even from his own family, ſome invaſion of his daughter's title, which he had taken ſuch pains to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>Adela, daughter of William, the Conqueror, had been married to Stephen, count of Blois, and had brought him ſeveral ſons; among whom, Stephen, and Henry, the two youngeſt, had been invited over to England by the late King, and had received great honours, riches, and preferment from the zealous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which that prince bore to every one, that had been ſo fortunate as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0162900301:254"/>
his favour and good opinion. Henry, who had betaken himſelf to the eccleſiaſtical profeſſion, was created abbot of Glaſtenbury and biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter; and tho' theſe dignities were conſiderable, Stephen, his brother, had, from his uncle's liberality, attained eſtabliſhments ſtill more ſolid and durable<note n="*" place="bottom">Gul. Neubr. p 360. Brompton, p. 1023.</note>. The King had married him to Matilda, who was daughter and heir of Euſtace count of Boulogne, and who brought him, beſides that feudal ſovereignty in France, an immenſe property in England, which, in the diſtribution of lands, had been conferred by the Conqueror on the family of Boulogne. Stephen alſo by this marriage acquired a new connexion with the royal family of England; as Mary, his wife's mother, was ſiſter to David, the preſent King of Scotland, and to Matilda, the firſt wife of Henry, and mother of the empreſs. The King, ſtill imagining, that he ſtrengthened the intereſts of his family by the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement of Stephen, took a pleaſure in enriching him by the grant of new poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; and he conferred on him the great eſtate forfeited by Robert Mallet in England, and that forfeited by the earl of Mortaigne in Normandy. Stephen, in return, profeſſed a great attachment to his uncle; and appeared ſo zealous for the ſucceſſion of Matilda, that when the barons ſwore fealty to that princeſs, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Robert, earl of Gloceſter, the King's natural ſon, who ſhould firſt be admitted to give her this teſtimony of devoted zeal and fidelity<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Malm. p. 192.</note>. Mean while, he continued to cultivate, by every art of popularity, the friendſhip and affection of the Engliſh nation; and many virtues, with which he ſeemed to be endowed, favoured the ſucceſs of his intentions. By his bravery, activity and vigor, he acquired the eſteem of the barons: By his generoſity, and by an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and familiar addreſs, unuſual in that age among men of his high quality, he obtained the affections of the people, particularly of the Londoners<note n="‡" place="bottom">W.

And tho' he dared not to take any ſteps towards his farther grandeur, leſt he might expoſe himſelf to the jealouſy of ſo penetrating a prince as Henry; he ſtill hoped, that, by accumulating riches and power, and by acquiring popularity, he might ſome time be able to open his way to the throne.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had Henry expired, than Stephen, inſenſible to all the ties of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and fidelity, and blind to danger, gave full reins to his criminal ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and truſted, that, even without any previous intrigue, the celerity of his enterprize and the boldneſs of his attempt might overcome the weak attachment, which the Engliſh and Normans in that age bore to the laws, and to the rights of their ſovereign. He haſtened over to England; and tho' the citizens of Dover, and thoſe of Canterbury, apprized of his purpoſe, ſhut their gates againſt him,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0162900301:255"/>
he ſtopped not till he arrived at London, where ſome of the lower rank, inſtigated by his emiſſaries, as well as moved by his general popularity, immediately ſaluted him King. His next point was to acquire the good will of the clergy; and by performing the ceremony of his coronation, put himſelf in poſſeſſion of the throne, from which, he was confident, it would not be eaſy afterwards to expel him. His brother, the biſhop of Wincheſter, was uſeful to him in theſe capital articles; and having gained Roger, biſhop of Saliſbury<note n="*" place="bottom">H. Hunt. p. 386. Gul. Neubr. p. 360. 362.

The primate, who, as well as all the others, had ſworn fealty to Matilda, refuſed to perform this ceremony<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſt. Steph. p. 929.</note>; but his oppoſition was overcome by an expedient equally diſhonourable with the other ſteps, by which this great revolution was effected. Hugh Bigod, ſteward of the houſhold, made oath before the primate, that the late King, on his death-bed, had diſcovered a diſſatisfaction with his daughter Matilda, and had expreſſed his intention of leaving the count of Boulogne heir to all his dominions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. Paris, p. 51. Diceto, p. 505. Chron. Dunſt. p. 23.</note>. <note place="margin">22d Decem.</note> William, either believing or feigning to believe, Bigod's teſtimony, anointed Stephen, and put the crown upon his head; and by this religious ceremony, that prince, without any ſhadow either of hereditary title or conſent of the nobility or people, was allowed to proceed to the exerciſe of ſovereign authority. Very few barons attended his coronation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1023.</note>; but none oppoſed his uſurpation, however unjuſt or flagrant. The ſentiment of religion, which, if corrupted into ſuperſtition, has often little efficacy in fortifying the duties of civil ſociety, overlooked the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied oaths, taken in favour of Matilda, and only rendered the people obedient to a prince, who was countenanced by the clergy, and who had received from the primate the rite of royal unction and conſecration<note n="§" place="bottom">Such ſtreſs was formerly laid on the rite of coronation, that the monkiſh writers never give any prince the title of King, till he is crowned; tho' he had for ſome time been in poſſeſſion of the crown, and exerciſed all the powers of ſovereignty.</note>.</p>
            <p>STEPHEN, that he might farther ſecure his tottering throne, paſſed a charter, in which he made liberal promiſes to all orders of men; to the clergy, that he would ſpeedily fill all vacant benefices, and would never draw the rents of any of them during the interval; to the nobility, that they ſhould not be proſecuted for hunting in their own foreſts; and to the people, that he would remit the tax of

ROBERT, earl of Gloceſter, natural ſon of the late King, was a man of honour and ability; and as he was much attached to the intereſts of his ſiſter, Matilda, and zealous for the lineal ſucceſſion to the crown, it was chiefly from his intrigues and reſiſtance, that the King had reaſon to dread a new revolution of government. This nobleman, when he received intelligence of Stephen's acceſſion, was much embarraſſed concerning the meaſures, which he ſhould purſue in that difficult emergency. To ſwear allegiance to the uſurper appeared to him very diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and a breach of his oath to Matilda: To refuſe giving this pledge of his fidelity was to baniſh himſelf from England, and be totally incapacitated from ſerving the royal family, or contributing to their reſtoration<note n="*" place="bottom">Malmeſ. p. 179.</note>. He offered Stephen to do him homage and to take the oath of fealty; but with an expreſs condition, that the King ſhould maintain all his ſtipulations, and ſhould never invade any of Robert's rights or dignities: And Stephen, tho' ſenſible, that this reſerve, ſo unuſual in itſelf, and ſo unbefitting the duty of a ſubject, was meant only to afford Robert a pretence for a revolt on the firſt favourable opportunity, was obliged, by the numerous friends and retainers of that nobleman, to receive him on theſe terms<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.

The barons, in return for their ſubmiſſion, exacted terms ſtill more deſtructive of public peace, as well as of royal authority: Many of them required the right of fortifying their caſtles, and of putting themſelves in a poſture of defence, and the King found himſelf totally unable to refuſe his conſent to this exorbitant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<note n="‖" place="bottom">Malmeſ. p. 180.</note>. All England was immediately filled with theſe fortreſſes, which the noblemen garriſoned, either with their vaſſals, or with licentious ſoldiers, who flocked to them from all quarters. Unbounded rapine was exerciſed upon the people for the maintenance of theſe troops; and private animoſities, which had with difficulty been reſtrained by law, now breaking out without controul, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered England a ſcene of uninterrupted violence and devaſtation. Wars between the nobles were carried on with the utmoſt fury in every quarter; the barons even aſſumed the right of coining money, and of exerciſing, without appeal, every act of juriſdiction<note n="§" place="bottom">Trivet. p. 19.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0162900301:258"/>
and by aſſiſting him in his rapine upon others. The erection of one caſtle proved the immediate cauſe of building many more; and even thoſe, who obtained not the King's permiſſion, thought themſelves intitled, by the great principle of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation, to put themſelves on an equal footing with their neighbours, who commonly were alſo their enemies and rivals. The ariſtocratical power, which is ſo tyrannical and oppreſſive in the feudal governments, had now riſen to its utmoſt height, during the reign of a prince, who tho', endowed with vigor and ability, had uſurped the throne without the pretence of a title, and who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to tolerate in others the ſame violence, to which he himſelf had been beholden for his ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>BUT Stephen was not of a diſpoſition to ſubmit long to theſe uſurpations, without making ſome efforts for the recovery of royal authority. Finding that the legal prerogatives of the crown were reſiſted and abridged, he was alſo tempted to make his power the ſole meaſure of his conduct; and to violate all thoſe conceſſions, which he himſelf had made on his acceſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">W.

            <p>THO' the exorbitant power of the church, in antient times, weakened the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the crown, and interrupted the courſe of the laws, it may be doubted, whether, in ages of ſuch violence and outrage, it was not rather advantageous that ſome limits were ſet to the power of the ſword, both in the hands of the prince and nobles, and that men were taught to pay regard to ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and privileges. The chief misfortune was, that the prelates, on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, acted entirely as barons, employed military power againſt their ſovereign or their neighbours, and thereby often increaſed thoſe diſorders, which it was their duty to repreſs. The biſhop of Saliſbury, in imitation of the nobility, had built two ſtrong caſtles, one at Sherborne, another at the Devizes, and had laid the foundations of a third at Malmeſbury: His nephew, Alexander biſhop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, had erected a fortreſs at Newark: <label type="milestone">

Religion only, not politics, carried abroad the views of princes; and either fixed their thoughts on the Holy Land, whoſe conqueſt and defence was deemed a point of common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and intereſt, or engaged them in intrigues with the court of Rome, to whom they had yielded the direction of eccleſiaſtical affairs, and who was every day aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming more authority than they were willing to allow her.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the conqueſt of England by the duke of Normandy, this iſland was as much ſeparated from the reſt of the world in politics as in ſituation; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from the inroads of the Daniſh pirates, the Engliſh, happily confined at

home, had neither enemies nor allies on the continent. The foreign dominions of William connected them with the Kings and great vaſſals of France; and while the oppoſite pretenſions of the Pope and Emperor in Italy produced a continual intercourſe between Germany and that country, the two great monarchs of France and England formed, in another part of Europe, a ſeparate ſyſtem, and carried on their wars and negotiations, without meeting either with oppoſition or ſupport from the others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">State of France.</note> ON the decline of the Carlovingian race, the nobles, in every province of France, taking advantage of the ſovereign's weakneſs, and obliged to provide, each for his own defence, againſt the ravages of the Norman freebooters, had aſſumed, both in civil and military affairs, an authority almoſt independant, and had reduced, within very narrow limits, the prerogative of their princes. The acceſſion of Hugh Capet, by annexing a great fief to the crown, had brought ſome addition of power to the royal dignity; but this fief, tho' conſiderable for a ſubject, appeared a narrow baſis of force, in a prince who was placed at the head of ſo great a community. The royal demeſnes conſiſted only of Paris, Orleans, Eſtampes, Compiegne, and a few places, ſcattered over the northern provinces: In all the reſt of the kingdom, the prince's authority was more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal than real: The vaſſals were accuſtomed, nay intitled, to make war, without his permiſſion, on each other: They were even entitled, if they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be injured, to turn their arms againſt their ſovereign: They exerciſed all civil juriſdiction, without appeal, over their tenants and inferior vaſſals: Their common jealouſy of the crown eaſily united them againſt any attempt on their exorbitant privileges; and as ſome of them had attained the power and authority of great princes, even the ſmalleſt baron was ſure of immediate and effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Beſides ſix eccleſiaſtical peerages, which, with the other immunities of the church, cramped extremely the general execution of juſtice; there were ſix lay-peerages, Burgundy, Normandy, Guienne, Flanders, Tholouſe, and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, which formed very extenſive and puiſſant ſovereignties. And tho' the combination of all theſe princes and barons could on occaſion muſter a mighty power: Yet was it very difficult to ſet that great machine in movement; it was almoſt impoſſible to preſerve harmony in its parts; a ſenſe of common intereſt alone could, for a time, unite them under their ſovereign againſt a common enemy; but if the King attempted to turn the force of the community againſt any mutinous vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, the ſame ſenſe of common intereſt made the others oppoſe themſelves to the ſucceſs of his pretenſions. Lewis the Groſs, the laſt ſovereign, marched, at one time, to his frontiers againſt the Germans at the head of an army of two hundred thouſand men; but a petty lord of Corbeil, of Puiſet, of Couci, was able, at
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0162900301:270"/>
another time, to ſet that prince at defiance, and to maintain open war againſt him.</p>
            <p>THE authority of the Engliſh monarch was much more extenſive within his kingdom, and the diſproportion much greater between him and the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his vaſſals. His demeſnes and revenue were very large, compared to the greatneſs of his ſtate: He was accuſtomed to levy arbitrary exactions from his ſubjects: His courts of judicature exerciſed juriſdiction in every part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: He could cruſh by his power, or by a judicial ſentence, well or ill found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, any obnoxious baron: And tho' the feudal inſtitutions, which prevailed in his kingdom, had the ſame tendency, as in other ſtates, to exalt the ariſtocracy, and depreſs the monarchy, it required, in England, according to its preſent conſtitution, a great combination of the vaſſals to oppoſe their ſovereign lord, and there had not hitherto ariſen any baron ſo powerful, as of himſelf to make war againſt the prince, and afford protection to the inferior barons.</p>
            <p>WHILE ſuch were the different ſituations of France and England, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enjoyed ſo great advantages over the former; the acceſſion of Henry II. a prince of great abilities, poſſeſſed of ſo many rich provinces on the continent, might appear an event dangerous, if not fatal, to the French monarchy, and ſufficient to break entirely the ballance between the ſtates. He was maſter, in the right of his father, of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine; in that of his mother, of Normandy; in that of his wife, of Guienne, Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Perigord, Angoumois, the Limouſin. He ſoon after annexed Britanny to his other ſtates, and was already poſſeſſed of the ſuperiority over that province, which, on the firſt ceſſion of Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had, by Charles the Simple, been granted in vaſſalage to that formidable ravager. Theſe provinces compoſed above a third of the whole French monarchy, and were much ſuperior, in extent and opulence, to thoſe territories, which were ſubjected to the immediate juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and government of the King. The vaſſal was here more powerful than his liege lord: The ſituation, which had enabled Hugh Capet to depoſe the Carlovingian princes, ſeemed here to be renewed, and that with much greater advantages on the ſide of the vaſſal: And when England was added to ſo many provinces, the French King had reaſon to apprehend, from this conjuncture, ſome great diſaſter to himſelf and to his family. But in reality, it was this circumſtance, which appeared ſo formidable, that ſaved the Capetian race, and by its conſequences, exalted them to that pitch of grandeur, which they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoy.</p>
            <p>THE limited authority of the prince in the feudal conſtitutions prevented the King of England from employing with advantage the force of ſo many ſtates,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0162900301:271"/>
which were ſubjected to his government; and theſe different members, disjoined in ſituation, and diſagreeing in laws, language and manners, were never thoroughly cemented into one monarchy. He ſoon became, both from his diſtant place of reſidence and from the incompatability of intereſts, a kind of foreigner to his French dominions; and his ſubjects on the continent conſidered their allegiance as more naturally due to their ſuperior lord, who lived in their neighbourhood, and who was acknowledged to be the ſupreme head of their nation. He was always at hand to invade them; their immediate lord was often at too great a diſtance to protect them; and any diſorder in any part of his diſperſed dominions gave advantages againſt him. The other powerful vaſſals of the French crown were rather pleaſed to ſee the expulſion of the Engliſh, and were not affected with that jealouſy, which would have ariſen from the oppreſſion of a co-vaſſal, who was of the ſame rank with themſelves. By this means, the King of France found it more eaſy to conquer theſe numerous provinces from England, than to ſubdue a duke of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou, Maine or Poictou. And after reducing ſuch extenſive territories, which immediately co-alited with the body of the monarchy, he found greater facility of uniting to the crown the other great fiefs, which ſtill remained ſeparate and independant.</p>
            <p>BUT as theſe important conſequences could not be foreſeen by human wiſdom, the French King remarked with terror the riſing grandeur of the houſe of Anjou or Plantagenet; and in order to retard its progreſs, he had ever maintained a ſtrict union with Stephen, and had endeavoured to ſupport the tottering fortunes of that bold uſurper. But after this prince's death, it was too late to think of oppoſing the ſucceſſion of Henry, or preventing the performance of thoſe ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which, with the unanimous conſent of the nation, he had made with his predeceſſor. The Engliſh, tired with civil wars, and diſguſted with the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and depredations, which, during the courſe of ſo many years, had attended them, were little diſpoſed to violate their oaths, by excluding the lawful heir from the ſucceſſion of their monarchy<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth.

Geoffrey, the King's brother, died ſoon after he had acquired poſſeſſion of Nantz; and tho' he had no other title to that county, than the voluntary ſubmiſſion or election of the inhabitants two years before, Henry laid claim to the territory as devolved to him by hereditary right, and he went over to ſupport his pretenſions by force of arms.

               </label> THE King had a proſpect of making ſtill farther acquiſitions; and the activity of his temper allowed no opportunity of that kind to eſcape him. Philippa, dutcheſs of Guienne, mother of Queen Eleanor, was the only iſſue of William IV. count of Thoulouſe; and ſhould have inherited his dominions, had not that prince, deſirous of preſerving the ſucceſſion in the male-line, conveyed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality to his brother, Raymond de St. Gilles, by a contract of ſale which was in that age regarded as fictitious and illuſory. By this means, the title to the county of Thoulouſe came to be diſputed between the male and female heirs; and the one or the other, as opportunities favoured them, had obtained poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Alfonſo, the ſon of Raymond, was the reigning ſovereign; and on Henry's reviving his wife's claim, this prince had recourſe for protection to the King of France, who was ſo much concerned in policy to prevent the farther aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Engliſh monarch. Lewis himſelf, when married to Eleanor, had aſſerted the juſtice of her claim, and had demanded poſſeſſion of Thoulouſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Newb. p. 387. Chron. W. Heming. p. 494.</note>; but his ſentiments changing with his intereſt, he now determined to defend, by his power and authority, the title of Alfonſo. Henry found, that it would be requiſite to ſupport his pretenſions againſt potent antagoniſts; and that nothing but a great army could maintain a claim, which he had in vain aſſerted by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and manifeſtos.</p>
            <p>AN army, compoſed of feudal vaſſals, was commonly very intractable and undiſciplined, both becauſe of the independent ſpirit of the perſons who ſerved in it, and becauſe the commands were not given either by the choice of the ſovereign or from the military capacity and experience of the officers. Each baron con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his own vaſſals: His rank was greater or leſs, proportioned to the extent of his property: Even the ſupreme command under the prince was often attached to birth: And as the military vaſſals were obliged to ſerve only forty days at their own charge; tho', if the expedition was diſtant, they were put to great expence;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0162900301:275"/>
the prince reaped very little benefit from their attendance. Henry, ſenſible of theſe inconveniencies, levied upon his vaſſals in Normandy and other provinces, which were remote from Thoulouſe, a ſum of money in lieu of their ſervice; and this commutation, by reaſon of the great diſtance, was ſtill more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for his Engliſh vaſſals. He impoſed, therefore, a ſcutage of three pounds on each knight's fee, a condition, to which, tho' it was unuſual, and the firſt perhaps to be met with in hiſtory<note n="*" place="bottom">Pere Daniel, vol. 1. p. 1216. Gervas, p. 1381.</note>, the military tenants willingly ſubmitted; and with this money, he levied an army which was more under his command, and whoſe ſervice was more durable and conſtant. Aſſiſted by Berenger, count of Barcelona, and Trincaval, count of Niſmes, whom he had gained over to his party, he invaded the county of Thoulouſe; and after taking Verdun, Chaſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau, and other places, he beſieged the capital of the province, and was likely to prevail in the enterprize; when Lewis, advancing before the arrival of his main body, threw himſelf into the place with a ſmall reinforcement. Henry was urged by ſome of his miniſters to proſecute the ſiege, to take Lewis priſoner, and to impoſe his own terms in the pacification; but he either thought it ſo much his intereſt to maintain the feudal principles, by which his foreign dominions were ſecured, or bore ſo much reſpect to his ſuperior lord, that he declared he would not attack a place defended by him in perſon; and he immediately raiſed the ſiege<note n="†" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 22. Diceto, p. 531.</note>. He marched into Normandy to protect that province againſt an incurſion, which the count of Dreux, inſtigated by King Lewis, his brother, had made upon it. War was now openly carried on between the two monarchs, but produced no memorable event, and was ſtopped by a ceſſation of arms, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by a peace, which was not, however, attended with any confidence or good correſpondence between theſe rival princes. <label type="milestone">

The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, making himſelf, as was uſual in ſpiritual courts, both judge and party, iſſued out, in a ſummary manner, the ſentence of excommunication againſt Eynsford, who complained to the King, that he, who held <hi>in capite</hi> of the

Paris, p. 70. Diceto, p. 536.</note>. Henry, who had now broke off all perſonal intercourſe with Becket, ſent him, by a meſſenger, his orders to abſolve Eynsford; but received for anſwer, that it belonged not to the King to inform him whom he ſhould abſolve and whom excommunicate<note n="†" place="bottom">Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 130.</note>: And it was not till after many remonſtrances and menaces, that Becket, tho' with the worſt grace imaginable, was induced to comply with the royal mandate.</p>
            <p>HENRY, tho' he found himſelf thus grievouſly miſtaken in the character of the perſon whom he had promoted to the primacy, determined not to deſiſt from his former intention of retrenching clerical uſurpations. He was entirely maſter of his extenſive dominions: The prudence and vigour of his government, attended with perpetual ſucceſs, had raiſed his character above that of any of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fitz Steph. p. 28.</note>: The papacy was weakened by a ſchiſm, which divided all Europe: And he rightly judged, that, if the preſent favourable opportunity were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the crown muſt, from the prevalent ſuperſtition of the people, be in danger of falling into an entire ſubordination under the mitre.</p>
            <p>THE union of the civil and eccleſiaſtical powers ſerves extremely, in every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized government, to the maintenance of peace and order; and prevents thoſe mutual incroachments, which, as there can be no ultimate judge between them, are often attended with the moſt dangerous conſequences. Whether the ſupreme magiſtrate, who unites theſe powers, receive the appellation of prince or prelate, is not material: The ſuperior weight, which temporal intereſts commonly bear in the apprehenſions of men above ſpiritual, renders the civil part of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moſt prevalent; and in time prevents thoſe groſs impoſtures and bigotted perſecutions, which, in all falſe religions, are the chief foundation of clerical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But during the progreſs of eccleſiaſtical uſurpations, the ſtate, by the reſiſtance of the civil magiſtrate, is naturally thrown into convulſions; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves the prince, both for his own intereſt, and for that of the public, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide in time ſufficient barriers againſt ſo dangerous and inſidious a rival. This precaution had been hitherto much neglected in England, as well as in other catholic countries; and affairs at laſt ſeemed to have come to a dangerous criſis: A ſovereign of the greateſt abilities was now on the throne: A prelate of the moſt inflexible and intrepid character was poſſeſſed of the primacy: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending powers appeared to be armed with their full force, and it was natural to expect ſome extraordinary event to reſult from their rencounter.</p>

AMONG their other inventions to obtain money, the clergy had inculcated the neceſſity of penance as an atonement for ſin; and having again introduced the practice of paying them large ſums as a commutation, or ſpecies of atonement, for the remiſſion of theſe penance, the ſins of the people, by theſe means, had become a revenue to the prieſts; and the King computed, that, by this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, they levied more money from his ſubjects, than flowed, by all the funds and taxes, into the royal exchequer<note n="*" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 32.</note>. That he might eaſe his ſubjects of ſo heavy and arbitrary an impoſition, Henry required, that a civil officer of his appointment ſhould be preſent in all eccleſiaſtical courts, and ſhould, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, give his conſent to every compoſition which was made with ſinners for their ſpir tual offences.</p>
            <p>THE eccleſiaſtics, in that age, had renounced all immediate ſubordination to the magiſtrate: They openly pretended to an exemption, in criminal accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from a trial before courts of juſtice; and were gradually introducing a like exemption in civil cauſes: Spiritual penalties alone could be inflicted on their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: And as the clergy had extremely multiplied in England, and many of them were conſequently of very low characters, crimes of the deepeſt dye, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, robberies, adulteries, rapes, were daily committed with impunity by the eccleſiaſtics. It had been found, for inſtance, by enquiry, that no leſs than an hundred murders had, ſince the King's acceſſion, been perpetrated by men of that profeſſion, who had never been called to account for theſe offences<note n="†" place="bottom">Neubr. p. 394.</note>; and holy orders were become a full protection for all enormities. A clerk in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire, having debauched a gentleman's daughter, had, at this time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to murder the father; and the general indignation againſt this crime moved the King to attempt the remedy of an abuſe which was become ſo palpable, and to require that the clerk ſhould be delivered up, and receive condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the magiſtrate<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 33. Hiſt. Quad. p. 32.</note>. Becket inſiſted on the privileges of the church; confined the criminal to the biſhop's priſon, leſt he ſhould be ſeized by the King's officers; maintained that no greater puniſhment could be inflicted on him than degradation: And when the King demanded, that, immediately after he was degraded, he ſhould be tried by the civil power, the primate aſſerted, that it was iniquitous to try a man twice upon the ſame accuſation, and for the ſame crime<note n="‖" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 29.

            <p>HENRY, laying hold of ſo favourable a cauſe, reſolved to puſh the clergy with regard to all their privileges, which they had raiſed to an enormous height, and

The King was ſenſible of the artifice, and was provoked to the higheſt indignation. He left the aſſembly, with viſible marks of his diſpleaſure: He required the primate inſtantly to ſurrender the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and caſtles of Eye and Berkham<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. Quad. p. 35. Gervas, p. 1385.</note>: The biſhops were terrified, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſtill farther effects of his reſentment.

Quadr. p. 37. Hoveden, p. 493. Gervas, p. 1385.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT Henry was not content with a declaration in theſe general terms: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ere it was too late, to define expreſsly thoſe cuſtoms, with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired compliance, and to put a ſtop to clerical uſurpations, before they were fully conſolidated, and could plead antiquity, as they already did a ſacred au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in their favour. The claims of the church were open and viſible. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a gradual and inſenſible progreſs thro' many centuries, the maſk had at laſt been taken off, and ſeveral eccleſiaſtical councils, by their canons, which were pretended to be irrevocable and infallible, had poſitively defined thoſe privileges and immunities, which gave ſuch general offence, and appeared ſo dangerous, to the civil magiſtrate. Henry therefore deemed it neceſſary to define with the ſame preciſion the limits of the civil power; to oppoſe his legal cuſtoms to their divine ordinances; to determine the exact boundaries of the rival juriſdictions; and for this purpoſe, he ſummoned a general council of the nobility and prelates at Clarendon, to whom he ſubmitted this great and important queſtion. <label type="milestone">

THESE articles, to the number of ſixteen, were calculated to prevent the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal abuſes, which had prevailed in eccleſiaſtical affairs, and to put an effectual ſtop to the uſurpations of the church, which, gradually ſtealing on, had threatened the total deſtruction of the civil power. Henry, therefore, by reducing theſe cuſtoms to writing and collecting them in a body, endeavoured to prevent all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſpute with regard to them; and by paſſing ſo many eccleſiaſtical ordinances in a national and civil aſſembly, he fully eſtabliſhed the ſuperiority of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature above all papal decrees or ſpiritual canons, and gained a ſignal victory over the eccleſiaſtics. But as he knew, that the biſhops, tho' overawed by the preſent combination of the crown and the barons, would take the firſt favourable opportunity of denying the authority, which had enacted theſe conſtitutions; he reſolved, that they ſhould all ſet their ſeal to them, and give a promiſe to obſerve them. None of the prelates dared to oppoſe his will; except Becker, who, tho' urged by the earls of Cornwal and Leiceſter, the barons of principal authority in the kingdom, obſtinately with held his conſent. At laſt, Richard de Haſtings, grand prior of the templars in England, threw himſelf on his knees before him; and with many tears, entreated him, if he paid any regard, either to his own ſafety or that of the church, not to provoke, by a fruitleſs oppoſition, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a great monarch, who was reſolutely bent on his purpoſe, and who was determined to take full revenge on every one, who ſhould dare to oppoſe him<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt Quadr. p. 38.

For the contemporary hiſtorian, who has given us a full account of theſe tranſactions, does not mention this circumſtance as any wiſe ſingular<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 36.</note>; and Becket, in all his ſubſequent remonſtrances with regard to the ſevere treatment, which he had met with, never founds any objection on an irregularity, which to us appears very palpable and flagrant. So little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was there at that time in the government and conſtitution!</p>
            <p>THE King was not content with this ſentence, however violent and oppreſſive. Next day, he demanded of Becket the ſum of three hundred pounds, which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate had levied from the honours of Eye and Berkham, while in his poſſeſſion.

Becket, after premiſing that he was not obliged to anſwer to this ſuit, becauſe it was not contained in his ſummons; after remarking, that he had expended more than that ſum in the repairs of theſe caſtles and of the royal palace at London; expreſſed however his reſolution not to allow money to be any ground of quarrel between him and his ſovereign: He agreed to pay the ſum; and immediately gave ſureties for it<note n="*" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</note>. In the ſubſequent meeting, the King demanded five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred marks, which, he affirmed, he had lent Becket during the war at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. Quad. p. 47.</note>; and another ſum to the ſame amount, for which that prince had been ſurety for him to a Jew. Immediately after theſe two claims, he ſtarted a third of ſtill greater importance: He required him to give in the account of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration while chancellor, and to pay the ballance due from the revenues of all the prelacies, abbies, and baronies, which had, during that time, been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to his management<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 494. Diceto, p. 537.</note>. Becket obſerved, that as this demand was totally unexpected, he had not come prepared to anſwer it; but he required a delay, and promiſed in that caſe to give ſatisfaction. The King inſiſted upon ſureties; and Becket deſired leave to conſult with his fuffragans in a caſe of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT is apparent, from the known character of Henry, and from the uſual vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of his government, that when he promoted Becket to the ſee of Canterbury, he was, on good grounds, well pleaſed with his adminiſtration in the former high office, with which he had entruſted him; and that, even if that prelate had diſſipated money beyond the income of his place, the King was ſatisfied, that his expences were not blameable, and had in the main been calculated for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 495.</note>. Two years had ſince elapſed; no demands had during that time been made upon him; it was not till the quarrel aroſe concerning eccleſiaſtical privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that the claim was ſtarted, and the primate was, of a ſudden, required to produce accounts of ſuch intricacy and extent before a tribunal, which had ſhown a determined reſolution to ruin and oppreſs him. To find ſureties, that he ſhould anſwer ſo boundleſs and uncertain a claim, which, in the King's eſtimation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to 44,000 marks<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 315.</note>, was impracticable; and Becket's ſuffragans were extremely at a loſs what council to give him, in ſuch a critical emergency. By the advice of the biſhop of Wincheſter he offered two thouſand marks as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſatisfaction for all demands: But this offer was rejected by the King<note n="*" place="bottom">Fitz Steph. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>AFTER a few days, ſpent in deliberation, Becket went to church, and ſaid maſs, where he had previouſly ordered, that the introit to the communion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould begin with theſe words, <hi>Princes ſat and ſpake againſt me;</hi> the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage appointed for the martyrdom of St. Stephen, whom the primate thereby tacitly pretended to reſemble in his ſufferings for the ſake of righteouſneſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt.

Hiſt. Quad. p. 53. Hoveden, p 494. Neubr. p. 394. Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 43.</note>. The King, who was in an inner room, was aſtoniſhed at this parade, by which the primate ſeemed to menace him and his court with the ſentence of excommunication; and he ſent ſome of the prelates to remonſtrate with him on account of ſuch audacious behaviour. Theſe prelates complained to him, that, by ſubſcribing, himſelf, to the conſtitutions of Clarendon, he had ſeduced them to imitate his example; and that now, when it was too late, he pretended to ſhake off all ſubordination to the civil power, and appeared deſirous of involving them in the guilt, which muſt attend any violation of thoſe laws, eſtabliſhed by their conſent and ratified by their ſubſcriptions<note n="‖" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 35.</note>. Becket replied, that he had indeed ſubſcribed the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Clarendon, <hi>legally, with good faith and without fraud or reſerve,</hi> but in theſe words was virtually implied a ſalvo for the rights of their order, which, being connected with the cauſe of God and his church, could never be relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by their oaths and engagements: That if he and they had erred, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the eccleſiaſtical privileges, the beſt atonement they could now make was to retract their conſent, which in ſuch a caſe could never be obligatory, and to follow the Pope's authority, who had ſolemnly abrogated the conſtitutions of Clarendon, and had abſolved them from all oaths, which they had taken to obſerve them: That a determined reſolution was evidently embraced to oppreſs the church; the ſtorm had firſt broke upon him; for a ſlight offence, and which too was even falſely imputed to him, he had been tyrannically condemned to a grievous penalty; a new and unheard of claim was ſince ſtarted, in which he could expect no juſtice; and he plainly ſaw that he was the deſtined victim, who, by his ruin, muſt prepare the way for the abrogation of all ſpiritual immunities: That he
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0162900301:290"/>
ſtrictly inhibited them, who were his ſuffragans, to aſſiſt at any ſuch trial, or give their ſanction to any ſentence againſt him; he put himſelf and his ſee under the protection of the ſupreme pontiff; and appealed to him againſt any penalty, which his iniquitous judges might think proper to inflict upon him: And that, however terrible the indignation of ſo great a monarch as Henry, his ſword could only kill the body; while that of the church, entruſted into the hands of the primate, could kill the ſoul, and throw the diſobedient into infinite and eternal predition<note n="*" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 42. 44. 45, 46.

            <p>APPEALS to the Pope, even in eccleſiaſtical cauſes, had been aboliſhed by the conſtitutions of Clarendon, and were become criminal by law; but an appeal in a civil cauſe, ſuch as that of the King's demand upon Becket, was a practice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together new and unprecedented; tended directly to the ſubverſion of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and could receive no colour of excuſe, except from the determined reſolution, which was but too apparent, in the King and the great council, to effectuate, without juſtice, but under colour of law, the total ruin of the inflexible primate. The King, having now obtained ſo much a better pretext for his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, would probably have puſhed this affair to the utmoſt extremity againſt him; but Becket gave him no leiſure to conduct that proſecution. <note place="margin">Puniſhment of Becket.</note> He refuſed ſo much as to hear the ſentence, which the barons, ſitting apart from the biſhops, and joined to ſome ſheriffs and barons of the ſecond rank<note n="†" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 46.

            <p>THE violent and unjuſt proſecution of Becket had a natural tendency to turn the public favour on his ſide, and to make men forget his former ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, and his departure from all oaths and engagements, as well as the enormity of thoſe eccleſiaſtical privileges, of which he affected to be tge cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0162900301:291"/>
diſturbance in his government; and forgeting that this was the common cauſe of princes, they affected to pity extremely the condition of the exiled primate; and the latter even honoured him with a viſit at Soiſſons, in which city he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to fix his retreat<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Quad. p. 76.</note>. The pope, whoſe intereſts were more immediately concerned in ſupporting him, gave a bad reception to a magnificent embaſſy, which Henry ſent to accuſe him; while he put the greateſt marks of diſtinction on Becket himſelf, who had come to Sens, in order to juſtify his cauſe before the ſovereign pontiff<note n="†" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 51. Hiſt. Quad. p. 72, 73, 77. Hoveden, p. 496. Gervas, p. 1393. Trivet. p. 46.</note>. The King, in revenge, ſequeſtered the revenues of Canterbury; and by a conduct, which might be eſteemed arbitrary had there been at that time any regular check on royal authority, he baniſhed all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's relations and domeſtics, to the number of four hundred<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt.

But this policy, by which Henry endeavoured to reduce Becket the ſooner to neceſſities, loſt its effect: The Pope, as ſoon as they arrived beyond ſea, abſolved them from their oath, and diſtributed them among the convents in France and Flanders: A reſidence was aſſigned to Becket himſelf in the convent of Pontigny<note n="§" place="bottom">M Paris, p. 72.</note>, where he lived for ſome years in great magnificence, partly from a penſion granted him on the revenues of that abbey, partly from remittances made him by the French monarch.</p>

Theſe were edicts of the utmoſt importance, affected the lives and properties of all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and even changed, for the time, the national religion, by breaking off all communication with Rome: Yet were they enacted by the ſole authority of the King, and were derived entirely from his will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>THE ſpiritual powers, which, in the primitive church, were, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, dependant on the civil, had by a gradual progreſs reached an equality and independance; and tho' the limits of the two juriſdictions were difficult to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or define, it was not impoſſible, but, by moderation on both ſides, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might ſtill have been conducted, in that imperfect and irregular manner which attends all human inſtitutions.

            <p>THE ſituation of Henry was ſo unhappy, that he could employ no expedient for ſaving his miniſters from this terrible cenſure, but by appealing to the Pope himſelf, and having recourſe to a tribunal, whoſe authority he had himſelf at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to abridge in this very article of appeals, and which, he knew, was ſo deeply engaged on the ſide of his adverſary<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt St Thom. p. 16, 202, 203, 234.</note>.

BUT the King attained not even that temporary tranquillity, which he had hoped to reap from this expedient. During the heat of his quarrel with Becket, while he was every day expecting an interdict to be laid on his dominions, and even a ſentence of excommunication to be denounced againſt his perſon, he had thought it prudent to have his ſon, prince Henry, aſſociated with him in the royalty, and to make him be crowned King, by the hands of Roger archbiſhop of York<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Quad. p. 102, 103. Gervas, p. 1408.</note>. By this precaution, he both enſured the ſucceſſion of that prince, which, conſidering the many paſt irregularities in that point, could not but be eſteemed ſomewhat precarious; and he preſerved at leaſt his family on the throne, if the ſentence of excommunication ſhould have the effect which he dreaded, and ſhould make his ſubjects renounce their allegiance to him<note n="†" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 65. Pere Daniel, vol. 1. p. 1247.</note>. Tho' this deſign was conducted with the utmoſt expedition and ſecreſy, Becket, before it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into execution, had got intelligence of it; and being deſirous to obſtruct all Henry's meaſures, as well as anxious to prevent this affront to himſelf, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a ſole right, as archbiſhop of Canterbury, to officiate in the coronation, he had inhibited all the prelates of England from aſſiſting at this ceremony<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt.

Gervas, p. 1412.</note>, and had incited the King of France to proteſt againſt the coronation of young Henry, unleſs the princeſs, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that monarch, ſhould at the ſame time receive the royal unction. There pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in that age an opinion, which was akin to its other ſuperſtitions, that the royal unction was eſſential to the exerciſe of royal power<note n="§" place="bottom">Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 708.</note>; and it was therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural both for the King of France, ſolicitous for his daughter the princeſs Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret's eſtabliſhment<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1061.</note>, and for Becket, jealous of his own dignity, to demand, in the treaty with Henry, ſome ſatisfaction in this eſſential point<note n="*" place="bottom">Gervas, p. 1408.</note>. Henry, after apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing to Lewis for the omiſſion with regard to Margaret, and excuſing it on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſecreſy requiſite for conducting that meaſure, promiſed that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſhould be again renewed in the perſons both of the prince and princeſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 518.</note>: And he aſſured Becket, that, beſides receiving the acknowledgments of Roger and the other biſhops for the ſeeming affront put on the ſee of Canterbury, he ſhould, as a farther ſatisfaction, recover his rights by officiating in this coronation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt St. Thom. p. 803, 810.</note>. But the violent ſpirit of Becket, elated by the power of the church, and by the victory which he had already obtained over his ſovereign, was not content with this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary compenſation, but reſolved to make the injury, which he pretended to have ſuffered, a handle for taking revenge of all his enemies. On his arrival in

But the primate, heedleſs of the reproof, proceeded, in the moſt oftentatious manner, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his dioceſe. In Rocheſter, and all the towns thro' which he paſſed, he was received with the ſhouts and acclamations of the people<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. Quad. p. 113. Beaulieu Vie de St Thom. p. 397. Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 132.</note>. As he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of all ranks and ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated with hymns of joy his triumphant entrance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Fitz Steph. p. 75. Hiſt. Quad. p. 117.</note>. And tho' he was obliged, by orders of the young prince, who reſided at Woodſtoke, to return to his dioceſe, he found that he was not miſtaken, when he laid his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with the higheſt veneration of the public towards his perſon and his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He proceeded, therefore, with the more courage to launch his ſpiritual thunders; and he iſſued the ſentence of excommunication againſt Robert de Broc<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 520. Diceto, p. 555.</note>, and Nigel de Sackville, with many of the moſt conſiderable prelates and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who had aſſiſted at the coronation of the young prince, and had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the late perſecution of the exiled clergy. This violent meaſure, by which he, in effect, denounced war againſt the King himſelf, is commonly aſcribed to the vindictive diſpoſition and imperious character of Becket; but as this prelate was alſo a man of acknowledged abilities, we are not, in his paſſions alone, to look for the cauſe of his conduct, when he proceeded to theſe extremities againſt his enemies. His ſagacity had led him to diſcover all Henry's intentions; and he purpoſed, by this bold and unexpected aſſault, to prevent the execution of them.</p>
            <p>THE King, from his experience of the diſpoſitions of his people, was become ſenſible, that his enterprize had been too bold, in eſtabliſhing the conſtitutions of Clarendon, in defining all the branches of royal power, and in endeavouring to extort from the church of England, as well as from the Pope, an expreſs avowal of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Conſcious alſo of his own violence, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to break or ſubdue the inflexible primate, he was not diſpleaſed to undo that meaſure, which had given his enemies ſuch advantage againſt him; and he was contented, that the controverſy ſhould terminate in that ambiguous manner,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0162900301:299"/>
which was the utmoſt that princes, in thoſe ages, could hope to attain in their diſputes with the ſee of Rome. Tho' he dropt, for the preſent, the proſecution of Becket, he ſtill reſerved to himſelf the right of maintaining, that the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Clarendon, the original ground of the quarrel, were both the antient cuſtoms and the preſent law of the realm: And tho' he knew, that the papal clergy aſſerted them to be impious in themſelves, as well as abrogated by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the ſovereign pontiff, he propoſed, in ſpite of their clamours, ſteadily to put theſe laws in execution<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 837, 839.</note>, and to truſt to his own ability, and to the courſe of events, for ſucceſs in that perilous enterprize. He hoped, that Becket's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a ſix years exile would, after his pride was fully gratified by his reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, be ſufficient to teach him more reſerve in his oppoſition; or if any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy aroſe, he expected thenceforth to engage in a more favourable cauſe, and to maintain with advantage, while the primate was now in his power<note n="†" place="bottom">Fitz-Steph. p. 65.</note>, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and undoubted cuſtoms of the kingdom againſt the uſurpations of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. But Becket, determined not to betray the eccleſiaſtical privileges by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt St. Thom. p. 345.</note>, and apprehenſive leſt a prince of ſuch profound policy, if allowed to proceed in his own way, would probably in the end prevail, reſolved to take all the advantage which his preſent victory gave him, and to diſconcert the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious meaſures of the King, by the vehemence and rigour of his own conduct<note n="‖" place="bottom">Fitz Steph. p. 74.</note>. Aſſured of ſupport from Rome, he was little apprehenſive of dangers, which his courage taught him to deſpiſe, and which, even if attended with the moſt fatal conſequences, would ſerve only to gratify his ambition and thirſt of glory<note n="§" place="bottom">Epiſt.

This was the tragical end of Thomas a Becket, a prelate of the moſt lofty, intrepid, and inflexible ſpirit, who was able to cover, to the world and probably to himſelf, the enterprizes of pride and ambition, under the diſguiſe of ſanctity and of zeal for the intereſts of piety and religion: An extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, ſurely, had he been allowed to remain in his firſt ſtation, and had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vehemence of his character to the ſupport of law and juſtice; inſtead of being engaged, by the prejudices of the times, to ſacrifice all private duties and public connexions to tyes, which he imagined, or repreſented, as ſuperior to every civil and political conſideration. But no man, who enters into the genius of that age, can reaſonably doubt of this prelate's ſincerity. The ſpirit of ſuperſtition was ſo prevalent, that it infallibly caught every careleſs reaſoner, much more every one whoſe intereſt, and honour, and ambition, were engaged to ſupport it. All the wretched literature of the times was inliſted on that ſide: Some faint glimmerings of common ſenſe might ſometimes pierce thro' the thick cloud of ignorance, or what was worſe, the illuſions of perverted ſcience, which had blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the ſun, and envelloped the face of nature: But thoſe who preſerved themſelves untainted from the general contagion, proceeded on no principles which they could pretend to juſtify: They were beholden more to their total want of inſtruction, than to their knowledge, if they ſtill retained ſome ſhare of

underſtanding: Folly was poſſeſſed of all the ſchools as well as all the churches; and her votaries aſſumed the garb of philoſophers together with the enſigns of ſpiritual dignities. Throughout that large collection of letters, which bears the name of St. Thomas, we find, in all the retainers of that aſpiring prelate, no leſs than in himſelf, a moſt entire and abſolute conviction of the reaſon and piety of their own party, and a diſdain of their antagoniſts; nor is there leſs cant and grimace in their ſtile, when they addreſs each other, than when they compoſe manifeſtos for the peruſal of the public. The ſpirit of revenge, violence, and ambition, which accompanied their conduct, inſtead of forming a preſumption of hypocriſy, are the ſureſt pledges of their ſincere attachment to a cauſe, which ſo much flattered theſe domineering paſſions.</p>

               <note place="margin">Grief</note> HENRY, on the firſt report of Becket's violent meaſures, had propoſed to have him arreſted, and had already taken ſome ſteps towards the execution of that deſign: But the intelligence of his murder threw that prince into the utmoſt conſternation, and he was immediately ſenſible of the dangerous conſequences, which he had reaſon to apprehend from ſo unexpected an event. An archbiſhop of reputed ſanctity, aſſaſſinated before the altar, in the exerciſe of his function, and on account of his zeal in maintaining eccleſiaſtical privileges, muſt attain the higheſt honours of martyrdom; while his murderer would be ranked among the moſt bloody tyrants, that ever were expoſed to the hatred and deteſtation of mankind. Interdicts and excommunications, weapons in themſelves ſo terrible, would, he foreſaw, be armed with double force; when employed in a cauſe ſo much calculated to work on the human paſſions, and ſo peculiarly adapted to the eloquence of popular preachers and declaimers. In vain would he plead his own innocence, and even his total ignorance of the fact: He was ſufficiently guilty, if the church thought proper to eſteem him ſo: And his concurrence in Becket's martyrdom, becoming a religious opinion, would be received with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit credit, which belonged to the moſt eſtabliſhed articles of faith.

            <p>THE clergy, mean while, tho' their rage was happily diverted from falling on the King, were not idle in magnifying the ſanctity of Becket; in extolling the merits of his martyrdom; and in magnifying him above all that devoted tribe, who, in ſeveral ages, had, by their blood, cemented the fabric of the temple. Other ſaints had only borne teſtimony in their ſufferings to the general doctrines of Chriſtianity; but Becket had ſacrificed his life to the power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the clergy; and this peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a ſuitable acknowledgement to his memory. Endleſs were the panegyrics on his virtues; and the miracles, operated by his relicts, were more numerous, more nonſenſical, and more impudently atteſted, than thoſe which ever filled the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend of any confeſſor or martyr. Two years after his death he was canonized by Pope Alexander<note n="‖" place="bottom">Epiſt. St. Thom. p. 880. Diceto p. 569</note>; a ſolemn jubilee was eſtabliſhed for celebrating his merits; his body was removed to a magnificent ſhrine, enriched with preſents from all parts of Chriſtendom; pilgrimages were performed to obtain his interceſſion with heaven; and it was computed, that, in one year, above an hundred thouſand pilgrims arrived in Canterbury, and paid their devotions at his tomb. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a mortifying reflection to thoſe who are actuated by the love of fame, ſo juſtly denominated the laſt infirmity of noble minds, that the wiſeſt legiſlator and moſt exalted genius, that ever reformed or enlightened the world, can never expect ſuch tributes of praiſe, as are laviſhed on the memory of a pretended ſaint, whoſe whole conduct was probably, to the laſt degree, odious or contemptible, and whoſe induſtry was entirely directed to the purſuits of objects pernicious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is only a conqueror, a perſonage no leſs intitled to our hatred, who can pretend to the attainment of equal renown and glory.</p>
            <p>IT may not be amiſs to remark, before we conclude this ſubject of Thomas a Becket, that the King, during his controverſy with that prelate, was on every

occaſion more anxious than uſual to expreſs his zeal for religion, and to avoid all a pearance of a proſane negligence on that head. He gave his conſent to the impoſing a tax on all his dominions for the delivery of the holy land, now threatened by the famous Saladine; and this tax amounted to two-pence a pound for one year, and a penny a pound for the four ſubſequent<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Gervas, p. 1399. M. Paris, p. 74.</note>. Almoſt all the princes of Europe laid a like impoſition on their ſubjects, which received the name of Saladine's tax. During this period, there came over from Germany about thirty heretics of both ſexes, under the direction of one Gerard; ſimple ignorant people, who could give no account of their faith, but declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to ſuffer for the tenets of their maſter. They made only one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert in England, a woman as ignorant as themſelves; yet they gave ſuch um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage to the clergy, that they were delivered over to the ſecular arm, and were puniſhed by being burned on the forehead, and then whipped thro' the ſtreets. They ſeemed to exult in their ſufferings, and as they went along, ſung the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>Bleſſed are ye, when men bate you and perſecute you</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Neubr. p. 391. M. Paris, p. 74. Heming. p. 494.</note>. After they were whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they were thruſt out almoſt naked in the midſt of winter, and periſhed thro' cold and hunger; no one daring, or being willing, to give them the leaſt relief.

               <note place="margin">State of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> AS Britain was firſt peopled from Gaul, ſo was Ireland probably from Britain; and the inhabitants of all theſe countries ſeem to have been ſo many tribes of the Celtae, who derive their origin from an antiquity, that lies far beyond the records of any hiſtory or tradition. The Iriſh, from the beginning of time, had been buried in the moſt profound barbariſm and ignorance; and as they were never conquered or even invaded by the Romans, from whom all the weſtern world derived its civility, they continued ſtill in the moſt rude ſtate of ſociety, and were diſtinguiſhed only by thoſe vices, to which human nature, not tamed by education nor reſtrained by laws, is for ever ſubject. The ſmall principalities, into which they were divided, exerciſed perpetual rapine and violence againſt each other; the uncertain ſucceſſion of their princes was a continued ſource of domeſtic convulſions; the uſual title of each petty ſovereign was the murder of his predeceſſor; courage and force, tho' exerciſed in the commiſſion of crimes, were more honoured than any pacific virtues; and the moſt ſimple arts of life, even tillage and agriculture, were almoſt wholly unknown among them. They had felt the invaſions of the Danes and the other northern people; but theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads, which had ſpread barbariſm in the other parts of Europe, tended rather to improve the Iriſh; and the only towns, which were to be found in the iſland, had been planted along the coaſt by the freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other inhabitants exerciſed paſturage in the open country; ſought protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from any danger in their foreſts and moraſſes; and being divided by the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0162900301:306"/>
fierceſt animoſities againſt each other, were ſtill more intent on the means of mutual injury, than on the expedients for common or even for private intereſt.</p>
            <p>BESIDES many ſmall tribes, there were in the age of Henry II, five principal ſovereignties in the iſland, Munſter, Leinſter, Meath, Ulſter, and Connaught; and as it had been uſual for one or the other of theſe to take the lead in their wars, there was commonly ſome prince, who ſeemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ireland. Roderic O Connor, King of Connaught, was then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to this d gnity<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 527.</note>; but his government, ill obeyed even within his own territory, was not capable of uniting the people in any meaſures, either for the eſtabliſhment of order, or for defence againſt foreigners. The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign, been moved, by the proſpect of theſe advantages, to attempt the ſubjection of Ireland; and a pretence was only wanting to invade a people, who, being always confined to their own iſland, had never given any reaſon of complaint to any of their neighbours. For this purpoſe, he had recourſe to Rome, which aſſumed a right to diſpoſe of kingdoms and empires; and not foreſeeing the dangerous diſputes, which he was one day to maintain with that ſee, he helped, for preſent, or rather for an imaginary conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, to give ſanction to claims which were now become dangerous to all ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. Adrian III. who was then pontiff, was by birth an Engliſhman; and being, on that account, diſpoſed to oblige Henry, he was eaſily perſuaded to act as maſter of the world, and to make, without any hazard or expence, the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a great iſland to his ſpiritual juriſdiction. The Iriſh had, by precedent miſſions from the Britains, been imperfectly converted to Chriſtianity; and what the Pope regarded as the ſureſt mark of their imperfect converſion, they followed the doctrines of their firſt teachers, and had never acknowledged any ſubjection to the ſee of Rome. Adrian, therefore, in the year 1156, iſſued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after premiſing, that that prince had ever ſhown an anxious care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to encreaſe the number of his ſaints and elect in heaven; he repreſents his deſign of ſubduing Ireland as derived from the ſame pious motives: He conſiders his care of applying previouſly for the apoſtolic ſanction as a ſure earneſt of ſucceſs and victory; and having eſtabliſhed it as a point inconteſtible, that all Chriſtian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it to be his own duty to ſow among them the ſeeds of the goſpel, which might in the laſt day fructify to their eternal ſalvation: He exhorts the King to invade Ireland, in order to extirpate the vice and wickedneſs of the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every houſe, a penny to the ſee of Rome: He gives him entire right and authority over the iſland, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0162900301:307"/>
all the inhabitants to obey him as their ſovereign, and inveſts with full power all ſuch godly inſtruments as he ſhould think proper to employ in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, thus calculated for the glory of God and the ſalvation of the ſouls of men<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 67. Girald Cambr. Spelm. Concil. vol. 2. p. 51. Rymer, vol. p. 15.</note>. Henry, tho' armed with this authority, did not immediately put his deſign in execution; but being detained by more intereſting buſineſs on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, waited for a favourable opportunity of invading Ireland.</p>
            <p>DERMOT Macmorrogh, King of Leinſter, had, by his licentious tyranny, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf extremely odious to his ſubjects, who ſeized with alacrity, the firſt occaſion that offered, of throwing off the yoke, which was become grievous and oppreſſive to them. This prince had formed a deſign on Omach, wife of Ororic, King of Meath; and taking advantage of her huſband's abſence, who, being obliged to viſit a diſtant part of his dominions, had left his Queen ſecure, as he thought, in an iſland, ſurrounded by a bog, he ſuddenly invaded the place, and carried off the princeſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Girald Cambr. p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. This exploit, tho' uſual among the Iriſh, and rather eſteemed a proof of gallantry and ſpirit<note n="‡" place="bottom">Spencer, vol. 6.</note>, provoked the reſentment of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; who, having collected forces, and being ſtrengthened by the alliance of Roderic, King of Connaught, invaded the dominions of Dermot, and expelled him from his kingdom. The exiled prince had recourſe to Henry, who was at that time in Guienne, craved his aſſiſtance to reſtore him to his ſovereignty, and offered, in that caſe, to hold his kingdom in vaſſalage of the crown of England. Henry, whoſe views were already turned towards making acquiſitions in Ireland, readily accepted the offer; but being at that time embaraſſed by the rebellions of his French ſubjects, as well as by his diſputes with the ſee of Rome, he declined for the preſent embarking in the enterprize, and gave Dermot no farther aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance than letters patent, by which he empowered all his ſubjects to aid the Iriſh prince in the recovery of his dominions<note n="‖" place="bottom">Girald Cambr. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. Dermot, ſupported by this authority, came to Briſtol; and after endeavouring, tho' for ſome time in vain, to engage adventurers in the enterprize, he at laſt formed a treaty with Richard, ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Strongbow, earl of Strigul. This nobleman, who was of the illuſtrious houſe of Clare, had impaired his eſtate by expenſive pleaſures; and being ready for any deſperate undertaking, he promiſed aſſiſtance to Dermot, on condition of his eſpouſing Eva, the daughter of that prince, and being declared heir of all his dominions<note n="§" place="bottom">Girald Cambr. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0162900301:308"/>
obtained their promiſe of invading Ireland. Being now aſſured of aſſiſtance, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned privately to his own ſtate; and lurking in the monaſtery of Fernes, which he had founded, for this ruffian was alſo a founder of monaſteries) he prepared every thing for the reception of his Engliſh allies<note n="*" place="bottom">Girald Camb. p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> THE troops of Fitz Stephens were firſt ready. That gentleman landed Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with an hundred and thirty knights, ſixty eſquires, and three hundred arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but this ſmall body, being brave men, not unacquainted with diſcipline, and compleatly armed, a thing almoſt unknown in Ireland, they ſtruck a great terror into the barbarous inhabitants, and ſeemed to menace them with ſome great revolution. The conjunction of Maurice de Prendergaſt, who, about the ſame time, brought over ten knights and ſixty archers, enabled Fitz-Stephens to attempt the ſiege of Wexford, a town inhabited by the Danes; and after gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a battle, he made himſelf maſter of the place<note n="†" place="bottom">Girald Cambr. p. 761. 762.</note>. Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived with ten knights, thirty eſquires, and a hundred archers<note n="‡" place="bottom">Girald Camb. p. 766.</note>; and being joined by the former adventurers, compoſed a force which nothing in Ireland was able to withſtand. Roderic, the chief monarch of the iſland, was defeated in battle; the prince of Oſſory was obliged to ſubmit, and give hoſtages for his peaceable behaviour; and Dermot, not content with being reſtored to his kingdom of Leinſter, projected the dethronement of Roderic, and aſpired to the ſole dominion of the iſland.</p>
            <p>IN proſecution of theſe views, he ſent over a meſſenger to the earl of Strigul, challenging the performance of his promiſe, and diſplaying the mighty advantages which might now be reaped by a ſmall reinforcement of warlike troops from England. Richard, not ſatisfied with the general allowance given by Henry to all his ſubjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and having obtained a cold or ambiguous permiſſion, prepared himſelf for the execution of his deſigns. He firſt ſent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and ſeventy archers, who landing near Waterford, defeated a body of three thouſand Iriſh, that had ventured to attack him<note n="‖" place="bottom">Girald Camb p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Roderic, in revenge, cut off the head of Dermot's ſon, who had been left as a hoſtage in his hands; and Richard, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Eva, became ſoon after, by the death of Dermot, maſter of the kingdom of Leinſter, and prepared to extend his dominion over all Ireland. Roderic, and the other Iriſh princes, were alarmed with the danger; and combining toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0162900301:309"/>
beſieged Dublin with an army of thirty thouſand men: But earl Richard, making a ſudden ſally at the head of ninety knights, with their followers, put this numerous army to rout, chaced them from the field of battle, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them with great ſlaughter. Nothing in Ireland now dared to oppoſe themſelves to the Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Girald Camb. p. 773.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY, jealous of the progreſs of his own ſubjects, ſent orders to recall all the Engliſh, and he made preparations to attack Ireland in perſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Girald Camb. p. 770.</note>: But Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and the other adventurers, found means to appeaſe him, by making him the moſt humble ſubmiſſions, and offering to hold all their acquiſitions in vaſſalage to his crown<note n="‡" place="bottom">Girald Camb. p. 775.</note>. That monarch landed in Ireland at the head of five hundred knights, beſides other ſoldiers; and found the Iriſh ſo diſpirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a progreſs which he made thro' the iſland, he had no other occupation than to receive the homages of his new ſubjects<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened.

He left moſt of the Iriſh chieftains or princes in poſſeſſion of their antient territories; beſtowed ſome lands on the Engliſh adventurers; gave earl Richard the commiſſion of ſeneſchal of Ireland; and after a ſtay of a few months, returned in triumph into England. By theſe trivial exploits, ſcarce worth relating, except for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the conſequences, was Ireland ſubdued, and annexed for ever to the Engliſh crown.</p>
            <p>THE low ſtate of commerce and induſtry, during thoſe ages, made it imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable for princes to ſupport regular armies, which might retain the conquered countries in ſubjection; and the extreme barbariſm and poverty of Ireland could ſtill leſs afford means of bearing this expence. The only expedient by which a durable conqueſt could then be made or maintained, was by pouring in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of new inhabitants, dividing among them the lands of the vanquiſhed, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing them in all offices of truſt and authority, and thereby transforming the antient inhabitants into a new people. By this policy, the northern invaders of old, and of late the duke of Normandy, had been able to fix their dominion, and to erect kingdoms, which remained ſtable on their foundations, and were tranſmitted to the poſterity of the firſt conquerors. But the preſent ſtate of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rendered that iſland ſo little inviting to the Engliſh, that only a few of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fortunes could be perſuaded, from time to time, to tranſport themſelves into it<note n="§" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1069. Neubrig. p. 403.</note>; and inſtead of reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated manners, they were gradually aſſimilated to the antient inhabitants, and degenerated from the cuſtoms of their own nation. It was alſo found requiſite to beſtow great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0162900301:310"/>
and arbitrary powers on the leaders, who commanded a handful of men amidſt ſuch hoſtile multitudes; and law and equity, in a little time, became as much unknown in the Engliſh ſettlements as they had ever been among the Iriſh tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of the new adventurers; independant authority conferred; the natives, never fully ſubdued, ſtill retained their animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities againſt the conquerors: Their hatred was retaliated by like injuries; and from theſe cauſes, the Iriſh, during the courſe of four centuries, remained ſtill ſavage and untractable; and it was not till the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, that the iſland was fully ſubdued; nor till that of her ſucceſſor, that it gave hopes of becoming a uſeful conqueſt to the Engliſh nation.</p>
            <p>BESIDES that the eaſy and peaceable ſubmiſſion of the Iriſh left Henry no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupation in that iſland, he was recalled from it by another incident, which was of the laſt importance to his intereſts and ſafety. The two legates, Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed the trial of his conduct in the death of archbiſhop Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and being impatient of delay, ſent him frequent letters, full of menaces, if he protracted any longer the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his appearance before them<note n="*" place="bottom">Gerald Camb. p. 778.</note>. He haſtened therefore to Normandy, and had a conference with them at Savigny, where their firſt demands were ſo exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, that he broke off the negotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade them do their worſt againſt him. They perceived, that the ſeaſon was now paſt for taking advantage of that tragical incident; which, had it been hotly purſued by interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throwing the whole kingdom into combuſtion. But the time, which Henry had happily gained, had contributed to appeaſe the minds of men: The event could not now have the ſame influence, as when it was recent; and as the clergy had every day looked for an accommodation with the King, they had not oppoſed the pretenſions of his partizans, who had been very induſtrious in repreſenting to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the primate, and his ignorance of the deſigns formed by the aſſaſſins. The legates, therefore, found themſelves obliged to lower their terms; and Henry was ſo fortunate as to conclude an accommodation with them. He declared upon oath, before the reliques of the ſaints, that ſo far from commanding or deſiring the death of the archbiſhop, he was extremely grieved when he received intelligence of it: But as the paſſion which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on account of that prelate's conduct, had probably given occaſion to his murder, he ſtipulated the following conditions, as an atonement for the offence. He promiſed, that he ſhould pardon all ſuch as had been baniſhed for their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Becker, and ſhould reſtore them to their livings; that the ſee of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury

Upon ſigning theſe conceſſions, Henry received ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from the legates; was confirmed in the grant made by Pope Adrian of Ireland<note n="†" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1071. Liber Nig. Scac. p. 47.</note>; and nothing proves more ſtrongly the great abilities of this monarch, than his extricating himſelf, on ſuch eaſy terms, from ſo difficult a ſituation. He had always inſiſted, that the laws, eſtabliſhed at Clarendon, contained not any new claims, but the antient cuſtoms of the kingdom; and he was ſtill at liberty, notwithſtanding the articles of this agreement, to maintain his pretenſions. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Pope were indeed permitted by this treaty; but as the King was alſo permitted to exact reaſonable ſecurities from the parties, and might ſtretch his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on this head as far as he pleaſed, he had it virtually in his power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Pope from reaping any advantage by this ſeeming conceſſion. And on the whole, the conſtitutions of Clarendon remained ſtill the law of the realm; tho' the Pope and his legates ſeem ſo little to have conceived the King's power to lie under any legal limitations, that they were ſatisfied with his departing, by treaty, from one of the moſt momentous articles of theſe conſtitutions, without requiring any repeal by the ſtates of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>HENRY, freed from this dangerous controverſy with the eccleſiaſtics and with the ſee of Rome, ſeemed now to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity, and to be equally happy in his domeſtic ſituation and in his political government. A numerous progeny of ſons and daughters gave both luſtre and authority to his crown, prevented the dangers of a diſputed ſucceſſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed all pretenſions of the ambitious barons. The King's precaution alſo, in eſtabliſhing the ſeveral branches of his family, ſeemed well calculated to prevent all jealouſies among the brothers, and to perpetuate the greatneſs of his family. He had ordered Henry, his eldeſt ſon, to be anointed King, and had deſtined him to be his ſucceſſor in the kingdom of England, the dutchy of Normandy,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0162900301:312"/>
and the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine; territories which lay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and which, by that means, might eaſily lend to each other mutual aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, both againſt inteſtine commotions and foreign invaſions. Richard, his ſecond ſon, was inveſted in the dutchy of Guienne and county of Poictou; Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, his third ſon, inherited, in right of his wife, the dutchy of Brittany; and his new conqueſt of Ireland was deſtined for the appanage of John, his fourth ſon. He had alſo negotiated, in favour of this laſt prince, a marriage with Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, the only daughter of Humbert, count of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive as her dowry very conſiderable demeſnes in Piedmont, Savoy, Breſſe, and Dauphiny<note n="*" place="bottom">Ypod Neuſt. p. 448.

            <p>YOUNG Henry, who was riſing to man's eſtate, began to diſplay his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and aſpire to independance: Brave, ambitious, liberal, magnificent, affable; he diſcovered qualities, which give great luſtre to youth; prognoſticate a ſhining fortune; but, unleſs tempered in mature age with diſcretion, are the forerunners of the greateſt calamities<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron.

It is ſaid, that at the time when this prince was anointed King, his father, in order to give greater dignity to the ceremony, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated at table as one of the retinue; and obſerved to his ſon, that never King was more royally ſerved. <hi>It is nothing extraordinary,</hi> ſaid young Henry to one of his courtiers, <hi>if the ſon of a count ſhould ſerve the ſon of a King.</hi> This ſaying, which might paſs only for an innocent pleaſantry, or even for an oblique com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to his father, was however regarded as a ſymptom of his aſpiring temper; and his conduct ſoon after juſtified the conjecture.</p>
            <p>HENRY, agreeable to the promiſe which he had given both to the Pope and the French King, permitted his ſon to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbiſhop of Roüen, and aſſociated the princeſs Margaret, ſpouſe to young Henry, in this ceremony<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 529.

            <p>WHILE Henry was alarmed with this event, and had the proſpect of dangerous intrigues, or even of a war, which, whether ſucceſsful or not, muſt be extremely calamitous and diſagreeable to him, he received intelligence of new misfortunes, which muſt have affected him in the moſt ſenſible part. Queen Eleanor, who had diſguſted her firſt huſband by her gallantries, was no leſs offenſive to her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by her jealouſy; and after this manner, carried to extremity, in the different parts of her life, every circumſtance of female weakneſs. She communicated her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents againſt Henry to her two younger ſons, Geoffrey and Richard; perſuaded them that they were alſo entitled to preſent poſſeſſion of the territories aſſigned to them; engaged them to fly ſecretly to the court of France<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 48. Brompton, p. 1083. Neubrig. p. 404.</note>; and was meditating, herſelf, an eſcape to the ſame court, and had even put on man's apparel for that purpoſe; when ſhe was ſeized by orders from her huſband, and was thrown into confinement<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron. Gerv. p. 1424.</note>. Thus, Europe ſaw with aſtoniſhment the beſt and moſt indulgent of parents at war with his whole family; three boys, ſcarce arrived at the age of puberty, require a great monarch, in the full vigour of his age and height of his reputation, to dethrone himſelf in their favour; and ſeveral princes not aſhamed to ſpport them in theſe unnatural and abſurd pretenſions.</p>
            <p>HENRY, reduced to this perilous and diſagreeable ſituation, had recourſe to the court of Rome; and tho' ſenſible of the danger attending the interpoſition of eccleſiaſtical authority in temporal diſputes, applied to the Pope, as his ſuperior lord, to excommunicate his enemies, and by theſe cenſures to reduce to obedience his undutiful children, whom he found ſuch a reluctance to puniſh by the ſword of the magiſtrate<note n="§" place="bottom">Epiſt.

The King, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking this humiliating ſtep, was obliged to have recourſe to arms, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſuch auxiliaries, as are the uſual reſource of tyrants, and have ſeldom been employed by ſo wiſe and juſt a monarch.</p>
            <p>THE looſe government, which prevailed in all the ſtates of Europe, the many private wars carried on among the neighbouring nobles, and the impoſſibility to enforce any general execution of the laws, had encouraged a tribe of banditti to diſturb every where the public peace, to infeſt the high roads, to pillage the open country, and to brave all the efforts of the civil magiſtrate, and even the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of the church, which were thundered out againſt them<note n="*" place="bottom">Neubrig. p. 413.</note>. Troops of them were ſometimes inliſted in the ſervice of one prince or baron, ſometimes in that of another: They often acted in an independent manner, under leaders of their own: The peaceful and induſtrious inhabitants, reduced to poverty by their ravages, were frequently obliged for ſubſiſtance to betake themſelves to a like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly courſe of life: And a continual inteſtine war, pernicious to induſtry, as well as to the execution of juſtice, was thus carried on in the bowels of every kingdom<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron.

Theſe deſperate reffians received the name ſometimes of Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſometimes of Routiers or Cottereaux; but for what reaſon, is not agreed by hiſtorians: And they formed a kind of ſociety or government among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſet at defiance all the reſt of mankind. The greateſt monarchs were not aſhamed, on occaſion, to have recourſe to their aſſiſtance; and as their habits of war and devaſtation had given them experience, hardineſs, and courage, they generally compoſed the moſt formidable part of thoſe armies, which decided the political quarrels of princes. Several of them were enliſted among the forces levied by Henry's enemies<note n="‡" place="bottom">Petr. Bleſ. epiſt. 47.</note>; but the great treaſures amaſſed by that prince enabled him to engage more numerous troops of them in his ſervice; and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of his affairs rendered even ſuch banditti the only forces on whoſe fidelity he could repoſe any confidence. His licentious barons, diſguſted with a vigilant government, were more deſirous of being ruled by young princes, ignorant of public affairs, remiſs in their conduct, and profuſe in their grants<note n="‖" place="bottom">Diceto, p. 570.</note>; and as the King had enſured to his ſons the ſucceſſion to every particular province of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, the nobles dreaded no danger in adhering to thoſe who, they knew, muſt ſome time become their ſovereigns.

            <p>LEWIS, in order to bind the confederates in a cloſer union, ſummoned at Paris an aſſembly of the chief vaſſals of the crown, received their approbation of his meaſures, and engaged them by oath to adhere to the cauſe of young Henry<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened.

That prince in return bound himſelf by a like tie never to deſert his French allies; and having made a new great ſeal<note n="§" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1084.</note>, he laviſhly diſtributed among them many conſiderable parts of thoſe territories which he propoſed to conquer from his father<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Bened.

Philip, count of Flanders, Matthew, count of Bologne, his brother, Theobald, count of Blois, Henry, count of Eu, partly moved by the general jealouſy which had been excited by Henry's power and ambition, partly allured by the proſpect of reaping advantage from the inconſiderate temper and the neceſſities of the young prince, declared openly in favour of the latter. William, King of Scotland, had alſo entered into this great confederacy<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Mailr. p. 172.

            <p>HOSTILITIES were firſt commenced by the counts of Flanders and Boulogne on the frontiers of Normandy.

After he had lain a month before the place, the garriſon, being ſtraitened for proviſions, were obliged to capitulate; and they engaged, if not relieved within three days, to ſurrender the town, and to retire into the citadel. On the laſt of theſe days, Henry appeared with his army upon the heights above Verneüil; and Lewis, dreading an aſſault, ſent the archbiſhop of Sens and the count of Blois to the Engliſh camp, and deſired that next day ſhould be appointed for a conference, in order to eſtabliſh a general peace, and terminate the differences between Henry and his ſons. The King, who paſſionately deſired this agreement, and ſuſpected no fraud, gave his conſent; but Lewis, that morning, obliging the garriſon to ſurrender according to the capitulation, ſet fire to the place, and began to retire with his army<note n="†" place="bottom">Bened. p. 57, 58, &amp;c. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 570, 571, 572. Brompton, p. 1085, 1086, 1087.</note>. Henry, provoked at this artifice, attacked the rear with vigor, put them to rout, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome ſlaughter, and took ſeveral priſoners. The French army, as their time of ſervice was now expired, immediately diſperſed themſelves into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral provinces; and left Henry free to proſecute his advantages againſt his other enemies.</p>
            <p>THE nobles of Brittany, excited by the earl of Cheſter and Ralph de Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres, were all in arms; but their progreſs was checked by a body of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancons, which the King, after Lewis's retreat, had ſent againſt them. The two armies came to an action near Dol; where the rebels were defeated, fifteen hundred killed on the ſpot, and the leaders, the earl of Cheſter and Fougeres, obliged to take ſhelter in the town of Dol<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 535.</note>. Henry haſtened to form the ſiege of that place, and carried on the attack with ſuch ardor, that he obliged the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and garriſon to ſurrender themſelves priſoners of war<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 64, 65. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 574. Neubrig. p. 406. Heming. p. 500. Trivet, p. 61.</note>. By theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous meaſures and happy ſucceſſes, the inſurrections were entirely quelled in Brittany; and the King, being thus fortunate in all quarters, willingly agreed to a conference with Lewis, in hopes, that his enemies, finding all their mighty efforts entirely fruſtrated, would agree to terminate hoſtilities on ſome moderate and reaſonable conditions.</p>
            <p>THE two monarchs met between Trie and Giſors; and Henry had here the mortification to ſee his three ſons in the retinue of his mortal enemy.

He made a like offer to Richard in Guinne; he promiſed to reſign all Brittany to Geoffrey; and if theſe conceſſions were not deemed ſufficient, he agreed to add to them whatever the Pope's legates, who were preſent, ſhould require of him<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 536. Brompton, p. 1088.</note>. The earl of Leiceſter was admitted to this negotiation; and either from the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of his temper, or from a view of breaking off abruptly a conference, which muſt cover the allies with confuſion, he gave vent to the moſt violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt Henry, and even put his hand to his ſword, as if he meant to attempt ſome violence upon him. This furious action threw the whole company into confuſion, and put an end to the treaty<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 536.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE chief hopes of Henry's enemies ſeemed now to depend on the ſtate of affairs in England, where his authority was expoſed to the moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. One article of young Henry's agreement with his foreign confederates, was, that he ſhould reſign Kent, with Dover and all its other fortreſſes, into the hands of the count of Flanders<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 533. Brompton, p. 1084. Neubr. p. 508.</note>; yet ſo little national or public ſpirit prevailed among the independant Engliſh nobility, ſo wholly bent were they on the aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment each of himſelf and his own family, that, notwithſtanding this pernicious conceſſion, which muſt have involved the total ruin of the kingdom, the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them had conſpired to make an inſurrection and to ſupport the prince's pretenſions. The King's chief reſource lay in the church and the biſhops, with whom he was now in perfect agreement; whether that the decency of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter made them aſhamed of ſupporting ſo unnatural a rebellion, or that they were entirely ſatisfied with Henry's atonement for the murder of Becket and for his former invaſion of eccleſiaſtical immunities. That prince, however, had reſigned none of the eſſential rights of his crown in the accommodation; he maintained ſtill the ſame prudent jealouſy of the court of Rome; admitted no legate into England, without his ſwearing to attempt nothing againſt his royal prerogatives; and he had even obliged the monks of Canterbury, who pretended to a free election on the vacancy, made by the death of Becket, to chooſe Roger, prior of Dover, in the place of that turbulent prelate<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 537.</note>.</p>

He aſſembled a chapter of the monks, diſrobed himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, put a ſcourge or diſcipline into each of their hands, and preſented his bare ſhoulders to the laſhes which theſe eccleſiaſtics ſucceſſively inflicted upon him<note n="*" place="bottom">Ypod Neuſt. p. 450.

He had here weakened his army ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, by ſending out numerous detachments in order to extend his ravages; and he lay abſolutely ſafe, as he imagined, from any attack of the enemy.

            <p>THIS great and important victory proved at laſt deciſive in favour of Henry, and broke entirely the ſpirit of the Engliſh rebels. The biſhop of Durham, who was preparing to revolt, made his ſubmiſſions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bened.

The clergy exalted a-new the merits and powerful interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Becket; and Henry, inſtead of oppoſing this ſuperſtition, plumed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the new friendſhip of that ſaint, and propagated an opinion which was ſo favourable to his intereſts<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 539.</note>.</p>
            <p>YOUNG Henry, who was ready to embark at Gravelines with the earl of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and a great army, hearing of the ſuppreſſion of his partizans in England, abandoned all thoughts of the enterprize, and joined the camp of the French King, who, during the abſence of old Henry, had made an irruption into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, and had laid ſiege to Roüen<note n="*" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1096.</note>. The place was defended with great vigor by the inhabitants<note n="†" place="bottom">Diceto, p. 578.</note>; and Lewis, deſpairing of ſucceſs by open force, tried to gain the town by a ſtratagem, which, in that ſuperſtitious age, was deemed very little honourable. He proclaimed in his own camp a ceſſation of arms under pretext of celebrating the feſtival of St. Laurence; and when the citizens, ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſafety, were ſo imprudent as to remit their guard, he propoſed to take advantage of their ſecurity. Happily, ſome prieſts had, from mere curioſity, mounted a ſteeple, where the alarm bell hung; and obſerving the French camp in motion, they immediately rang the bell, and gave warning to the inhabitants, who ran to their ſeveral ſtations. The French, who, on hearing the bell, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the aſſault, had already mounted the walls in ſeveral places; but being repulſed by the enraged citizens, were obliged to retreat with conſiderable loſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Brompton, p. 1096.

Next day, Henry, who had haſtened to the defence of his Norman dominions, paſſed over the bridge in triumph; and entered Roüen in ſight of the French army. The city was now in abſolute ſafety; and the King, in order to brave the French monarch, commanded the gates, which had been walled up, to be opened<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 540.</note>; and he prepared to puſh his advantages againſt the enemy. Lewis ſaved himſelf from this perilous ſituation by a new piece of deceit, not ſo juſtifiable. He propoſed a conference for adjuſting the terms of a general peace, which, he knew, would be greedily embraced by Henry; and while the King of England truſted to the execution of his promiſe, he made a retreat with his army into France<note n="†" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. 86. Brompton, p 1098.</note>.</p>
            <p>THERE was, however, a neceſſity on both ſides for an accommodation. Henry could no longer bear to ſee his three ſons in the hands of his enemy; and Lewis dreaded, left this great monarch, victorious in all quarters, crowned with glory, and abſolute maſter of his dominions, might take revenge for the many dangers and diſquietudes, which the arms, and ſtill more the intrigues of France, had, in his diſputes both with Becket and his ſons, been able to raiſe him. After making a ceſſation of arms, a conference was agreed on near Tours; where Henry granted his ſons much leſs advantageous terms than he had formerly proffered; and he received their ſubmiſſions. <note place="margin">The King's accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his ſons.</note> The moſt material of his conceſſions were ſome pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which he ſtipulated to pay them, and ſome caſtles which he granted them for the place of their reſidence; together with an indemnity to all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, who were reſtored to their eſtates and honours<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 35.

            <p>OF all thoſe who had embraced the cauſe of the young princes, William, King of Scotland, was the only conſiderable ſufferer, by that invidious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt enterprize.

He engaged the King and ſtates of Scotland to make a perpetual ceſſion of the fortreſſes of Berwic and Roxborough, and to allow the caſtle of Edinburgh to remain in his hands for a limited time. This was the firſt great aſcendant which England ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over Scotland; and indeed the firſt important event, which had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe kingdoms. Few princes have been ſo fortunate as to gain conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantages over their weaker neighbours with leſs violence and injuſtice, than was practiſed by Henry againſt the King of Scotland, whom he had taken priſoner in battle, and who had wantonly engaged in a war, in which all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of that prince, and even all his own family, were, without provocation, combined againſt him.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1176</label> HE enacted ſevere penalties againſt robbery, murder, falſe coining, burning houſes; and ordained that theſe crimes ſhould be puniſhed by the amputation of the right hand and right foot<note n="†" place="bottom">Bened.

Theſe puniſhments were probably eſteemed more ſevere than death: The pecuniary commutation for crimes, which has a falſe appearance of lenity, had been gradually diſuſed; and ſeems to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aboliſhed by the rigor of theſe ſtatutes. The ſuperſtitious trial by water ordeal, tho' condemned by the church<note n="‡" place="bottom">Seld.

Abb. p. 132.</note>.</p>
            <p>ALL advances towards reaſon and good ſenſe are ſlow and gradual. Henry, tho' ſenſible of the great abſurdity, attending the trial by duel or battle, did not venture to aboliſh it: He only admitted either of the parties to challenge
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0162900301:323"/>
a trial by an aſſize or jury of twelve freeholders<note n="*" place="bottom">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note>. This method of trial ſeems to have been very antient in England, and was fixed by the laws of King Alfred: But the barbarous and violent genius of the age had of late given more credit to the trial by battle, which had become the general method of deciding all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant controverſies. It was never aboliſhed by law in England; and there is an inſtance of it ſo late as the reign of Elizabeth: But the inſtitution revived by this King, being found more reaſonable and more ſuitable to a civilized people, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually prevailed over it.</p>
            <p>THE partition of England into four diviſions, and the appointment of itinerant juſtices to go the circuit in each diviſion, and decide the cauſes in the counties, was another important ordinance of this prince, had a direct tendency to reſtrain the oppreſſions of the barons, and to protect the inferior gentry and common people in their property<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 590.</note>. Theſe juſtices were either prelates or conſiderable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and beſides carrying the authority of the King's commiſſion, were able, by the dignity of their own character, to give weight and credit to the laws.</p>
            <p>THAT there might be fewer obſtacles to the execution of juſtice, the King was vigilant to demoliſh all the new erected caſtles of the nobility, in England as well as in his foreign dominions; and he permitted no fortreſs to remain in hands, whom he found reaſon to ſuſpect<note n="‡" place="bottom">Benedict Abbas, p. 202. Diceto, p. 585.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT leſt the kingdom ſhould be expoſed by this demolition of the ſtrong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the King fixed an aſſize of arms, by which all his ſubjects were obliged to put themſelves in a ſituation proper for defending themſelves and the realm. Every man, poſſeſſed of a knight's fee, was ordained to have for each fee a coat of mail, a helmet, a ſhield, and a lance; every free layman poſſeſſed of goods to the value of ſixteen marks, was to be armed in like manner; every one poſſeſſed of ten marks was obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a lance; all burgeſſes were to have a cap of iron, a lance, and a wambais, that is, a coat twilted with wool, tow, or ſuch other materials<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 305. Chron. Gerv. p. 1459. Annal. Waverl. p. 161.</note>. It appears, that archery, for which the Engliſh were afterwards ſo renowned, had not, at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very common among them. The ſpear was the chief weapon employed in battle.</p>
            <p>THE clergy and the laity were during that age in a ſtrange ſituation with regard to each other, and ſuch as may ſeem totally incompatible with a civilized, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with any government. If a clergyman was guilty of murder, he could only be puniſhed by degradation: If he was murdered, the murderer was only expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0162900301:324"/>

Hence the aſſaſſins of Thomas a Becket himſelf, tho' guilty of the moſt atrocious wickedneſs, and the moſt repugnant to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of that age, lived ſecurely in their own houſes, without being called to account by Henry himſelf, who was ſo much concerned, both in honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to puniſh that crime, and who profeſſed or affected on all occaſions the moſt extreme abhorrence of it. It was not till they found their preſence ſhunned by every one as excommunicated perſons, that they were induced to take a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Rome, to throw themſelves at the Pope's feet, and to ſubmit to the penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces impoſed upon them: After which, they continued to poſſeſs, without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their honours and fo tunes, and ſeem even to have recovered the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and good opinion of the public. But as the King, by the conſtitutions of Clarendon, which he endeavoured ſtill to maintain in force<note n="†" place="bottom">Chron. Gerv. p. 1433.</note>, had ſubjected the clergy to a trial by the civil magiſtrate, it ſeemed but juſt to give them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of that power, to which they were ſubjected; and it was enacted, that the murderers of clergymen ſhou'd be tried before the juſticiary in the preſence of the biſhop or his official; and beſides the uſual puniſhment for murder, ſhould be ſubjected to a forfeiture of their eſtates, and a confiſcation of their goods and chattels<note n="‡" place="bottom">Diceto p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>THE King paſſed a very equitable law, that the goods of a vaſſal ſhall not be ſeized for the debt of his lord, unleſs the vaſſal be ſurety for the debt; and that the rents of vaſſals ſhall be paid to the creditors of the lord, not to the lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is remarkable, that this law was enacted by the King in a council which he held at Verneuil, and which conſiſted of ſome prelates and barons of England, as well as ſome of Normandy, Poictou, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and the ſtatute took place in all theſe different territories<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened.

Molineux's Caſe of Ireland, p. 64, 65, 66.</note>: A certain proof how irregular the antient feudal government was, and how near the Kings, in ſame inſtances, approached to deſpotiſm, tho' in others they ſeemed ſcarce to poſſeſs any authority. If a prince, much dreaded and revered like Henry, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but the appearance of general conſent to an ordinance, which was equitable and juſt, it became immediately an eſtabliſhed law, and all the world acquieſced in it. If the prince was hated or deſpiſed; if the nobles, who ſupported him, had ſmall influence; if the humours of the times diſpoſed the people to queſtion the juſtice of his ordinances; the fulleſt and moſt authentic council had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

Thus all was confuſion and diſorder; no regular ideas of a conſtitution prevailed; force and violence decided every thing.</p>
            <p>THE ſucceſs which had attended Henry in his wars did not encourage his neighbours to attempt any thing againſt him; and his tranſactions with them, during the remainder of his reign, contain little memorable.

Richard, whom he had made maſter of Guienne, and who had diſplayed his valour and military genius, by ſuppreſſing the revolts of his mutinous barons, refuſed to obey Henry's orders, in doing homage to his elder brother for that dutchy; and he defended himſelf againſt young Henry and Geoffrey, who, uniting their arms, carried war into his territories<note n="*" place="bottom">Ypod Neuſt. p. 451.

            <p>THE behaviour of his ſurviving children was ill calculated to give the King any conſolation for this loſs.

Theſe infidels, tho' obliged to yield to the immenſe inundation of Chriſtians in the firſt croiſade, had recovered courage after the torrent was paſt; and attacking on all quarters the ſettlements of the Europeans, had reduced them to great difficulties, and obliged them to apply again for ſuccours from the weſt. A ſecond croiſade, under the Emperor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, and Lewis VII.

The King of France required, that Richard ſhould be crowned King of England in the lifetime of his father, ſhould be inveſted in all his tranſmarine dominions, and ſhould be immediately married to Alice, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip's ſiſter, to whom he had formerly been contracted, and who had been already conducted into England<note n="‖" place="bottom">Bened.

and aſſign this as an additional reaſon for his refuſing theſe conditions: But he had ſo many other juſt and equitable motives for his conduct, that it is needleſs to ſeek for a cauſe, which the great prudence and advanced age of that monarch render ſomewhat improbable.</p>
            <p>CARDINAL Albano, the Pope's legate, diſpleaſed with theſe increaſing obſtacles to the croiſade, excommunicated Richa d, as the chief ſpring of diſcord: But the ſentence of excommunication, which, when it was properly prepared, and was zealouſly ſupported by the clergy, had often great influence in that age, proved entirely ineffectual in the preſent caſe. The chief barons of Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being attached to the young prince, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had now received the inveſtiture from their ſuperior lord, declared for him, and made inroads into the territories of ſuch as ſtill adhered to the old King. Henry, diſquieted by the daily revolts of his mutinous ſubjects, and dreading ſtill worſe effects from their turbulent diſpoſition, had again recourſe to papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and engaged the cardinal Anagni, who had ſucceeded Albano in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateſhip, to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his dominions. But Philip, who was a prince of great vigour and capacity, deſpiſed the menace; and told Anagni, that it belonged not to the Pope to interpoſe in the temporal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of princes, much leſs in thoſe between him and his rebellious vaſſals.

            <p>THE King of England was now obliged to defend his dominions by arms, and to enter on a war with France and with his eldeſt ſon, a prince of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, on ſuch diſadvantageous terms.

               </note> THIS prince, like moſt of his predeceſſors of the Norman line, except Stephen, paſſed more of his time on the continent than in this iſland: He was ſurrounded with the Engliſh gentry and nobility, when abroad: The French gentry and nobility followed him when he reſided in England: Both nations acted in the government, as if they were the ſame people; and on many occaſions, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures ſeem not to have been diſtinguiſhed. As the King and Engliſh ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were all of them of French extraction, the manners of that people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the aſcendant, and were regarded as the great models of imitation. All foreign improvements, therefore, ſuch as they were, in literature and politeneſs, in laws and arts, ſeem now to have been, in a good meaſure, tranſplanted into England; and that nation was become nowiſe inferior, in all the faſhionable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, to any of its neighbours on the continent. The more homely,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0162900301:333"/>
but more ſenſible manners and principles of the Saxons were exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the ſubtilties of ſchool philoſophy: The feudal ideas of civil government, the Romiſh ſentiments of religion, had taken entire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the people: By the former, the ſenſe of ſubmiſſion towards princes was ſomewhat diminiſhed in the barons; by the latter, the devoted attachment to papal authority was much augmented among the clergy. The Norman and other foreign families, eſtabliſhed in England, had now ſtruck deep root; and being entirely coalited with the people, whom at firſt they oppreſſed and deſpiſed, they no longer thought, that they needed the protection of the crown for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their fortunes, or conſidered their tenure as precarious and dependant. They aſpired to the ſame liberty and independance, which they ſaw enjoyed by their brethren on the continent, and deſired to reſtrain thoſe exorbitant prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the neceſſities of war and the violence of conqueſt had at firſt obliged them to indulge in their monarch. That memory alſo of a more equal government under the Saxon princes, which ſtill remained with the Engliſh, diffuſed ſtill farther the ſpirit of liberty, and made the barons both deſirous of more independance to themſelves, and willing to indulge it to the people. And it was not long before this ſecret revolution in the ſentiments of men produced firſt violent convulſions in the ſtate, and then an evident alteration in the maxims of government.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of all the preceding Kings of England ſince the Conqueſt, give evident proofs of the diſorders attending the feudal government; the licentiouſneſs of the barons, their ſpirit of rebellion againſt the prince and laws, and of animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity againſt each other: The conduct of the barons in the tranſmarine dominions of thoſe monarchs afforded perhaps ſtill more flagrant inſtances of theſe convulſions; and the hiſtory of France, during ſeveral ages, conſiſts almoſt entirely of narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this nature. The cities, during the continuance of this violent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could neither be very populous nor numerous; and there occur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which ſeem to prove, that, tho' theſe are always the firſt ſeat of law and liberty, their police was in general very looſe and irregular, and expoſed to the ſame diſorders, with thoſe by which the country was generally infeſted. It was a cuſtom in London for great numbers, to the amount of a hundred or more, of the ſons and relations of eminent citizens, to form themſelves into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious confederacy, to break into rich houſes and plunder them, to rob and murder the paſſengers, and to commit with impunity all ſorts of diſorder. By theſe crimes, it had become ſo dangerous to walk the ſtreets a-nights, that the citizens dared no more to venture abroad after ſunſet, than if they were expoſed to the incurſions of a public enemy. The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0162900301:334"/>
murdered by ſome of theſe nocturnal rioters; and the death of a perſon of that noble birth, which was much more regarded than that of many thouſands of an inferior ſtation, ſo provoked the King, that he ſwore vengeance againſt the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and became thenceforth much more rigorous in the execution of the laws<note n="*" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 196.</note>.</p>
            <p>THERE is another inſtance given by hiſtorians, which proves to what a height ſuch riots had proceeded, and how open theſe criminals were in committing their robberies. A band of them had attacked the houſe of a rich citizen, with an intention of plundering it; had broke thro' a ſtone-wall with hammers and wedges; and had already entered the houſe ſword in hand; when the citizen, armed cap-a-pee and ſupported by his faithful ſervants, appeared in the paſſage to oppoſe them: He cut off the right-hand of the firſt robber that entered; and made ſuch ſtout reſiſtance, that his neighbours had leizure to aſſemble, and come to his relief. The man, who loſt his hand, was caught; and was tempted by the promiſe of pardon to reveal his confederates; among whom was one John Senex, eſteemed among the richeſt and beſt born citizens of London. He was convicted by the ordeal trial; and tho' he offered five hundred marks for his life, the King refuſed the money, and ordered him to be hanged<note n="†" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. 197, 198.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY's exactneſs in adminiſtring juſtice had gained him ſo great reputation, that even foreign and diſtant princes made him an arbiter, and ſubmitted their differences to his judgment. Sanchez, King of Navarre, having ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies with Alfonſo, King of Caſtile, was contented, tho' Alfonſo had married the daughter of Henry, to chooſe that prince for a referee; and they agreed, each of them, to conſign three caſtles into neutral hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his award. Henry made the cauſe be examined before his great council, and gave a ſentence, which was willingly ſubmitted to by both parties. Theſe two Spaniſh Kings ſent each a ſtout champion to the court of England, in order to defend his cauſe by arms, in caſe the way of duel had been choſen by Henry<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 4. p. 43. Bened. Abb. p. 172. Diceto, p. 597. Brompton, p 1120.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY ſo far aboliſhed the barbarous and abſurd practice of forfeiting ſhips, which had been wrecked on the coaſt, that if one man or animal was alive in the ſhip, the veſſel and goods were reſtored to the owners<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 36.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE reign of Henry was remarkable for an innovation, which was afterwards carried farther by his ſucceſſors, and was attended with the moſt important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to the government. This prince was diſguſted with the ſpecies of military force, which was eſtabliſhed by the feudal inſtitutions, and which, tho' it
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0162900301:335"/>
was extremely burdenſome to the ſubject, yet rendered very little ſervice to the ſovereign. The barons, or military tenants, came late into the field; they were obliged to ſerve only for forty days; they were unſkilful and diſorderly in all their operations; and they were apt to carry into the camp the ſame refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and independant ſpirit, to which they were accuſtomed in their civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of making a commutation of their military ſervice for money; and he levied ſcutages from his baronies and knights fees, inſtead of requiring the perſonal attendance of his vaſſals. There is mention made, in the hiſtory of the exchequer, of theſe ſcutages in his ſecond, fifth, and eighteenth year<note n="*" place="bottom">Madox, p. 435, 436, 437, 438.</note>; and other writers give us an account of three more of them<note n="†" place="bottom">Tyrrel, vol. 2. p. 466. from the records.</note>. When the prince had thus obtained money, he made a contract with ſome of thoſe adventurers, in which Europe at that time abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They found him ſoldiers of the ſame character with themſelves, who were bound to ſerve for a ſtipulated time: The armies were much leſs numerous, but more uſeful, than when compoſed of all the military vaſſals of the crown: The feudal inſtitutions began to relax: The Kings became rapacious for money, on which all their power depended: The barons, ſeeing no end of exactions, ſought to defend their property: And as the ſame cauſes had nearly the ſame effect in the different countries of Europe, the ſeveral crowns either loſt or acquired au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, according to their different ſucceſs in this ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>THIS prince was alſo the firſt who levied a tax on the moveables or perſonal eſtates of his ſubjects, nobles as well as people. Their zeal for the holy wars made them ſubmit to this innovation; and a precedent being once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns, the uſual method of ſupplying the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the crown. The tax of Danegelt, ſo generally odious to the nation, was remitted in this reign.</p>
            <p>IT was an uſual practice of the Kings of England, to repeat the ceremony of their coronation thrice a-year, on aſſembling the ſtates at the three great feſtivals. Henry, after the firſt years of his reign, never renewed this ceremony, which was found to be very expenſive and very uſeleſs. None of his ſucceſſors ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived it. It is deemed a great act of grace in this prince, that he mitigated the rigor of the foreſt-laws, and puniſhed any tranſgreſſions of them, not capitally, but by fines, impriſonments, and other more moderate penalties.</p>
            <p>SINCE we are here collecting ſome detached inſtances, which ſhow the genius of the age, and which could not ſo well enter into the body of the hiſtory, it may not be amiſs to mention the quarrel between Roger archbiſhop of York, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0162900301:336"/>
Richard archbiſhop of Canterbury. We may judge of the violence of military men and laymen, when eccleſiaſtics could proceed to ſuch extremities. Cardinal Haguezun being ſent, in 1176, as legate into Britain, ſummoned an aſſembly of the clergy at London; and as both the archbiſhops pretended to ſit on his right hand, this queſtion of precedency begot a controverſy between them. The monks and retainers of archbiſhop Richard fell upon Roger, in the preſence of the cardinal and of the ſynod, threw him on the ground, trampled him under foot, and ſo bruiſed him with blows, that he was taken up half dead, and his life was, with difficulty, ſaved from their violence. The archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury was obliged to give a large ſum of money to the legate, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all complaints of this enormity<note n="*" place="bottom">Bened. Abb. p. 138, 139. Brompton, p. 1109. Chron. Gerv. p. 1433. Neubrig. p. 413.</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS King left only two legitimate ſons, Richard, who ſucceeded him, and John, who inherited no territory, tho' his father had often intended to leave him a part of his extenſive dominions. He was thence commonly denominated <hi>Lackland.</hi> Henry left three legitimate daughters; Maud, born in 1156, and married to Henry, duke of Saxony; Eleanor, born in 1162, and married to Alphonſo, King of Caſtile; Joan, born in 1165, and married to William, King of Sicily<note n="†" place="bottom">Diceto, p. 616.</note>.</p>
            <p>HENRY is ſaid by antient hiſtorians to have been of a very amorous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they mention two of his natural ſons by Roſamond, daughter of lord Clifford, viz. Richard Longeſpée, or Long-ſword, (ſo called from the ſword he uſually wore) who was afterwards married to Ela, the daughter and heireſs of the earl of Saliſbury; and Geoffrey, firſt biſhop of Lincoln, and then archbiſhop of York.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1189</label> THE compunction of Richard, for his undutiful behaviour towards his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was very durable, and influenced him in the choice of his miniſters and ſervants after his acceſſion. Thoſe who had ſeconded and favoured his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, inſtead of meeting with that honour and truſt which they expected, were ſurpriſed to find, that they lay under diſgrace with the new King, and were on all occaſions hated and deſpiſed by him. The faithful miniſters of Henry, who had vigorouſly oppoſed all the enterprizes of his ſons, were received with open arms, and were continued in thoſe employments, which they had honourably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to their former maſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 655. Bened. Abb. p 547. M. Paris, p. 107.</note>. This prudent conduct might be the reſult of reflection; but in a prince, like Richard, ſo much guided by paſſion, and ſo little by policy, it was commonly aſcribed to a principle ſtill more virtuous and more honourable.</p>

His bounty to his brother John was rather profuſe and imprudent. Beſides beſtowing on him the county of Mortaigne in Normandy, granting him a penſion of four thouſand marks a-year, and marrying him to Aviſa, the daughter of the earl of Gloceſter, by whom he inherited all the poſſeſſions of that opulent family; he increaſed this

appanage, which the late King had deſtined him, by other extenſive grants and conceſſions. He conſerred on him the whole eſtate of William Peverell, which had eſcheated to the crown: He put him in poſſeſſion of eight caſtles, with all the foreſts and honours annexed to them<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

               <note place="margin">The King's preparation for the croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade.</note> THE King, impelled more by the love of military glory than by ſuperſtition, acted, from the beginning of his reign, as if the ſole purpoſe of his government had been the relief of the holy land, and the recovery of Jeruſalem from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens. This zeal againſt infidels, being communicated to his ſubjects, broke out in London on the day of his coronation, and made them find a croiſade leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and attended with more immediate profit. The prejudices of the age had made the lending of money on intereſt paſs by the invidious name of uſury; yet the neceſſity of the practice had ſtill continued it, and the greateſt part of that kind of dealing fell every where into the hands of the Jews; who, being already infamous on account of their religion, had no honour to loſe, and were apt to exerciſe a profeſſion, odious in itſelf, by every kind of rigor, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by rapine and extortion. The induſtry and frugality of that people had put them in poſſeſſion of all the ready money, which the idleneſs and profuſion of the Engliſh, as well as of other European nations, enabled them to lend on exorbitant and unequal intereſt. The monkiſh writers repreſent it as a great ſtain on the wiſe and equitable government of Henry, that he had carefully protected this infidel race from all injuries and inſults; but the zeal of Richard afforded the populace a pretence for exerciſing their animoſity againſt them. The King had iſſued a proclamation, prohibiting their appearance at his coronation; but ſome of them, bringing him large preſents from their nation, preſumed, in confidence of that merit, to approach the hall in which he dined; and being diſcovered, they were expoſed to the inſults and injuries of the byſtanders<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 657.

Knyghton, p. 2401.</note>. But the diſorder ſtopped not at London. The inhabitants of the other cities of England, hearing of this execution of the Jews, imitated the barbarous example<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chron. de Dunſt. p. 43. Wykes, p. 34. W.

            <p>THE antient ſituation of England, when the people poſſeſſed little riches and the public no credit, made it impoſſible for the ſovereigns to bear the expences of a ſteady or durable war, even on their frontiers; much leſs could they find regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar means for the ſupport of ſuch diſtant expeditions as thoſe into Paleſtine, which were more the reſult of popular frenzy than of ſober reaſon or deliberate policy. Richard, therefore, knew, that he muſt carry with him all the treaſure requiſite for his enterprize, and that both the remoteneſs of his own country and its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty made it unable to furniſh him with thoſe continued ſupplies, which the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of ſo perilous a war muſt neceſſarily require.

Elated with the hopes of fame, which in that age attended no wars but thoſe againſt the infidels, he was blind to every other conſideration; and when ſome of his wiſer miniſters objected againſt this diſſipation of the revenue and power of the crown, he replied, that he would ſell London itſelf, if he could find a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer<note n="†" place="bottom">W.

Nothing indeed could be a ſtronger proof how negligent he was of all future intereſts in compariſon of the croiſade, than his ſelling, for ſo ſmall a ſum as 10,000 marks, the vaſſalage of Scotland, together with the fortreſſes of Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and Berwic, the greateſt acquiſition which had been made by his father during the courſe of his victorious reign; and his accepting the homage of William in the uſual terms, merely for the territories which that prince held in England<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 662. Rymer, vol. 1. p. 64. M. Weſt. p. 257.</note>. Numerous exactions were practiſed on the Engliſh of all ranks and ſtations: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces were employed both againſt the innocent and the guilty, in order to force money from them: And where a pretence was wanting againſt the rich, the King obliged them, by the fear of his diſpleaſure, to lend him ſums, which, he knew, it would never be in his power to repay.</p>
            <p>BUT Richard, tho' he ſacrificed every intereſt and conſideration to the ſucceſs of this pious enterprize, carried ſo little the appearance of ſanctity in his conduct, that Fulk, curate of Neuilly, a zealous preacher of the croiſade, who from that merit had acquired the privilege of ſpeaking the boldeſt truths, adviſed him to rid himſelf of his notorious vices, particularly his pride, avarice, and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he called the King's three favourite daughters. <hi>You counſel well,</hi> replied Richard; <hi>and I hereby diſpoſe of the firſt to the Templars, of the ſecond to the Benedictines, and of the third to my prelates.</hi>

            <p>RICHARD, jealous of attempts which might be made on England during his abſence, laid prince John, as well as his natural brother Geoffrey, archbiſhop of York, under engagements, confirmed by their oaths, that neither of them ſhould enter that kingdom till his return; tho' he thought proper, before his departure, to withdraw this prohibition<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 664.

            <p>THE Emperor Frederic, a prince of great ſpirit and conduct, had already taken the road to Paleſtine at the head of 150,000 men, collected from Germany and all the northern ſtates; and having ſurmounted every obſtacle thrown in his way by the artifices of the Greeks and the power of the infidels, had penetrated to the borders of Syria; when, bathing in the cold river Cydnus, during the greateſt heat of the ſummer-ſeaſon, he was ſeized with a mortal diſtemper, which put an end to his life and his raſh enterprize<note n="‡" place="bottom">Bened.

This princeſs had, in expectation of that rich inheritance, been married to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VI. the preſent Emperor<note n="†" place="bottom">Bened.

Tho' that monarch had formerly maintained the cauſe of Luſignan againſt Conrade, he had become ſenſible of the bad effects at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending theſe diſſenſions, and had voluntarily conferred on the former the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Cyprus, on condition that he ſhould reſign to his rival all pretenſions to the crown of Jeruſalem<note n="‡" place="bottom">Viniſauf, p. 391.</note> Conrade himſelf, with his dying breath, had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his widow to the prot ction of Richard<note n="‖" place="bottom">Brompton, p 1243.</note>; the prince of the aſſaſſins avowed the action in a form I narrative which he ſent to Europe<note n="§" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 1 p. 71 Trivet. p 124 W.

BUT Richard's heroic actions in Paleſtine were the beſt apology for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The croiſes under his command determined, on opening the campaign, to attempt the ſiege of Aſcalon, in order to prepare the way for that of Jeruſalem; and they marched along the ſea-coaſt with that intention. Saladin propoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept their paſſage; and he placed himſelf on the road with an army, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 300,000 combatants. On this occaſion was fought one of the greateſt battles of that age; and the moſt celebrated, for the military genius of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, for the number and valour of the troops, and for the great variety of events which attended it. Both the right wing of the Chriſtians, commanded by d'Aveſnes, and the left, headed by the duke of Burgundy, were, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the day, broken and defeated; when Richard, who led on the main body, reſtored the battle; attacked the enemy with admirable intrepidity and preſence of mind; performed the part both of a conſummate general and gallant ſoldier; and not only gave his two wings leizure to recover from their confuſion, but obtained a compleat victory over the Saracens, of whom forty thouſand are ſaid to have periſhed in the field<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Aſcalon ſoon after fell into the hands of the Chriſtians: Other ſieges were carried on with ſucceſs: Richard was even able to advance within ſight of Jeruſalem, the object of all his enterprizes; when he had the mortification to find, that he muſt abandon all hopes of immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and muſt put a ſtop to his career of victory. The croiſes, animated with an enthuſiaſtic ardor for the holy wars, broke at firſt thro' all regards to ſafety or intereſt in the proſecution of their purpoſe; and truſting to the immediate aſſiſtance of heaven, ſet nothing before their eyes but fame and victory in this world, and a crown of glory in the next. But long abſence from home, fatigue, diſeaſe, want, and the varieties of ſucceſs which naturally attend war, had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually abated that fury, which nothing was able directly to withſtand; and every one, except the King of England, expreſſed a deſire of ſpeedily returning into Europe. The Germans and the Italians declared their reſolution of deſiſting from the enterprize: The French were ſtill more obſtinate in this purpoſe: The duke of Burgundy, in order to pay court to Philip, took all opportunities of mortifying and oppoſing Richard<note n="†" place="bottom">Viniſauf. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>.</note>: And there appeared an abſolute neceſſity of abandoning for the preſent all hopes of farther conqueſt, and of ſecuring the acquiſitions of the Chriſtians by an accommodation with Saladin. Richard, therefore, concluded a truce with that monarch; and ſtipulated, that Acre, Joppa, and other ſeaport towns of Paleſtine, ſhould remain in the hands of the croiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This truce was concluded for three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours; a magical number, which had probably been devized by the Europeans, and which was ſuggeſted by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition well ſuited to the object of the war.</p>
            <p>THE liberty in which Saladin indulged the Chriſtians, to perform their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to Jeruſalem, was an eaſy ſacrifice on his part; and the furious wars, which he waged in defence of the barren territory of Judea, were not with him, as with the croiſes, the reſult of ſuperſtition, but of policy. The advantage indeed of ſcience, moderation, humanity, was at that time entirely on the ſide of the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens; and this gallant Emperor, in particular, diſplayed, during the courſe of the war, a ſpirit and generoſity, whcih even his bigotted enemies were obliged to acknowledge and admire. Richard, equally martial and brave, carried with him more of the barbarian character; and was guilty of acts of ferocity, which throw a ſtain on his celebrated victories. When Saladin refuſed to ratify the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of Acre, the King of England ordered all his priſoners, to the number of five thouſand, to be butchered; and the Saracens found themſelves obliged to retaliate upon the Chriſtians by a like cruelty<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 607.

But the moſt ſucceſsful of Philip's negotiations was with prince John, who, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting every tye to his brother, his ſovereign, and his benefactor, thought of nothing but how to make his own advantage of the public calamities.

Happily, Robert earl of Leiceſter appeared in that critical moment; a gallant nobleman, who had acquired great honour during the croiſade, and who being more fortunate than his maſter in finding his paſſage homewards, took on him the command in Roüen, and exerted himſelf, by his preſence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to infuſe courage into the diſmayed Normans<note n="§" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 724.

Yet are the incidents which attended theſe hoſtilities ſo frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that ſcarce any hiſtorian can entertain ſuch a paſſion for military deſcriptions as to venture on a detail of them: A certain proof of the extreme weakneſs of princes in thoſe ages, and of the little authority they poſſeſſed over their refractory vaſſals! The whole amount of the exploits on both ſides is, the taking a caſtle, the ſurpriſe of a ſtraggling party, a rencounter of horſe, which reſembles more a rout than a battle. Richard obliged Philip to raiſe the ſiege of Verneüil; he took Loches, a ſmall town in Anjou; he made himſelf maſter of Beaumont, and ſome other places of little conſequence; and after theſe trivial exploits, the two Kings began already to hold conferences for an accommodation. Philip inſiſted, that, if a general peace was concluded, the barons on each ſide ſhould be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from carrying on private wars againſt each other: But Richard replied, that this was a right claimed by his vaſſals, and he could not debar them of it<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 741.</note>. After this fruitleſs negotiation, there enſued an action between the French and Engliſh cavalry at Fretteval, in which the former were routed, and the King of France's cartulary and records, which commonly at that time attended his perſon, were taken<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

The ſame day, Richard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Marcadée, leader of his Brabançons, approached the caſtle in order to ſurvey it; when one Bertrand de Gourdon, an archer, took an aim at him, and pierced his ſhoulder with an arrow. <note place="margin">28th March.</note> The King, however, gave orders for the aſſault, took the place, and hanged all the garriſon, except Gourdon, who had wounded him, and whom he reſerved for a more deliberate and more cruel exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

No man, even in that romantic age, carried perſonal courage and intrepidity to a greater height; and this quality gained him the appellation of the lion-hearted, <hi>coeur de lion.</hi> He paſſionately loved glory, chiefly military glory; and as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the field was not inferior to his valour, he ſeems to have poſſeſſed every talent neceſſary for acquiring it. His reſentments alſo were high; his pride un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable; and his ſubjects, as well as his neighbours, had therefore reaſon to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0162900301:360"/>
apprehend, from the continuance of his reign, a perpetual ſcene of blood and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Of an impetuous and vehement ſpirit, he was diſtinguiſhed by all the good, as well as the bad qualities, which are incident to that character: He was open, frank, generous, ſincere, and brave; he was revengeful, domineering, ambitious, haughty, and cruel; and was thus better calculated to dazzle men by the ſplendor of his enterprizes, than either to promote their happineſs or his own grandeur, by a ſound and well regulated policy. As military talents make great impreſſion on the people, he ſeems to have been much beloved by his Engliſh ſubjects; and he is remarked to have been the firſt prince of the Norman line who bore a ſincere affection and regard to them. He paſſed however only four months of his reign in that kingdom: The croiſade employed him near three years; he was detained about fourteen months in captivity; the reſt of his reign was ſpent either in war, or preparations for war, againſt France; and he was ſo pleaſed with the fame which he had acquired in the Eaſt, that he ſeems to have determined, notwithſtanding all his paſt misfortunes, to have farther exhauſted his kingdom, and to have expoſed himſelf to new hazards, by conducting another expedition againſt the infidels.</p>

A King who poſſeſſed ſuch a revenue could never have endured fourteen months captivity, for not paying 150,000 marks to the Emperor, and be obliged at laſt to leave hoſtages for a third of the ſum. The prices of commodities in this reign are alſo a certain proof, that no ſuch enormous ſum could be levied from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>THE diſorders in London, derived from its bad police, had riſen to a great height during this reign; and in the year 1196, there ſeemed to be formed a regular conſpiracy of the malefactors, which threatened the city with deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There was one William Fitz-Oſbert, commonly called <hi>Longbeard,</hi> a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, who had rendered himſelf extremely popular among the lower rank of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and by defending them on all occaſions, had acquired the appellation of the advocate or ſaviour of the poor. He exerted his authority, by injuring and inſulting the more ſubſtantial inhabitants, with whom he lived in a ſtate of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and who were every moment expoſed to the moſt outrageous violences from him and his licentious emiſſaries. Murders were daily committed in the ſtreets; houſes were broke open and pillaged in day-light; and it is pretended, that no leſs than fifty-two thouſand perſons had ſigned an aſſociation, by which they bound themſelves to obey all the orders of this dangerous ruffian. Archbiſhop Hubert, who was then chief juſticiary, ſummoned him before the council to anſwer for his conduct; but he came ſo well attended, that no one durſt accuſe him, or bear evidence againſt him; and the primate, finding the impotence of laws, contented himſelf with exacting from the citizens hoſtages for their good behaviour.

But tho' this progreſs of ideas was natural, it was gradual.

would maintain his right of ſucceſſion; and Richard, on his return, to k no ſteps towards reſtoring or ſecuring the order which he had at firſt eſtabliſhed. He was even careful, by his laſt will, to declare his brother John heir to all his dominions<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 791. Trivet, p. 138.</note>; whether, that he now thought Arthur, who was only twelve years of age, incapable of aſſerting his claim againſt John's faction, or was influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by Eleanor, the Queen-mother, who hated Conſtantia, mother to the young duke, and who dreaded the influence which that princeſs would naturally acquire during the reign of her ſon. The authority of a teſtament was great in that age, even where the ſucceſſion of a kingdom was concerned; and John had reaſon to hope, that this title, joined to his plauſible right in other reſpects, would enſure him the ſucceſſion. But the idea of repreſentation ſeems to have made, at this time, greater progreſs in France than in England; and the barons of the tranſmarine provinces, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, immediately decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in favour of Arthur's ſucceſſion<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 792. M. Paris, p. 137. M. Weſt. p. 263. Knyghton, p. 2414.</note>, and applied for the aſſiſtance of the French monarch as their ſuperior lord. Philip, who deſired only an occaſion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſs John, and diſmember his dominions, embraced the cauſe of the young duke of Brittany, took him under his protection, and ſent him to Paris to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, along with his ſon Lewis<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. In this emergence, John haſtened to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his authority in the chief members of the monarchy; and after ſending Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anor into Poictou and Guienne, where her right was inconteſtible, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledged, he hurried to Roüen, and being there inveſted in the dutchy of Normandy, he paſſed over without loſs of time into England. Hubert, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, William Mareſchal, earl of Strigul, ſoon after created earl of Pembroke, and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the juſticiary, the three moſt favoured miniſters of the late King, were already engaged on his ſide<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hoveden, p. 793.

            <p>YOUNG Arthur, fond of military renown, had broke into Poictou at the head of a ſmall army; and paſſing near Mirabel, he heard, that his grandmother, Queen Eleanor, who had always oppoſed his intereſts, was lodged in that place, and was protected by a weak garriſon, and ruinous fortifications<note n="*" place="bottom">Ann.

            <p>THE King had here a conference with his nephew; repreſented to him the folly of his pretenſions; and required him to renounce the French alliance, which had encouraged him to enter into enmity againſt all his family: But the brave youth, rendered more haughty from misfortunes, maintained the juſtice of his cauſe; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his claim, not only to the French provinces, but to the crown of England; and in his turn, required the King to reſtore the ſon of his elder brother to the poſſeſſion of his inheritance<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. John, ſenſible, from theſe ſymptoms of ſpirit, that the young prince, tho' now a priſoner, might ſome time prove a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemy, determined to prevent all future peril by diſpatching his nephew; and Arthur was never more heard of. <note place="margin">Murder of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur, duke of Brittany.</note> The circumſtances which attended this deed of darkneſs, were, no doubt, carefully concealed by the actors, and are variouſly related by hiſtorians: But the moſt probable account is as follows.

This diſcovery proved fatal to the young pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE whole world was ſtruck with horror at this inhuman deed; and from that moment, the King, deteſted by his ſubjects, retained a very precarious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over both the people and the barons in his dominions. The Bretons, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this diſappointment in their fond hopes, waged implacable war againſt him; and fixing the ſucceſſion of their government, put themſelves in a poſture to revenge the murder of their ſovereign. John had got into his power his niece, Eleanor, ſiſter to Arthur, commonly called <hi>the damſel of Brittany;</hi> and carrying her over to England, detained her ever after in captivity<note n="*" place="bottom">Trivet. p. 145.

               </note> THE King of France, whoſe ambitious and active ſpirit had been hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, either by the ſound policy of Henry, or the martial genius of Richard, ſeeing now the opportunity favourable againſt this baſe and odious prince, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the project of expelling the Engliſh, or rather the Engliſh King, from France, and of annexing to the crown ſo many conſiderable fiefs, which, during ſeveral ages, had been diſmembered from it. Many of the other great vaſſals, whoſe jealouſy might have interpoſed, and have obſtructed the execution of this project, were not at preſent in a ſituation to oppoſe it; and the reſt either looked on with indifference, or gave their aſſiſtance to this dangerous aggrandizement of their ſuperior lord. The earls of Handers and Blois were engaged in the holy war: The count of Champagne was an inſant, and under the guardianſhip of Philip: The dutchy of Brittany, enraged at the murder of their prince, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly promoted all his meaſures: And the general defection of John's vaſſals made every enterprize eaſy and ſucceſsful againſt him. Philip, after taking ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſtles and fortreſſes beyond the Loire, which he either garriſoned or diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, received the ſubmiſſions of the count of Alençon, who deſerted John, and delivered up all the places under his command to the French King: Upon which, Philip ſeparated his army, in order to give them ſome repoſe after the fatigues of the campaign. John, ſuddenly collecting ſome troops, laid ſiege to Alençon; and Philip, whoſe diſperſed army could not be brought together in time to ſuccour it, ſaw himſelf expoſed to the diſgrace of ſuffering the oppreſſion of his friend and confederate. But his active and fertile genius found an expedient againſt this evil. There was held at that very time a tournament at Moret in the Gatinois; whither all the chief nobility of France and the neighbouring countries had reſorted, in order to ſignalize their courage and addreſs. Philip preſented himſelf before them; craved their aſſiſtance in his diſtreſs; and pointed out the plains of Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon as the moſt honourable field, in which they could diſplay their generoſity and martial ſpirit. Theſe valorous knights vowed, that they would take vengeance on the baſe parricide, the ſtain of arms and of chivalry; and putting themſelves, with all their retinue, under the command of Philip, inſtantly marched to raiſe the ſiege of Alençon. John, hearing of their approach, fled from before the place; and in the hurry abandoned all his tents, machines, and baggage, to the enemy.</p>
            <p>THIS feeble effort was the laſt exploit of that ſlothful and cowardly prince for the defence of his dominions. He thenceforth remained in total inactivity at Roüen; and paſſed all his time, with his young wife, in paſtimes and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if his ſtate had been in the moſt profound tranquillity, or his affairs in the moſt proſperous condition. If he ever mentioned war, it was only to give

His ſtupidity and indolence appeared ſo extraordinary, that the people endeavoured to account for the infatuation by ſorcery, and believed, that he was thrown into this lethargy by ſome magic or witchcraft. The Engliſh barons, finding that their time was waſted to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that they muſt ſuffer the diſgrace of ſeeing, without reſiſtance, the progreſs of the French arms, withdrew from their colours, and ſecretly returned to their own country<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

No one thought of defending a man, who ſeemed to have deſerted himſelf; and his ſubjects looked on his fate with the ſame indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to which, in this preſſing exigency, they ſaw him totally abandoned.</p>
            <p>JOHN, while he neglected all domeſtic reſources for his ſafety, had the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to betake himſelf to a foreign power, whoſe protection he claimed: He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Pope, Innocent III. and entreated him to interpoſe with his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between him and the French monarch. Innocent, pleaſed with any occaſion of exerting his ſuperiority, ſent Philip orders to ſtop the progreſs of his arms, and to make peace with the King of England. But the French barons received this meſſage with indignation; diſclaimed the temporal authority challenged by the pontiff; and vowed, that they would, to the uttermoſt, aſſiſt their prince againſt all his enemies: And Philip, ſeconding their ardour, proceeded, inſtead of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope's envoys, to lay ſiege to Chateau Gaillard, the moſt conſiderable fortreſs which remained to guard the frontiers of Normandy.</p>

The late King, having caſt his eye on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſituation, had ſpared no labour nor expence in fortifying it; and it was defended by Roger de Laci, conſtable of Cheſter, a determined officer, at the head of a numerous garriſon. Philip, who deſpaired of taking the place by force, propoſed to ſubdue it by famine; and that he might cut off its communication with the neighbouring country, he threw a bridge acroſs the Seine, while he himſelf with his army blockaded it by land. The earl of Pembroke, the man of greateſt vigour and capacity in the Engliſh court, formed a plan for breaking thro' the French entrenchments, and throwing relief into the place. He carried with him an army of 4000 infantry and 3000 cavalry, and ſuddenly attacked, with great ſucceſs, Philip's camp in the night time; having left orders, that a fleet of ſeventy flat-bottomed veſſels ſhould ſail up the Seine, and fall at the ſame

After this misfortune, John made no farther efforts for the relief of Chateau Gaillard; and Philip had all the leizure requiſite for conducting and finiſhing the ſiege. Roger de Laci defended himſelf for a twelvemonth with great obſtinacy; and having bravely repulſed every attack, and patiently born all the hardſhips of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, he was at laſt overpowered by a ſudden aſſault in the night-time, and made priſoner of war, with his whole garriſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Trivet, p. 144.

Philip, who knew how to reſpect valor even in an enemy, treated him with the utmoſt civility; and gave him the whole city of Paris for the place of his confinement.</p>
            <p>WHEN this balwark of Normandy was once ſubdued, all the province lay open to the inroads of Philip; and the King of England deſpaired of being any longer able to defend it. He ſecretly prepared veſſels for a ſcandalous flight; and that the Normans might no longer doubt of his reſolution to abandon them, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the fortifications of Pont de l'Arche, Moulineaux, and l' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auri to be demoliſhed. Not daring to repoſe confidence in any of his Barons, whom he believed to be univerſally engaged in a conſpiracy againſt him, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the government of the province to Archas Martin and Lupicaire, two mercenary Brabançons, whom he had retained in his ſervice. Philip, now ſecure of his prey, puſhed his conqueſts with vigor and ſucceſs againſt the diſmayed Normans. Falaiſe was firſt beſieged; and Lupicaire, who commanded in this impregnable fortreſs, after ſurrendering the place, baſely inliſted himſelf with his troops in the ſervice of Philip, and carried on hoſtilities againſt his antient maſter. Caen, Cautance, Seez, Evreux, Baïeux ſoon fell into the hands of the French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and all the lower Normandy was reduced under his dominion. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his enterprizes on the other diviſion of the province, Gui de Thouars, at the head of the Bretons, broke into the territory, and took Mount St. Michael, Avranches, and all the other fortreſſes in that neighbourhood. The Normans, who abhorred the French yoke, and who would have defended themſelves to the laſt extremity, if their prince had appeared to conduct them, found no reſource but in ſubmiſſion; and every city opened its gates, as ſoon as Philip appeared before it.

Upon the expiration of the term, as no ſupply had arrived, they opened their gates to Philip<note n="*" place="bottom">Trivet, p. 147. Ypod. Neuſt. p. 459.</note>; and the whole province ſoon after imitated their example, and ſubmitted to the victor. Thus was this important territory reunited to the crown of France, near three centuries after the ceſſion of it by Charles the Simple to Rollo, the firſt duke: And the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, ſenſible that this conqueſt was probably final, demanded the privilege of being governed by French laws; which Philip, making a few alterations on the ancient Norman cuſtoms, readily granted them. But the French monarch had too much ambition and genius to ſtop in his preſent career of ſucceſs. He carried his victorious army into the weſtern provinces; ſoon reduced Anjou, Maine, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, and part of Poictou under his dominion<note n="†" place="bottom">Trivet, p. 149.</note>; and in this manner, the French crown, during the reign of one able and active prince, received ſuch an acceſſion of power and grandeur, as, in the ordinary courſe of things, would have required it ſeveral ages to acquire.</p>
            <p>JOHN, on his arrival in England, that he might cover the diſgrace of his own conduct, exclaimed loudly againſt his barons, who, he pretended, had deſerted his ſtandard in Normandy; and he arbitrarily extorted from them a ſeventh part of all their moveables, as a puniſhment for this offence<note n="‡" place="bottom">M. Paris, 146. M. Weſt. p. 265.</note>. Soon after he forced them to grant him a ſcutage of two marks and a half on each knight's fee for an expedition into Normandy; but he did not attempt to execute the ſervice, for which he pretended to exact it. Next year, he ſummoned all the barons of his realm to attend him on this foreign expedition, and collected the ſhips from all the ſea-ports; but meeting with oppoſition from ſome of his miniſters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting him of his deſign, he diſmiſſed both fleet and army, and then renewed his exclamations againſt the barons for deſerting him. He next put to ſea with a ſmall army, and his ſubjects believed, that he was reſolved to expoſe himſelf to the utmoſt hazards for the defence and recovery of his dominions: But they were ſurprized, after a few days, to ſee him return again into harbour, without attempting any thing. In the ſubſequent ſeaſon, he had the courage to carry his hoſtile meaſures a ſtep farther. <label type="milestone">

But the approach of Philip with an army threw him into terrors; and he immediately made propoſals of peace, and fixed a place of interview with his enemy: But inſtead of keeping this engagement, he ſtole off with his army, embarked at Rochelle, and returned, loaded with new ſhame and diſgrace, into England.

               </note> THE papal chair was then filled by Innocent III. who, having attained that dignity at the age of thirty-ſeven years, and being endowed with a loſty and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing genius, gave full ſcope to his ambition, and attempted, perhaps more openly than any of his predeceſſors, to convert that ſuperiority, which was yielded him by all the European princes, into a real dominion over them. The hierarchy, protected by the Roman pontiff, had already carried to an enormous height its uſurpations upon the civil power; but in order to extend them farther, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them uſeful to the court of Rome, it was neceſſary to reduce the eccleſiaſtics themſelves under an abſolute monarchy, and to make them entirely dependant on their ſpiritual leader. For this purpoſe, Innocent firſt attempted to impoſe taxes at pleaſure upon the clergy; and in the firſt year of this century, taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the popular fr nzy for croiſades, he ſent collectors over all Europe, who levied by his authority the fortieth of all eccleſiaſtical revenues, for the relief of the holy land, and received the voluntary contributions of the laity to a like

amount<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer. vol. 1. p. 119.</note>. The ſame year Hubert, archbiſhop of Canterbury, attempted another innovation, favourable to eccleſiaſtical and papal power: In the King's abſence, he ſummoned, by his legantine authority, a ſynod of all the Engliſh clergy, contrary to the prohibition of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the chief juſticiary; and no proper cenſure was ever paſſed on this encroachment, the firſt of the kind, upon the royal power. But a favourable incident ſoon after happened, which enabled ſo aſpiring a pontiff as Innocent, to extend ſtill farther his uſurpations on ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a prince as John.</p>
            <p>HUBERT, the primate, died in 1205; and as the monks or canons of Chriſt church, Canterbury, poſſeſſed a right of voting in the election of their archbiſhop, ſome of the juniors of the order, who lay in wait for that event, met clandeſtinely the very night of Hubert's death; and without any conge d'elire from the King, choſe Reginald, their ſub-prior, for the ſucceſſor; inſtalled him in the archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal throne before midnight; and having enjoined him the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, ſent him immediately to Rome, in order to ſollicit the confirmation of his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 148. M. Weſt. p. 266.</note>. The vanity of Reginald prevailed over his policy; and he no ſooner arrived in Flanders, than he revealed to every one the purpoſe of his journey, which was immediately known in England<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The King was enraged at the novelty and temerity of the attempt, in filling ſo important an office without his knowledge or conſent: The ſuffragan biſhops of Canterbury, who were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to concur in the choice of their primate, were no leſs diſpleaſed at the excluſion given them in this election: The elder monks of Chriſt-church were injured by the irregular proceedings of their juniors: The juniors themſelves, aſhamed of their conduct, and diſguſted with the levity of Reginald, who had broke his engagement with them, were willing to ſet aſide his election<note n="‖" place="bottom">M. Weſt p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>.</note>: And all men concurred in the deſign of remedying the falſe meaſures, which had been taken. But as John knew, that this affair would be convaſſed before a ſuperior tribunal, where the interpoſition of royal authority, in beſtowing eccleſiaſtical benefices, was very invidious; where even the cauſe of ſuffragan biſhops was not ſo favourable as that of monks; he determined to make the new election entirely unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable: He ſubmitted the affair wholly to the canons of Chriſt-church; and, departing from the right, claimed by his predeceſſors, ventured no farther than to inform them privately, that they would do him an acceptable piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if they choſe John de Gray, biſhop of Norwich, for their primate<note n="§" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 149. M. Weſt. p. 266.</note>. The election of that prelate was accordingly made without a contradictory vote; and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0162900301:375"/>
the King, to obviate all conteſts, endeavoured to perſuade the ſuffragan biſhops not to inſiſt on their right of concurring in the election: But theſe prelates, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in their pretenſions, ſent an agent to maintain their cauſe before Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; while the King, and the convent of Chriſt church, diſpatched twelve monks of that order to ſupport, before the ſame tribunal, the election of the biſhop of Norwich.</p>
            <p>THUS, there lay three different claims before the Pope, whom all parties allowed to be the ſupreme arbiter of the conteſt. The claim of the ſuffragans, being ſo oppoſite to the uſual maxims of the papal court, was ſoon ſet aſide: The election of Reginald was ſo obviouſly fraudulent and irregular, that there was no poſſibility of defending it: But Innocent maintained, that, tho' this elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was null and invalid, it ought previouſly to have been declared ſuch by the ſovereign pontiff, before the monks could proceed to a new election; and that the choice of the biſhop of Norwich was of courſe as uncanonical as that of his competitor<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 155. Chron. de Mailr. p. 182.</note>. Advantage was, therefore, taken of this ſubtlety for introducing a precedent, by which the ſee of Canterbury, the moſt important dignity in the church after the papal throne, ſhould be ever after at the diſpoſal of the court of Rome.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Pope maintained ſo many fierce conteſts, in order to wreſt from princes the right of granting inveſtitures, and to exclude laymen from all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of conferring eccleſiaſtical benefices, he was ſupported by the united influence of the clergy, who, aſpiring to independance, fought, with all the ardour of ambition, and all the zeal of ſuperſtition, under his ſacred banners. But no ſooner was this point, after a great effuſion of blood and the convulſions of many ſtates, eſtabliſhed in ſome tolerable degree, than the victorious leader, as is uſual, turned his arms againſt his own community, and aſpired to center all power in his perſon. By the invention of reſerves, proviſions, commendams, and other devices, the Pope gradually aſſumed the right of filling vacant benefices; and the plenitude of his apoſtolic power, which was not ſubjected to any limitations, ſupplied all defects of title in the perſon on whom he beſtowed preferment. The canons which regulated elections were purpoſely rendered intricate and involved: Frequent diſputes aroſe among candidates: Appeals were every day carried to Rome: The apoſtolic ſee, beſides reaping pecuniary advantages from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, often exerciſed the power of ſetting aſide both the litigants, and on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of appeaſing faction, nominated a third perſon, who might be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the contending parties.</p>

THE preſent controverſy about the election to the ſee of Canterbury afforded Innocent an opportunity of claiming this right; and he failed not to perceive and avail himſelf of his advantage.

Paris, p. 155. Ann. Waverl. p. 169. W. Heming. p. 553. Knyghton, p. 2415.</note>. In vain did the monks repreſent, that they had received from their convent no authority to this purpoſe; that an election, without a previous writ from the King, would be deemed highly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and that they were merely agents for another perſon, whoſe right they had no power nor pretence to abandon. None of them had the courage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in this oppoſition, except one, Elias de Brantefield: All the reſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the menaces and authority of the Pope, complied with his orders, and made the election required of them.</p>
            <p>INNOCENT, ſenſible that this flagrant uſurpation would be highly reſented by the court of England, wrote John a mollifying letter; ſent him four golden rings ſet with precious ſtones; and endeavoured to enhance the value of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by informing him of the many myſteries which were implied in it. He begged him to conſider ſeriouſly the <hi>form</hi> of the rings, their <hi>number,</hi> their <hi>matter,</hi> and their <hi>colour.</hi> Their form, he ſaid, being round, ſhadowed out Eternity, which had neither beginning nor end; and he ought thence to learn his duty of aſpiring from earthly objects to heavenly, from things temporal to things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The number four, being a ſquare, denoted ſteadineſs of mind, not to be ſubverted either by adverſity or proſperity, fixed for ever on the firm baſis of the four cardinal virtues. Gold, which is the matter, being the moſt precious of metals, ſignified Wiſdom, which is the moſt precious of all accompliſhments, and juſtly preferred by Solomon to riches, power, and all exterior attainments. The blue colour of the emerald repreſented Faith; the verdure of the ſaphire, Hope; the redneſs of the ruby, Charity; and the ſplendor of the topaz, Good Works<note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. 1. p. 159. M. Paris, p. 155.</note>. By theſe conceits, Innocent endeavoured to repay John for one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant prerogatives of his crown, which he had raviſhed from him; conceits probably admired by Innocent himſelf. For it is eaſily poſſible for a man, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a barbarous age, to unite ſtrong talents for buſineſs with an abſurd taſte in ſcience and the arts.</p>
            <p>JOHN was enflamed with the utmoſt rage, when he heard of this attempt of the court of Rome<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. i. p. 143.</note>; and he immediately vented his paſſion on the monks of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0162900301:377"/>
Chriſt church, whom he found inclined to ſupport the election made by their brethren at Rome. He ſent Fulk de Cantelupe, and Henry de Cornhulle, two knights of his train, men of violent tempers and rude manners, to expel them the convent, and take poſſeſſion of their revenues. Theſe knights entered the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery with drawn ſwords, commanded the prior and the monks to depart the kingdom, and menaced them, that, in caſe of diſobedience, they would inſtantly burn them with the convent<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 156. Trivet, p. 151. Ann. Waverl. p. 169.</note>. Innocent, prognoſticating, from the violence and imprudence of theſe meaſures, that John would finally ſink in the conteſt, perſevered the more vigorouſly in his pretenſions, and exhorted the King not to oppoſe God and the church any longer, nor to perſecute that cauſe for which the holy martyr, St. Thomas, had ſacrificed his life, and which had exalted him equal to the higheſt ſaints in heaven<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris. p. 157.</note>: A ſufficient hint to John to profit by the example of his father, and to remember the prejudices and eſtabliſhed principles of his ſubjects, who bore a profound veneration to that martyr, and regarded his merits as the ſubject of their chief glory and exultation.</p>
            <p>THE pontiff, finding that John was not yet ſufficiently tamed to ſubmiſſion, ſent three prelates, the biſhops of London, Ely, and Worceſter, to intimate to him, that, if he perſevered in his diſobedience, Innocent would be obliged to put the kingdom under the ſentence of interdict<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. All the other prelates threw themſelves on their knees before him, and entreated him, with tears in their eyes, to prevent the ſcandal of this ſentence, by making a ſpeedy ſubmiſſion to his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Father, by receiving from his hands the new elected primate, and by reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the monks of Chriſt church to all their rights and poſſeſſions. He burſt out into the moſt indecent invectives againſt the prelates; ſwore by God's teeth, his uſual oath, that if the Pope preſumed to put his kingdom under an interdict, he would ſend to him all the biſhops and clergy of England, and would confiſcate all their eſtates; and threatened, that, if thenceforth he caught any Romans in his dominions, he would put out their eyes, and cut off their noſes, in order to ſet a mark upon them, which might diſtinguiſh them from all other nations<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Amidſt all this idle violence, John ſtood on ſuch bad terms with his nobility, that he never dared to aſſemble the ſtates of the kingdom, who, in ſo juſt a cauſe, would probably have adhered to any other monarch, and have defended with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour the liberties of the nation againſt theſe palpable uſurpations of the court of Rome. Innocent, therefore, perceiving the King's weakneſs, iſſued at laſt the ſentence of interdict, which he had for ſome time held ſuſpended over him<note n="§" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 157.

               </note> THE ſentence of interdict was at that time the great inſtrument of vengeance and policy employed by the court of Rome; was pronounced againſt ſovereigns for the lighteſt offences; and made the guilt of one perſon involve the ruin of millions, even in their ſpiritual and eternal welfare. The execution of it was artificially calculated to ſtrike the ſenſes in the higheſt degree, and to operate with irreſiſtible force on the ſuperſtitious minds of the people. The nation was of a ſudden deprived of all exterior exerciſe of its religion: The altars were deſpoiled of their ornaments: The croſſes, the reliques, the images, the ſtatues of the ſaints were laid on the ground; and as if the air itſelf were profaned, and might pollute them by its contact, the prieſts carefully covered them up, even from their own approach and veneration. The uſe of bells entirely ceaſed in all the churches: The bells themſelves were removed from the ſteeples, and laid on the ground with the other ſacred utenſils. Maſs was celebrated with ſhut doors; and none but the prieſts were admitted to that holy inſtitution. The laity partook of no religious rite, except baptiſm to new-born infants, and the communion to the dying: The dead were not interred in conſecrated ground: They were thrown into ditches, or buried in common fields; and their obſequies were not attended with prayers or any hallowed ceremony. Marriage was celebrated in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron. Dunſt. vol. i. p. 51.</note>; and that every action in life might bear the marks of this dreadful ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the people were prohibited the uſe of meat, as in Lent, or times of the higheſt penance; were debarred from all pleaſures and entertainments; and were forbid even to ſalute each other, or ſo much as to ſhave their beards, and give any decent attention to their perſon and apparel. Every circumſtance carried the ſymptoms of the deepeſt diſtreſs, and of the moſt immediate apprehenſions of divine vengeance and indignation.</p>
            <p>THE King, that he might oppoſe <hi>his</hi> temporal to <hi>their</hi> ſpiritual terrors, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, from his own authority, confiſcated the eſtates of all the clergy who obeyed the interdict<note n="†" place="bottom">Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</note>; baniſhed the prelates, confined the monks to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and gave them only ſuch a ſmall allowance from their own eſtates, as would ſuffice to provide them in food and rayment. He treated with the utmoſt rigour all Langton's adherents, and every one that ſhowed any diſpoſition to obey the orders of Rome: And that he might diſtreſs the clergy in the tendereſt point, and at the ſame time expoſe them to reproach and ridicule, he threw into priſon all their concubines, and required high fines and confiſcations as the price of their liberty<note n="‡" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 158. Ann. Waverl. p. 170.</note>.</p>
            <p>AFTER the canons, which eſtabliſhed the celibacy of the clergy, were, by the zealous endeavours of archbiſhop Anſelm, more rigorouſly executed in England,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0162900301:379"/>
the eccleſiaſtics gave, almoſt univerſally and avowedly, into the uſe of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binage; and the court of Rome, which had no intereſt in prohibiting this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, made a very ſlight oppoſition to it. The cuſtom was become ſo prevalent, that ſome German ſynods, before the reformation, not only permitted, but, to avoid ſcandal, enjoined the uſe of concubines to the younger clergy<note n="*" place="bottom">Padre Paolo, Hiſt. Conc. Trid. lib. 1.</note>; and it was uſual every where for prieſts to apply to their ordinary, and obtain from him a formal liberty for this indulgence. The biſhop commonly took care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this practice from degenerating into licentiouſneſs: He confined the prieſt to the uſe of one woman, required him to be conſtant to her bed, obliged him to provide for her ſubſiſtance and that of her children; and, tho' the offspring was, in the eye of the law, deemed illegitimate, this commerce was really a kind of inferior marriage, ſuch as is ſtill practiſed in Germany among the nobles; and may be regarded by the candid as an appeal, from the tyranny of civil and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical inſtitutions, to the more virtuous and more unerring laws of nature.</p>
            <p>THE quarrel between the King and the ſee of Rome continued for ſome years; and tho' many of the clergy, from the fear of puniſhment, obeyed the orders of John, and celebrated divine ſervice, they complied with the utmoſt reluctance, and were regarded, both by themſelves and the people, as men who betrayed their principles, and ſacrificed their conſcience to temporal regards and intereſts. During this violent ſituation, the King, in order to give a luſtre to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, attempted military expeditions, againſt Scotland, againſt Ireland, againſt the Welſh<note n="†" place="bottom">W. Heming. p. 556. Ypod Neuſt. p. 460. Knyghton, p. 2420.</note>; and he commonly prevailed, more from the weakneſs of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than from his own vigour or abilities. Mean while, the danger to which his government ſtood continually expoſed from the diſcontents of the eccleſiaſtics, increaſed his natural propenſion to tyranny; and he ſeems even wantonly to have diſguſted all orders of men, eſpecially his nobles, from whom alone he could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect ſupport and aſſiſtance. He diſhonoured their families by his licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious amours; he publiſhed edicts, prohibiting them from hunting feathered game, and thereby reſtrained them from their favourite occupation and amuſement<note n="‡" place="bottom">M. Weſtm. p. 268.</note>; he ordered all the hedges and fences near his foreſts to be levelled, that his deer might have more ready acceſs into the fields for paſture; and he continually loaded the nation with arbitrary taxes and impoſitions. <label type="milestone">

He was witneſs of the other ſcenes, which, at that very time, were acting in Europe, and which diſplayed the unbounded and uncontrouled power of the papacy. Innocent, far from being diſmayed at his conteſts with the King of England, had excommunicated the Emperor Otho, John's nephew<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 160. Trivet, p. 154. M. Weſt. p. 269.</note>; and ſoon brought that powerful and haughty prince to ſubmit to his authority. He publiſhed a croiſade againſt the Albigenſes, a ſpecies of enthuſiaſts in the ſouth of France, whom he denominated heretics, becauſe, like other enthuſiaſts, they neglected the rites of the church, and oppoſed the power and influence of the clergy: The people from all parts of Europe, moved by their ſuperſtition and their paſſion for wars and adventures, flocked to his ſtandard: Simon de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the general of the croiſade, acquired to himſelf a ſovereignty in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: The count de Tholouſe, who protected the Albigenſes, was deſpoiled of his dominions: And theſe ſectaries themſelves, tho' the moſt innocent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive of mankind, were exterminated with all the circumſtances of the moſt extreme violence and barbarity. Here was therefore both an army and a general, dangerous from their zeal and valour, ready to act againſt John; and Innocent, after keeping the thunder long ſuſpended, gave at laſt authority to the biſhops of London, Ely, and Worceſter, to denounce the ſentence of excommunication againſt him<note n="‡" place="bottom">M Paris, p. 159.

But Langton, perceiving his advantage, was not ſatisfied with theſe conceſſions: He demanded, that full reſtitution and reparation ſhould be made to all the clergy; a condition ſo exorbitant, that the King, who probably had not the power of fulfilling it, and who foreſaw that this eſtimation of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages might amount to an infinite ſum, finally broke off the conference<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ann.

But as a ſentence of this kind required an armed force to execute it, the pontiff, caſting his eyes around, pitched at laſt on Philip, King of France, as the perſon, into whoſe powerful hand he could moſt properly entruſt that weapon, the ultimate reſource of his ghoſtly authority.

He levied a great army; ſummoned all the vaſſals of his crown to attend him at Roüen; collected a fleet of 1700 veſſels, great and ſmall, in the ſea-ports of Normandy and Picardy; and partly from the zeal of the age, partly from the perſonal regard, univerſally paid him, prepared a force, which ſeemed equal to the greatneſs of his enterprize. The King, on the other hand, iſſued out writs, requiring the attendance of all his military vaſſals at Dover, and even of all able-bodied men, to defend the kingdom in this dangerous extremity. An infinite number appeared; of whom he ſelected an army of 60,000 men; a power invincible, had they been united in affections to their prince, and animated with a becoming zeal for the defence of their native country<note n="‡" place="bottom">M.

But the people were ſwayed by ſuperſtition, and regarded their King with horror, as anathematized by papal cenſures: The barons, beſides lying under the ſame prejudices, were all diſguſted with his tyranny, and were, many of them, ſuſpected of holding a ſecret correſpondence with the enemy: And the incapacity and cowardice of the king himſelf, ill fitted to ſtruggle with thoſe mighty difficulties, made men prognoſticate the moſt fatal effects from the French invaſion.</p>

PANDOLF, whom the Pope had choſen for his legate, and appointed to head this important expedition, had, before he left Rome, applied for a ſecret conference with his maſter, and had aſked him, whether, if the King of England, in this deſperate ſituation, were willing to ſubmit to the apoſtolic ſee, he ſhould grant him any terms of accommodation<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

Innocent, who expected more advantages from his agreement with a prince ſo abject both in character and fortune, than from his alliance with a great and victorious monarch, who, after ſuch mighty acquiſitions, might become too haughty to be bound by ſpiritual chains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to Pandolf the conditions on which he was willing to be reconciled to the King of England. The legate, therefore, as ſoon as he arrived in the north of France, ſent over two knights templars to deſire an interview with John at Dover, which was readily granted; and he there repreſented to him, in ſuch ſtrong, and probably in ſuch true colours, his loſt condition, the diſaffection of his ſubjects, the ſecret combination of his vaſſals againſt him, the mighty armament of France, that John yielded at diſcretion<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

            <p>BUT the ignominy of the King was not yet carried to its full height. Pandolf, as the firſt ſpecimen of his deference to the Pope's orders, required him to reſign his kingdom to the church, and he perſuaded him, that he could no way ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſappoint the French invaſion, as by thus putting himſelf under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate protection of the apoſtolic ſec. John, lying under the agonies of preſent terror, made no ſcruple of ſubmitting to this condition. He paſſed a charter, in which he ſaid, that, not conſtrained by fear, but of his own free-will, and by the common advice and conſent of his barons, he had, for the remiſſion of his own ſins and that of his family, reſigned England and Ireland to God, to St. Peter and St. Paul, and to Pope Innocent and his ſucceſſors in the apoſtolic chair: He agreed to hold theſe dominions as feudatory of the church of Rome, by the

annual payment of a thouſand marks; ſeven hundred for England, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for Ireland: And he ſtipulated, that if he or his ſucceſſors ſhould ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to revoke or infringe this charter, they ſhould inſtantly, except upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition they repented them of their offence, forfeit all right to their dominions<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. i. p. 176.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">15th May.</note> IN conſequence of this agreement, John did homage to Pandolf as the Pope's legate. with all the humiliating rites which the feudal law required of vaſſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their liege-lord and ſuperior. He came diſarmed into the legate's preſence, who was ſeated on a throne; he flung himſelf on his knees before him; he liſted up his joined hands, and put them within thoſe of Pandolf; he ſwore fealty to the Pope; and he paid part of the tribute, which he owed for his kingdom as the patrimony of St. Peter. The legate, elated by this ſupreme triumph of ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal power, could not forbear diſcovering extravagant ſymptoms of joy and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: He trampled on the money, which was laid at his feet as an earneſt of the ſubjection of the kingdom: An inſolence, which however offenſive to all the Engliſh, no one preſent, except the archbiſhop of Dublin, dared to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. But tho' Pandolf had brought the King to ſubmit to theſe baſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he ſtill refuſed to take off the excommunication and interdict, till an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould be taken of the loſſes of the eccleſiaſtics, and full compenſation and reſtitution ſhould be made them.</p>
            <p>JOHN, reduced to this abject ſituation under a foreign power, ſtill ſhowed the ſame diſpoſition to tyranny over his ſubjects, which had been the chief cauſe of all his misfortunes. One Peter of Pomfret, a hermit, had foretold, that the King, this very year, ſhould loſe his crown; and for that raſh prophecy, he had been thrown into priſon in Corfe-caſtle. John now determined to bring him to puniſhment as an impoſtor; and tho' the man pleaded, that his prophecy was fulfilled, and that the King had loſt the royal and independant crown which he formerly were, the defence was ſuppoſed to augment his guilt: He was dragged at horſes tails to the town of Warham, and there hanged on a gibbet with his ſon<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

            <p>WHEN Pandolf, after receiving the homage of John, returned to the court of France, he congratulated Philip on the ſucceſs of his pious enterprize; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that John, moved by the terror of the French arms, had now come to a juſt ſenſe of his guilt; had returned to obedience under the apoſtolic ſee; had even conſented to do homage to the Pope for his dominions; and having
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0162900301:385"/>
thus made his kingdom a part of St. Peter's patrimony, had rendered it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Chriſtian prince, without the moſt manifeſt and moſt flagrant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, to attack him<note n="*" place="bottom">Trivet, p. 160.</note>. Philip was in a rage on receiving this intelligence: He exclaimed, that having, at the Pope's inſtigation, undertaken an expedition, which had coſt him above 60,000 pounds Sterling, he was fruſtrated of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, at the time when its ſucceſs was become infallible: He complained, that all the expence had fallen upon him; all the advantage had accrued to Innocent. He threatened to be no longer the dupe of theſe hypocritical pretences: And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his vaſſals, he laid before them the ill treatment which he had received, expoſed the intereſted and fraudulent conduct of the Pope, and required their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to execute his enterprize againſt England, in which, he told them, that, notwithſtanding the inhibitions and menaces of the legate, he was determined to perſevere. The French barons were in that age little leſs ignorant and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than the Engliſh: Yet, ſo much does the influence of theſe religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples depend on the preſent diſpoſition of mens minds! they all vowed to follow their prince on his intended expedition, and were reſolute not to be diſappointed of that glory and thoſe riches, which they had long expected from this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. The earl of Flanders alone, who had previouſly formed a ſecret treaty with John, declaring againſt the injuſtice and impiety of the undertaking, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with his forces<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 166.</note>; and Philip, that he might not leave ſo dangerous an enemy behind him, firſt turned his arms againſt the dominions of that prince. Mean while, the Engliſh fleet was aſſembled under the earl of Saliſbury, the King's natural brother; and tho' inferior in number, received orders to attack the French in their harbours. Saliſbury performed this ſervice with ſo much ſucceſs, that he took three hundred ſhips; deſtroyed a hundred more<note n="‡" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 166. Chron. Dunſt. vol. i. p. 59. Trivet, p. 157.</note>: And Philip, finding it impoſſible to prevent the reſt from falling into the hands of the enemy, ſet fire to them himſelf, and thereby rendered it impoſſible for him to proceed any farther in his enterprize.</p>
            <p>JOHN, exulting in his preſent ſecurity, inſenſible to his paſt diſgrace, was ſo elated with this ſucceſs, that he thought of no leſs than of invading France in his turn, and of recovering all thoſe provinces which the proſperous arms of Philip had formerly raviſhed from him. He propoſed this expedition to the barons, who were already aſſembled for the defence of the kingdom. But the Engliſh barons both hated and deſpiſed their prince: They prognoſticated no ſucceſs to any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize conducted by ſuch a leader: And pretending, that their time of ſervice was elapſed, and all their proviſions exhauſted, they refuſed to ſecond his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking<note n="*" place="bottom">M.

The King, however, reſolute in his purpoſe, embarked with a few followers, and ſailed to Jerſey, in the fooliſh notion, that the barons would at laſt be aſhamed to ſtay behind<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. But finding himſelf diſappointed, he returned to England; and raiſing ſome troops, threatened to take vengeance on all his nobles for their deſertion and diſobedience. The archbiſhop of Canterbury, who was in a confederacy with the nobles, here interpoſed; ſtrictly inhibited the King from thinking of ſuch an attempt; and threatened him with a renewal of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication, if he pretended to levy war upon any of his ſubjects, before the kingdom was freed from the ſentence of interdict<note n="‡" place="bottom">M.

            <p>THE church had diſſolved the ſeveral anathemas pronounced againſt John, by the ſame gradual progreſs with which ſhe had at firſt iſſued them. By receiving his homage, and admitting him to the rank of vaſſal, his depoſition was annulled, and his ſubjects were again bound by their oaths of allegiance. The exiled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates then returned in great triumph, with Langton at their head; and the King, hearing of their approach, went forth to meet them, and throwing himſelf on the ground before them, he entreated them with tears to have compaſſion on him and the kingdom of England<note n="‖" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 166. Ann. Waverl. p. 178.</note>. <note place="margin">20th July.</note> The primate, ſeeing theſe marks of ſincere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, led him to the chapter-houſe of Wincheſter, and there adminiſtered an oath to him, by which he again ſwore fealty and obedience to Pope Innocent and his ſucceſſors; promiſed to love, maintain, and defend holy church and the clergy; engaged, that he would re-eſtabliſh the good laws of his anceſtors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe of St. Edward, and would aboliſh the wicked ones; and expreſſed his reſolution of maintaining juſtice and right in all his dominions<note n="§" place="bottom">M.

The ſentence, however, of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was ſtill upheld againſt the kingdom. A new legate, Nicholas, biſhop of Freſcati, came into England, in the place of Pandolf; and he declared it to be the Pope's intentions never to looſen that ſentence, till full reſtitution was made to the clergy of every thing taken from them, and ample reparation for all da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which they had ſuſtained<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Trivet, p. 160.

Certain barons were appointed to take an account of the claims<note n="*" place="bottom">Brady's Append.

The clergy rejected the offer with diſdain; but the Pope, willing to favour his new vaſſal, whom he found zealous in his declarations of fealty, and regular in paying the ſtipulated tribute to Rome, directed his legate to accept of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

The neceſſity alſo of devolving great power into the hands of a prince, who was to maintain a military dominion over a vanquiſhed nation, had engaged the Norman barons to ſubmit to a more rigorous and abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than that to which men of their rank, in other feudal governments, were

commonly ſubjected. The prerogatives of the crown, once raiſed to a high pitch, were not eaſily reduced; and the nation, during the courſe of an hundred and fifty years, had groaned under a tyranny, unknown to all the kingdoms founded by the northern conquerors. Henry I. that he might allure the people to give an excluſion to his elder brother Robert, had granted them a charter, favourable in many particulars to their liberties; Stephen had renewed this grant; Henry II. had confirmed it: But the conceſſions of all theſe princes had ſtill remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect; and the ſame unlimited, at leaſt irregular authority, continued to be exerciſed both by them and their ſucceſſors. The only happineſs was, that arms were never yet raviſhed from the hands of the barons and people: The nation, by a great confederacy, might ſtill vindicate its liberties: And nothing was more likely, than the character, conduct, and fortunes of the preſent ſovereign, to produce ſuch a general union and combination againſt him Equally odious and contemptible, both in public and private life, he affronted the barons by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, diſhonoured their families by his gallantries, enraged them by his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and gave diſcontent to all ranks of men by his endleſs exactions and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="*" place="bottom">Chron.

The effect of theſe lawleſs practices had already appeared in the general demand made by the barons of a reſtoration of their privileges; and after he had reconciled himſelf to the Pope, by abandoning the independance of the kingdom, he appeared to all the world in ſo mean a light, that they univerſally thought they might with ſafety and honour inſiſt upon their pretenſions.</p>
            <p>BUT nothing forwarded this confederacy ſo much as the concurrence of Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, archbiſhop of Canterbury; a man, whoſe memory, tho' he was obtruded on the nation by a palpable incroachment of the ſee of Rome, ought always to be reſpected by the Engliſh. This prelate, whether he was moved by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of his nature and his affection to public good; or had entertained an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt John, on account of the long oppoſition made by that prince to his e ection; or thought, that an acquiſition of liberty to the people would ſerve to increaſe and ſecure the privileges of the church; had formed the plan of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the government, and had prepared the way for that great innovation, by inſerting thoſe ſingular clauſes above mentioned in the oath, which he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to the King, before he would abſolve him from the ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Soon after, in a private meeting of ſome principal barons at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he ſhowed them a copy of Henry I.'s charter, which, he ſaid, he had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found in a monaſtery; and he exhorted them to inſiſt on the renewal and obſervance of it: The barons ſwore, that they would ſooner loſe their lives than

He again produced to the aſſembly the old charter of Henry; renewed his exhortations of unanimity and vigour in the proſecution of their purpoſe; and repreſented in the ſtrongeſt colours the tyranny to which they had ſo long been ſubjected, and from which it now behoved them to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterity<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

            <p>INNOCENT beheld with regret the diſturbances which had ariſen in England, and was much inclined to favour John in his pretenſions. He had no other hopes of retaining and extending his newly acquired ſuperiority over that kingdom, but by ſupporting ſo baſe and degenerate a prince, who was willing to ſacrifice every conſideration to his preſent ſafety; and he foreſaw, that, if the adminiſtration fell into the hands of theſe gallant and high-ſpirited barons, they would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the honour, liberty, and independance of the nation, with the ſame ardour which they now exerted in defence of their own. He wrote letters therefore to the prelates, to the nobility, and to the King himſelf. He exhorted the firſt to employ their good offices in conciliating peace between the contending parties, and putting an end to civil diſcord: To the ſecond, he expreſſed his diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their conduct in employing force to extort conceſſions from their reluctant ſovereign: The laſt, he adviſed to treat his nobles with grace and indulgence, and to grant them ſuch of their demands as ſhould appear juſt and reaſonable<note n="§" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. i. p. 196, 197.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE barons eaſily ſaw, from the tenor of theſe letters, that they muſt lay their account with having the Pope, as well as the King, for their adverſary; but they had already advanced too far to recede from their pretenſions, and their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ſo deeply engaged, that it exceeded even the power of ſuperſtition itſelf any longer to controul them. They alſo foreſaw, that the thunders of Rome, when not ſeconded by the efforts of the Engliſh eccleſiaſtics, would be of ſmall avail againſt them; and they perceived, that the moſt conſiderable of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, as well as all the inferior clergy, profeſſed the higheſt approbation of their cauſe.

very powerful cauſes to looſen their devoted attachment to the apoſtolic ſee. It appeared from all the late uſurpations of the Roman pontiff, that he pretended to reap alone all the advantages accruing from that victory, which, under his banners, tho' at their own hazard, they had every where obtained over the civil magiſtrate. The Pope aſſumed a deſpotic power over all the churches: Their particular cuſtoms, privileges, and immunities, were treated with diſdain: Even the canons of general councils were ſet aſide by his diſpenſing power: The whole adminiſtration of the church was centered in the court of Rome: All preferments ran of courſe in the ſame channel: And the provincial clergy ſaw, at leaſt felt, that there was a neceſſity of limiting theſe exorbitant pretenſions. The legate, Nicholas, in filling thoſe numerous vacancies which had fallen in England dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an interdict of ſix years, had proceeded in the moſt arbitrary manner; and had paid no regard, in conferring dignities, to perſonal merit, to rank, to the inclination of the electors, or to the cuſtoms of the country. The Engliſh church was univerſally diſguſted; and Langton himſelf, tho' he owed his eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an incroachment of the Romiſh ſee, was no ſooner eſtabliſhed in his high office, than he became jealous of the privileges annexed to it, and formed attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the country ſubjected to his juriſdiction.

               <note place="margin">Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. 15th June.</note> A CONFERENCE between the King and the barons was appointed at Runnemede, between Windſor and Staines; a place which has ever ſince been extremely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, on account of this great event. The two parties encamped apart, like open enemies; and after a debate of a few days, the King, with a facility which was ſomewhat ſuſpicious, ſigned and ſealed the charter which was required of him. <note place="margin">19th June.</note> This famous deed, commonly called the GREAT CHARTER, either grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſecured very important liberties and privileges to every order of men in the kingdom, to the clergy, to the barons, and to the people.</p>
            <p>THE freedom of elections was ſecured to the clergy: The former charter of the King was confirmed, by which the neceſſity of a royal congé d'elire and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was ſuperſeded: All check upon appeals to Rome was removed, by the allowance granted every man to depart the kingdom at pleaſure: And the fines upon the clergy, for any offence, were ordained to be proportional to their lay eſtates, not to their eccleſiaſtical benefices.</p>
            <p>THE privileges granted to the barons were either abatements in the rigors of the feudal law, or determinations in points which had been left by that law, or
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0162900301:393"/>
had become by practice, arbitrary and ambiguous. The reliefs of heirs ſucceeding to a military fee were aſcertained; an earl's at an hundred pounds, a baron's at an hundred marks, a knight's at an hundred ſhillings. It was ordained by the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that, if the heir be a minor, he ſhall, immediately upon his majority, enter upon his eſtate, without paying any relief: The King ſhall not ſell his wardſhip: He ſhall levy only reaſonable profits upon the eſtate, without committing waſte or hurting the property: He ſhall uphold the caſtles, houſes, mills, parks and ponds: And if he commit the guardianſhip of the eſtate to the ſheriff or any other, he ſhall previouſly oblige them to find ſurety to the ſame purpoſe. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minority of a baron, while his lands are in wardſhip, and are not in his own poſſeſſion, no debt which he owes to the Jews ſhall bear any intereſt. Heirs ſhall be married without diſparagement; and before the marriage be contracted, the neareſt relations of the perſons ſhall be informed of it. A widow, without paying any relief, ſhall enter upon her dower, the third part of her huſband's rents: She ſhall not be compelled to marry, ſo long as ſhe chuſes to continue ſingle; ſhe ſhall only give ſecurity never to marry without her lord's conſent. The King ſhall not claim the wardſhip of any minor, who holds lands by mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tenure of a baron, on pretence that he alſo holds lands of the crown, by ſoccage or any other tenure. Scutages ſhall be eſtimated at the ſame rate as in the time of Henry I.; and no ſcutage or aid, except in the three general feudal caſes, the King's captivity, the knighting his eldeſt ſon, and the marrying his eldeſt daughter, ſhall be impoſed but by the great council of the kingdom; the prelates, earls and great barons, ſhall be called to this great council, each by a particular writ; the leſſer barons by a general ſummons of the ſheriff. The King ſhall not ſeize any baron's land for a debt to the crown, if the baron poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes as many goods and chattels as are ſufficient to diſcharge that debt. No man ſhall be obliged to perform more ſervice for his fee than he is bound to by his tenure. No governor or conſtable of a caſtle ſhall oblige any knight to give money for caſtle-guard, if he is willing to perform the ſervice in perſon, or by another able-bodied man; and if the knight be in the field himſelf, by the King's command, he ſhall be exempt from all other ſervice of this nature. No vaſſal ſhall be allowed to ſell ſo much of his land as to incapacitate himſelf from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his ſervice to his lord.</p>
            <p>THESE were the principal articles, which were calculated for the intereſts of the barons; and had the charter contained nothing farther, national happineſs and liberty had been very little promoted by it, as it would only have tended to increaſe the power and independance of an order of men, who were already too powerful, and whoſe yoke might have become more heavy on the people
<pb facs="tcp:0162900301:394"/>
than even that of an abſolute monarch. But the barons, who alone drew and impoſed on the prince th s memorable charter, were neceſſitated to inſert in it other clauſes of a more extenſive and more beneficent nature: They could not expect the concurrence of the people, without comprehending, together with their own, the intereſts of inferior ranks of men; and all proviſions, which the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, for their own ſakes, were obliged to make, in order to enſure the free and equitable adminiſtration of juſtice, tended directly to the benefit of the whole community. The following were the principal clauſes of this nature.</p>
            <p>IT was ordained, that all the privileges and immunities above mentioned, granted to the barons againſt the King, ſhould be extended by the barons to their inferior vaſſals. The King bound himſelf not to grant any writ, empowering a baron to levy aids from his vaſſals, except in the three feudal caſes. One weight and one meaſure ſhall be obſerved throughout the whole kingdom. Merchants ſhall be allowed to tranſact all buſineſs, without being expoſed to any arbitrary tolls and impoſitions: They and all free men ſhall be allowed to go out of the kingdom and return to it at pleaſure. London, and all cities and burghs, ſhall preſerve their antient liberties, immunities and free cuſtoms: Aids ſhall not be required of them but by the conſent of the great council. No towns nor indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals ſhall be obliged to make or ſupport bridges but by antient cuſtom. The goods of every free man ſhall be diſpoſed of according to his will: If he die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate, his heirs ſhall ſucceed to them. No officer of the crown ſhall take any horſes, carts, or wood, without the conſent of the owner. The King's courts of juſtice ſhall be ſtationary, and ſhall no longer follow his perſon: They ſhall be open to every one; and juſtice ſhall no longer be bought, refuſed, or delayed by them. The ſheriffs ſhall be incapacitated to hold pleas of the crown; and ſhall not put any perſon upon his trial, from rumor or ſuſpicion alone, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evidence of lawful witneſſes. No freeman ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or diſpoſſeſſed of his free tenement and liberties, or outlawed, or baniſhed, or any wiſe hurt or injured, unleſs by the legal judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land; and all who ſuffered otherwiſe in this or the two former reigns, ſhall be reſtored to their rights and poſſeſſions. Every freeman ſhall be fined in proportion to his fault; and no fine ſhall be levied on him to his utter ruin: Even a villain or ruſtic ſhall not by any fine be bereaved of his carts, ploughs, and implements of huſbandry. This was the only article calculated for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of this body of men, probably at that time the moſt numerous in the kingdom.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that the former articles of the Great Charter contain ſuch mitigations and explanations of the feudal law as are very reaſonable and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0162900301:395"/>
and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a legal government, and provide for the equal diſtribution of juſtice, and free enjoyment of property; the great objects for which political ſociety was at firſt founded by men, which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall, and which no time, nor precedent, nor ſtatute, nor poſitive inſtitution, ought to deter them from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever uppermoſt in their thoughts and attention. Tho' the proviſions made by this charter might, conformable to the genius of the age, be eſteemed too conciſe, and too bare of circumſtances, to maintain the execution of its articles, in oppoſition to the chicanery of lawyers, ſupported by the violence of power; time gradually aſcertained the ſenſe of all the ambiguous expreſſions, and thoſe generous barons, who firſt extorted this conceſſion, ſtill held their ſwords in their hands, and could turn them againſt thoſe who dared, on any pretence, to depart from the original ſpirit and meaning of the grant. It is now eaſy, from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this charter, to determine what thoſe laws were of King Edward, which the Engliſh nation, during ſo many generations, ſtill deſired, with ſuch an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſeverance, to have recalled and eſtabliſhed. They were theſe latter arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and the barons, who, at the beginning of theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, required the revival of the Saxon laws, undoubtedly thought, that they had ſufficiently ſatisfied the people by procuring them this conceſſion, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the chief objects to which they had ſo long aſpired. But what we are moſt to admire, is the prudence and moderation of theſe haughty nobles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who were enraged by injuries, enflamed by oppoſition, and elated by a total victory over their ſovereign. They were contented, even in this plenitude of power, to depart from ſome articles of Henry I.'s charter, which they made the foundation of their demands, particularly from the abolition of wardſhips, ſo important a point; and they ſeem to have been ſufficiently careful not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh too far the power and revenue of the crown. If they appear, therefore, to have carried other demands to too great a height, it can be aſcribed only to the faithleſs and tyrannical character of the King himſelf, of which they had long had experience, and which, they foreſaw, would, if they provided no farther ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, lead him ſoon to infringe their liberties, and recall his own conceſſions. This alone gave birth to thoſe other articles, ſeemingly exorbitant, which were added as a rampart for the ſafeguard of the Great Charter.</p>
            <p>THE barons obliged the King to agree, that London ſhould remain in their hands, and the Tower be conſigned to the cuſtody of the primate, till the 15th of Auguſt next, or till the execution of the ſeveral articles of the great charter<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. i. p. 201.

The better to inſure the ſame end, he allowed them to chooſe five and twenty members from their own body, as conſervators of the public liberties; and no bounds were ſet to the authority of theſe men either in extent or duration. If any complaint was made of a violation of the charter, whether by the King, juſticiaries, ſheriffs, or foreſters, any four of theſe barons m ght admoniſh the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the grievance; and if ſatisfaction was not obtained, they could aſſemble the whole council of twenty-five; who, in conjunction with the great council, were empowered to compel him to obſerve the charter, and, in caſe of reſiſtance, might levy war againſt him, attack his caſtles, and employ every kind of violence, except againſt his royal perſon, and that of his Queen and children. All men, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdom, were bound, under the penalty of confiſcation, to ſwear obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the five and twenty barons; and the freeholders of each county were to chooſe twelve knights, who were to make report of ſuch evil cuſtoms as required redreſs, conformable to the tenor of the Great Charter<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſeems a certain proof that the houſe of commons was not then in being: otherwiſe the knights and burgeſſes f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>INNOCENT, conſidering himſelf as feudal lord of the kingdom, was incenſed at the temerity of the barons, who, tho' they pretended to appeal to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had dared, without waiting for his conſent, to impoſe ſuch terms on a prince, who, by reſigning to the Roman pontiff, his crown and independance, had placed himſelf immediately under the papal protection.

He prohibited the barons to exact the obſervance of it: He even prohibited the King himſelf to pay any regard to it: He abſolved him and his ſubjects from all oaths, which they had been conſtrained to take to that purpoſe: And he denounced a general ſentence of excommunication againſt every one, who ſhould perſevere in maintaining ſuch treaſonable and iniquitous pretenſions<note n="§" place="bottom">Rymer, vol. i. p. 203, 204, 205, 208.

The King was from the firſt maſter of the field; and immediately laid ſiege to the caſtle of Rocheſter, which was obſtinately defended by William de Albiney, at the head of an hundred and forty knights with their retainers, and was at laſt reduced by famine. <note place="margin">30th Nov.</note> John, irritated with the reſiſtance, intended to have hanged the governor and all the garriſon; but on the repreſentation of William de Mauleon, who ſuggeſted to him the danger of reprizals, he was contented to ſacrifice, in this barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the inferior priſoners only<note n="‡" place="bottom">M.

Tho' the ſenſe of the common rights of mankind, the only rights which are entirely indefeaſible, might have juſtified them in their depoſition of the King; they declined inſiſting before Philip, on a pretenſion, which is commonly ſo unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable among ſovereigns, and which ſounds harſhly in their royal ears. They affirmed, that John was incapable of ſucceeding to the crown, by reaſon of the attainder, paſſed upon him during his brother's reign; tho' that attainder had been reverſed, and Richard had even, by his laſt will, declared him his ſucceſſor. They pretended, that he was already legally depoſed by ſentence of the peers of France, on account of the murder of his nephew; tho' that ſentence could not poſſibly regard any thing but his tranſmarine dominions, which alone he held in homage to that crown. On more plauſible grounds, they affirmed, that he had already depoſed himſelf by doing homage to the Pope, changing the nature of his ſovereignty, and reſigning an independent crown for a ſee or vaſſalage under a foreign power. And as Blanche of Caſtille, the wife of Lewis, was deſcended by her mother from Henry II. they maintained, tho' many other princes ſtood before her in the order of ſucceſſion, that they had not ſhaken off the royal family in chooſing her huſband for their ſovereign.</p>
            <p>PHILIP was extremely tempted to lay hold of the rich prize which was offered to him. The Pope's legate menaced him with interdicts and excommunications, if he invaded the patrimony of St. Peter, or attacked a prince, who was under the immediate protection of the holy ſee<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

His chief ſcruple was with regard to the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which he might expect of the Engliſh barons in their new engagements, and the danger of entruſting his ſon and heir into the hands of men, who might, on any caprice or neceſſity, make peace with their native ſovereign, by ſacrificing a pledge of ſo much value. He therefore exacted from the barons twenty-five hoſtages of the moſt noble birth in the kingdom<note n="‖" place="bottom">M. Paris, p. 193. Chron.

Many conſiderable noblemen deſerted John's party, the earls of Saliſbury, Arundel, Warrenne, Oxford, Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle, and William Mareſchal the younger: His caſtles fell daily into the hands of the enemy: Dover was the only place, which, from the valor and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Hubert de Burgh, the governor, made reſiſtance to the progreſs of Lewis's arms<note n="†" place="bottom">M.

there, and his diſtemper ſoon after put an end to his life, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and ſeventeenth of his reign; and freed the nation from the dangers, to which it was equally expoſed, by his ſucceſs or his misfortunes. <note place="margin">Death and character of the King.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE character of this prince is nothing but a complication of vices, equally mean and odious; ruinous to himſelf, and deſtructive to his people. Cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity, licentiouſneſs, ingratitude, treachery, tyranny, and cruelty; all theſe qualities appear too evidently in the ſeveral incidents of his life to give us any room to ſuſpect, that the diſagreeable picture has been any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe overcharged by the prejudice of the antient hiſtorians. It is hard to ſay, whether his conduct to his father, his brother, his nephew, or his ſubjects was moſt culpable; or whether his crimes in theſe reſpects were not even exceeded by the baſeneſs, which appeared in his tranſactions with the King of France, the Pope, and the barons. His dominions, when they devolved to him by the death of his brother, were more extenſive than have, ever ſince his time, been ruled by any Engliſh monarch: But he firſt loſt by his miſconduct the flouriſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in France, the antient patrimony of his family: He ſubjected his kingdom to a ſhameful vaſſalage under the ſee of Rome: He ſaw the prerogatives of his crown diminiſhed by law, and ſtill more reduced by faction: And he died at laſt, when in danger of being totally expelled by a foreign power, and of either ending his life miſerably in priſon, or ſeeking ſhelter as a fugitive from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his enemies.</p>
            <p>THE prejudices againſt this prince were ſo violent, that he was believed to have ſent an embaſſy to the Miramoulin or Emperor of Morocco, and to have offered to change his religion and become Mahometan, in order to purchaſe the protection of that monarch. But tho' that ſtory is told us, on plauſible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by Matthew Paris<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 169.</note>, it is in itſelf utterly improbable; except, that there is nothing ſo incredible as may not become likely from the folly and wickedneſs of John.</p>
            <p>THE monks throw great reproaches on this prince for his impiety and even infidelity; and as an inſtance of it, they tell us, that having, one day, caught a very fat ſtag, he exclaimed, <hi>How plump and well fed is this animal; and yet I dare ſwear he never heard maſs</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>THE feudal law is the chief foundation, both of the political government and of the juriſprudence, eſtabliſhed by the Normans in England. Our ſubject therefore requires, that we ſhould form a juſt idea of this law, in order to explain the ſtate, as well of that kingdom, as of all the other kingdoms of Europe, which, during thoſe ages, were governed by ſimilar inſtitutions. And tho' I am ſenſible, that I muſt here repeat many obſervations and reflections, which have been communicated by others<note n="‖" place="bottom">L'Eſprit des loix. Dr. Robertſon's hiſtory of Scotland. Dalrymple of feudal Tenures.</note>; yet, as every book, agreeable to the obſervation of a great hiſtorian<note n="*" place="bottom">Padre de Paolo Hiſt. Conc. Trid.</note>, ſhould be as complete as poſſible within itſelf, and ſhould never refer, for any thing material, to other books, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in this place, to deliver a ſhort plan of that prodigious fabric, which, for ſeveral centuries, preſerved ſuch a mixture of liberty and oppreſſion, order and anarchy, ſtability and revolution, as was never experienced in any other age or any other part of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Origin of the feudal law.</note> AFTER the northern nations ſubdued the provinces of the Roman empire, they were obliged to eſtabliſh a ſyſtem of government, which might ſecure their conqueſts, as well againſt the revolt of their numerous ſubjects, who remained in the provinces, as from the inroads of other tribes, who might be tempted to raviſh from them their new acquiſitions. The great change of circumſtances made them here depart from thoſe inſtitutions, which prevailed among them, while
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0162900301:404"/>
they remained in the foreſts of Germany; yet was it ſtill natural for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in their preſent ſettlement, as much of their antient cuſtoms as was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with their new ſituation.</p>
            <p>THE German governments, being more a confederacy of independant war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, than a civil ſubjection, derived their principal force from many inferior and voluntary aſſociations, which individuals formed under a particular head or chieftain, and which it became the higheſt point of honour to maintain with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable fidelity. The glory of the chieftain conſiſted in the number, the bravery, and the zealous attachment of his retainers: The duty of the retainers required that they ſhould accompany their chieftain in all wars and dangers, that they ſhould fight and periſh by his ſide, and that they ſhould eſteem his renown or his favour a ſufficient recompence for all their ſervices<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit. de Mor. Germ.</note>. The prince himſelf was nothing but a great chieftain, who was choſen from among the reſt, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſuperior valour or nobility; and who derived his power from the voluntary aſſociation or attachment of the other chieftains.</p>
            <p>WHEN a tribe, governed by thoſe ideas, and actuated by thoſe principles, ſubdued a large territory, they found, that tho' it was neceſſary to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a military poſture, they could neither remain united in a body, nor take up their quarters in ſeveral garriſons, and that their manners and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions debarred them from uſing thoſe expedients, the obvious ones, which, in a like ſituation, would have been employed by a civilized nation. Their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the art of finances, and perhaps the devaſtations inſeparable from ſuch violent conqueſts, rendered it impracticable for them to levy taxes ſufficient for the pay of numerous armies; and their repugnance to a ſlaviſh ſubordination, with their attachment to rural pleaſures, made the life of the camp or garriſon, if perpetuated during peaceful times, extremely odious and diſguſtful to them. They ſeized, therefore, ſuch a proportion of the conquered lands as appeared neceſſary; they aſſigned a ſhare for ſupporting the dignity of their prince and government; they diſtributed other parts, under the title of fiefs, to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; theſe made a new partition among their retainers; the expreſs condition of all theſe grants was, that they might be reſumed at pleaſure, and that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, ſo long as he enjoyed them, ſhould ſtill remain in readineſs to take the field for the defence of the nation. And tho' the conquerors immediately ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in order to enjoy their new acquiſitions, their martial diſpoſition made them readily fulfil the terms of their engagement: They aſſembled on the firſt alarm; their habitual attachment to the chieftain made them willingly ſubmit to his command; and thus a regular military force, tho' concealed, lay always
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0162900301:405"/>
ready, to defend, on any emergence, the intereſt and honour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>WE are not to imagine, that all or even the greateſt part of the conquered lands was ſeized by the northern conquerors; or that the whole of the land thus ſeized was ſubjected to theſe military ſervices. This ſuppoſition is confuted by the hiſtory of all the nations on the continent. Even the idea given us of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manners by the Roman hiſtorian, may convince us, that that bold people would never have been contented with ſo precarious a ſubſiſtence, or have fought to procure eſtabliſhments, which were only to continue during the good pleaſure of their ſovereign. Tho' the northern chieftains accepted of lands, which, being conſidered as a kind of military pay, might be reſumed at the will of the King or general; they alſo took poſſeſſion of eſtates, which, being hereditary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant, enabled them to maintain their native liberty, and ſupport, without court-favour, the honour of their rank and family.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Progreſs of the feudallaw.</note> BUT there is a great difference, in the conſequences, between the diſtribution of a pecuniary ſubſiſtence, and the aſſignment of lands burdened with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of military ſervice. The delivery of the former at the weekly, monthly, or annual terms of payment, ſtill recalls the idea of a voluntary gratuity from the prince, and reminds the ſoldier of the precarious tenure by which he holds his commiſſion. But the attachment naturally formed with a fixed portion of land, gradually begets the idea of ſomething like property, and makes the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor forget his dependant ſituation, and the condition which was at firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the grant. It ſeemed equitable, that one who had cultivated and ſowed a field, ſhould reap the harveſt: Hence fiefs, which were at firſt entirely preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, were ſoon made annual. A man, who had employed his money in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, planting, or other improvements, expected to reap the fruits of his labour or expence: Hence they were next granted during a term of years. It would be thought hard to expel a man from his poſſeſſions, who had always done his duty, and performed the conditions on which he originally received them: Hence the chieftains, in a ſubſequent period, thought themſelves entitled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the enjoyment of their feudal lands during life. It was found, that a man would, in battle, hazard his life more willingly, if aſſured, that his family ſhould inherit his poſſeſſions, and ſhould not be expoſed by his death to want and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: Hence fiefs were made hereditary in families, and deſcended, during one age, to the ſon; then to the grandſon, next to the brothers, and afterwards to more diſtant relations<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. Feud. lib. 1. tit. 1.</note>. The idea of property ſtole in gradually upon that of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0162900301:406"/>
military pay; and each century made ſome ſenſible addition to the ſtability of fiefs and tenures.</p>
            <p>IN all theſe ſucceſſive acquiſitions, the chieftain was ſupported by his vaſſals; who, having originally a ſtrong connexion with him, augmented by the conſtant intercourſe of good offices, and by the friendſhips ariſing from neighbourhood and dependance, were inclined to follow their leader againſt all his enemies, and voluntarily, in his private quarrels, pay him the ſame obedience, to which by their tenure they were bound in foreign wars. While he daily advanced new pretenſions to ſecure the poſſeſſion of his ſuperior fief, they expected to find the ſame advantage in acquiring ſtability to their ſubordinate ones; and they zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly oppoſed the intruſion of a new lord, who would be inclined, as he was fully intitled, to beſtow the poſſeſſion of their lands on his own favourites and retainers. The authority of the ſovereign gradually decayed; and the nobles, fortified each in his own territory by the attachment of his vaſſals, became too powerful to be expelled by an order from the throne; and he ſecured by law what he had at firſt acquired by uſurpation.</p>
            <p>DURING this precarious ſtate of the ſupreme power, a difference would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be experienced between thoſe portions of territory which were ſubjected to the feudal tenures, and thoſe which were poſſeſſed by an allodial or free title. Tho' the latter poſſeſſions had at firſt been eſteemed infinitely preferable, they were ſoon found, by the progreſſive changes introduced into public and private law, to be of a much inferior condition to the former. The poſſeſſors of a feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal territory, united by a regular ſubordination under one chieftain, and by the mutual attachments of the vaſſals, had the ſame advantages over the proprietors of the other, which a diſciplined army enjoys over a diſperſed multitude; and were enabled to commit with impunity all injuries on their defenceleſs neighbours. Every one, therefore, haſtened to ſeek that protection which he found ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and each allodial proprietor, reſigning his poſſeſſions into the hands of the King, or of ſome nobleman reſpected for power or valour, received them back with the condition of feudal ſervices<note n="†" place="bottom">Marculf. Form 47. apud Lindenbr. p. 1238.</note>, which, tho' a burden ſomewhat grievous, brought him ample compenſation, by connecting him with the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and placing him under the guardianſhip of a potent chieftain. The decay of the political government thus neceſſarily occaſioned the extenſion of the feudal: The kingdoms of Europe were univerſally divided into baronics, and theſe into inferior fiefs: And the attachment of vaſſals to their chieftain, which was at firſt an eſſential part of the German manners, was ſtill ſupported by the

ſame cauſes from which it at firſt aroſe; the neceſſity of mutual protection, and the continued intercourſe, between the head and the members, of benefits and ſervices.</p>
            <p>BUT there was another circumſtance, which corroborated theſe feudal depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies, and tended to connect the vaſſals with their ſuperior lord by an indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble bond of union. The northern conquerors, as well as the more early Greeks and Romans, embraced a policy, which is unavoidable to all nations that have made ſlender advances in refinement; and they every where united the civil juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with the military power. Law, in its commencement, was not an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſcience, and was more governed by maxims of equity, which ſeem obvious to common ſenſe, than by numerous and ſubtile principles, applied to a variety of caſes by profound reaſonings from analogy. An officer, tho' he had paſſed his life in the field, was able to determine all legal controverſies which could oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur within the diſtrict committed to his charge; and his deciſions were the moſt likely to meet with a prompt and ready obedience, from men who reſpected his perſon, and were accuſtomed to act under his command. The profit ariſing from puniſhments, which were then chiefly pecuniary, was another reaſon for his deſiring to retain the judicial power; and when his fief became hereditary, this authority, which was eſſential to it, was alſo tranſmitted to his poſterity. The counts and other magiſtrates, whoſe power was merely official, were tempted, in imitation of the feudal lords, whom they reſembled in ſo many particulars, to render their dignity perpetual and hereditary; and in the decline of the regal power, they found no difficulty to make good their pretenſions. After this manner, the vaſt fabric of feudal ſubordination became quite ſolid and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; it formed every where an eſſential part of the political conſtitution; and the Norman and other barons, who followed the fortunes of William, were ſo accuſtomed to it, that they could ſcarce form an idea of any other ſpecies of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government<note n="*" place="bottom">The ideas of the feudal government were ſo rooted, that even lawyers, in thoſe ages, could not form a notion of any other conſtitution. <hi>Regnum,</hi> (ſays Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 34.) <hi>quod ex comitatibus &amp; baronibus dicitur eſſe conſtitutum.</hi>

            <p>THE Saxons, who conquered England, as they exterminated the antient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and were ſecured by the ſea againſt new invaders, found it leſs requiſite to maintain themſelves in a military poſture; and the quantity of land which they annexed to offices, ſeems to have been of ſmall value; and for that reaſon conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the longer in its original ſituation, and was always poſſeſſed during pleaſure by thoſe entruſted with the command. Theſe conditions were too precarious to ſatisfy the Norman chieftains, who enjoyed more independant poſſeſſions and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions

in their own country; and William was obliged, in the new diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of land, to copy the tenures, which were now become univerſal on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. England of a ſudden became a feudal kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Coke Comm. on Lit. p. 1, 2. ad ſect. 1.</note>; and received all the advantages, and was expoſed to all the inconveniences, incident to that ſpecies of civil polity.</p>

               <note place="margin">The feudal government of England.</note> ACCORDING to the principls of the feudal law, the King was the ſupreme lord of the landed property; and all poſſeſſors, who enjoyed the fruits or revenue of any part of it, held theſe privileges, either mediately or immediately, of him; and their property was conceived to be, in ſome degree, conditional<note n="†" place="bottom">Sommer of Gavelk, p. 109. Smith de Rep. lib. 3. cap 10.</note>. The land was ſtill apprehended to be a ſpecies of <hi>benefice,</hi> which was the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a feudal property; and the vaſſal owed, in return for it, ſtated ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to his baron, as the baron himſelf did for his land to the crown. The vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal was obliged to defend his baron in war; and the baron, at the head of his vaſſals, was bound to fight in defence of the King and kingdom. But beſides theſe military ſervices, which were caſual, there were others impoſed of a civil nature, which were more conſtant and perpetual.</p>
            <p>THE northern nations had no idea, that any man, trained up to honour, or enured to arms, was ever to be governed, without his own conſent, by the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will of another; or that the adminiſtration of juſtice was ever to be exerciſed by the private opinion of any one magiſtrate, without the concurrence of ſome other perſons, whoſe intereſt might induce them to check his arbitrary and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous deciſions. The King, therefore, when he found it neceſſary to demand any ſervices of his barons or chief tenants, beyond what was due by their tenures, was obliged to aſſemble them, in order to procure their <hi>conſent:</hi> And when it was neceſſary to determine any controverſy among the barons themſelves, the queſtion muſt be diſcuſſed in their preſence, and be decided according to their opinion or <hi>advice.</hi> In theſe two circumſtances of conſent and advice, conſiſted chiefly the civil ſervices of the antient barons; and theſe implied all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable incidents of governments. In one view, the barons regarded this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as their principal <hi>privilege;</hi> in another, as a grievous <hi>burden.</hi> That no momentous affairs could be tranſacted without their conſent and advice, was in <hi>general</hi> eſteemed the great ſecurity of their poſſeſſions and dignities; but as they reaped no immediate profit from their attendance at court, and were expoſed to great inconvenience and charge by an abſence from their own eſtates, every one was glad to exempt himſelf from each <hi>particular</hi> exertion of this power; and was pleaſed both that the call for that duty ſhould return ſeldom upon him, and that
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0162900301:409"/>
others ſhould undergo the burden in his ſtead. The King, on the other hand, was uſually anxious, for ſeveral reaſons, that the aſſembly of the barons ſhould be full at every ſtated or caſual time of meeting: This attendance was the chief badge of their ſubordination to his crown, and drew them from that independance which they were apt to affect in their own caſtles and manors; and where the meeting was thin or ill attended, its determinations had leſs authority, and were not followed by ſo ready an obedience from the whole community.</p>
            <p>THE caſe was the ſame with the barons in their courts as with the King in the ſupreme council of the nation. It was requiſite to aſſemble the vaſſals, in order to determine by their vote any queſtion which regarded the barony; and they ſat along with the chieftain in all trials, whether civil or criminal, which occurred within the limits of their juriſdiction. They were bound to pay ſuit and ſervice at the court of their baron; and as their tenure was military, and conſequently honourable, they were admitted into his ſociety, and partook of his friendſhip. Thus, a kingdom was only conſidered as a great barony, and a barony as a ſmall kingdom. The barons were peers to each other in the national council, and, in ſome degree, companions to the King: The vaſſals were peers to each other in the court of barony, and companions to their baron<note n="*" place="bottom">Du Cange Gloſſ. in verb.

            <p>BUT tho' this reſemblance ſo far took place, the vaſſals, by the natural courſe of things, univerſally, in the feudal conſtitutions, fell into a greater ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the baron, than the baron himſelf under his ſovereign; and theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments had a neceſſary and infallible tendency to augment the power of the nobles. The great chieftain, reſiding in his country-ſeat or caſtle, which he was commonly allowed to fortify, loſt, in a great meaſure, his connexion or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the prince; and added every day new force to his authority over the vaſſals of the barony. They received from him education in all military ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes: His hoſpitality invited them to live and enjoy ſociety in his hall: Their leizure, which was great, made them perpetual retainers on his perſon, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his country ſports and amuſements: They had no means of gratifying their ambition but by making a figure in his train: His favour and countenance was their greateſt honour: His diſpleaſure expoſed them to contempt and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny: And they felt every moment the neceſſity of his protection, both in the controverſies which occurred with other vaſſals, and what was more material, in the daily inroads and injuries which were committed by the neighbouring barons. During the time of general war, the ſovereign, who marched at the head of his armies, and was the great protector of the ſtate, acquired always ſome acceſſion
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0162900301:410"/>
to his authority, which he loſt during the intervals of peace and tranquillity: But the looſe police incident to the feudal conſtitutions, maintained a perpetual, tho' ſecret hoſtility, between the ſeveral members of the ſtate; and the vaſſals found no other means of ſecurity againſt the injuries to which they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually expoſed, but by cloſely adhering to their chieftain, and falling into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, it was ſtill more deſtructive of the independance and ſecurity of the other members of the ſtate, or what in a proper ſenſe we call the people. A great part of them were <hi>ſerfs,</hi> and lived in a ſtate of abſolute ſlavery or villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: The other inhabitants of the country paid their rent in ſervices which were in a great meaſure arbitrary, and they could expect no redreſs of injuries in a court of barony from men who thought they had a right to oppreſs and tyrannize over them: The towns were ſituated either within the demeſnes of the King, or the lands of the great barons, and were almoſt entirely ſubjected to the abſolute will of their maſter. The languiſhing ſtate of commerce kept the inhabitants poor and contemptible; and the political inſtitutions were calculated to render that poverty perpetual. The barons and gentry, living in ruſtic plenty and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, gave no encouragement to the arts, and had no demand for any of the more elaborate produce of manufactures: Every profeſſion was held in contempt but that of arms: And if any merchant or manufacturer roſe by induſtry and frugality to a degree of opulence, he found himſelf but the more expoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, from the envy and avidity of the military nobles.</p>
            <p>THESE concurring cauſes gave the feudal governments ſo ſtrong a biaſs towards ariſtocracy, that the royal authority was extremely eclipſed in all the European ſtates; and, inſtead of dreading the growth of monarchical power, we might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expect, that the community would every where crumble into ſo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant baronies, and loſe the political union by which they were cemented. In elective monarchies, the event was commonly anſwerable to this expectation; and the barons, gaining ground on every vacancy of the throne, raiſed themſelves almoſt to a ſtate of ſovereignty, and ſacrificed to their power both the rights of the crown and the liberties of the people. But hereditary monarchies had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of authority, which was not ſo eaſily ſubverted; and there were ſeveral cauſes, which ſtill maintained a degree of influence in the hands of the ſovereign.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt baron could never loſe view entirely of thoſe principles of the feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal conſtitution, which bound him, as a vaſſal, to ſubmiſſion and fidelity towards his prince; becauſe he was every moment obliged to have recourſe to thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in exacting fidelity and ſubmiſſion from his own vaſſals. The leſſer ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,

finding that the annihilation of royal authority leſt them expoſed without protection to the inſults and injuries of more potent neighbours, naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the crown, and promoted the execution of general and equal laws. The people had ſtill a ſtronger intereſt to deſire the grandeur of the ſovereign; and the King, being the legal magiſtrate, who ſuffered by every internal convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or oppreſſion, and who regarded the great nobles as his immediate rivals, aſſumed the ſalutary office of general guardian or protector of the commons. Beſides the prerogatives with which the law endowed him; his large demeſnes and numerous retainers rendered him, in one ſenſe, the greateſt baron of his kingdom; and where he was poſſeſſed of perſonal vigor and ability (for his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required theſe advantages) he was commonly able to preſerve his authority, and maintain his ſtation as head of the community, and the chief fountain of law and juſtice.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Kings of the Norman race were favoured by another circumſtance, which preſerved them from the encroachments of their barons. They were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of a conquering army, which was obliged to continue in a military poſture, and to maintain great ſubordination under their leader, in order to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the revolt of the numerous natives, whom they had bereaved of all their properties and privileges. But tho' this circumſtance ſupported the authority of William and his immediate ſucceſſors, and rendered them extremely abſolute, it was loſt as ſoon as the Norman barons began to coaleſce with the nation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſecurity in their poſſeſſions, and to fix their influence over their vaſſals, tenants, and ſlaves. And the immenſe fortunes, which the Conqueror had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on his chief captains, ſerved to ſupport their independancy, and make them formidable to the ſovereign.</p>

               </note> THE ſupreme legiſlative power of England was lodged in the King and great council, or what was afterwards called the parliament. It is not doubted but the archbiſhops, biſhops, and moſt conſiderable abbots were conſtituent members of this council. They ſat by a double title: By preſcription, as having always poſſeſſed that privilege, thro' the whole Saxon period, from the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity; and by their right of baronage, as holding of the King <hi>in capite</hi> by military ſervice. Theſe two titles of the prelates were never accurately diſtinguiſhed. When the uſurpations of the church had riſen to ſuch a height, as to make the biſhops affect a ſeparate dominion, and regard their ſeat in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a degradation of their epiſcopal dignity; the King inſiſted, that they were barons, and on that account, obliged, by the general principles of the feudal law, to attend on him in his great councils<note n="‖" place="bottom">Spel. Gloff. in verb. <hi>Baro.</hi>
               </note>. Yet there ſtill remained ſome practices, which ſuppoſed their title to be derived merely from antient poſſeſſion: When a biſhop was elected, he ſat in parliament before the King had made him reſtitution of his temporalities; and during the vacancy of a ſee, the guardian of the ſpiritualities was ſummoned to attend along with the biſhops.</p>
            <p>THE barons were another conſtituent part of the great council of the nation. Theſe held immediately of the crown by a military tenure: They were the moſt honourable members of the ſtate, and had a <hi>right</hi> to be conſulted in all public deliberations: They were the immediate vaſſals of the crown, and owed as a <hi>ſervice</hi> their attendance in the court of their Supreme Lord. A reſolution, taken without their conſent, was likely to be but ill executed: And no determination
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0162900301:413"/>
of any cauſe or controverſy among them had any validity, where the vote and advice of the whole body did not concur. The dignity of earl or count was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and territorial, as well as hereditary; and as all the earls were alſo barons, they were conſidered as military vaſſals of the crown, were admitted in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity into the general council, and formed the moſt honourable and powerful branch of it.</p>
            <p>BUT there was another claſs of the immediate military tenants of the crown, equally numerous with the barons, the tenants <hi>in capite</hi> by knights ſervice; and theſe, however inferior in power or property, held by a tenure, which was equally honourable as that of the others. A barony was commonly compoſed of ſeveral knights fees; and tho' the number ſeems not to have been exactly defined, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſiſted of leſs than forty hydes of land<note n="*" place="bottom">Four hydes made one knight's fee: The relief of a barony was twelve times greater than that of a knight's fee; whence we may conjecture its value.

But as this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was uſually eſteemed a burthen, and one too great for a man of ſlender fortune to bear conſtantly; it is probable, that tho' he had a title, if he pleaſed, to be admitted, he was not obliged by any penalty, like the barons, to pay a regular attendance. All the immediate military tenants of the crown amounted not fully to 700, when Domeſday book was framed; and as the members were well pleaſed, on any pretext, to excuſe themſelves from attendance, the aſſembly was never likely on any occaſion to become too numerous for the diſpatch of public buſineſs.</p>

This queſtion was once diſputed in England with great acrimony; but ſuch is the force of time and evidence, that they can ſometimes prevail even over faction, and the queſtion ſeems, by general conſent, and even by their own, to be at laſt determined againſt the ruling party.

Their land, comprehended in the barony, was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in parliament by the baron himſelf, who was ſuppoſed, according to the fictions of the feudal law, to poſſeſs the direct property of it; and it would have been deemed incongruous to give it any other repreſentation. They ſtood in the ſame capacity to him, that he and the other barons did to the King: The former were peers of the barony; the latter were peers of the realm: The vaſſals poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a ſubordinate rank within their diſtrict; the baron enjoyed a ſupreme dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the great aſſembly: They were in ſome degree his companions at home; he the King's companion in the court: And nothing can be more evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to all feudal ideas, and to that gradual ſubordination, which was eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to thoſe antient inſtitutions, than to imagine that the King would apply either for the advice or conſent of men, who were of a rank or order ſo much inferior, and whoſe duty was immediately paid to the <hi>meſne</hi> lord, that was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed between them and the throne<note n="*" place="bottom">Spelm.

It appears from Domeſday, that the boroughs were, at the time of the conqueſt, ſcarce more than country villages; and that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants lived in entire dependance on the King or great lords, and were of a ſtation little better than ſervile<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>THE great ſimilarity among all the feudal governments of Europe is well known to every man, that has any acquaintance with antient hiſtory; and the antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of all foreign countries, where the queſtion was never embaraſſed by party diſputes, have allowed, that the commons were very late in being admitted to a ſhare in the legiſlative power. In Normandy particularly, whoſe conſtitution was moſt likely to be William's model in raiſing his new fabric of the Engliſh government, the ſtates were entirely compoſed of the clergy and nobility; and the firſt incorporated boroughs or communities of that dutchy were Roüen and Falaiſe, which enjoyed their privileges by a grant of Philip Auguſtus in the year 1207<note n="‖" place="bottom">Norman. Du Cheſnii, p. 1066. Du Cange Gloſſ. in verb. <hi>commune.</hi>
               </note>. All the antient Engliſh hiſtorians, when they mention the great council of the nation, call it an aſſembly of the baronage, nobility or great men; and none of their expreſſions, tho' ſeveral hundred paſſages might be produced, can, without the utmoſt violence, be tortured to a meaning, which will admit the commons to be conſtituent members of that body<note n="§" place="bottom">Sometimes the hiſtorians mention the people, <hi>populus,</hi> as a part of the parliament: But they always mean the laity, in oppoſition to the clergy. Sometimes, the word, <hi>communitas,</hi> is found; but it always means <hi>communitas baronii.</hi> Theſe points are clearly proved by Dr. Brady.</note>. The <hi>magna charta</hi> of King John provides, that no tax or ſcutage ſhould be impoſed but by the conſent of the great council; and for more ſecurity, it enumerates the perſons intitled to a ſeat in that council, the prelates and immediate tenants of the crown, without any mention of the commons: An authority ſo full, certain and explicite, that nothing but the zeal of party could ever have procured credit to any contrary ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>IT was probably the example of the French barons which firſt emboldened the Engliſh to require greater independance from their ſovereign: It is alſo probable, that the boroughs and corporations of England were eſtabliſhed in imitation of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0162900301:416"/>
thoſe of France. It may, therefore, be propoſed, as no unlikely conjecture, that both the privileges of the peers and the liberty of the commons were originally the growth of that country.</p>
            <p>IN antient times, men were very little ſolicitous to obtain a place in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative aſſemblies; and rather regarded their attendance as a burden, which was not compenſated by any return of profit or honour, proportioned to the trouble and expence. The only reaſon of inſtituting thoſe public councils, was; on the part of the ſubject, that they deſired ſome ſecurity from the attempts of arbitrary power; and on the part of the ſovereign, that he deſpaired of governing men of ſuch independant ſpirits without their own conſent and concurrence. But the commons, or the inhabitants of boroughs, had not as yet reached ſuch a degree of conſideration, as to deſire <hi>ſecurity</hi> againſt their prince, or to imagine, that, even if they were aſſembled in a repreſentative body, they had power or rank ſufficient to enforce it. The only protection, which they aſpired to, was againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate violence and injuſtice of their fellow-citizens; and this advantage each of them looked for, from the courts of juſtice, or from the authority of ſome great lord, to whom, by law or his own choice, he was attached. On the other hand, the ſovereign was ſufficiently aſſured of obedience in the whole community, if he procured the concurrence of the nobles; nor had he reaſon to apprehend, that any order of the ſtate could reſiſt his and their united authority. The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary vaſſals could entertain no idea of oppoſing both their prince and their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors: The burgeſſes and tradeſmen could much leſs aſpire to ſuch a thought: And thus, even if hiſtory were ſilent on that head, we have reaſon to conclude, from the known ſituation of mankind during theſe ages, that the commons were never admitted as members of the legiſlative body.</p>

By this means, they received frequent and ſenſible admonitions of their dependance on the King or ſupreme magiſtrate: They formed a kind of community with their fellow-barons and freeholders: They were often drawn from their individual and independant ſtate, peculiar to the feudal ſyſtem; and were made members of a political body: And perhaps, this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of county-courts in England has had greater effects on the government, than has yet been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly pointed out by hiſtorians or traced by antiquaries.

SUCH an accumulation of powers was itſelf a great ſource of authority, and rendered the juriſdiction of the court terrible to all the ſubjects; but the turn, which judicial trials took ſoon after the Conqueſt, ſerved ſtill more to encreaſe its authority, and to augment the royal prerogatives. William, among the other violent changes, which he attempted and effected, had introduced the Norman law into England<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dial. de Sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Law now became a ſcience, which at firſt fell entirely into the hands of the Normans; and which, even after it was communicated to the Engliſh, required ſo much ſtudy and application, that the laity, in thoſe ignorant ages, were incapable of attaining it, and it was a myſtery almoſt ſolely confined to the clergy, and chiefly to the monks<note n="*" place="bottom">Malmeſ. lib. 4. p. 123.</note>. The great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the crown and the feudal barons, who were military men, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unfit to penetrate into thoſe obſcurities; and tho' they were intitled to a ſeat in the ſupreme judicature, the buſineſs of the court was wholly managed by the chief juſticiary and the law barons, who were men appointed by the King, and entirely at his diſpoſal<note n="†" place="bottom">Dugd Orig. Jurid p. 25.</note>. This natural courſe of things was forwarded by the multiplicity of buſineſs, which flowed into that court, and which daily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the appeals from all the ſubordinate judicatures of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>IN the Saxon times, no appeal was received in the King's court, except upon the denial or delay of juſtice by the inferior courts; and the ſame practice was ſtill obſerved in moſt of the feudal kingdoms of Europe. But the great power of the Conqueror eſtabliſhed at firſt in England an authority, which the monarchs in France were not able to attain till the reign of St. Lewis, who lived near two centuries after: He empowered his court to receive appeals both from the courts of barony and the county-courts, and by that means brought the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice ultimately into the hands of the ſovereign<note n="‡" place="bottom">Madox.

And leſt the expence or trouble of a journey to court ſhould diſcourage ſuitors, and make them acquieſce in the deciſion of the inferior judicatures, itinerant judges were afterwards eſtabliſhed, who made their circuits thro' the kingdom, and tried all cauſes, that were brought before them<note n="§" place="bottom">Madox Hiſt. of the Exch. p. 83, 84. 100. Gerv. Dorob. p. 1410. What made the Anglo-Norman barons more readily ſubmit to appeals from their court of the King's court of Exchequer, was, their being accuſtomed to like appeals in Normandy to the ducal court of exchequer. See Gilbert's Hiſtory of the exchequer, p. 1, 2.; tho' the author thinks it doubtful, whether the Norman court was not rather copied from the Engliſh, p. 6.</note>. By this expedient, the courts of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0162900301:419"/>
were kept in awe, and if they ſtill preſerved ſome influence, it was only from the apprehenſions which the vaſſals might entertain of diſobliging their ſuperior, by appealing from his court. But the county-courts were much diſcredited; and as the freeholders were found ignorant of the intricate principles and forms of the new law, the lawyers gradually brought all buſineſs before the King's judges, and abandoned the antient ſimple and popular judicature. After this manner, the formalities of juſtice, which, tho' they appear tedious and cumberſome, are found requiſite to the ſupport of liberty in all monarchical governments, proved at firſt, by a combination of cauſes, very advantageous to the royal authority.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Revenue of the crown.</note> THE power of the Norman kings was alſo much ſupported by a great revenue; and by a revenue, that was fixed, perpetual, and independant of the ſubject. The people, without betaking themſelves to arms, had no check upon the King, and no regular ſecurity for the due diſtribution of juſtice. In thoſe days of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, many inſtances of oppreſſion paſſed unheeded; and were ſoon after openly pleaded as precedents, which it was unlawful to diſpute or controul. Princes and miniſters were too ignorant to be themſelves ſenſible of the advantages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an equitable adminiſtration; and there was no eſtabliſhed council or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly which could protect the people, and by withdrawing ſupplies, regularly and peaceably admoniſh the King of his duty, and enſure the execution of the laws.</p>
            <p>THE firſt branch of the King's ſtated revenue was the royal demeſnes or crown-lands, which were very extenſive, and comprehended, beſide a great number of manors, moſt of the chief cities of the kingdom. It was eſtabliſhed by law, that the King could alienate no part of his demeſne, and that he himſelf, or his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, could, at any time, reſume ſuch donations<note n="*" place="bottom">Fleta, lib. 1. cap. 8, 17. lib. 3. cap. 6. § 3. Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 5.</note>: But this law was never regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obſerved; which happily rendered in time the crown ſomewhat more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant. The rent of the crown-lands, conſidered merely as ſo much riches, was a ſource of power: The influence of the King over his tenants and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of his towns, increaſed this power: But the other numerous branches of his revenue, beſides ſupplying his treaſury, gave, by their very nature, a great latitude to arbitrary authority, and were a ſupport of the prerogative; as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from an enumeration of them.</p>
            <p>THE King was never content with the ſtated rents, but levied heavy tailliages at pleaſure on the inhabitants both of town and country, who lived within his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0162900301:420"/>
demeſne. All bargains of ſale, in order to prevent theft, being prohibited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in boroughs and public markets<note n="*" place="bottom">LL. Will. 1. cap. 61.</note>, he pretended to exact tolls on all goods which were there ſold<note n="†" place="bottom">Madox, p. 530.</note>. He ſeized two hogſheads, one before and one behind the maſt, from every veſſel that imported wine. All goods paid to his cuſtoms a proportional part of their value<note n="‡" place="bottom">Madox, p. 529. This author ſays a fifteenth.

            <p>SUCH was the ſituation of the inhabitants within the royal demeſnes. But the poſſeſſors of land, or the military tenants, tho' they were better protected, both by law, and by the great privilege of carrying arms, were, from the nature of their tenures, much expoſed to the inroads of power, and poſſeſſed not what we ſhould eſteem in our age a very durable ſecurity. The Conqueror granted by his laws, that the barons ſhould be obliged to pay nothing beyond their ſtated ſervices<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">LL. Will. Conq. § 55.</note>, except a reaſonable aid to ranſom his perſon if he were taken in war, to make his eldeſt ſon a knight, and to marry his eldeſt daughter. What ſhould, on theſe occaſions, be deemed a reaſonable aid, was not determined; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the crown were ſo far diſcretionary.</p>
            <p>THE King could require in war the perſonal attendance of his vaſſals, that is, of all the landed proprietors; and if they declined the ſervice, they were obliged to pay him a compoſition in money, which was called a ſcutage. The ſum was, during ſome reigns, very precarious and uncertain; it was ſometimes levied without allowing the vaſſal the liberty of perſonal ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">Gervaſe de Tilbury, p. 25.</note>; and it was an uſual artifice of the King to pretend an expedition, that he might be intitled to levy the ſcutage from his military tenants. Danegelt was another ſpecies of land-tax levied by the early Norman kings, arbitrarily, and contrary to the laws of the Conqueror<note n="†" place="bottom">Madox's Hiſt. of the Exch. p. 475.</note>. Moneyage was alſo a general land-tax of the ſame nature, levied by the two firſt Norman kings, and aboliſhed by the charter of Henry I.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. Paris, p. 38.</note>. It was a ſhilling paid every three years by each hearth, to induce the King not to uſe his prerogative of debaſing the coin. Indeed, it appears from that charter, that, tho' the Conqueror had granted his military tenants an immunity from all taxes and tailliages, he and his ſon William had never thought themſelves bound to obſerve that rule, but had levied impoſitions at pleaſure on all the landed eſtates
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0162900301:421"/>
of the kingdom. The utmoſt that Henry grants, is, that the land cultivated by the military tenant himſelf ſhall not be ſo burdened; but he reſerves the power of taxing the farmers: And as it is known, that Henry's charter was never obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in any one article, we may be aſſured, that this prince and his ſucceſſors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted even this ſmall indulgence, and levied arbitrary impoſitions on all the lands of all their ſubjects. Theſe taxes were ſometimes very heavy; ſince Malmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury tells us, that, in the reign of William Rufus, the farmers, on account of them, abandoned tillage, and a famine enſued<note n="*" place="bottom">So alſo Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 55. Knyghton, p. 2366.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE eſcheats were a great branch both of power and of revenue to the King, eſpecially during the firſt reigns after the conqueſt. In default of deſcendants from the firſt baron, his land reverted to the crown, and continually augmented the King's poſſeſſions. The prince had indeed by law a power of alienating theſe eſcheats; but by this means he enjoyed an opportunity of eſtabliſhing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of his friends and ſervants, and thereby enlarging his authority. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he retained them in his own hands, and they were gradually confounded with his royal demeſnes, and became difficult to be diſtinguiſhed from them. This confuſion is probably the reaſon why the King acquired the right of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating his demeſnes.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides eſcheats from default of heirs, thoſe which enſued from crimes or breach of duty towards the ſuperior lord, were very frequent in antient times. If the vaſſal, being thrice ſummoned to attend his ſuperior's court, and do fealty, neglected or refuſed obedience, he forfeited all title to his lands<note n="†" place="bottom">Hottom. de Feud. Diſp. cap. 38. col. 886.</note>. If he denied his tenure, or refuſed his ſervice, he was expoſed to the ſame penalty<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. Feud. lib. 3. tit. 1.; lib. 4. tit. 21, 39.</note>. Where he ſold his eſtate without licence from his lord<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lib.

The higher crimes, rapes, robbery, murder, burning houſes, &amp;c. were called felony; and being interpreted want of fidelity to his lord, made him loſe his fief<note n="§" place="bottom">Spelm. Gloſſ. in verb. <hi>Felonia.</hi>
               </note>. Even where the felon was vaſſal to a baron, tho' his immediate lord enjoyed the forfeiture, the King might retain poſſeſſion of his eſtate during a year, and had the right of ſpoiling and deſtroying it, unleſs the baron paid him a reaſonable compoſition<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Spelm. Gloſſ. in verb. <hi>Felonia.</hi> Glanville, lib. 7. cap. 17.</note>.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0162900301:422"/>
We have not here enumerated all the ſpecies of felonies, or of crimes by which forfeiture was incurred: We have ſaid enough to prove, that the poſſeſſion of feudal property was antiently ſomewhat precarious, and that the primary idea was never entirely loſt, of its being a kind of <hi>fee</hi> or <hi>benefice:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN a baron died, the King immediately took poſſeſſion of the eſtate; and the heir, before he recovered his right, was obliged to make application to the crown, to deſire that he might be admitted to do homage for his land, and to pay a compoſition to the King. This compoſition was not at firſt fixed by law, at leaſt by practice: The King was often very exorbitant in his demands, and kept poſſeſſion of the land till they were complied with.</p>
            <p>IF the heir was a minor, the King retained the whole profit of the eſtate till his majority; and might grant what ſum he thought proper for the education and maintenance of the young baron. This practice was alſo founded on the notion, that a fief was a benefice, and that, while the heir could not perform his military ſervices, the revenue devolved to the ſuperior, who employed another in his place. It is obvious, that a great proportion of the landed property muſt, by means of this device, be continually in the hands of the prince, and that all the noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies were thereby held in continual dependance. When the King granted the wardſhip of a rich heir to any one, he had the opportunity of enriching a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite or miniſter: If he ſold it, he was thereby able to levy a conſiderable ſum of money. Simon de Mountfort paid Henry III. 10,000 marks, an immenſe ſum in thoſe days, for the wardſhip of Gilbert de Umfreville<note n="*" place="bottom">Madox's Hiſt. of the Exch. p. 223.</note>.</p>
            <p>IF the heir was a female, the King was entitled to offer her any huſband of her rank he thought proper; and if ſhe refuſed him, ſhe forfeited her land. Even a male heir could not marry without the royal conſent, and it was uſual for men to pay large ſums for the liberty of making their own choice in marriage<note n="†" place="bottom">Id. p. 320.</note>. No man could diſpoſe of his land, either by ſale or will, without the conſent of his ſuperior. The poſſeſſor was never conſidered as full proprietor: He was ſtill a kind of beneficiary; and could not oblige his ſuperior to accept of any vaſſal, who was not agreeable to him.</p>
            <p>FINES, amerciaments, and oblatas, as they were called, were another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable branch of the royal power and revenue. The antient records of the exchequer, which are ſtill preſerved, give ſurprizing accounts of the numerous fines and amerciaments levied in thoſe days<note n="‡" place="bottom">Id. p. 272.</note>, and of the ſtrange inventions fallen upon to exact money from the ſubject. It appears, that the old kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land put themſelves entirely on the footing of the barbarous eaſtern princes,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0162900301:423"/>

            <p>THESE iniquitous practices of the Norman kings were ſo well known, that on the death of Hugh Bigod, in the reign of Henry II. the beſt and moſt juſt of theſe princes, the eldeſt ſon and the widow of this nobleman came to court, and ſtrove, by proffering large preſents to the King, each of them to acquire poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that rich inheritance.

            <p>AMERCIAMENTS or fines for crimes and treſpaſſes were another conſiderable branch of the royal revenue<note n="‡" place="bottom">Madox, chap xiv.</note>.

               </note>, as an undoubted truth, that, during the reigns of the firſt Norman princes, every edict of the King, iſſued with the conſent of his privy-council, had the full force of law. But the barons ſurely were not ſo paſſive as to entruſt a power, entirely arbitrary and deſpotic, into the hands of the ſovereign. It only appears, that the conſtitution had not fixed any preciſe boundaries to the royal power; that the right of iſſuing proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on any emergence and of exacting obedience to them, a right which was always ſuppoſed inherent in the crown, is very difficult to be diſtinguiſhed from a legiſlative authority; that the extreme imperfection of the antient laws and the ſudden exigencies, which often occurred in ſuch turbulent governments, obliged the prince to exert frequently the latent powers of his prerogative; that he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally proceeded, from the acquieſcence of the people, to aſſume, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of moment, an authority, from which he had excluded himſelf by expreſs ſtatutes, charters or conceſſions, and which was, in the main, repugnant to the general genius of the conſtitution; and that the lives, the perſonal liberty, and the properties of all his ſubjects were leſs ſecured by law againſt the exertion of his arbitrary authority, than by the independant power and private connexions of each individual. It appears from the great charter itſelf, that not only John, a tyrannical prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father, Henry, under whoſe reign the prevalence of groſs abuſes is the leaſt to be ſuſpected, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, from his ſole authority, without proceſs of law, to impriſon, baniſh and attaint the freemen of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>A GREAT baron, in antient times, conſidered himſelf as a kind of ſovereign within his territory; and was attended with courtiers and dependants more zealouſly attached to him than the miniſters of ſtate, and the great officers were commonly to <hi>their</hi> ſovereign. He often maintained in his court the parade of royalty, by eſtabliſhing a juſticiary, conſtable, mareſchal, chamberlain, ſeneſchal, and chancellor, and aſſigning to each of theſe officers a ſeparate province and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He was uſually very aſſiduous in exerciſing his juriſdiction; and took ſuch delight in that image of ſovereignty, that it was found neceſſary to reſtrain his activity, and prohibit him by law from holding courts too frequently<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dugd. Jurid. Orig. p. 26.</note>. It is not to be doubted, that the example, ſet him by the prince, of a mercenary and ſordid extortion, would be faithfully copied; and that all his good and bad offices, his
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0162900301:428"/>
juſtice and injuſtice, were equally put to ſale. He had the power, with the King's conſent, to exact talliages even from the free-citizens who lived within his barony; and as his neceſſities made him rapacious, his authority was uſually found to be more oppreſſive and tyrannical than the ſovereign<note n="*" place="bottom">Madox. H. of Exch. p. 520.</note>. He was ever engaged in hereditary or perſonal animoſities or confederacies with his neighbours; and often gave protection to all deſperate adventurers and criminals who could be uſeful in ſerving his violent purpoſes. He was able alone, in times of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, to obſtruct the execution of juſtice within his territories; and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining with a few malcontent barons of high rank and power, he could throw the whole ſtate into convulſions. And on the whole, tho' the royal authority was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within bounds, and often within very narrow ones, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous knight fought not only in his own quarrel; but in that of the innocent, the helpleſs, and above all, of the fair, whom he ſuppoſed to be for ever under the guardianſhip of his valiant arm. The uncourteous knight, who, from his caſtle, exerciſed robbery on travellers, and committed violence on virgins, was the object of his perpetual indignation; and he put him to death, without ſcruple or trial or appeal, wherever he met with him. The great independance of men made perſonal honour and fidelity the chief tie among them; and rendered it the capital virtue of every true knight, or genuine profeſſor of chivalry. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of ſingle combat, as eſtabliſhed by law, baniſhed the notion of every thing unfair or unequal in rencounters; and maintained an appearance of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy between the combatants, till the moment of their engagement.

            <p>THE conceſſion of the Great Charter, or rather its full eſtabliſhment (for there was a conſiderable interval between the one and the other) gave riſe, by degrees, to a new ſpecies of government, and introduced ſome order and juſtice into the adminiſtration.
