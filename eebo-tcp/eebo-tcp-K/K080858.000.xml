            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WHEN Philip's ſon led forth his warlike band,</l>
            <l>To die, or conquer, in a diſtant land;</l>
            <l>To fan the fire, a martial muſe he choſe;</l>
            <l>From Homer's ſong a new Achilles roſe!</l>
            <l>When generous Athens her prime trophies won,</l>

            <l>The ſtage breath'd war—the ſoldiers boſom burn'd,</l>
            <l>And fiercer to the field each chief return'd:</l>
            <l>Now, when the world reſounds with loud alarms,</l>
            <l>When victory ſits plan'd on Britain's arms,</l>
            <l>Be war our theme: the hero's glorious toil,</l>
            <l>And virtue ſpringing from the iron ſoil!</l>
            <l>Our ſcenes preſent a ſiege in ſtory known;</l>
            <l>Where magnanimity, and valour ſhone:</l>
            <l>If nature guides us, if the hand of truth</l>
            <l>Draws the juſt portrait of a Roman youth,</l>
            <l>Who, with the beſt and nobleſt paſſions ſir'd,</l>
            <l>In the ſame moment, conquer'd and expir'd;</l>
            <l>Perhaps your bearts may own the pictur'd woe,</l>
            <l>And from a fonder ſource your ſorrows flow:</l>
            <l>Whilſt warm remembrance aids the poet's ſtrain,</l>

As oft ſince Freedom fell our fathers fought,</l>
                  <l>When Latian chiefs contended who ſhould reign,</l>
                  <l>With half the ſenate liſted on each ſide;</l>

Serene I ſtep'd along the lofty hall,</l>
                  <l>Imbelliſh'd with the ſtatues of our fathers,</l>

                  <l>The murder'd GRACCHI. Hand in hand, the brothers</l>

                  <l>They were no more the GRACCHI, but my ſons</l>

            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>OUR Author, as I'm told, is not to ſeek</l>
               <l>In antient Lore; in Latin, nor in Greek.</l>
               <l>I therefore did adviſe him, as a friend,</l>
               <l>To make his learning ſerve ſome uſeful end:</l>
               <l>And let me know, what rules he had obſerv'd,</l>
               <l>What unities of time and place preſerv'd.</l>
               <l>He anſwer'd, Poetry is not an art;</l>
               <l>'Tis nature only frames the poet's heart:</l>
               <l>Still as he thinks, the ſcene he feels along,</l>
               <l>And from his boſom burſts the raptur'd ſong.</l>
               <l>This is the ſacred oracle, the ſhrine</l>
               <l>The bard conſults, and here, the tuneful Nine.</l>
               <l>With the ſame fire, the hearer's ſoul muſt glow,</l>
               <l>Elſe vain to him, the tale of tragick woe.</l>
               <l>There is a temper, which is all and all:</l>
               <l>That ſounds reſponſive to the poet's call.</l>
               <l>Like Memnon's harp, which pour'd harmonious lays,</l>
               <l>Whene'er its ſtrings were touch'd by Phoebus' rays.</l>
               <l>This temper of the ſoul is ſweet and wild;</l>
               <l>It ſobs, or ſmiles, as ſudden as a child;</l>
               <l>To woes imagin'd tears unfeigned gives,</l>
               <l>And in the poet's world of fancy lives.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whilſt thus he ſpoke, a bell was heard to ring;</l>
               <l>He ſtop'd, and ſtarted like a guilty thing;</l>
               <l>Ere the dread curtain roſe, in haſte withdrew,</l>
               <l>And at a diſtance wails his doom from you.</l>
