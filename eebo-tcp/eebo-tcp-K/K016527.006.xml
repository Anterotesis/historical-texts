            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU will be ſo good, my dear friend, as to let my neighbours, particularly the gentlemen you mention, know, that the only reaſon I forbear paying my compliments to them, now I am ſo near, is, becauſe I cannot as yet enjoy their company with that freedom and eaſe which I hope in a little while to do. Tell them, that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, after ſome particular affairs are determined (which will for a little while longer engroſs me) to devote the greateſt part of my time to my native place; and that then I will endeavour to make myſelf as good a neighbour, and as ſocial a friend, as they can wiſh me to be.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday I had a viſit from the two Hartleys.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1185400106:3"/>
They gave me very ſatisfactory proofs of what they were able to do, as well as willing, in ſupport of the right of the Mansfields to the eſtate of which they have been deſpoiled; and ſhewed me a paper, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body thought was in being, of the utmoſt conſequence in the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>On Monday, by appointment, I attended Sir John Lambton. Two lawyers of the Keelings were with him. They produced their demands. I had mine ready; but theirs were ſo extravagant, that I would not produce them: But, taking Sir John aſide, I love not, ſaid I, to affront men of a profeſſion; but I am convinced, that we never ſhall come to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if we conſider ourſelves as Lawyers and Clients. I am no lawyer; but I know the ſtrength of my friends cauſe, and will riſque half my eſtate upon the juſtice of it. The Mansfields will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>me,</hi> if the Keelings will <hi>you;</hi> and we perhaps may do ſomething: If not, let the Law take its courſe. I am now come to reſide in England. I will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for myſelf, till I have done what can be done to make all my friends eaſy.</p>
                  <p>Sir John owned, that he thought the Mansfields had hardſhips done them. Mr. Keeling ſenior, he ſaid, had heard of the paper in the Hartley's hands; and, praiſing his honeſty, told me in confidence, that he had declared, that if ſuch a paper could have been produced in time, he would not have proſecuted the ſuit, which he had carried. But Sir John ſaid, that the younger Keeling was a furious young man, and would oppoſe a compromiſe on the terms he ſuppoſed the Mansfields would expect to be complied with. But what are your propoſals, Sir?</p>
                  <p>Theſe, Sir John: The Law is expenſive; delays may be meditated; appeals may be brought, if we gain our point.—What I think it may coſt us to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the right of the injured, which cannot be a ſmall ſum, that will I prevail upon the Mansfields to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1185400106:4"/>
give up to the Keelings. I will truſt you, if you give me your honour, with our proofs; and if you and your friends are ſatisfied with them, and will conſent to eſtabliſh our right by the form only of a new trial; then may we be agreed: Otherwiſe, not. And I leave you and them to conſider of it. I ſhall hear from you within two or three days. Sir John promiſed I ſhould; but hoped to have ſome talk firſt with the Hartleys, with whom, as well as with me, he declared he would be upon honour.</p>

                  <p>I HAD a meſſage from Sir John laſt night, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to dine with him and the elder Mr. Keeling this day; and to bring with me the two Mr. Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and the proofs I had hinted at.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe gentlemen were ſo obliging, as to go with me; and took the important paper with them, which had been depoſited with their grandfather, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend, and contained a recognition of the Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields right to the eſtates in queſtion, upon an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable reference to perſons long ſince departed: An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted copy of which was once in the Mansfields poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as by a memorandum that came to hand, but which never could be found. The younger Keeling was not intended to be there; but he forced himſelf upon us. He behaved very rudely. I had once like to have forgot myſelf. This meeting produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: But as the father is a reaſonable man; as we have obtained a re-hearing of the cauſe; as he is much influenced by Sir John Lambton, who ſeems convinced; and to whoſe honour I have ſubmitted an abſtract of our proofs; I am in hopes that we ſhall be able to accommodate.</p>
                  <p>I have Bolton's propoſals before me. The firſt child is dead; the ſecond cannot live many months. He trembles at the proofs he knows we have of his villainy. He offers, on the death of this ſecond child, to give us poſſeſſion of the eſtate, and a large ſum of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1185400106:5"/>
money (but thought not to be half of what the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated Calvert left) if we will give him general releaſes. The wretch is not, we believe, married to the relict of Calvert.</p>
                  <p>I am loth, methinks, to let him eſcape the juſtice which his crimes call for: But ſuch are the delays and chicaneries of the law, when practiſers are found who know how to perplex an honeſt purſuer; and as we muſt have recourſe to low and dirty people to eſtabliſh our proofs; the vile fellow ſhall take with him the propoſed ſpoils: They may not be much more than would be the lawyers part of the eſtate, were we to puſh the litigation.</p>
                  <p>As to our poor Everard, nothing, I fear, can be done for him, with the men who are revelling on <hi>his</hi> ſpoils. I have ſeen one of them. The unhappy man has ſigned and ſealed to his own ruin. He regrets, that a part of the eſtate which has been ſo long in the family and name, ſhould go out of it. What an empty pride is that of name! The general tenor of his life was not a credit to it; tho' he felt not that, till he felt diſtreſs. The diſgrace is actually incurred. Does not all the world know his loſs, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's triumph? And if the world did not, can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from himſelf thoſe vices, the conſequences of which have reduced him to what he is? But perhaps the unhappy man puts a value upon the name, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to me.</p>
                  <p>Mention not to him what I write. The poor man is ſenſible enough of his folly, to engage pity: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a right ſenſe, or not, muſt be left to his own heart.</p>
                  <p>As to the woman's claim: What in honour can I do, againſt a promiſe that he owns may be proved upon him? He did not condition with her, that ſhe was to be a ſpotleſs woman. If he thought ſhe was ſo when he ſolicited her to yield to his deſires, he is the leſs to be excuſed: Vile as ſhe comes out to be,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1185400106:6"/>
he had propoſed to make her as vile, if he had found her not ſo. He promiſed her marriage: Meant he only a promiſe? <hi>She</hi> is puniſhed in being what ſhe <hi>is: His</hi> puniſhment cannot be condign, but by his being obliged to perform his promiſe. Yet I cannot bear to think that my couſin Grandiſon ſhould be made, for life, the dupe of a ſucceſsful and premeditated villainy; and the leſs, as, in all likelihood, the profligate Lord B. would continue to himſelf, from the merit with her of having vindicated her claim, an intereſt in the bad woman's favour, were ſhe to be the wife of our poor Everard.</p>
                  <p>But certainly this claim muſt be proſecuted with a view only to extort money from my couſin; and they know him to be of a family jealous of its honour. I think ſhe muſt be treated with for releaſes. I could not bear to appear in ſuch a cauſe as this, in open court, in ſupport of my couſin, againſt a promiſe made by him. He is of age, and thought to be no novice in the ways of the town. I am miſtaken in Mr. Grandiſon's ſpirit, if it did not lead him to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very ſeverely puniſhed, were he to have no other puniſhment, for thoſe vices, which were to be expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to <hi>me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if I ſhould be able to extricate the unhappy man from this difficulty, what can next be done for him? The poor remains of his fortune will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one who has always lived <hi>more</hi> than genteelly. Will he be able, think you, to endure the thoughts of living in a conſtant ſtate of dependence, however eaſy and genteel I ſhould endeavour to make it to him? There may be many ways (in the public offices, for example) of providing for a broken tradeſman: But for a man who calls himſelf, and is, a gentleman; who will expect as ſuch to rank with his employer, who knows nothing of figures, or buſineſs of any kind; who has been brought up in idleneſs, and hardly knows the meaning of the word <hi>diligence;</hi> and never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1185400106:7"/>
could bear confinement; what can be done for ſuch a one in the public offices, or by any other employment that requires punctual attendance?</p>
                  <p>But to quit this ſubject, for a more agreeable one.</p>
                  <p>I have for ſome time had it in my thoughts to aſk you, my dear friend, Whether your nephew is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for to <hi>your</hi> liking and his <hi>own?</hi> If not, and he would put it in <hi>my</hi> power to ſerve <hi>him,</hi> by ſerving <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> I ſhould be obliged to <hi>you</hi> for permitting him ſo to do, and to <hi>him,</hi> for his conſent. I would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him, by the offer of a ſalary: My preſents to him ſhall be ſuch as befit the ſervices done:—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as my amanuenſis; ſometimes as a tranſcriber and methodizer of Papers and Letters; ſometimes in adjuſting ſervants accounts, and fitting them for my inſpection. You need not fear my regard to <hi>myſelf</hi> in my acknowlegements to be made to him (that, I know, will be all your fear); for I have always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered profuſion and parſimony as two extremes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to be avoided. You, my dear Dr. Bartlett, have often enforced this leſſon on my mind. Can it then ever be forgotten by</p>

               <p>YOUR kind Letters from Lyons, my deareſt friend, rejoiced us extremely. Clementina lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed to hear from you. How was it poſſible for you to write with ſo much warmth of affection to her, yet with ſo much delicacy, that a rival could not take exceptions at it?</p>
               <p>She writes to you. It is not for me, it is not for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1185400106:8"/>
any of us, I think, to ſay one word to the principal ſubject of her Letter. She ſhewed it to me, and to her mother, only.</p>
               <p>Dear creature! Could ſhe be prevailed upon!—But how can you be aſked to ſupport the family-wiſhes? Yet if you think them juſt, I know you will. You know not <hi>Self,</hi> when juſtice and the ſervice of your friend ſtand in oppoſition to it. All that I am afraid of is, that we ſhall be too precipitate for the dear creature's head.</p>
               <p>Would to God, you could have been my Brother! That was the firſt deſire of my heart!—But you will ſee by her Letter (the leaſt flighty that ſhe has written of a long time) that ſhe has no thought of that: And ſhe declares to us, that ſhe wiſhes you happily married to an Engliſhwoman. Would to Heaven, we might plead <hi>your</hi> example to <hi>her!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will certainly attend you in your England!—If one thing, that we all wiſh, could happen, you would have the whole family, as far as I know. We think, we talk, of nobody but you. We look out for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, to do them honour for your ſake.</p>
               <p>Mrs, Beaumont is with us. Surely ſhe is your near relation! She adviſes caution; but thinks that our preſent meaſures are not wrong ones, as we never can give into my ſiſter's wiſhes to quit the world. Dear Grandiſon! love not Mrs. Beaumont the leſs for her opinion in our favour.</p>

               <p>HOW welcome to me was your Letter from Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! My good Chevalier Grandiſon, my heart thanks you for it: Yet it was poſſible that heart could have been ſtill more thankful, had I not obſerved in your Letter an air of penſiveneſs, tho' it is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be concealed. What pain would it give me to know, that you ſuffer on my account!—But no more in this ſtrain: A complaining one muſt take place.</p>
               <p>O Chevalier, I am perſecuted! And by whom? By my deareſt, my neareſt friends. I was afraid it would be ſo. Why, why, would you deny me your influence, when I importuned you for it? Why would you not ſtay among us, till you ſaw me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed? Then had I been happy—In <hi>time,</hi> I ſhould have been happy!—Now am I beſet with entreaties, with ſupplications, from thoſe who ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;—yet unlawfully, if they did: I preſume to think ſo: Since parents, tho' they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in the change of condition, as to the <hi>perſon;</hi> yet ſurely ſhould not oblige the child to marry, who chooſes to be ſingle all her life. A more cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be pleaded, and I do plead it to my relations, as Catholics, as I wiſh for nothing ſo much as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the veil.—But you are a Proteſtant: You favour not a Divine dedication, and would not plead for me. On the contrary, you have ſtrengthened their hands!—O Chevalier! how could you do ſo, and ever love me! Did you not know, there was but one way to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1185400106:10"/>
eſcape the grievous conſequences of the importunities of thoſe who juſtly lay claim to my obedience?—And they <hi>do</hi> claim it.</p>
               <p>And in what forcible manner, claim it!—Shall I tell you? Thus, then: My father, with tears in his eyes, beſeeches me! My mother gently reminds me of what ſhe has ſuffered for me in my illneſs; and declares, that it is in my power to make the reſt of her days happy: Nor ſhall ſhe think my own tranquility of mind ſecured, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>till I oblige her!—O Chevalier! what pleas are theſe from a father, whoſe eyes plead more ſtrongly than words: and from a mother, on whoſe bright days I caſt a cloud!—The Biſhop pleads: How can a Catholic Biſhop plead, and not for me? The General declares, that he never wooed his beloved wife for her conſent with more fervour than he does me for mine, to oblige them all. Nay, Jeronymo! Bluſh, ſiſterly love! to ſay it—Jeronymo, your friend Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo, is ſolicitous on the ſame ſide—Even Father Mareſcotti is carried away by the example of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.—Mrs. Beaumont argues with me in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.—And Camilla, who was ever full of your praiſes, teazes me continually.</p>
               <p>They name not the man: They pretend to leave me free to chooſe through the world. They plead, that, zealous as they are in the Catholic faith, they were <hi>ſo</hi> earneſt for me to enter into the ſtate, that they were deſirous to ſee me the wife even of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, rather than I ſhould remain ſingle: And they remind me, that it was owing to my ſcruple only, that this was not effected.—But why, why will they weaken rather than ſtrengthen my ſcruple? Could I have got over three points—The ſenſe of my own unworthineſs, after my mind had been diſturbed; The <hi>inſuperable</hi> apprehenſion, that, drawn aſide by your Love, I ſhould probably have enſnared my own Soul: and that I ſhould be perpetually lamenting the certainty of the loſs of his whom it would be my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1185400106:11"/>
duty to love as my own; their importunity would hardly have been wanted.</p>
               <p>Tell me adviſe me, my good Chevalier, my fourth brother (You are not Now <hi>intereſted</hi> in the debate) if I may not lawfully ſtand out? Tell me, as I know that I cannot anſwer their views, except I marry, and yet cannot conſent to marry, whether I may not as well ſequeſter myſelf from the world, and inſiſt upon ſo doing?</p>
               <p>What, what can I do?—I am diſtreſſed—O thou, my <hi>Brother,</hi> my Friend, whom my heart ever muſt hold dear, adviſe me! To you I have told them I will appeal. They are ſo good as to promiſe to ſuſpend their ſolicitations, if I will hold ſuſpended my thoughts of the veil till I have your advice.—But give it not againſt me—If you ever valued Clementina,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give it not againſt her!</hi>

               <p>WHAT can I ſay, moſt excellent of women, to the contents of the Lerter you have honoured me with? What a taſk have you impoſed upon me! You take great, and, reſpecting your intentions, I will call it, <hi>kind</hi> care, to let me know that I can have no intereſt in the deciſion of the caſe you refer to me. I repeat my humble acquieſcence; but muſt again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it would have been next to impoſſible to do ſo, had you not made a point of conſcience of your ſcruples.</p>
               <p>But what weight is my advice likely to have with a young Lady, who repeatedly, in the cloſe of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſires me not to give it <hi>for</hi> her parents?</p>
               <p>I, madam, am <hi>far</hi> from being unprejudiced in this caſe. For can the man who once himſelf hoped for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1185400106:12"/>
the honour of your hand, adviſe you againſt Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age?—Are not your parents generouſly indulgent, when they name not any particular perſon to you? I applaud both their wiſdom and their goodneſs, on this occaſion. Poſſibly, you <hi>gueſs</hi> the man whom they would recommend to your choice: And I am ſure, Lady Clementina would not refuſe their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation merely becauſe it was <hi>theirs.</hi> Nor indeed upon any leſs reaſon than an unconquerable averſion, or a preference to ſome other Catholic. A Proteſtant, it ſeems, it <hi>cannot</hi> be.</p>
               <p>But let me aſk my Siſter, my Friend, What anſwer can I return to the Lady who had ſhewn, in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that ſhe had not an inſuperable averſion to Matrimony; yet on conſcientious reaſons refuſing one man, and not particularly favouring any, can ſcruple to oblige <hi>(obey</hi> is not the word they uſe) <q rend="inline margQuotes">'a Father, who with tears in his eyes beſeeches her; a Mother who gently reminds her of what ſhe has ſuffered for her; who declares, that it is in her power to make the reſt of her days happy; and who urges a ſtill ſtronger plea reſpecting them both, and the whole family, to engage the attention of the beloved daughter?"—O madam, what pleas are thoſe (Let me ſtill make uſe of your own pathetic words) from a Father whoſe eyes plead more ſtrongly than words! and from a Mother, over whoſe bright days you had (tho' involuntarily) caſt a cloud!—Your Brother the Biſhop, a man of piety; your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fſſor, a man of equal piety; your two other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your diſintereſted Friend Mrs. Beaumont; your faithful Camilla; all wholly diſintereſted.'</q>—What an enumeration againſt yourſelf.—Forbidden, as I am. to give the cauſe <hi>againſt</hi> you, what can I ſay? Deareſt Lady Clementina, can I, on your own repreſentation, give it <hi>for</hi> you?</p>
               <p>You know, madam, the ſacrifice I have made to the plea of <hi>your</hi> conſcience, not <hi>my</hi> own. I make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1185400106:13"/>
no doubt, but parents ſo indulgent as yours, will yield to your reaſons, if you can plead <hi>conſcience</hi> againſt the performance of the <hi>filial duty;</hi> the more a duty, as it is ſo gently urged: Nay, hardly urged; but by tears, and wiſhes, which the eyes, not the lips, expreſs; and which if you will perform, your parents will think themſelves under an obligation to their child.</p>
               <p>Lady Clementina is one of the moſt generous of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But conſider, madam, in this inſtance of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own will to that of the moſt indulgent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whether there is not an apparent ſelfiſhneſs, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with your general character, even were you to be as happy in a convent, as you propoſe. Would you not, in that caſe, live to yourſelf, and renounce your parents and family, as parts of that world which you would vow to deſpiſe?—Dear Lady! I asked you once before, Is there any thing ſinful in a Sacrament? Such all good Catholics deem Matrimony. And ſhall I ask you, Whether, as ſelf-denial is held to be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in your church, there is not a merit in denying yourſelf in the caſe before us, when you can, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the filial duty, oblige your whole family?</p>
               <p>Permit me to ſay, that tho' a Proteſtant, I am not an enemy to ſuch foundations in general. I could wiſh, under proper regulations, that we had Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries among us. I would not, indeed, have the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon Nuns be perpetual: Let them have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the end of every two or three years, to renew their vows, or otherwiſe, by the conſent of friends. Celibacy in the Clergy is an indiſpenſable law of your church: Yet a Cardinal has been allowed to lay down the purple, and marry. You know, madam, I muſt mean Ferdinand of Medicis. Family-reaſons, in that caſe, preponderated, as well at Rome, as at Florence.</p>
               <p>Of all the women I know, Lady Clementina della Porretta ſhould be the laſt who ſhould be earneſt to take the veil. There can be but two perſons in the world, beſides herſelf, who will not be grieved at her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1185400106:14"/>
choice. We know <hi>their</hi> reaſons. The will of her grandfathers, now with God, is againſt her; and her living parents, and every other perſon of her family, thoſe <hi>two</hi> excepted, would be made unhappy, if ſhe ſequeſtered herſelf from the world, and them. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina has charity: She wiſhes, ſhe once ſaid, to take a great revenge upon Laurana. Laurana has ſomething to repent of: Let <hi>her</hi> take the veil. The fondneſs ſhe has for the world, a fondneſs which could make her break through all the ties of relation, and humanity, requires a check: But are any of thoſe in convents more pious, more exemplary pious, than Clementina is, out of them?</p>
               <p>Much more could I urge on the ſame ſide of the queſtion; but what I have urged has been a <hi>taſk</hi> upon me; a taſk which I could not have performed, had I not preferred to my own, the happineſs of you and your family.</p>
               <p>May both earthly and heavenly bleſſings attend your determination, whatever it be, prays, deareſt madam.</p>

               <p>I Have written, my beloved friend, to Lady Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina; and ſhall incloſe a copy of my Letter.</p>
               <p>I own, that, till I received hers, I thought there was a poſſibility, tho' not a probability, that ſhe might change her mind in my favour. I <hi>foreſaw</hi> that you would all join, for family-reaſons, to preſs her to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1185400106:15"/>
marry: And when, thought I, ſhe finds herſelf very earneſtly urged, it is poſſible, that ſhe will forego her ſcruples, and, propoſing ſome conditions for herſelf, will honour with her hand the man whom ſhe has avowedly honoured with a place in her heart, rather than any other. The malady ſhe has been afflicted with, often leaves, for ſome time, an unſteadineſs in the mind: My abſence, as I propoſed to ſettle in my native country, never more, perhaps, to return to Italy; the high notions ſhe has of obligation and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; her declared confidence in my honour and affection; all co-operating, ſhe may, thought I, change her mind; and if ſhe does, I cannot doubt the favour of her friends. It was not, my Jeronymo, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to <hi>hope.</hi> It was <hi>juſtice</hi> to Clementina to attend the event, and to wait for the promiſed Letter: But now, that I ſee you are all of one mind, and that the dear Lady, tho' vehemently urged by all her friends to marry ſome other man, can appeal to me, only as to her <hi>fourth Brother,</hi> and a man <hi>not intereſted</hi> in the event—I give up all my hopes.</p>
               <p>I have written accordingly to your dear Clementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; but it could not be expected, that I ſhould give the argument all the weight that might be given it: Yet, being of opinion that ſhe was in duty obliged to yield to the entreaties of all her friends, I have been honeſt. But ſurely no man ever was involved in ſo many difficult ſituations as your Grandiſon; who yet never, by enterprize or raſhneſs, was led out of the plain path into difficulties ſo uncommon.</p>
               <p>You wiſh, my dear friend, that I would ſet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to your excellent ſiſter. I will unboſom my heart to you.</p>
               <p>There is a Lady, an Engliſh Lady, beautiful as an Angel, but whoſe beauty is her leaſt perfection, either in my eyes, or her own: Had I never known Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina, I could not have loved her, and <hi>only</hi> her, of all the women I ever beheld. It would not be doing her
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1185400106:16"/>
juſtice, if I could not ſay, I <hi>do</hi> love her; but with a flame as pure as the heart of Clementina, or as her own heart, can boaſt. Clementina's diſtreſſed mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me: I imputed her ſufferings to her eſteem for me. The farewel interview denied her, ſhe demonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, I thought, ſo firm an affection for me, at the ſame time that ſhe was to me, what I may truly call, a firſt Love; that, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the difficulties in my way ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable. I thought it became me, in honour, in gratitude, to hold myſelf in ſuſpenſe, and not offer to make my addreſſes to any other woman, till the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the dear Clementina was determined.</p>
               <p>It would look like vanity in me to tell my Jerony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo how many propoſals, from the partial friends of women of rank and merit ſuperior to my own, I thought myſelf obliged, in honour to the Ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to decline: But my heart never ſuffered unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs from the uncertainty I was in of ever ſucceeding with your beloved ſiſter, but on this Lady's account, I preſume not, however, to ſay, I could have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had I thought myſelf at liberty to make my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to her: Yet, when I ſuffered myſelf to balance, becauſe of my uncertainty with your Clementina, I had hopes, from the intereſt my two ſiſters had with her (her affections diſengaged), that, had I been at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make my addreſſes to her, I might.</p>
               <p>Shall I, my dear Jeronymo, own the truth?—The two nobleſt-minded women in the world, when I went over to Italy, on the invitation of my Lord the Biſhop, held almoſt an equal intereſt in my heart; and I was thereby enabled juſtly, and with the greater command of myſelf, to declare to the Marchioneſs, and the General, at my laſt going over, that I held myſelf bound to you; but that your ſiſter, and you all, were free. But when the dear Clementina began to ſhew ſigns of recovery, and ſeemed to confirm the hopes I had of her partiality to me; and my gratitude and attachment ſeemed of importance to her complete
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1185400106:17"/>
reſtoration; then, my Jeronymo, did I content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with wiſhing another husband to the Engliſh Lady, more worthy of her than my embaraſſed ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could have made me. And when I farther expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the condeſcending goodneſs of your whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, all united in my favour; I had not a wiſh but for your Clementina.</p>
               <p>What a diſappointment, my Jeronymo, was her rejection of me! obliged, as I was, to admire the noble Lady the more for her <hi>motives</hi> of rejecting me.</p>
               <p>And now, my dear friend, what is your wiſh?—That I ſhall ſet your ſiſter an example? How can I? Is marriage in my power? There is but one woman in the world, now your dear Clementina has refuſed me, that I can think worthy of ſucceeding <hi>her</hi> in my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' there are thouſands of whom I am not worthy. And ought that Lady to accept of a man whoſe heart had been another's, and that other living, and ſingle, and ſtill honouring him with ſo much of her regard, as may be thought ſufficient to attach a grateful heart, and occaſion a divided Love? Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina herſelf is not more truly delicate than this Lady. Indeed, Jeronymo, I am ready, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template my ſituation, on a ſuppoſition of making my addreſſes to her, to give up myſelf, as the unworthieſt of her favour of all the men I know; and ſhe has for an admirer almoſt every man who ſees her—Even Olivia admires her! Can I do juſtice to the merits of both, and yet not <hi>appear</hi> to be divided by a double Love?—For I will own to all the world, my affection for Clementina; and, as once it was encouraged by her whole family, glory in it.</p>
               <p>You ſee, my Jeronymo, how I am circumſtanced. The example, I fear, muſt come from Italy; not from England. Yet ſay I not this for punctilio-ſake: It is not in my <hi>power</hi> to ſet it, as it is in your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina's: It would be preſumption to ſuppoſe it is, Clementina has not an averſion to the <hi>ſtate:</hi> She
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1185400106:18"/>
cannot to the man you have in view, ſince prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in favour of another is over—This is a hard puſh upon me. I preſume not to ſay what Clementina <hi>will,</hi> what ſhe <hi>can</hi> do: But ſhe is naturally the moſt dutiful of children, and has a high ſenſe of the more than common obligations ſhe owes to parents, to brothers, to whom ſhe has as unhappily as involuntarily given great diſtreſs: Difference in Religion, the motive of her rejecting <hi>me,</hi> is not in the queſtion: Filial duty is an article of Religion.</p>
               <p>I do myſelf the honour of writing to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, to the General, to Father Mareſcotti, and to Mr. Lowther. May the Almighty perfect your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, my Jeronymo; and preſerve in health and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the dear Clementina!—and may every other laudable wiſh of the hearts of a family ſo truly-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, be granted to them!—prays, my deareſt Jerony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, the friend who expects to ſee you in England; the friend who loves you, as he loves his own heart; and equally honours all of your name; and <hi>will,</hi> ſo long as he is</p>

               <p>O My dear couſin! I am now ſure you will be the happieſt of women! Sir Charles Grandiſon made us a viſit this very day.—How Mr. Reeves and I rejoiced to ſee him! We had but juſt before been called upon by a line from Lady G. to rejoice with her on her brother's happy arrival. He ſaid, he was under obligation to go to Windſor and Hampſhire, upon extraordinary occaſions; but he could not go, till he had paid his reſpects to us, as well for our own ſakes, as to enquire after your health. He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1185400106:19"/>
he ſaid, ſome diſagreeable inimitations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it. We told him, you were not well; but we hoped not dangerouſly ill. He ſaid ſo many kind, tender, yet reſpectful things of you—O my Harriet! I am ſure, and ſo is Mr. Reeves, he loves you dearly. Yet we both wondered that he did not talk of paying you a viſit. But he may have great matters in hand.—But what matters can be ſo great as not to be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, if he loves you?—and that he certainly does. I ſhould not have known how to contain my joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, had he declared himſelf your Lover.</p>
               <p>He condeſcendingly asked to ſee my little boy—Was not that very good of him? He would have won my heart by this condeſcenſion, had he not had a great ſhare of it before—For your ſake, my couſin. You know I cannot mean otherwiſe: And you know, that, except Mr. Reeves and my little boy, I love my Harriet better than any-body in the world. No-body in Northamptonſhire, I am ſure, will take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this.</p>
               <p>I thought I would write to you of this kind viſit. Be well, now, my dear: All things, I am ſure, will come abou for good: God grant they may!—I dare ſay, he will viſit you in Northamptonſhire: And if he does, what can be his motive? <hi>Not</hi> mere friendſhip: Sir Charles Grandiſon is no triſler!</p>
               <p>I know you will be ſorry to hear that Lady Betty Williams is in great affliction. Miſs Williams has run away with enſign who is not worth a ſhilling: He is, on the contrary, <hi>over head and cars,</hi> as the ſaying is, in debt. Such a mere girl! But what ſhall we ſay?</p>
               <p>Miſs Cantillon has made as fooliſh a ſtep. Lord bleſs me! I think girls, in theſe days, are bewitched. A nominal captain too: Her mother vows, they ſhall both ſtarve for her: And they have no other depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. She can't live without her pleaſures: Neither can he without his. A Ranelagh ſop. Poor wretches!
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1185400106:20"/>
What will become of them? For every-thing is in her mother's power, as to fortune.—She has been met by Miſs Alleſtree: and looked <hi>ſo</hi> ſhy! <hi>ſo</hi> ſilly! <hi>ſo</hi> ſlatternly! Unhappy coquettiſh thing!</p>
               <p>Well, but God bleſs you, my dear!—My nurſery calls upon me: The dear little ſoul is ſo <hi>fond</hi> of me! Adieu. Compliments to every-body I have ſo much reaſon to love: Mr. Reeves's too. Once more, Adieu.</p>

               <p>YOUR kind Letter, my dear couſin, has, at the ſame time, delighted and pained me. I rejoyce in the declared eſteem of one of the beſt of men; and I honour him for his friendly love expreſſed to you and my couſin, in the viſit he made you: But I am pained at your calling upon me (in pity to my weakneſs, ſhall I call it? a weakneſs ſo ill concealed) to rejoice, that the excellent man, when he has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched all his affairs of conſequence, and has nothing elſo to do, may <hi>poſſibly,</hi> for you cannot be certain, make me a viſit in Northamptonſhire.—O my couſin! And were his abſence, and the apprehenſion of his being the huſband of another woman, think you, the <hi>occaſion</hi> of my indiſpoſition; that I muſt now, that the other affair ſeems determined in a manner ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, be bid at once to be well?</p>
               <p>Sir Charles Grandiſon, my dear couſin, may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour us with the <hi>prognoſticated</hi> viſit, or not, as he pleaſes: But were he to declare himſelf my Lover, my heart would not be ſo joyful as you ſeem to expect, if Lady Clementina is to be unhappy. What tho' the refuſal of marriage was hers; was not that refuſal
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1185400106:21"/>
the greateſt ſacrifice that ever woman made to her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior duty? Does ſhe not ſtill avow her Love to him? And <hi>muſt</hi> he not, <hi>ought</hi> he not, ever to love her? And here my pride puts in it's claim to attention—Shall your Harriet ſit down and think herſelf happy in a ſecond-place Love? Yet let me own to you, my couſin, that Sir Charles Grandiſon is dearer to me than all elſe that I hold moſt dear in this world: And if Clementina could be not <hi>un</hi> -happy [Happy I have no notion ſhe can be without him] and he were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf my Lover; Affectation, be gone! I would ſay; I will truſt to my own heart, and to my future conduct, to make for myſelf an intereſt in his affections, that ſhould enrich my content; in other words, that ſhould make me <hi>more</hi> than contented.</p>
               <p>But time will ſoon determine my deſtiny: I will have patience to wait its determination. I make no doubt but he has ſufficient reaſons for all he does.</p>
               <p>I am as much delighted, as you could be, at the notice he took of your dear infant. The brave muſt be humane: And what greater inſtance of humanity can be ſhewn, than for grown perſons to look back upon the ſtate they were once themſelves in, with tenderneſs and compaſſion?</p>
               <p>I am very ſorry for the cauſe of Lady Betty's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Pity! the good Lady took not—But I will not be ſevere, after I have ſaid, that children's faults are not always <hi>originally</hi> their own.</p>
               <p>Poor Miſs Cantillon!—But ſhe was not under age; and <hi>as</hi> her puniſhment was of her own chooſing—I am ſorry, however, for both. I hope, after they have ſmarted, ſomething will be done for the poor wretches. Good parents <hi>will be</hi> placable; bad ones, or ſuch as have not given good examples, <hi>ought to be</hi> ſo.</p>
               <p>God continue to you, my dear couſins both, your preſent comforts, and increaſe your pleaſures! for all your pleaſures are innocent ones; prays</p>

               <p>DO you know what is become of your brother? My grandmamma Shirely has ſeen his Ghoſt; and talked with it near an hour; and then it vaniſhed. Be not ſurprized, my dear creature. I am ſtill in amaze at the account my grandmamma gives us of its appearance, diſcourſe, and vaniſhing! Nor was the dear parent in a reſverie. It happened in the middle of the afternoon, all in broad day. Thus ſhe tells it:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I was ſitting, ſaid ſhe, in my own drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, yeſterday, by myſelf; when, in came James, to whom it firſt appeared, and told me that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman deſired to be introduced to me. I was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sherlock upon Death,</hi> with that chearfulneſs with which I always meditate the ſubject. I gave orders for his admittance; and in came, to appearance, one of the handſomeſt men I ever ſaw in my life, in a riding-dreſs. It was a courteous Ghoſt: It ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted me; or at leaſt I thought it did: For it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the deſcription that you, my Harriet, had given me of that amiable man, I was ſurpriſed. But, contrary to the manner of ghoſts, it ſpoke firſt—Venerable Lady, it called me; and ſaid, its name was Grandiſon, in a voice—ſo like what I had heard you ſpake of it, that I had no doubt but it was Sir Charles Grandiſon himſelf; and was ready to fall down to welcome him.</q>
               </p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">'It took its place by me: You, madam, ſaid it, will forgive this intruſion: And it made ſeveral fine ſpeeches, with an air <hi>ſo</hi> modeſt, <hi>ſo</hi> manly—It had almoſt all the talk to itſelf. I could only bow, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1185400106:23"/>
be pleaſed; for ſtill I thought it was corporally, and indeed, Sir Charles Grandiſon. It ſaid, that it had but a very little while to ſtay: It muſt reach, I don't know what place, that night—What, ſaid I, will you not go to Selby-houſe? Will you not ſee my daughter Byron? Will you not ſee her aunt Selby? No, it deſired to be excuſed. It talked of leaving a pacquet behind it; and ſeemed to pull out of its pocket a parcel of Letters ſealed up. It broke the ſeal, and laid the parcel on the table before me. It refuſed refreſhment. It deſired in a courtly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, an anſwer to what it had diſcourſed upon—Made a profound reverence—and—vaniſhed.'</q>
               <p>And now, my dear Lady G. let me repeat my queſtion; What is become of your brother?</p>
               <p>Forgive me, this light, this amuſing manner. My grandmamma ſpeaks of this viſit as an appearance, ſo ſudden, and ſo ſhort, and nobody ſeeing him but ſhe; that it gave a kind of amuſing levity to my pen, and I could not reſiſt the temptation I was under to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you, as he has done us all. How could he take ſuch a journey, ſee nobody but my grandmamma, and fly the country? Did he do it to ſpare us, or to ſpare himſelf?</p>
               <p>The direct truth is this: My grandmamma was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by herſelf, as above: James told her, as above, that a gentleman deſired to be introduced to her. He <hi>was</hi> introduced. He called himſelf by his own name; took her hand; ſaluted her—Your character, madam, and mine, ſaid he, are ſo well known to each other, that tho' I never before had the honour of approaching you, I may preſume upon your pardon for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion.</p>
               <p>He then launched out in the praiſes of your happy friend. With what delight did the dear, the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent parent repeat them from his mouth! I hope ſhe mingled not her own partialities with them, whether I deſerved them, or not; for ſweet is praiſe, from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1185400106:24"/>
thoſe we wiſh to love us. And then he ſaid, You ſee before you, madam, a man glorying in his affection to one of the moſt excellent of your Sex; an Italian Lady; the pride of Italy! And who, from motives which cannot be withſtood, has rejected him, at the very time that all her friends conſenting, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable difficulties overcome, he expected that ſhe would yield her hand to his wiſhes—And they <hi>were</hi> his wiſhes. My <hi>friendſhip</hi> for the dear Miſs Byron <hi>(You</hi> and <hi>ſhe</hi> muſt <hi>authorize</hi> me to call it by a ſtill dearer name, before I dare to it) is well known: That alſo has been my pride. I know too well what belongs to female delicacy in general, and particularly to that of Miſs Byron, to addreſs myſelf firſt to her, on the ſubject which occaſions you this trouble. I am not accuſtomed to make profeſſions, not even to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies—Is it conſiſtent with your notions of delicacy, madam; Will it be with Mr. and Mrs. Selby's; to give your intereſt in favour of a man who is thus ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated? A rejected man! A man who dares, to own, that the rejection was a diſappointment to him; and that he tenderly loved the fair rejecter. If it will, and Miſs Byron can accept the tender of a heart that has been divided, unaccountably ſo (the circumſtances, I preſume, you know) then will <hi>you,</hi> then will <hi>ſhe,</hi> lay me under an obligation that I can only <hi>endeavour</hi> to repay by the utmoſt gratitude and affection.—But if not, I ſhall admire the delicacy of the <hi>ſecond</hi> refuſer, as I do the piety of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and, at <hi>leaſt, ſuſpend</hi> all thoughts of a change of condition.</p>
               <p>Nobleſt of men—And my grandmamma was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in high ſtrains, but very ſincere ones; when, interrupting her, and pulling out of his pocket the pacquet I mentioned above; I preſume, madam, ſaid he, that I ſee favour and goodneſs to me in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign countenance: But I will not even be <hi>favoured,</hi> but upon your full knowledge of all the facts I am maſter of myſelf. I will be the guardian of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1185400106:25"/>
of Miſs Byron and all her friends in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſe, rather than the diſcourager, tho' I were to ſuffer by it. You will be ſo good as to read theſe Letters to your daughter Byron, to her Lucy, to Mr. and Mrs. Selby, and to whom elſe you will think fit to call to the conſultation: They will be thoſe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, who already know ſomething of the hiſtory of the excellent Clementina. If, on the peruſal of them, I may be admitted to pay my reſpects to Miſs Byron, conſiſtently, as I hinted, with <hi>her</hi> notions and <hi>yours</hi> of that delicacy by which ſhe was always directed, and at the ſame time be received with that noble frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which has diſtinguiſhed her in my eye above all women but one (Excuſe me, madam, I muſt always put theſe ſiſter-ſouls upon an equal foot of excellence); then ſhall I be a happier man than the happieſt. Your anſwer, madam, by pen and ink, will greatly oblige me; and the more, the ſooner I can be favoured with it; becauſe, being requeſted by my friends abroad to ſet an example to their beloved Clementina, as you will ſee in more than one of theſe Letters; I would avoid all punctilio, and let them know, that I had offered myſelf to Miſs Byron, and have not been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with abſolute denial; if I may be ſo happy as to be allowed to write ſo.</p>
               <p>Thus did this moſt generous of men prevent, by this reference to the Letters, my grandmamma's heart overflowing to her lips. He ſhould directly, he ſaid, proceed on his journey to London; and was in ſuch haſte to be gone, when he had ſaid what he had to ſay, that it precipitated a little my grandmamma's ſpirits: But the joy ſhe was filled with, on the occaſion, was ſo great, that ſhe only had a concern upon her, when he was gone, as if ſomething was left by her undone or unſaid, which ſhe thought ſhould have been ſaid and done to oblige him.</p>
               <p>The Letters he left on the table, were copies of what he wrote from Lyons to the Marquis and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1185400106:26"/>
the Biſhop, the General, and Father Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcotti; as alſo to Lady Ciementina, and her brother, the good Jeronymo <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Theſe Letters are omitted in this collection.</note>. That to the Lady cannot be enough admired, for the tenderneſs, yet for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence with her will expreſſed in it. Surely they were born for each other, however it happens, that they are not likely to come together.</p>
               <p>A Letter from Signor Jeronymo, in anſwer to his from Lyons, I will mention next. In this—Sir Charles is wiſhed to uſe his ſuppoſed influence upon Lady Clementina (What a hard taſk upon him! (to diſſuade her from the thoughts of going into a nunnery and to reſolve upon marriage <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Letter ii.</note>.</p>
               <p>Next is a Letter of Lady Clementina to Sir Charles, complaining tenderly of perſecution from her friends, who preſs her to marry; while ſhe contends to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to take the veil, and applies to Sir Charles for his intereſt in her behalf.</p>
               <p>The next is Sir Charles's reply to Lady Clementina.</p>
               <p>Then follows a Letter from Sir Charles to Signor Jeronymo. I have copied theſe three laſt, and incloſe them in confidence <note n="(c)" place="bottom">See Letters iii iv. v.</note>.</p>
               <p>By theſe you will ſee, my dear, that the affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this excellent man and woman is entirely given up by both; and alſo in his reply to Signor Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo, that your Harriet is referred to as his next choice. And how can I ever enough value him, for the dignity he has given me, in putting it, as it ſhould ſeem, in my power to lay an obligation upon him; in making for me my own ſcruples; and now, laſtly, in the method he has taken in the application to my grandmamma, inſtead of to me; and leaving all to our determination. But thus ſhould the men give dignity, even for their own ſaken to the women whom they wiſh to be theirs. Were there more Sir Charles Grandiſons, would not even the Female world
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1185400106:27"/>
(much better, as I hope it is, than the Male) be amended?</p>
               <p>My grandmamma, the moment Sir Charles was gone, ſent to us, that ſhe had ſome very agreeable news to ſurpriſe us with; and therefore deſired the whole family of us, her Byron particularly to attend her at Breakfaſt, the next morning. We looked upon one another, at the meſſage, and wondered. I was not well, and would have excuſed myſelf; but my aunt inſiſted upon my going. Little did I or any-body elſe think of your brother having viſited my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma in perſon. When ſhe acquainted us that he had, my weakened ſpirits wanted ſupport: I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to withdraw with Lucy.</p>
               <p>I thought I could not bear, when I recovered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſhould be ſo near, and not <hi>once</hi> call in, and enquire after the health of the creature for whom he profeſſed ſo high an eſteem, and even affection: But when, on my return to company, my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma related what paſſed between them, and the Letters were read; then again were my failing ſpirits unable to ſupport me. They all gazed upon me, as the Letters were reading, as well as while my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma was giving the relation of what he ſaid, and of the noble, the manly air with which he delivered himſelf.—With joy and ſilent congratulation they gazed upon me; while I felt ſuch a variety of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in my heart, as I never felt before, ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities mixed with wonder; and I was ſometimes ready to doubt whether I were not in a reſverie; whether indeed I was in this world, or another; whether I was Harriet Byron—I know not how to deſcribe what I felt in my now fluttering, now rejoicing, now deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart—</p>
               <p>Dejected?—Yes, my dear Lady G. Dejection was a ſtrong ingredient in my ſenſibilities. I know not why. Yet may there not be a fulneſs in joy, that will mingle diſſatisfaction with it? If there may, ſhall I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1185400106:28"/>
be excuſed for my ſolemnity, if I deduce from thence an argument, that the human ſoul is not to be fully ſatisfied by worldly enjoyments; and that therefore the completion of its happineſs muſt be in another, a more perfect ſtate? You Lady G. are a very good woman, tho' a lively one; and I will not excuſe <hi>you,</hi> if on an occaſion that bids me look forward to a very ſolemn event, you will not forgive my <hi>ſeriouſneſ</hi>—That <hi>bids me look forward,</hi> I repeat; for Sir Charles Grandiſon cannot alter his mind: The world has not wherewith to <hi>tempt</hi> him to alter it, after he has made <hi>ſuch</hi> advances, except I miſbehave.</p>
               <p>Well, my dear, and what was the reſult of our conference?—My grandmamma, my aunt, and Lucy, were of opinion, that I ought no more to revolve the notions of a divided or ſecond-placed Love: That every point of female delicacy was anſwered: That he ought not only <hi>ſtill</hi> to be allowed to love Lady Clementina, but that I and all her Sex ſhould revere her: That my grandmamma, being the perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, ſhould anſwer for me, for us all, in words of her own chooſing.</p>
               <p>I was ſilent. What think <hi>you,</hi> my dear, ſaid my aunt? with her accuſtomed tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>Think! ſaid my uncle, with his uſual facetiouſneſs; Do you think, if Harriet had <hi>one</hi> objection, ſhe would have been ſilent? I am for ſending up for Sir Charles out of hand. Let him come the firſt day of next week, and let them be married before the end of it.</p>
               <p>Not <hi>quite</hi> ſo haſty, neither, Mr. Selby, ſaid my grandmamma, ſmiling: Let us ſend to Mr. Deane. His love for my child, and regard for deſerve the moſt grateful returns.</p>
               <p>What a duce, and defer an anſwer to Sir Charles, who gives a generous reaſon, for the ſake of the Lady abroad, and her family (and I hope he thinks a little of his <hi>own</hi> ſake) for wiſhing a ſpeedy anſwer?—</p>
               <p>No, Mr. Selby: Not deſer writing, neither. We
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1185400106:29"/>
know enough of Mr. Deane's mind already. But, for my part, I don't know what terms, what conditions, what additions to my child's fortune, to propoſe—</p>
               <p>Additions! madam—Why, ay; there muſt be ſome, to be ſure—And we are able, and as willing as able, let me tell you, to make them—</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, Sir, ſaid I—Pray, madam—No more of this—Surely it is time enough to talk of theſe ſubjects.</p>
               <p>So it is, niece. Mr. Deane is a lawyer. God help me! I never was brought up to any-thing but to live on the fat of the land, as the ſaying is. Mr. Deane and Sir Charles ſhall talk this matter over by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Let us, as you ſay, ſend for Mr. Deane. But I will myſelf be the meſſenger of theſe joyful tidings.</p>
               <p>My uncle then tuned out, in his gay manner, a line of an old ſong; and then ſaid, I'll go to Mr. Deane: I will ſet out this very day—Pull down the wall, as one of our kings ſaid; the door is too far about.—I'll bring Mr. Deane with me to-morrow, or it ſhall coſt me a fall.</p>
               <p>You know my uncle, my dear. In this manner did he expreſs his joy.</p>
               <p>My grandmother retired to her cloſet; and this that follows is what ſhe wrote to Sir Charles. Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body is pleaſed whenever ſhe takes up the pen. No one made objection to a ſingle word in it.</p>

She, Sir, experimentally knows how to allow for a double, a divided Love—Dr. Bartlett, perhaps ſhould not have favoured her with the character of a Lady whom ſhe prefers to herſelf; and Mrs. Selby and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as we read her melancholy ſtory, thought, not unjuſtly. If ſhe can be induced to love, to honour, the man of her choice, as much as ſhe loves, honours, and admires Lady Clementina; the happy Man will have reaſon to be ſatisfied.

               <p>But, my dear Lady G. does your brother tell you and Lady L. nothing of his intentions? Why, if he does, do not you—But I <hi>can</hi> have no doubt. Is not the man Sir Charles Grandiſon? And yet, methinks, I want to know what the contents of his next Letters from Italy will be.</p>

               <p>EXcellent Mrs. Shirley! Incomparable woman! How I love her! If I were ſuch an excellent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I would no more wiſh to be young, than ſhe has ſo often told us, ſhe does. What my brother once ſaid, and you once wrote to your Lucy, is true (in <hi>her</hi> caſe, at leaſt); that the matronly and advanced time of life, in a woman, is far from being the <hi>leaſt</hi> elegible part of it; eſpecially, I may add, when health and a good conſcience accompany it. What a ſpirit does ſhe, at her time of Life, write with!—But her heart is in her ſubject—I hope I may ſay <hi>that,</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, without offending you.</p>
               <p>Not a word did my brother ſpeak of his intention, till he received that Letter; and then he invited Lady L. and me, and our two honeſt men, to afternoon tea with him—[O but I have not reckoned with you for your ſaucy rebukes in your laſt of the 7th; I owe you a ſpite for it; and, Harriet, depend on payment—What was I writing?—I have it—] And when tea was over, he, without a bluſh, without looking down, as a girl would do in this ſituation—[But why ſo, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet? Is a woman, on theſe occaſions, to act a part as if ſhe ſuppoſed herſelf to be the greateſt gainer by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1185400106:32"/>
matrimony; and therefore was aſhamed of conſenting to accept of an honourable offer? As if, in other words, ſhe was to be the ſelf-denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation?—Lord, how we ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-headed creatures break in upon ourſelves!] with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry; of his apparition to Mrs. Shirley; of his ſudden vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all that—And then he produced Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's Letter, but juſt received.</p>
               <p>And do you think we were not overjoyed?—Indeed we were. We congratulated him: We congratulated each other: Lord L. looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day: Lord G. could not keep his ſeat: He was tipſy, poor man, with his joy: Aunt Nell prank'd herſelf, ſtroked her ribbands of pink and yellow, and chuckled and mumped for joy, that her nephew at laſt would not go out of Old England for a wife. She was <hi>mightily</hi> pleaſed too with Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's Letter. It was juſt ſuch a one as ſhe herſelf would have written upon the occaſion.</p>
               <p>I poſted afterward to Mrs Reeves, to ſhew her, as you requeſted, your Letter: And when we had read it, there was, Dear Madam, and, Dear Sir; and now this, and now that; and Thank God—three times in a breath; and we were couſins, and couſins, and couſins: And, O bleſſed! And, O be joyful! And—Hail the day!—And, God grant it to be a ſhort one!—And, How will Harriet anſwer to the queſtion? Will not her frankneſs be try'd? He deſpiſes affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So he thinks does ſhe!—Good Sirs! and, O dears—How things are brought about!—O my Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet! you never heard or ſaw ſuch congratulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three goſſips, as were between our two couſin Reeves's and me: And not a little did the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pride herſelf in her <hi>prognoſtics;</hi> for ſhe explained that matter to me.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bartlett is at Grandiſon-hall, with our unhappy couſin. How will the good man rejoice!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1185400106:33"/>
Now you will aſk, What became of Emily?—</p>
               <p>By the way, do you know that Mrs. O-Hara is turned <hi>Methodiſt?</hi> True as you are alive. And ſhe labours hard to convert her husband. Thank God ſhe is any-thing that is ſerious! Thoſe People have really great merit with me, in <hi>her</hi> converſion.—I am ſorry that our own Clergy are not as zealouſly in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt as they, They have really, my dear, if we may believe aunt Eleanor, given a face of religion to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean colliers, tinners, and the moſt profligate of men, who hardly ever before heard either of the word, or thing. But <hi>I</hi> am not turning <hi>Methodiſt,</hi> Harriet. No! you will not ſuſpect me.</p>
               <p>Now Emily, who is at preſent my viſiter, had asked leave before my brother's invitation (and was gone, my Jenny attending her) to viſit her mother, who is not well. My brother was engaged to ſup abroad with ſome of the Danby's, I believe: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made Lord and Lady L. couſin Reeves and couſin Reeves, and my aunt Grandiſon, ſup with me.</p>
               <p>Emily was at home before me—Ah the poor Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—I'll tell you how it was between us—</p>
               <p>My lovely girl, my dear Emily, ſaid I, I have good news to tell you, about Miſs Byron.</p>
               <p>O thank God—And is ſhe well? Pray, madam, tell me, tell me; I long to hear good news of my dear Miſs Byron.</p>
               <p>Why, ſhe will ſhortly be married, Emily!—</p>
               <p>Married, madam!—</p>
               <p>Yes, my love!—And to your guardian, child!—</p>
               <p>To my guardian, madam!—Well, but I hope ſo—</p>
               <p>I then gave her a few particulars.</p>
               <p>The dear girl tried to be joyful, and burſt into tears!</p>
               <p>Why weeps my girl—O fie! Are you ſorry that Miſs Byron will have your guardian? I thought you loved Miſs Byron.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1185400106:34"/>
So I do, madam, as my own ſelf, and more than myſelf, if poſſible—But the ſurprize, madam—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am glad! What makes me ſuch a fool?—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am glad!—What ails me, to cry, I wonder! It is what I wiſhed, what I prayed for, night and day. Dear madam, don't tell any-body. I am aſhamed of myſelf,</p>
               <p>The ſweet April-faced girl then ſmiled through her tears.</p>
               <p>I was charmed with her innocent ſenſibility; and if you are not, I ſhall think leſs of you than ever I did yet.</p>
               <p>Dear madam, ſaid ſhe, permit me to withdraw for a few minutes: I muſt have my cry out—And I ſhall then be all joy and gladneſs.</p>
               <p>She tript away; and in half an hour came down to me with quite another face.</p>
               <p>Lady L. was then with me. I had told her of the girl's emotion. We are equally lovers of you, my dear, ſaid I: you need not be afraid of Lady L.</p>
               <p>And have you told, madam?—Well, but I am not a hypocrite. What a ſtrange thing! I who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſo much afraid of another Lady, for Miſs Byron's ſake, to be ſo oddly affected, as if I were ſorry!—Indeed I rejoice.—But if you tell Miſs Byron, ſhe won't love me: She won't let me live with her and my guardian, when ſhe is happy, and has made him ſo. And what ſhall I do then? for I have ſet my heart upon it.</p>
               <p>Miſs Byron, my dear, loves you ſo well, that ſhe will not be able to deny you any-thing your heart is ſet upon, that is in her power to grant.</p>
               <p>God bleſs Miſs Byron as I love her, and ſhe will be the happieſt of women!—But what was the matter with me?—Yet I believe I know!—My poor mother had been crying ſadly to me, for her paſt unhappy life. She kiſſed me, as ſhe ſaid, for my <hi>Father's</hi> 
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1185400106:35"/>
ſake: She had been the worſt of wives to the beſt of huſbands.</p>
               <p>Again the good girl wept at her mother's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered remorſe—My guar—my guardian's goodneſs, my mother ſaid, had awakened her to a ſenſe of her wickedneſs. My poor mother did not ſpare herſelf: And I was all ſorrow; for what could I ſay to her on ſuch a ſubject?—And all the way that I came home in the coach, I did nothing but cry. I had but juſt dried my eyes, and tried to look chearful, when you came in. And then, when you told me the good news, ſomething ſtruck me all at once, ſtruck my very heart; I cannot account for it: I know not what to liken it to—And had I not burſt into tears. I believe it would have been worſe for me. But now I am myſelf; and if my poor mother could pacify her conſcience, I ſhould be a happy creature—<hi>becauſe</hi> of Miſs Byron's happineſs. You look at each other, Ladies: But if you think I ſhould <hi>not,</hi> bid me be gone from your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for a falſe girl, and never ſee you more.</p>
               <p>Now, Harriet, this emotion of Emily appears to me as a ſort of phaenomenon. Do <hi>you</hi> account for it as you will; but I am ſure Emily is no hypocrite: She has no art: She <hi>believes</hi> what ſhe ſays, that her ſudden burſt of tears was owing to her heart being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by her mother's contrition: And I am alſo ſure that ſhe loves you above all the women in the world. Yet it is poſſible, that the ſubtle thief, ycleped Love, had got very near her heart; and juſt at the moment threw a dart into one angle of it, which was the <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> that ſtruck her, all at once, as ſhe phraſed it, and made her find tears a relief. This I know, my dear, that we may be very differently affected by the ſame event, when judged of at a diſtance, and near. If you don't already, or if you ſoon will not, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the truth of this obſervation in the great event before you, I am much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1185400106:36"/>
But you ſee, Harriet, what joy this happy decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my brother, and the kind reception it has met with from Northamptonſhire, has given us all. We will keep your ſecret, never fear, till all is over; and, when it is, you ſhall let my brother know, from the Letters we have had the favour of ſeeing, as much as <hi>we</hi> do. Till he does, excellent as he thinks you, he will not know one half of your excellencies, nor the merit which your Love and your Suſpenſes have made you with him.</p>
               <p>But, with you, I long for the arrival of the next Letters from Italy. God grant that Lady Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina hold her reſolution, now that ſhe ſees it is almoſt impoſſible for her to avoid marrying. If ſhe ſhould relent, what would be the conſequence, to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to herſelf, to you! And how ſhall all we, his friends and yours, be affected! You think the Lady is obliged, in duty to her parents, to marry. Lady L. and I are determined to be wiſe, and not give our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions till the events which are yet in the boſom of Fate, diſcloſing themſelves, ſhall not leave us a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being much miſtaken. And yet, as to what the filial duty requires of her, we think ſhe ought to marry. Mean time, I repeat, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'God grant that Lady Clementina now hold her mind!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>LADY L. ſends up her name. Formality in <hi>her,</hi> ſurely. I will chide her. But here ſhe comes.—I love, Harriet, to write to the moment; that's a knack I had from you and my brother: And be ſure conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it, on every occaſion: No <hi>pathetic</hi> without it!</p>
               <p>Your ſervant, Lady L.</p>
               <p>And your ſervant, Lady G.—Writing? To whom?</p>
               <p>To our Harriet—</p>
               <p>I will read your Letter—Shall I?</p>
               <p>Take it; but read it out, that I may know what I have written.</p>
               <p>

And in your Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript—<hi>You will give us copies, if you are as obliging as you uſed to be.</hi>—Why ſhould I, when likely to be more obliged to you than ever, be leſs obliging than before?

               <p>And what, my dear, if Lady Clementina <hi>ſhould</hi> RELENT, as you phraſe it? My <hi>friends</hi> might be now grieved—Well, and I might be affected too, more than if the viſit to my grandmamma had not been made: I own it.—But the high veneration I truly profeſs to have for Lady Clementina, would be parade and pretenſion, if, whatever became of your Harriet, I did not reſolve, in that caſe, to <hi>try,</hi> at leaſt, to make myſelf eaſy, and give up to her prior and worthier claim: And I ſhould conſider her <hi>effort,</hi> tho' unſucceſsful, as having intitled her to my higheſt eſteem. To what we know to be right, we ought to ſubmit; the more difficult, the more meritorious: And, in this caſe, your Harriet would conquer, or die. If ſhe conquered, ſhe would then, in <hi>that</hi> inſtance, be greater than even Clementina. O my dear, we know not, till we have the trial, what emulation will enable a warm and honeſt mind to do.</p>

I will ſend you incloſed, copies of the two Letters tranſcribed by Lucy <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Theſe Letters do not appear. The contents may be gathered from what ſhe here ſays of them.</note>. I am very proud of them both; perhaps too proud; and it may be neceſſary that I ſhould be pulled down; tho' I expected it not from my Charlotte. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'To be complimented in ſo noble and ſincere a manner as you will ſee I am, with the power of laying an obligation on him,'</q> (inſtead of owing it to his compaſſionate conſideration for a creature ſo long labouring in ſuſpenſe, and then deſpairing that her hopes could be anſwered) is enough at the ſame time to flatter her vanity, and gratify the moſt delicate ſenſibility.</p>

               <p>My uncle ſet out for Peterborough, in order to bring Mr. Deane with him to Selby-houſe. Poor Mr. Deane had kept his chamber for a week before; yet had not let us know he was ill. He was forbid to go abroad for two days more; but was ſo overjoyed at what my uncle communicated to him, that he ſaid, he was not ſenſible of alling any-thing; and he would have come with my uncle next day, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor the doctor would permit it: But on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day he came.—Such joy!—Dear good man!—Such congratulation!—How conſiderable, to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do they all make that of their too-too much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged Harriet!</p>
               <p>They have been in conſultation often; but they have excluded me from ſome particular ones. I gueſs the ſubject; and beg of them, that I may not be <hi>too much</hi> obliged. What critical ſituations have I been in! When will they be at an end.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deane has written to Sir Charles. I am not to know the contents of his Letter. The hearts of us women, when we are urged to give way to a <hi>clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine</hi> and <hi>unequal</hi> addreſs, or when inclined to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſuch a one, are apt, and are pleaded with, to riſe againſt the notions of bargain and ſale. <hi>Smithfield bargains,</hi> you Londoners call them: But unjuſt is the odium, if preliminaries are neceſſary in all treaties of this nature. And ſurely previous ſtipulations are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably ſo among us changeable mortals, however promiſing the ſunſhine may be at our ſetting out on the journey of life; a journey too that will not be ended but with the life of one of the travellers.</p>
               <p>If I ever were to be tempted to wiſh for great

wealth, it would be for the ſake of Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon; that I might be a means of enlarging his power: Since I am convinced, that the neceſſities of every worthy perſon within the large circle of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, would be relieved, according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>My dear Emily!—Ah Lady G.! Was it <hi>poſſible</hi> for you to think, that my pity for the amiable Innocent ſhould not increaſe my love of her! I will give you leave <hi>indeed</hi> to deſpiſe me, if you ever find any-thing in my behaviour to Emily, let me be circumſtanced as I will, that ſhall ſhew an abatement of that tender affection which ever muſt warm my heart in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Whenever I can promiſe any-thing for myſelf, then ſhall Emily be a partaker of my felicity, in the way her own heart ſhall direct. I hope, for <hi>her own</hi> ſake, that the dear girl puts the matter right, when ſhe attributes her ſudden burſt of tears to the weakneſs of her ſpirits occaſioned by her mother's remorſe: But let me ſay one thing; It would grieve me as much as it did Sir Charles, in the Count of Belvedere's caſe, to ſtand in the way of any-body's happineſs. It is not, you ſee, your <hi>brother</hi>'s fault, that he is not the huſband of Lady Clementina: She wiſhes him to marry an Engliſhwoman.—Nor is even the hope of Lady Olivia fruſtrated by me. You know I always pitied her; and that before I knew, from Sir Charles's Letter to Signor Jeronymo, that ſhe thought kindly of me.—Lady Anne S.; Do you think, my dear, that worthy Lady could have hopes, were it <hi>not</hi> for me?—And could my Emily have any, were I out of the world?—No, ſurely: The very <hi>wardſhip,</hi> which he executes with ſo much indulgent goodneſs to her, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all ſuch hopes, conſiderable enough as his eſtate is, to anſwer a larger fortune than even Emily's. Were hers not half ſo much as it is, it would perhaps be more likely than now, that his generous mind might be diſpoſed in her favour, ſome years hence.</p>

Let me, however, tell you, that true ſiſterly pity overwhelmed my heart, when I firſt read that part of your Letter which ſo pathetically deſcribes her tender woe. Be the occaſion her Duty, or her Love, or owing to a mixture of both, I am charmed with her beautiful ſimplicity: I wept over that part of your Letter for half an hour (for I was by myſelf); and more than once I looked round and round me, wiſhing for the dear creature to be near me, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to claſp her to my boſom.</p>

               <p>

               <p>The Counteſs of D. has made my brother a viſit. I happened to be at his houſe. They were alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether near an hour. At going away, he attending her to her chair, ſhe took my hand; All, all my hopes are over, ſaid ſhe; but I will love Miſs Byron, for all that.

               <p>Lady W. and my ſiſter and I correſpond. I want you to know her, that you may love her as well as we do. Love-matches, my dear, are fooliſh things.

Violent Love on one ſide, is enough in conſcience, if the other be not a fool, or ungrateful: The <hi>Lover</hi> and <hi>Lovée</hi> make generally the happieſt couple.

               <p>A Thouſand thanks to you, my dear Lady G. for the favour of your laſt: You have re-aſſured me in it. I think I could not have been happy even in the affection of Sir Charles Grandiſon, were I to have found an abatement in the Love of his two ſiſters.

I have a Letter from the Counteſs of D <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This Letter does not appear.</note>. She is a moſt generous woman. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'She even congratulates me, on your brother's account, from the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that paſſed between him and her. She gives me the particulars of that converſation. Exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly flattering are they to my vanity.'</q> I <hi>muſt,</hi> my dear, be happy, if you continue to love me; and if I can know that Lady Clementina is not unhappy. This latter is a piece of Intelligence, neceſſary, I was going to ſay, for my tranquility: For can your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be happy, if that Lady be otherwiſe, whoſe griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malady could hold in ſuſpence his generous heart, when he had no proſpects at the time, of ever calling her his?</p>
               <p>I pity from my heart Lady Anne S. What a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is hopeleſs Love; the object ſo worthy, that every mouth is full of his praiſes! How many women will your brother's preference of <hi>one,</hi> be ſhe who ſhe will, diſappoint in their firſt Loves! Yet out of a hundred women, how few are there, who, for one reaſon, or other, have the man of their choice!</p>
               <p>I remember, you once ſaid, It was well that Love is not a paſſion abſolutely invincible: But, however, I do not, my dear, agree with you in your notions of all Love-matches. Love merely <hi>perſonal,</hi> that ſort of Love which commences between the year of fifteen and twenty; and when the extraordinary <hi>merit</hi> of the object is not the foundation of it; may, I believe, and perhaps <hi>generally</hi> ought to, be ſubdued. But Love that is founded on a merit that every-body acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges—I don't know what to ſay to the vincibility of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Love: For myſelf, I think it impoſſible that I ever could have been the wife of any man on earth, and given him my affection in ſo <hi>entire</hi> a manner, as ſhould, on reflexion, have acquitted my own heart—Tho' I hope I ſhould not have been wanting in my general duties—And why impoſſible? Becauſe I muſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1185400106:47"/>
have been conſcious, that there was another man whom I would have preferred to him. Let me add, that when proſpects were darkeſt with regard to my wiſhes, I promiſed my grandmamma and aunt, to make myſelf eaſy, at leaſt to endeavour to do ſo, if they never would propoſe to me the Earl of D. or any other man. They <hi>did</hi> promiſe me.</p>
               <p>Lady D. in her Letter to me, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'is ſo good as to claim the continuance of my correſpondence.'</q> Moſt ungrateful, and equally ſelf-denying, muſt I be, if I were to decline my part of it.</p>
               <p>I have a Letter from Sir Rowland Meredith <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This Letter appears not.</note>You, who have ſeen his former Letters to me, need not be ſhewn this. The ſame honeſt heart appears in them all; the ſame kind profeſſions of paternal love. You love Sir Rowland; and will be pleaſed to hear that his worthy nephew is likely to recover his health: I cannot, however, be joyful that they are reſolved to make me ſoon one more viſit. But you will ſee that Mr. Fowler thinks, if he could be allowed to viſit me once more, he ſhould, tho' hoping nothing from the viſit, be eaſier for the reſt of his life. A ſtrange way of thinking! ſuppoſing Love to be his diſtemper: Is it not?</p>
               <p>I have a Letter from Mr. Fenwick. He is arrived at his ſeat near Daventry. He has made a very ſhort excurſion abroad. He tells me in it, that he deſigns me a viſit on a particular ſubject. If it be, as I ſuſpect, to engage my intereſt with my Lucy, he ſhall <hi>not</hi> have her: He is not worthy of her.</p>
               <p>The friendſhip and favour of Lady W. is one of the great felicities which ſeem to offer to bleſs my future lot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greville is the moſt perſevering, as well as moſt audacious of men. As other men endeavour to gain a woman's affections by politeneſs; he makes pride, ill-nature, and impetuoſity, the proofs of his Love;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1185400106:48"/>
and thinks himſelf ill uſed, eſpecially ſince his large acquiſition of fortune, that they are not accepted as ſuch. He has obliged Mr. Deane to hear his pleas; and preſumed to hope for his favour. Mr. Deane frankly told him, that his intereſt lay quite another way. He then inſolently threatened with deſtruction, the man, be he who he will, that ſhall ſtand in his way. He doubts not, he ſays, but Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon is the man deſigned: But if ſo <hi>cool</hi> a Lover is to be encouraged againſt ſo <hi>ſervent</hi> a one as himſelf, he is miſtaken in all his notions of womens conduct and judgments in Love-matters. A <hi>diſcrect</hi> Lover, he ſays, is an unnatural character: Women, the odious wretch ſays, love to be devoured (Is he not an odious wretch?) and if Miſs Byron can content herſelf with another woman's <hi>leavings,</hi> for that, he ſays, he is well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed is the caſe, he knows what he ſhall think of her ſpirit. And then he threw out, as uſual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on our Sex, which had malice in them.</p>
               <p>This man's threats diſturb me. God grant that your brother may not meet with any more embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſments from inſolent men, on my account!</p>
               <p>If theſe men, this Greville in particular, would let me be at peace, I ſhould be better, I believe, in my health: But Lady Frampton is his advocate, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He watches my footſteps, and, in every viſit I make, throws himſelf in the way: And on Sundays he is always ready with his officious hand, as I alight to enter the church, and to lead me back to my uncle's coach. My uncle cannot affront him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not be affronted by him. He rallies off, with an intrepidity that never was exceeded, all that my aunt ſays to him. I repulſe him with anger every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where but in a place ſo public, and ſo ſacred. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs my devotion, with his ſtaring eyes, always fixed on our pew; which draw every one's after them. He has the aſſurance, when he intrudes himſelf into my company, to laugh off my anger; telling me,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1185400106:49"/>
that it is what he has long wiſhed for; and that now he is ſo much uſed to it, that he can live on my frowns, and cannot ſupport life without them. He plainly tells me, that Mr. Fenwick's arrival from abroad, and another certain perſon's alſo, are the occaſion of his reſumed ſedulity.</p>
               <p>Every-body about us, in ſhort, is intereſted for or againſt him. He makes me appear coy and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. He—But no more of this bold man. Would to Heaven that ſome one of thoſe who like ſuch, would relieve me from him!</p>
               <p>Viſiters, and the poſt, oblige me, ſooner than I otherwiſe ſhould, to conclude myſelf, my dear Lady G.</p>

As to the young Lady—I ſay nothing of her—Yet how ſhall I forbear—O Sir, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me! ſhe will dignify your choice. Her duty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1185400106:50"/>
and her inclination through every relation of life, were never divided.</p>
               <p>Excuſe me, Sir—No parent was ever more fond of his child than I have been, from her infancy, of this my daughter by adoption. Hence, Sir, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on this occaſion, as my affection I will ſay for the whole family deſerves, I take upon me to acquaint you, before any further ſteps are taken, what our dear child's fortune will be: For it has been always my notion, that a young gentleman, in ſuch a caſe, ſhould, the moment he offers himſelf, if his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals are acceptable, be ſpared the <hi>indelicacy</hi> of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions as to fortune. We know, Sir, yours is great: But as your ſpirit is princely, you ought to have ſomething worthy of your own fortune with a wife. But here, alas! we muſt fail, I doubt; at leaſt, in hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Byron was one of the beſt of men; his Lady a moſt excellent woman: There never was a happier pair. Both had reaſon to boaſt of their anceſtry, His eſtate was upwards of Four thouſand pounds a year; but it was entailed, and, in failure of male heirs, was to deſcend to a ſecond branch of the family which had made itſelf the more unworthy of it, by ſettling in a foreign country, renouncing, as I may ſay, its own Mr. Byron died a young man, and left his Lady <hi>enſient;</hi> but grief for loſing him, occaſioned firſt her miſcarriage, and then her death; and the eſtate followed the name. Hence, be pleaſed to know, that Miſs Byron's fortune, in her own right is no more than between Thirteen and Fourteen thouſand pounds. It is chiefly in the funds. It has been called 15,000<hi>l.</hi> but it is not much more than thirteen. Her grandmother's jointure is between 4 and 500<hi>l.</hi> a year. We none of us wiſh to ſee my god-daughter in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it: She herſelf leaſt of all. Mrs. Shirley is called, by every one that knows her, or ſpeaks of her, The ornament of old age. Her husband, an
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1185400106:51"/>
excellent man, deſired her to live always in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe, and in the hoſpitable way he had ever kept up, if what he left her would ſupport her in it. She has been longer ſpared to the prayers of her friends, and to thoſe of the poor, than was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; for ſhe is but infirm in health. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can do but little towards the increaſe of her child's fortune. But Shirley-manor is a fine old ſeat, Sir!—And there is timber upon the eſtate, which wants but ten years growth, and will be felled to good account. Mr. Selby is well in the world. He propoſes, as a token of his love, to add 3000<hi>l,</hi> in hand to his niece's fortune; and by his will, ſomething very conſiderable, farther expectant on his Lady's death; who being Miſs Byron's aunt, by the father's ſide, intends by her will to do very handſomely for her.—By the way, my dear Sir, be aſſured, that what I write is abſolutely unknown to Miſs Byron.</p>
               <p>There <hi>is</hi> a man who loves her as he loves himſelf. This man has laid by a ſum of money every year for the advancing her in marriage, beginning with the fifth year of her life, when it was ſeen what a hopeful child ſhe was: This has been putout at accumulated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and it amounts, in ſixteen years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to very near 8000<hi>l,</hi> This man, Sir will make up the eight thouſand, ten, to be paid on the day of marriage: And I hope, without promiſing for what this man will do further at his death, that you will accept of this Five or Six-and-twenty thouſand Pounds, as the chearfulleſt given and beſt-beſtowed money that ever was laid out.</p>
               <p>Let not theſe particulars pain you, Sir: They ſhould not; The ſubject is a neceſſary one. You, who ought to give way to the increaſe of that power which you ſo nobly uſe, muſt not be pained at this mention, once for all. Princes, Sir, are not above asking money of their people as free-gifts, on the marriage of their children. He that would be greater than a prince
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1185400106:52"/>
may, before he is aware, be leſs than a gentleman. Of this ten thouſand pounds, Eight is Miſs Byron's due, as ſhe is likely to be ſo happy with all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; elſe it would not: For that was the man's <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> condition; and the ſum, or the deſignation of it, was till this day only known to himſelf.</p>
               <p>As to ſettlements in return, I would have acted the lawyer, but the <hi>honeſt</hi> lawyer, with you, Sir, and made demands of you; but Mr. and Mrs Selby, and Mrs. Shirley, unanimouſly declare, that you ſhall not be preſcribed to in this caſe. Were you not Sir Charles Grandiſon? was the queſtion. I was againſt leaving it to you, for that <hi>very</hi> reaſon. It will be, ſaid I, to provoke ſuch a man as Sir Charles to do too much. Moſt other men ought to be ſpurred; but <hi>this</hi> muſt be held in. But, however, I acquieſced; and the more eaſily, becauſe I expect that the deeds ſhall paſs through my hands; and I will take care that you ſhall not, in order to give a proof of Love where it is not wanted, exert an inadequate genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters I thought it was abſolutely neceſſary to apprize you of: You will have the goodneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any imperfections in my manner of writing. There are none in my heart, when I aſſure you, that no man breathing can more reſpect you, than, Sir.</p>

               <p>YOU know not, my dear Mr. Deane upon what an unthankful man you would beſtow your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. I pretend not to be above complying with the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1185400106:53"/>
laudable cuſtoms of the world. Princes are examples to themſelves. I have always, in things indifferent, been willing to take the world as I find it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to it.</p>
               <p>To ſay Miſs Byron is a treaſure in herſelf, is what every man would ſay, who has the honour to know her: Yet I would not, in a vain oſtentation, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a man and his wife is one, make a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my affection by reſigning or giving from her her natural right; eſpecially as there is no one of her family that wants to be benefited by ſuch gifts or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations. But then I will not allow, that any of her friends ſhall part with what is theirs, to ſupply—What? A <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> deficiency in her fortune. And by <hi>whom,</hi> as implied by you, ſuppoſed a deficiency?—By me; and it is left to me to <hi>confirm</hi> the imputation by my acceptance of the addition ſo generouſly, as to the <hi>intention,</hi> offered. Had I incumbrances on my eſtate, which, undiſcharged, would involve in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the woman I love; I know not what, for <hi>her</hi> ſake, I might be tempted to do. But avarice only can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a man who wants it not to accept of the bounty of a Lady's friends, in their life-time eſpecially—When thoſe friends are not either father or mother; one of them not a relation by blood, tho' he is by a nearer tye, that of Love: And it is not the fortune which the Lady poſſeſſes, in her own right, an ample one?</p>
               <p>I am as rich as I wiſh to be, my dear Mr. Deane. Were my income leſs, I would live within it; were it more, it would increaſe my duties. Permit me, my good Sir to ask, Has the MAN, as you call him (and a MAN indeed he appears to me to be) who intends to make ſo noble a preſent to a ſtranger, no relations, no friends, who would have reaſon to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unkindly treated, if he gave from them ſuch a large portion of his fortune?</p>
               <p>I would not be thought romantic; neither aim I at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1185400106:54"/>
oſtentation. I would be as glad to <hi>follow,</hi> as to <hi>ſet,</hi> a good example. Can I have a nobler, if Miſs Byron honours me with her hand, than ſhe, in <hi>that</hi> caſe, will give in preferring me to the Earl of D. a worthy man, with a much more ſplendid fortune than mine? Believe me, my dear Mr. Deane, it would, on an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo happy, be a reſtraint to my own joy before friends ſo kindly contributing to the increaſe of her fortune, leſt they ſhould imagine that their generoſity on the occaſion, was one of the motives of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to her for her goodneſs to me,</p>
               <p>You tell me, that Miſs Byron knows nothing of your propoſals: I beſeech you, let her <hi>not</hi> know any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them: Abaſe not ſo much, in her eye, the man who preſumes on her favour for the happineſs of the reſt of his life, by ſuppoſing <hi>(Your</hi> ſuppoſition, Sir, may have weight with <hi>her)</hi> he could value her the more for ſuch an addition to her fortune. No, Sir: Let Miſs Byron (ſatisfied with the conſciouſneſs of a worth which all the world acknowleges) in one of the moſt ſolemn events of her life look round among her congratulating friends with that modeſt confidence which the ſenſe of laying a high obligation on a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured object gives to diffident merit; and which the receiving of favours from all her friends, as if to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a ſuppoſed defective worth, muſt either abate; or, if it do not, make her think leſs of the intereſted man, who could ſubmit to owe ſuch obligations.</p>
               <p>If theſe friendly expoſtulations conclude againſt the offer of your <hi>generous friend,</hi> they equally do ſo againſt that of Mr. Selby. Were that Gentleman and his Lady the <hi>parents</hi> of Miſs Byron, the caſe would be different: But Miſs Byron's fortune is an <hi>aſcertained</hi> one; and Mr. Selby has relations who ſtand in an equal degree of conſanguinity to him, and who are all intitled, by their worthineſs, to his favour. My beſt reſpects and thanks are however due; and I beg you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1185400106:55"/>
will make my acknowledgments accordingly, as well to your <hi>worthy friend,</hi> as to Mr. Selby.</p>
               <p>I take the liberty to ſend you down the rent-roll of my Engliſh eſtate. Determine for me as you pleaſe, my deareſt Mr. Deane. Only take this caution—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front me not a ſecond time; but let the ſettlements be ſuch, as may be fully anſwerable to my fortune; altho', in the common methods of calculation, it may exceed that of the dear Lady That you may be the better judge of this, you will find a brief particular of my Iriſh Eſtate, ſubjoined to the other.</p>
               <p>I was intending, when I received yours, to do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the honour of a viſit to Selby-houſe. I am im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to throw myſelf at the feet of my dear Miſs Byron, and to commend myſelf to the favour of Mr. and Mrs. Selby, and every one of a family I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by their characters, as well as by their relation to Miſs Byron, to revere and love. But as you ſeem to chooſe that the requiſite preliminaries ſhould be firſt adjuſted by pen and ink, I ſubmit, tho' with reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to that courſe; but with the leſs, as I may, in the interim, receive Letters from abroad, which, tho' they can now make no alteration with regard to the treaty ſo happily begun, may give me an opportunity of laying the whole ſtate of my affairs before Miſs Byron; by which means ſhe will be enabled to form a judgment of them, and of the heart of, dear Sir,</p>

               <p>WELL did you obſerve, my dear that we may be very differently affected by the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, when judged of at a diſtance, and near. May I, in the preſent ſituation, preſume to ſay <hi>near?</hi> Mr. Deane has entered into the particulars of my fortune with Sir Charles. The Letter was not ſhewn me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it went; and I was not permitted to ſee the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it till your brother's anſwer came; and then they ſhewed me both.</p>
               <p>O my dear Mr. Deane! my ever-kind uncle and aunt Selby! Was not your Harriet Byron too much obliged to you before?—As to your brother, What, my love, ſhall I do with my <hi>pride?</hi> I did not know I had ſo much of that bad quality. My poverty, my dear, has added to my pride. Were my fortune ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of your brother, I am ſure I ſhould not be ſo proud as I now, on this occaſion, find I am. How generouſly does he decline accepting the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was offered to give me more conſideration with him (as kindly intended by them)! What can I ſay to him, but that his heart, ſtill prouder than my own, and more generous than that of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon breathing, will not permit me to owe uncommon obligations to any but himſelf?</p>
               <p>He deſires that I may not know any-thing of this tranſaction: But they thought the communication would give me pleaſure. However, they wiſh me not to take notice to him, when he viſits Selby-houſe, that they have communicated it to me. If I did, I ſhould think myſelf obliged to manifeſt a gratitude that would embarraſs me, in my preſent ſituation, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1185400106:57"/>
ſeem to fetter the freedom of my will. Millions of obligations ſhould not bribe me to give up even a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my heart, to a man to whom I could not give the whole. Your brother, my dear, is in poſſeſſion of the whole.</p>
               <p>You know that I hate affectation: But muſt I not have great abatements in my proſpects of happineſs, becauſe of Lady Clementina? And muſt they not be ſtill greater, ſhould ſhe be unhappy, ſhould ſhe repent of the reſolution ſhe ſo nobly took, for his ſaying, that whatever be the contents of his next Letters from Italy, they can make no alteration with regard to the treaty begun with us?—Dear, dear Clementina! moſt excellent of women! Can I bear to ſtand in the way of your happineſs?—I cannot—<hi>My</hi> life, any more than yours, may not be a long one; and I will not fully the whiteneſs of it (Pardon my vanity; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to call it ſo, on retroſpecting it, regarding my <hi>intentions</hi> only) by giving way to an act of injuſtice, tho' it were to obtain for me the whole heart of the man I love.</p>
               <p>Yet think you, my dear, that I am not mortified? <q rend="inline margQuotes">'How can I look round upon my congratulating friends, in one of the moſt ſolemn events of my life, with that modeſt confidence which the ſenſe of laying an obligation on a favoured object'</q> (You know in whoſe generous words I expreſs myſelf) <q rend="inline">'gives to diffident merit?'</q> O my Charlotte! I am <hi>afraid</hi> of your brother! How ſhall I look up to him, when I next ſee him?—But I will give way to this new gueſt, my <hi>pride.</hi> What other way have I?—Will you forgive me, if I try to look upon your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's generoſity to me and my friends, in declining ſo greatly their offers, as a bribe to make me ſit down ſatisfied with half, nay, <hi>not</hi> half, a heart?—And now will you not ſay, that I am proud indeed? But his is the moſt delicate of human minds; And ſhall not the woman pretend to ſome delicacy who has looked up to him?</p>

My brother will ſoon be with you, I believe. I wiſh Dr. Bartlet were in town: One ſhould then know ſomething of the motions of my brother—Not that he is reſerved, neither. But he is ſo much engaged, that I go four times to St. James's-Square, and perhaps do not ſee him once. My Lord had the aſſurance to ſay, but yeſterday, that I was there more than at home. He is very impertinent: I believe he has taken up my ſaucineſs. I laid it down, and thought to reſume it occaſionally; but when I came to look for it, behold! it was gone!—But I hope, if he has it not, it is only miſlaid. I intend, if it come not ſoon to hand, to ſet the pariſh-crier to proclaim the loſs, with a reward for the finder. It might be the ruin of ſome indiſcreet woman, ſhould ſuch a one meet with it, and try to uſe it. Aunt Eleanor [There I remember myſelf: No more aunt

As a dinner was preparing for him, perhaps, my dear, he will dine in the very room he dined in at that time. The farmer had the curioſity to aſk
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1185400106:60"/>
who he was; and was anſwered by the moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous gentleman's ſervants he ever ſpoke to, that they had the honour to ſerve Sir Charles Grandiſon. And the farmer having ſaid he was of Northampton; one of them aſked him, How far Selby-houſe was from that town? The farmer was obliged to hurry home on his own affairs; and meeting my uncle with Mr. Deane, and my couſin James Selby, taking an airing on horſeback, told him the viſiter he was likely to have. My uncle inſtantly diſpatched his ſervant to us with the tidings, and that he was gone to meet him, in hopes of conducting him hither.</p>
                  <p>This news gave me ſo much emotion, being not well before, that my aunt adviſed me to retire to my cloſet, and endeavour to quiet my Spirits.</p>

Sir Charles is juſt arrived with a billet directed for my uncle Selby. My aunt opened it. It is dated from Stratford. The contents are, after compliments of enquiry of our healths, to acquaint my uncle, that he ſhall put up at the George at Northampton, this night; and hopes to be allowed to pay his compliments to us to-morrow morning, at breakfaſt: So he did not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> to give himſelf the conſequence, of which my capricious heart was ſo apprehenſive. Yet then, as if reſolved to find fault, Is not this a little too parading for his natural freedom? thought I: Or does he think we ſhould not be able to outlive our joyful ſurprize, if he gave us not notice of his arrival in theſe parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaw us?—O Clementina!—Goodneſs! Angel! What a meremortal, what a woman, doſt thou make the poor Harriet Byron appear in her own eyes! How apprehenſive of coming after thee! The ſenſe I have of my own littleneſs, will make me little, indeed!</p>
                  <p>Well, but I preſume, that if my uncle and Mr. Deane meet him, they will prevail on him to come hither this night: Yet I ſuppoſe he muſt be allowed to go to the propoſed inn afterwards.—But here, he is come!—Come, indeed!—My uncle in the chariot with him! My couſin and Mr. Deane, Sally tells me, juſt alighted. Sally adores Sir Charles Grandiſon—Begone, Sally. Thy emotions, fooliſh wench, add to thoſe of thy miſtreſs!—</p>
                  <p>THAT I might avoid the appearance of affectation, I was going down to welcome him when I met my uncle on the ſtairs. Niece Byron, ſaid he, you have not done <hi>juſtice</hi> to Sir Charles Grandiſon. I thought your <hi>Love-ſick heart</hi> (What words were theſe, my dear! and at that moment too!) muſt have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to him. He prevailed on me to go into his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. You may think yourſelf very happy. For fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles together did he talk of nobody but you. Let <hi>me</hi> go down with you: Let me preſent you to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1185400106:62"/>
I had before beſought my ſpirits to befriend me, but for one half-hour. Surely there is nothing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome as an unſeaſonable jeſt. <hi>Preſent me to him! Love-ſick heart!</hi> O my uncle! thought I. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proceed. I haſtened back to my cloſet, as much diſconcerted as a child could be, who, having taken pains to get its leſſon by heart, daſhed by a chiding countenance, forgot every ſyllable of it when it came to <hi>ſay</hi> it. You know, my dear, that I had not of ſome time been well. My ſpirits were weak, and joy was almoſt as painful to me as grief could have been.</p>
                  <p>My aunt came up—My love, why don't you come down?—What now! Why in tears?—You will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to the fineſt man I ever ſaw in my life, very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular!—Mr. Deane is in love with him: Your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin James—</p>
                  <p>Dear madam, I am already, when I make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons between him and myſelf, humbled enough with his excellencies. I did <hi>intend</hi> to avoid particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; but my uncle has quite diſconcerted me—Yet he always means well: I ought not to complain. I attend you, madam.</p>
                  <p>Can you, Lady G. forgive my pride, my petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance?</p>
                  <p>My aunt went down before me. Sir Charles haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to me, the moment I appeared, with an air of reſpectful love.</p>
                  <p>He took my hand, and bowing upon it, I rejoice to ſee my dear Miſs Byron; and to ſee her ſo well. How many ſufferers muſt there be, when you ſuffer!</p>
                  <p>I bid him welcome to England: I hope he heard me: I could not help ſpeaking low: He muſt obſerve my diſcompoſure. He led me to a ſeat, and ſat down by me, ſtill holding my hand. I withdrew it not preſently, left he ſhould think me preciſe: But, as there were ſo many perſons preſent, I thought it was free in Sir Grandiſon. Yet perhaps he could
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1185400106:63"/>
not well quit it, as I did not withdraw it; ſo that the fault might be rather in my paſſiveneſs, than in his forwardneſs.</p>
                  <p>However, I aſked my aunt afterwards, If his looks were not thoſe of a man aſſured of ſucceſs; as indeed he might be from my grandmother's Letter, and my ſilence to <hi>his.</hi> She ſaid, there was a manly freedom in his addreſs to me; but that it had ſuch a mixture of tenderneſs in it, that never, in <hi>her</hi> eyes, was freedom ſo becoming. While he was reſtrained by his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, added ſhe, no wonder that he treated you with reſpect only, as a <hi>Friend;</hi> but now he finds himſelf at liberty to addreſs you, his behaviour ought, as a <hi>Lover,</hi> to have juſt been what it was.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles led me into talk, by mentioning you and Lady L. your two Lords, and my Emily.</p>
                  <p>My uncle and aunt withdrew, and had ſome little canvaſſings, it ſeems, (All their canvaſſings are thoſe of aſſured Lovers) about the propriety of my uncle's invitation to Sir Charles to take up his reſidence, while he was in theſe parts, at Selby-houſe. My uncle, at coming in, had directed Sir Charles's ſervants to put up their horſes: But they, not having their maſter's orders to do ſo, held themſelves in readineſs to attend him; as they knew that Sir Charles had given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to his gentleman, Richard Saunders, who brought the billet to my uncle, to go back to North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, and provide apartments for him at the George inn there.</p>
                  <p>My aunt, who you know is a perfect judge of points of decorum, pleaded to my uncle, that it was too well known among our ſelect friends, by Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's means, that Sir Charles had never before made his addreſſes to me; and that therefore, tho' he was to be treated as a man whoſe alliance is conſidered as an honour to us; yet that ſome meaſures were to be kept, as to the <hi>look</hi> of the thing; and that the world might not conclude that I was to be won at his very
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1185400106:64"/>
firſt appearance; and the rather, as Mr. Greville's vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as well as virulence, was ſo well known.</p>
                  <p>My uncle was petulant. <hi>I,</hi> ſaid he, am always in the wrong: You women, never. He ran into all thoſe peculiarities of words, for which you have ſo often raillied him—His <hi>adſheart,</hi> his <hi>female ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> his <hi>What a pize,</hi> his hatred of <hi>ſhilly-ſhally's</hi> and <hi>fiddle-faddles,</hi> and the reſt of our <hi>female nonſenſes,</hi> as he calls them. He hoped to ſalute his niece, as Lady Grandiſon, in a fortnight: What a <hi>duce</hi> was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it could <hi>not</hi> be ſo, both ſides now of a mind?—He warned my aunt, and bid her warn me, againſt affectation, now the criſis was at hand. Sir Charles, he ſaid, would think meanly of us, if we were <hi>ſilly:</hi> And then came in another of his odd words: Sir Charles, he ſaid, had been ſo much already <hi>bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boozled,</hi> that he would not have patience with us: and <hi>therefore,</hi> and for all theſe <hi>reaſons,</hi> as he called them, he deſired that Sir Charles might not be ſuffered to go out of the houſe, and to an inn; and this as well for the <hi>propriety</hi> of the thing, as for the credit of his own invitation to him.</p>
                  <p>My aunt replied, that Sir Charles <hi>himſelf</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect delicacy from us. It was evident, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not (no doubt for the ſake of the world's eye) to reſide in the houſe with <hi>me</hi> on his <hi>firſt</hi> viſit, by his having ordered his ſervant who brought the billet, to take apartments for him at Northampton, even not deſigning to viſit us over-night, had he not been met by Mr. Deane and himſelf, and <hi>perſuaded</hi> to come. In ſhort, my dear, ſaid my aunt, I am as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about Sir Charles's <hi>own</hi> opinion of our conduct, as for that of the world: Yet you know, that every genteel family around us expected examples from us, and Harriet. If Sir Charles is not with us, the oftener he viſits us, the more reſpectful it will be conſtrued. I hope he will live with us all day, and every day: But indeed it muſt be as a viſiter, not as an inmate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1185400106:65"/>
Why then bring me off ſome-how, that I may not ſeem the blunderer you are always making me by your <hi>documents</hi>—Will you do <hi>that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When my uncle and aunt came in, they found Sir Charles, and Dr. Deane, and me, talking. Our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was, the happineſs of Lord and Lady W. and the whole Mansfield family, with whom Mr. Deane, who began the diſcourſe, is well acquainted. Sir Charles aroſe, at their entrance. The night draws on, ſaid he—I will do myſelf the honour of attending you, madam, and this happy family, at tea in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—My good Mr. Selby, I had a deſign upon you, and Mr. Deane, and upon you, young gentleman (to my couſin James) as I told you on the road; but it is now too late. Adieu, till to-morrow.—He bowed to each, to me profoundly, kiſſing my hand, and went to his chariot.</p>
                  <p>My uncle whiſpered my aunt, as we all attended him to that door of the hall which leads into the court-yard, to invite him to ſtay. Hang punctilio! he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>My aunt wanted to ſpeak to Sir Charles; yet, ſhe owned, ſhe knew not what to ſay: Such a conſcious aukwardneſs had indeed poſſeſſion of us both, as made us uneaſy: We thought all was not right; yet knew not that we were wrong. But when Sir Charles's chariot drove away with him, and we took our ſeats, and ſupper was talked of, we all of us ſhewed diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and my uncle was quite out of humour. He would give a thouſand pounds, he ſaid, with all his heart and ſoul, to find in the morning, Sir Charles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coming hither to breakfaſt, had ſet out on his return to London.</p>
                  <p>For my part, Lady G. I could not bear theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations. I begged to be excuſed ſitting down to ſupper. I was not well; and this odd ſituation added <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> to my indiſpoſition: A diſſatisfaction, that I find will mingle with our higheſt enjoyments: Nor
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1185400106:66"/>
were the beloved company I left, happier. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed the matter, with ſo much good-natured earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the ſupper was taken away, as it was brought, at a late hour.</p>
                  <p>What, my dear Lady G. in your opinion, ſhould we have done? Were we right, or were we wrong? Over-delicacy, as I have heard obſerved, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicacy. You, my dear, your Lord, our Emily, and Dr. Bartlett, all ſtanding in ſo well-known a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of relation to Sir Charles Grandiſon, were our moſt welcome gueſts: And was not the brother to be received with equal warmth of reſpect?—O no! Cuſtom, it ſeems, tyrant cuſtom, and the apprehended opinion of the world obliged us (eſpecially as ſo much buſtle had been made about me, by men ſo bold, ſo impetuous) to ſhew him—Shew him what?—In effect, that we had expectations upon him, which we could not have upon the brother and ſiſter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe we hoped he would be more <hi>near,</hi> we were to keep him at the <hi>greater</hi> diſtance!—What an indirect acknowledgment was this in his favour, were there room for him to doubt! Which, however, there could not be. What would I give, ſaid my aunt to me, this moment, to know <hi>his</hi> thoughts of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!</p>
                  <p>Lucy and Nancy will be here at dinner: ſo will my grandmamma. She has, with her uſual enquiries after my health, congratulated me by this line, ſealed up.</p>

                  <p>Here, in her cloſet, again, is your poor Harriet. Surely the determined ſingle ſtate is the happieſt of lives, to young women, who have the greatneſs of mind to be above valuing the admiration and flatteries of the other Sex.

again my paſſive hand, in preſence of half a ſcore of my friends, Whether I was <hi>greatly</hi> uneaſy becauſe of his abſence?</p>
                  <p>But let me try to <hi>excuſe</hi> him. May he not have <hi>forfot</hi> his engagement? May he not have <hi>over ſlept</hi> himſelf?—Some <hi>agreeable dream</hi> of the Bologna fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily—I am offended at him—Did he learn this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in Italy?—O no, no, Lady G.!</p>
                  <p>I now cannot help looking back for <hi>other</hi> faults in him, with regard to me. My memory is not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo malicious, as I would have it. But do you think every man, in the like ſituation, would have ſtopt at Stratford to dine by himſelf?—Not but your brother can be very happy in his <hi>own</hi> company. If <hi>he</hi> cannot, who can? But, as to that, his horſes might require reſt, as well as baiting: One knows not in how ſhort a time he might have proſecuted his journey ſo far. He who will not ſuffer the nobleſt of all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to be deprived of an ornament, would be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to them in greater inſtances. He ſays, that he cannot bear indignity from ſuperiors. Neither can we. In that light he appears to us. But why ſo?—My heart, Lady G. begins to ſwell I aſſure you; and it it twice as big as it was laſt night.</p>
                  <p>My uncle before I came up, ſat with his watch in his hand, from half an hour after nine, till near ten, telling the minutes as they crept. Mr. Deane often looked at me, and at my aunt, as if to ſee how we bore it. I bluſhed; looked ſilly, as if your brother's faults were mine.—Over in a fortnight! cried my uncle; <hi>ads-heart,</hi> I believe it will be half a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall come to the queſtion. But Sir Charles, to be ſure, is offended. Your confounded female niceties!</p>
                  <p>My heart roſe—Let him, if he <hi>dare,</hi> thought the proud Harriet.</p>
                  <p>God grant, added my uncle, that he may be gone up to town again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Perhaps, ſaid Mr. Deane, he is gone, by miſtake, to Mrs. Shirley's.</p>
                  <p>We then endeavoured to recollect the words of his ſelf-invitation hither. My couſin James propoſed to take horſe, and go to Northampton, to inform himſelf of the occaſion of his not coming: Some misfortune, perhaps.</p>
                  <p>Had he not ſervants, my aunt aſked, one of whom he might have ſent?—Shall my couſin Jemmy go, however, Harriet, ſaid ſhe?</p>
                  <p>No, indeed, anſwered I, with an air of anger—My teazing uncle broke out into a loud laugh, which however had more of a vexedneſs than mirth in it.—He is certainly gone to London, Harriet! <hi>Juſt</hi> as I ſaid, dame Selby!—Certainly tearing up the road; his very horſes reſenting, for their maſter, your <hi>ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</hi> You'll hear from him next, at London, my life for yours, niece—Hah, hah, hah! What will your <hi>grandmamma</hi> ſay, by-and-by? Lucy, Nancy, how will <hi>they</hi> ſtare! Laſt night's ſupper, and this day's din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will be alike ſerved in, and taken away.</p>
                  <p>I could not ſtand all this: I aroſe from my ſeat. Are you not unkind, Sir? ſaid I to my uncle, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſying to him however; and, deſiring his and Mr. Deane's excuſe, quitted the breakfaſting parlour. Teazing man! ſaid my aunt. Mr. Deane alſo blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; gently, however; for every-body acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his good heart, and natural good temper.</p>
                  <p>My aunt followed me to the door; and taking my hand, Harriet, ſaid ſhe, ſpeaking low, Not Sir Charles Grandiſon himſelf ſhall call you his, if he is capable of treating you with the leaſt indifference. I underſtand not this, added ſhe: He cannot ſurely be offended.—I hope all will be cleared up before your grandmamma comes: She will be very jealous of the honour of her girl.</p>
                  <p>I anſwered not: I could not anſwer: But haſtened up to my place of refuge; and, after wiping from my

                  <p>We made a very ſhort breakfaſting; and looked upon one another as people who would have helped themſelves, if they could. Mr. Deane, however, would engage, he ſaid, that we ſhould be fatisfied with Sir Charles's excuſes, when we came to hear them.</p>
                  <p>But, my dear, this man, this viſiter, whoever he is, muſt be of <hi>prodigious</hi> importance, to detain him, from an engagement that I had hoped might have been thought a <hi>firſt</hi> engagement;—yet owned to be <hi>impertinent.</hi> And muſt not the accident be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, that ſhould bring ſuch a one, a ſtranger as Sir Charles is, in his way? Yet this might very well happen, my uncle obſerves, at an <hi>inn,</hi> whither we thought fit to ſend him.</p>
                  <p>Now I think of it, I was ſtrangely diſturbed laſt night in my imperfect ſlumbers: Something, I thought, was to happen to prevent me ever being his. But hence, Recollection! I chaſe thee from me. Yet when realities diſturb, ſhadows will officiouſly obtrude on the buſy imagination <hi>as</hi> realities.</p>

               <p>I Am ſtolen up again, to tell you how it is. I never will be petulant again—Dear Sir, forgive me! How wicked in us all, but my grandmamma and Mr. Deane, to blame a man who cannot be guilty of a wilful fault! The fault is all my aunt's and mine—Was my aunt ever in fault before?</p>
               <p>We were all together when he entered. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to us, in that noble manner, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages every-body in his favour, at firſt ſight. How, ſaid he, bowing to every one, have I ſuffered, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindered, by an unhappy man, from doing myſelf the honour of attending you ſooner!</p>
               <p>You ſee, my dear, he made not apologies to <hi>me,</hi> as if he ſuppoſed me diſappointed by his abſence. I was afraid he would. I know I looked very grave.</p>
               <p>He then particularly addreſſed himſelf to each; to me firſt; next to my grandmamma; and taking one of her hands between both his, and bowing upon it, I rejoice to ſee you, madam, ſaid he—Your laſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will ever be remembered by me, with gratitude. I ſee you well, I hope. Your Miſs Byron will be well, if <hi>you</hi> are; and <hi>our</hi> joy, looking round him, will then be complete.</p>
               <p>She bowed her head, pleaſed with his compliment; ſo were my aunt, and Lucy, and Nancy. I was ſtill a little ſullen; otherwiſe I ſhould have been pleaſed too, that he made my health depend on that of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid he, turning to my aunt, I am afraid I made you wait for me at breakfaſt. A moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent viſiter! He put me out of humour. I dared not to let you and <hi>yours</hi> (looking at me) ſee, how
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1185400106:73"/>
much I <hi>could</hi> be out of humour. I am naturally paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate: But paſſion is ſo ugly, ſo deforming a thing, that, if I can help it, I will never, by thoſe I love, be ſeen in it.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry, Sir, ſaid my aunt, you meet with any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſturb you.</p>
               <p>My uncle's ſpirit had not come down: He, too, was ſullen in behalf of the punctilio of the girl whom he honours with his jealous Love. How, how, is that, Sir Charles? ſaid he.</p>
               <p>My aunt preſented Lucy and Nancy to him: But before ſhe could name either—Miſs Selby, ſaid he, Miſs Byron's <hi>own</hi> Lucy, I am ſure. Miſs Nancy Selby!—I know your characters, Ladies, ſaluting each, and I know the intereſt you have in Miſs Byron.—Honour me with <hi>your</hi> approbation, and that will be to give me hope of <hi>hers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He then turning to my uncle and Mr. Deane, and taking a hand of each—My dear Mr. Deane, ſmiles upon me, ſaid he—But Mr. Selby looks grave.—</p>
               <p>At-<hi>ten</hi> -tive only Sir Charles, to the <hi>cauſe</hi> of your being put out of humour, that's all—</p>
               <p>The cauſe, Mr. Selby!—Know, then, I met with a man at my inn, who would force himſelf upon me: Do you know I am a qurrelſome man? He was ſo hardy as to declare, that he had pretenſions to a Lady in this company, which he was determined to aſſert.</p>
               <p>O that Greville! ſaid my aunt—</p>
               <p>I was ready to ſink. Wretched Harriet! thought I, at the inſtant: Am I to be for ever the occaſion of embroiling this excellent man!</p>
               <p>My grandmamma, Mr. Deane, my uncle, my couſin James, all ſpoke at once—Dear, dear Sir Charles, ſaid one, ſaid another—How, how, was it?</p>
               <p>Both ſafe! Both unhurt! No more of the raſh man, at this time. He is to be pitied. He loves Miſs Byron to diſtraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1185400106:74"/>
This comes of nicety! whiſpered my uncle, to my aunt: <hi>fooliſh</hi> nicety!—To let ſuch a man as this go to an inn!—Inhoſpitable, vile punctilio! Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir Charles—Dear Sir, forgive me! I <hi>was</hi> a little ſerious, that I muſt own [I pulled my uncle by the ſleeve, fearing he would ſay too much by way of atonement for his ſeriouſneſs]:—I, I, I, <hi>was</hi> a little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, I muſt own [I, I, I, was afraid ſomething was the matter—turned he off, what he was going to ſay—too freely, ſhall I ſay?—Hardly ſo! had he ſaid what he would; tho' habitual punctilio made me almoſt involuntarily twitch my uncle by the ſleeve: for my heart would have directed my lips to utter the kindeſt things; but my concern was too great to allow them to obey it.</p>
               <p>I muſt go down, Lady G.—I am enquired after; 'tis juſt dinner-time—Let me only add, that Sir Charles waved further talk of the affair between him and that wretch, while I ſtaid—perhaps they have got it out of him ſince I came up.</p>
               <p>I SHALL be <hi>ſo</hi> proud, my dear!—a thouſand fine things he has ſaid of your Harriet, in her little ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence!—Lucy, Nancy, call him THE man: And every one looks upon him as if there were not one ſoul in company but <hi>he</hi> and themſelves. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma's eyes are complained of as weak, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour her joyful emotion: But, thank God, her eyes are not weak. And he is ſo reſpectfully tender to her, that had he not my heart before, he would have won it now.</p>
               <p>He had again waved the relation of the inſult he met with: Mr. Greville himſelf, he ſuppoſed, would give it. He had a mind to ſee if the gentleman, by his report of it, was a gentleman. Thank God, ſaid he, I have not hurt a man who boaſts of his paſſion for Miſs Byron; and of his neighbourhood to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1185400106:75"/>
OUR places were choſen for us at table: Sir Charles's next me. Cannot I be too minute, do you ſay?—So eaſy, ſo free, ſo polite; ſomething ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily addreſſed occaſionally to each perſon at table—O my dear! I am abundantly kept in countenance; for every one loves him, as well as I. You have been pleaſed to take very favourable notice of our ſervants—They <hi>are</hi> good, and ſenſible. What reverence for him, and joy for their young miſtreſs's ſake, ſhone in their countenances as they attended!</p>
               <p>My couſin James, who has never been out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was very curious to be informed of the manners, cuſtoms, diverſions, of the people in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries—Italy, in particular—Ah the dear Clementina! What abatement from recollection! <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The ſighing heart,'</q> I remember he ſays, in one of his Letters to Dr. Bartlett, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'will remind us of imperfection, in the higheſt of our enjoyments.</q>' And he adds, <q rend="inline">'It is fit it ſhould be ſo.'</q> And on what occaſion did he write this?—O my Charlotte, <hi>I</hi> was the occaſion! It was in kind remembrance of me! He could not, at that time, have ſo written, had he been indifferent, even then, to your Harriet.</p>
               <p>I am ſo apprehenſive of my uncle's after remarks, that I am half-afraid to look at Sir Charles: And he muſt by-and-by return to this wicked inn—They wonder at my frequent abſences. It is to oblige you, Lady G. and indeed myſelf: There is vaſt pleaſure in communicating one's pleaſures to a friend who inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts herſelf, as you do, in one's deareſt concerns.</p>
               <p>YOU know and admire my grandmamma's chearful compliances with the innocent diverſions of youth: She made Lucy give us a leſſon on the harpſichord, on purpoſe, I ſaw, to draw me in. We both obeyed.</p>
               <p>I was once a little out in an Italian ſong. In what a ſweet manner did he put me in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> touching the keys
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1185400106:76"/>
himſelf, for a minute or two. Every one wiſhed him to proceed; but he gave up to me, in ſo polite a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we all were ſatisfied with his excuſes.</p>
               <p>My poor couſin Jemmy is on a ſudden very earneſt to go abroad; as if, ſilly youth, travelling would make him a Sir Charles Grandiſon!</p>
               <p>I have juſt aſked your brother, If all is over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Greville and him? He ſays, He hopes and believes ſo. God ſend it may; or I ſhall hate that Greville!</p>
               <p>MY uncle, Mr. Deane, and my couſin James, were too much taken with Sir Charles, to think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, as it might have been expected they would; and after ſome general converſation, that ſucceeded our playing, Sir Charles drew his chair between my grandmamma and aunt, and taking my grandmam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's hand, May I not be allowed a quarter of an hour's converſation with Miſs Byron in your preſence, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? ſaid he, ſpeaking low. We have indeed only friends and relations preſent: But it will be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, I believe, to the dear Lady, that what I have to ſay to her, and to you, may be rather reported <hi>to</hi> the gentlemen, than heard <hi>by</hi> them.</p>
               <p>By all means, Sir Charles, ſaid my grandmamma. Then whiſpering to my aunt, No man in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <hi>thinks,</hi> but Sir Charles. Excuſe me my dear.</p>
               <p>The moment Sir Charles applied himſelf in this particular manner to them, my heart, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſaid, was at my mouth. I aroſe, and withdrew to the cedar-parlour, followed by Lucy and Nancy. The gentlemen, ſeeming to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, withdrew likewiſe, to another apartment. My aunt came to me—Love!—But ah! my dear, how you tremble!—You muſt come with <hi>me,</hi> And then ſhe told me what he had ſaid to my grandmamma and her.</p>
               <p>I have no courage—None at all, ſaid I, If appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1185400106:77"/>
if timidy, be ſigns of Love, I have them all. Sir Charles Grandiſon has not one.</p>
               <p>Nay, my dear, ſaid Lucy, impute not to him want of reſpect, I beſeech you.—<hi>Reſpect,</hi> my Lucy! What a poor word!—Had I only reſpect for him, we ſhould be nearer an equality.—Has he ſaid any-thing of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Clementina?</p>
               <p>Don't be ſilly, Harriet, ſaid my aunt. You uſed to be—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſed to be!</hi>—Ah, madam I Sir Charles's heart, at <hi>beſt,</hi> a divided heart! I never had a trial till now.</p>
               <p>I tell you all my foibles, Lady G.</p>
               <p>My aunt led me in to Sir Charles and my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma. He met me at my entrance into the room, and in the moſt engaging manner, my aunt having taken her ſeat, conducted me to a chair which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be vacant between her and my grandmother. He took no notice of my emotion, and I the ſooner recovered myſelf, and ſtill the ſooner, as he himſelf ſeemed to be in ſome little confuſion. However, he ſat down, and with a manly, yet reſpectful air, his voice gaining ſtrength as he proceeded, thus deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf.</p>
               <p>Never, Ladies, was man more particularly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced than he before you. You know my ſtory: You know what once were the difficulties of my ſituation with a family that I muſt ever reſpect; with a Lady of it whom I muſt ever revere: And you, madam (to my grandmamma) have had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſignify to me, in a moſt engaging manner, that Miſs Byron has added to the innumerable inſtances which ſhe has given me of her true greatneſs of mind, a <hi>kind,</hi> and even a <hi>friendly</hi> concern for a Lady who is the Miſs Byron of Italy. I aſk not excuſe for the compariſon. The heart of the man before you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam (to me) in ſincerity and frankneſs emulates your own.—</p>
               <p>You want not excuſe, Sir, ſaid my grandmamma—
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1185400106:78"/>
We all reverence Lady Clementina: We admire her.</p>
               <p>He bowed to <hi>each</hi> of us; as my aunt and I looked I believe, aſſentingly to what my grandmamma ſaid. He proceeded:</p>
               <p>Yet in ſo particular a ſituation, altho' what I have to ſay, may, I preſume, be collected from what you know of my ſtory; and tho' my humble appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Miſs Byron for her favour, and to you, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for your intereſt with her, have not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; ſomething, however, may be neceſſary to be ſaid, in this audience, of the ſtate of my own heart, for the ſake of this dear Lady's delicacy, and yours. And I will deliver myſelf with all the truth and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which I think are required in treaties of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, equally with thoſe ſet on foot between nation and nation.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible to Beauty: But the beauty of perſon <hi>only,</hi> never yet had power over more than my eye; to which it gave a pleaſure like that which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the flowers of a gay parterre. Had <hi>not</hi> my heart been out of the reach of <hi>perſonal</hi> attractions, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf; and had I been my own maſter; Miſs Byron, in the firſt hour that I ſaw her (for her beauty ſuffered not by her diſtreſs) would have left me no other choice: But when I had the honour of converſing with her, I obſerved in her mind and behaviour that true dignity, delicacy, and noble frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I ever thought characteriſtic in the Sex, but never met with, in equal degree, but in <hi>one</hi> Lady. I ſoon found, that my admiration of her fine qualities was likely to lead me into a gentler, yet a more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable paſſion: For of the Lady abroad I then could have no reaſonable, at leaſt, no <hi>probable</hi> hope: Yet were there circumſtances between her and me, which I thought, in ſtrict juſtice, obliged me to attend the iſſue of certain events.</p>
               <p>I called myſelf therefore to account, and was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1185400106:79"/>
alarmed when I found that Miſs Byron's graces had ſtolen ſo imperceptibly on my heart, as already to have made an impreſſion on it too deep for my tranquillity. I determined therefore, in honour, in juſtice, to both Ladies, to endeavour to reſtrain a paſſion ſo new, yet likely to be ſo ſervent.</p>
               <p>I had avocations in town, while Miſs Byron was with my ſiſters in the country. Almoſt afraid of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf in her preſence, I purſued the <hi>more</hi> will-ingly thoſe avocations in perſon, when I could have managed ſome of them, perhaps, near as well by other hands. Compaſſion for the one Lady, becauſe of her calamity, might, at that time, I found, have been made to give way, <hi>could thoſe calamities have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,</hi> to Love for the other. Nor was it difficult for me to obſerve, that my ſiſters and Lord L. who knew nothing of my ſituation, would have choſen for a ſiſter the young Lady preſent, before every other woman.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, I will own to you, I was ready, from that ſelf-partiality and vanity which is too natural to men of vivacity and ſtrong hopes, to flatter myſelf, that I might, <hi>by my ſiſters intereſt,</hi> have made myſelf, <hi>not unacceptable</hi> to a Lady, who ſeemed to be wholly diſengaged in her affections: But I would not permit myſelf to dwell on ſuch hopes: Every look of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, every ſmile, which uſed to beam over that lovely countenance, I attributed to her natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and frankneſs of heart, and to that grateful ſpirit which made her over-rate a common ſervice that I had been ſo happy as to render her. Had I even been free, I ſhould have been careful not to deprive myſelf of that animating ſunſhine, by a too early declaration. For well did I know, by <hi>other</hi> mens experience, that Miſs Byron, at the ſame time that her natural polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſweetneſs of manners, engaged every heart, was not, however, eaſily to be won.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding all my efforts to prevent a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1185400106:80"/>
competition which had grown ſo faſt upon me, I ſtill found my uneaſineſs increaſe with my affection for Miſs Byron. I had then but one way left—It was, to ſtrengthen my heart, in Clementina's cauſe, by Miſs Byron's aſſiſtance: In ſhort, to acquaint Miſs Byron with my ſituation; to engage her generoſity for Clementina, and thereby deprive myſelf of the encouragement my fond heart might have hoped for, had I indulged my wiſhes of obtaining her favour. My end was anſwered, as to the latter. Miſs By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's generoſity was engaged for the Lady; but was it poſſible that my obligations to her for that generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould not add to my admiration of her?</p>
               <p>At the time I laid before her my ſituation (it was in Lord L's Study at Colnebrooke) ſhe ſaw my emotion. I could not conceal it. My abrupt departure from her, muſt convince her, that my heart was too much engaged for that ſituation <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. III. p. 193,</note>. I deſired Dr. Bartlett to take an airing with me, in hopes, by his counſels, to compoſe my diſordered ſpirits <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 194,</note>. He knew the ſtate of my heart: He knew, with regard to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals I had formerly made to the family at Bologna, relating to Religion and Reſidence (as I had alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the brothers of the Lady) that no worldly grandeur ſhould ever have induced me to allow, in a <hi>beginning</hi> addreſs, the terms, I was willing, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, to allow to that Lady; for thoroughly had I weighed the inconveniencies which muſt attend ſuch an alliance: The Lady zealous in her Religion; the Confelſor who was to be allowed her, equally zealous; the ſpirit of making proſelytes ſo ſtrong, and held by Roman Catholics to be ſo meritorious; and myſelf no leſs in earneſt in my Religion; I had no doubt to pronounce, I told the good Doctor, in confidence, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'that I ſhould be much more happy in marriage with the Lady of Selby-houſe, were ſhe to be induced to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1185400106:81"/>
honour me with her hand, than it was poſſible I could be with Lady Clementina, even were they to comply with the conditions I had propoſed; as I doubted not but that Lady would <hi>alſo</hi> be, were her health reſtored, with a man of her own nation and Religion:'</q> And I owned to him, beſides, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'that I could have no hope of conquering the oppoſition given me by the friends of Clementina; and that I could not at times but think hardly of the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties caſt upon me by ſome of them.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The doctor, I knew, at the ſame time that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the evil treatment Clementina met with from her miſtaken friends, and her unhappy malady; and admired her for her manifold excellencies; next to adored Miſs Byron: And he gave his voice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'But here, doctor, is the caſe, ſaid I—Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina is a woman with whom I had the honour of being acquainted before I knew Miſs Byron: Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina has infinite merits: She herſelf refuſed me not: <hi>She</hi> conſented to accept of the terms I offered: She even beſought her friends to comply with them. She has an opinion of my honour, and of my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for her. Till I had the happineſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſs Byron, I was determined to await either her recovery or releaſe; and will Miſs Byron her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if ſhe knows that, forgive me (the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances not changed) for the change of a reſolution of which Clementina was ſo worthy? The treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the poor Lady has met with, <hi>for my ſake,</hi> as once ſhe wrote, tho' virgin modeſty induced her to croſs out thoſe words, has heightened her diſorder. She ſtill to this moment, wiſhes to ſee me: While there is a poſſibility, tho' not a probability, of my being made the humble inſtrument of reſtoring an excellent woman, who in herſelf deſerves from me every conſideration of tenderneſs, <hi>ought</hi> I to wiſh to engage the heart (were I able to ſucceed in my wiſhes) of the <hi>equally</hi> -excellent Miſs Byron?—Could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1185400106:82"/>
I be happy in my own mind, were I to try, and to ſucceed? And if not, muſt I not be as ungrateful to her, as ungenerous to the other?—Miſs Byron's happineſs cannot depend on <hi>me.</hi> She <hi>muſt</hi> be happy in the happineſs ſhe will give to the man of her choice, <hi>whoever</hi> ſhall be the man!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>We were all ſilent. My grandmamma and aunt ſeemed determined to be ſo; and I <hi>could</hi> not ſpeak. He proceeded:</p>
               <p>You know not, dear Miſs Byron, I wiſhed you <hi>not</hi> to know, the conflicts my mind laboured with, when I parted with you on my going abroad. My deſtiny was wrapt up in doubt, and uncertainty. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited over: Signor Jeronymo was deemed irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: He wiſhed to ſee me, and deſired but to <hi>live</hi> to ſee me. My preſence was requeſted as a laſt effort to recover his noble ſiſter. You yourſelf, madam, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded my reſolution to go: But, that I might not be thought to wiſh to engage you in my favour (ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as I was, that to have done ſo, would have been to have acted unworthily to <hi>both</hi> Ladies,) I inſinuated my hopeleſſneſs of ever being nearer to you than I was.</p>
               <p>I was not able to take a formal leave of you. I went over. Succeſs attended the kind, the ſoothing treatment which Clementina met with from her friends. Succeſs alſo attended the means uſed for the recovery of the noble Jeronymo. Conditions were again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Clementina, on her reſtoration, ſhone upon us all even with a brighter luſtre than ſhe did before her diſorder. All her friends conſented to reward with the hand of their beloved daughter, the man to whom they attributed ſecondarily the good they rejoiced in. I own to you, Ladies, that what was before <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>compaſſion,</hi> now became <hi>admiration;</hi> and I ſhould have been unjuſt to the merits of ſo excellent a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if I could not ſay, <hi>Love.</hi> I concluded myſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the huſband of Clementina; yet it would have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1185400106:83"/>
been ſtrange, if the welfare and happineſs of Miſs By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron were not the next wiſh of my heart. I rejoiced that (deſpairing as I did of ſuch an event before I went over, becauſe of the articles of Religion and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) I had not ſought to engage more than her friendſhip; and I devoted myſelf wholly to Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina—<hi>I own it, Ladies</hi>—And had I thought, Angel as ſhe came out, upon proof, that I could not have given her my heart, I had been equally unjuſt, and ungrateful. For, dear Ladies, if you know all her ſtory, you muſt know, that occaſion called her out to act gloriouſly; and that gloriouſly ſhe anſwered the call.</p>
               <p>He pauſed. We were ſtill ſilent. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and aunt looked at each other by turns. But their eyes, as well as mine, at different parts of his ſpeech ſhewed their ſenſibility. He proceeded, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking down, and at firſt with ſome little heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, it was with a very ill grace, that, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,</hi> as I muſt in juſtice call it, tho' on the nobleſt motives, by Clementina, I come to offer myſelf, and ſo ſoon after her refuſal, to a Lady of Miſs Byron's delicacy. I ſhould certainly have acted more laudably, reſpecting my own character <hi>only,</hi> had I taken at leaſt the uſual time of a <hi>Widower-Love.</hi> But great minds, ſuch as Miſs Byron's, and yours, Ladies, are above common forms, where decorum is not too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. As to myſelf, what do I, but declare a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that would have been, but for one obſtacle, which is now removed, as ſervent as man ever knew? Dr. Bartlett has told me, madam <hi>[to me],</hi> that you and my ſiſters have ſeen the Letters I wrote to him from Italy: By the contents of ſome of thoſe, and of the Letters I left with <hi>you,</hi> madam <hi>[to my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma],</hi> you have ſeen Clementina's conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the ſtep ſhe ſo greatly took. In this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, received but laſt Wedneſday [taking one out of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1185400106:84"/>
his boſom], you will ſee (my laſt Letters to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received, as they muſt be) that I am urged by all her family, for the ſake of ſetting <hi>her</hi> an example, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf to a Lady of my own country. This <hi>impels</hi> me, as I may ſay, to <hi>accelerate</hi> the humble ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my vows to you, madam. However haſty the ſtep may be thought, in my ſituation; Would not an inexcuſable neglect, or ſeeming indifference, as if I were balancing as to the perſon, have been attributable to me, had I, for <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> form's ſake, been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of poſtponing the declaration of my affection to Miſs Byron? And if, madam, you can ſo far get over obſervances, which perhaps, on conſideration, will be found to be punctilious only, as to give your heart, with your hand, to a man who himſelf has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by what ſome would call (particular as it ſounds) a <hi>double Love</hi> (an embarraſment, however, not of his own ſeeking, or which he could poſſibly avoid) you will lay him under obligation to your goodneſs (to your magnanimity, I will call it) which all the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate tenderneſs of my life to come will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to diſcharge.</p>
               <p>He then put the Letter (a tranſlation of it incloſed) into my hand. I have already anſwered it, madam, ſaid he, and acquainted my friend, that I have actually tendered myſelf to the acceptance of a Lady worthy of a ſiſterly relation to their Clementina; and have not been rejected. Your goodneſs muſt enable me (I humbly hope it will) to give them ſtill ſtronger aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of your favour: On my happineſs they have the generoſity to build a part of their own.</p>
               <p>Not well before, I was more than once apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of fainting, as he talked, agreeable as was his talk, and engaging as was his manner. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and aunt ſaw my complexion change at his particular addreſs to me, in the laſt part of his ſpeech. Each put her kind hand on one of mine, and held it on it, as my other hand held my handkerchief now
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1185400106:85"/>
to my eyes, and now as a cover to my ſelf-felt vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheek.</p>
               <p>At the ſame moment that he ceaſed ſpeaking, he took our triply-united hands in both his; and in the moſt reſpectful, yet graceful manner, his Letter laid in my lap, preſſed each of the three with his lips; mine twice. I could not ſpeak. My grandmamma and aunt, delighted, yet tears ſtanding in their eyes, looked upon each other, and upon me; each as expecting the other to ſpeak. I have perhaps, ſaid he, with ſome emotion, taken up too much of Miſs Byron's attention on this my firſt perſonal declaration: I will now return to the company below. To-morrow I will do myſelf the honour to dine with you. We will for this evening poſtpone the important ſubject. Miſs Byron, I preſume, will be beſt pleaſed to have it ſo. I ſhall to-morrow be favoured with the reſult of your deliberations. Mean time may I meet with an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding friend in every one I have had the pleaſure to ſee this day! I muſt flatter myſelf with the honour of Miſs Byron's <hi>whole</hi> heart, as well as with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all her friends. I cannot be thought at <hi>preſent,</hi> to deſerve it; but it ſhall be the endeavour of my life ſo to do.</p>
               <p>He withdrew, with a grace which was all his own.</p>
               <p>The moment he was gone from us, my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma threw her arms about her Harriet, then about my aunt; and they congratulated me, and each other.</p>
               <p>We were all pained at heart, when we read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is from Signor Jeronymo, urging your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſet the example to his ſiſter, which they ſo much want her to follow. I ſend you the tranſlation. Pray return it. Poor Lady Clementina! Without ſeeing the laſt Letters he wrote to them, ſhe ſeems to be tired into compliance. I will not ſay one half that is upon my mind on this occaſion, as you will have the Letter before you. His laſt-written Letters
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1185400106:86"/>
will not favour her wiſhes. Poor Lady! Can I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to pity her? And ſtill the more is ſhe to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, as your brother's excellencies riſe upon us.</p>
               <p>I beſought my aunt to excuſe me to the company.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles joined his friends (HIS friends indeed they are all!) with a vivacity in his air and manner, which charmed every-body; while the ſilly heart of your Harriet would not allow her to enter into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the whole night. Indeed it wanted the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his preſence; for, to every one's regret, he declined ſtaying ſupper; yet my uncle put it to him—What, Sir, do you chooſe to ſup at your inn? My uncle will have it, that Sir Charles <hi>looked</hi> an anſwer of diſpleaſure for ſuffering him to go to it atall. My uncle is a good-natured man. He will ſometimes concede, when he is not convinced; and on every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance which makes for his opinion, we are ſure to hear of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall have an opportunity to-morrow morning early (This morning I might ſay) to ſend this long Letter by a neighbour, who is obliged to ride poſt to town on his own affairs.</p>
               <p>Had I <hi>not</hi> had this agreeable employment, reſt, I am ſure, would not have come near me. Your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I hope, has found it. Remember, I always mean to include my dear Lady L. in this correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Any-body elſe, but diſcretionally. My dear Ladies both, Adieu.</p>

               <p>WE have at laſt, my Grandiſon, ſome hopes given us, that our dear Clementina will yield to our wiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1185400106:87"/>
The General, with his Lady, made us a viſit from Naples, on purpoſe to make a deciſive effort, as he called it; and vowed that he would not return till he left her in a diſpoſition to oblige us. The Biſhop at one time brought the Patriarch to reaſon with her; who told her, that ſhe ought not to think of the veil, unleſs her father and mother conſented to her aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Beaumont was prevailed upon to favour us with her company. She declared for us: And on Thurſday laſt Clementina was ſtill harder ſet. Her Father, Mother, the General and his Lady, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, all came into my chamber, and ſent for her. She came. Then did we all ſupplicate her to oblige us. The General was at firſt tenderly urgent: The Biſhop beſought her: The young Marchioneſs preſſed her: Her Mother took her hand between both hers, and in ſilent tears could only ſigh over it: And, laſtly, my Father dropt down on one knee to her. My daughter, my child, ſaid he, oblige me. Your Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo could not refrain from tears.</p>
               <p>She fell on her knee—O my Father, ſaid ſhe, riſe, or I ſhall die at your feet! Riſe, my Father!</p>
               <p>Not, my dear, till you conſent to oblige me.</p>
               <p>Grant me but a little time, my Father, my dear, my indulgent Father!</p>
               <p>The General thought he ſaw a flexibility which we had never before ſeen in her on this ſubject, and called upon her for her <hi>inſtant</hi> determination. Shall a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneel in vain? ſaid he. Shall a Mother in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilence in vain entreat?—Now, my ſiſter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply—or—He ſternly ſtopt.</p>
               <p>Have patience with me, ſaid ſhe, but till the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier's next Letters come: You expect them ſoon. Let me receive his next Letter. And putting her hand to her forehead—Riſe, my Father, or I die at your feet!</p>
               <p>I thought the General puſhed too hard. I begged that the next Letters might be waited for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1185400106:88"/>
Be it ſo, ſaid my father, riſing, and raiſing her: But whatever be the contents, remember, my deareſt child, that I am your Father, your indulgent Father; and oblige me.</p>
               <p>My dear Clementina, ſaid the General, will not this paternal goodneſs prevail upon you? Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Brothers, are all ready to kneel to you; Yet are we all to be ſlighted? And is a foreigner, an Engliſhman, a Heretic (great and noble as is the man; a man, too, whom you have ſo gloriouſly refuſed) to be preferred to us all? Who can bear the thoughts of ſuch a preference!</p>
               <p>And remember, my Siſter, ſaid the Biſhop, that you already know his opinion. You have already had his advice, in the Letters he wrote to you in the month's correſpondence which paſſed between you, before he left Italy. Think you, that the Chevalier Grandiſon can recede from an opinion ſolemnly given, the circumſtances not having varied?</p>
               <p>I have not been well. It is wicked to oppoſe my Father, my Mother: I cannot argue with my Brothers. I have not been well. Spare me, ſpare me, my Lords, to the General and the Biſhop. My Father gives me time: Don't <hi>you</hi> deny it me.</p>
               <p>My mother, afraid of renewing her diſorder, ſaid; Withdraw, my dear, if you chooſe to do ſo, and compoſe yourſelf: The intention is not to compel, but to perſuade you.</p>
               <p>O madam! ſaid ſhe, perſuaſion ſo ſtrongly urged by my parents, is <hi>more</hi> than compulſion.—I take the liberty you give me.</p>
               <p>She hurried to Mrs. Beaumont, and, throwing her arms about her, O madam, I have been oppreſſed! Oppreſſed by perſuaſion! By a kneeling Father! By a weeping Mother! By entreating Brothers!—And this is but perſuaſion!—Cruel perſuaſion!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Beaumont then entered into argument with her. She repreſented to her the General's inflexibility:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1185400106:89"/>
Her Father's and Mother's indulgence: The wiſhes of her two other Brothers: She pleaded your opinion given as an impartial man, not merely as a Proteſtant: She told her of an admirable young Lady of your own country, who was qualified to make you happy: of whom ſhe had heard ſeveral of your countrymen ſpeak with great diſtinction. This laſt plea, as the intimate friendſhip between you and Mrs. Beaumont is ſo well known, took her attention. She would not for the world ſtand in the way of the Chevalier Grandiſon. She wiſhed you to be happy, ſhe ſaid, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of her. Father Mareſcotti ſtrongly enforced this point; and adviſed her to come to ſome reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>before</hi> your next Letters arrived, as it was not to be doubted, but the contents of them would ſupport your former opinion. The Patriarch's arguments were re-urged with additional force. A day was named when ſhe was again to be brought before her aſſembled friends. Mrs. Beaumont applauded her for the magnanimity ſhe had already ſhewn, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of her firſt duty; and called upon her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh herſelf equally in the filial.</p>
               <p>Clementina took time to conſider of theſe and other arguments; and after three hours paſſed in her cloſet, ſhe gave the following written paper to Mrs. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont; which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe hoped, when read in full aſſembly, would excuſe her from attending her friends in the propoſed congreſs.</p>

               <p>How did we congratulate ourſelves, when we read this paper, faint as are the hopes it gives us!</p>
               <p>Our whole endeavour is now, to treat her with tender obſervance, that ſhe may not think of receding. Nor will we aſk her to ſee the perſon ſhe knows we favour, till we can aſſure her, that you will ſet her the example. And if there be a Lady with whom you think you could be happy, may not this, my dear Grandiſon, pleaded by you, be a motive with her?</p>
               <p>The Count of Belvedere has made overtures to us, which are too great for our acceptance, were this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance to take place. We have been told, but not by himſelf, the danger to which his diſpair had ſubjected him, in more than one viſit to you at Bologna, had you not borne with his raſhneſs. You know him to be a man of probity, of piety. He is a zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic; and you muſt allow, that a religious zeal is a ſtrengthener, a confirmer, of all the ſocial ſanctions. He is learned; and, being a domeſtic man, he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Italian cuſtom, admires in a wife thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual improvements which make a woman a fit companion for her huſband. You know how much the Marchioneſs excells almoſt all the women of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Italy, in a taſte for polite literature: You know ſhe has encouraged the ſame taſte in her daughter; and the Count conſiders her as the only woman in Italy with whom he can be happy.</p>
               <p>As you, my Grandiſon, cannot now be my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by marriage, the Count of Belvedere is the only man in the world I can wiſh to be ſo. He is of Italy. My ſiſter, always ſo dear to us, and he, will be ever
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1185400106:92"/>
with us, or we with them. He knows the unhappy way ſhe has been in; and was ſo far from making that an objection, that when her malady was at the height (being ecouraged by phyſicians to hope that her recovery would be the probable conſequence) he would have thought himſelf the happieſt of men, could he have been honoured with her hand. He knows her Love of you. He adores her for her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of refuſing you. He loves you; and is confident of the inviolable honour of both: Whoſe alliance, on all theſe conſiderations, can be ſo deſirable to us as that with the Count of Belvedere?</p>
               <p>Surely, my dear friend, it <hi>muſt</hi> be in your power to ſet the example: In <hi>yours,</hi> who could ſubdue a whole family of zealous Catholics, and keep your own religion; and who could engage the virgin heart of one of the moſt delicate women in the world. What woman, who has a heart to beſtow; what family, that has a daughter or ſiſter to give, can withſtand you? Religion and Country of both the ſame?</p>
               <p>Give us hope, therefore, my dear Grandiſon, that you will make the effort. Aſſure us, that you will not ſcruple, if you can ſucceed, to ſet the example: and on this aſſurance we will claim from Clementina the effects of the hope ſhe has given us: And if we <hi>can</hi> prevail. will in England return you thanks for the numberleſs favours you have conferred upon us.</p>
               <p>Thus earneſtly, as well from inclination, as in compliance with the preſſing entreaties of every one of a family which I hope are ſtill, and ever, will be, dear to you, do I, your Jeronymo, your Brother, your Friend, ſolicit you. Mrs. Beaumont joins with us. She ſcruples not, ſhe bids me tell you, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that you and Clementina will both be more happy; ſhe, with the Count of Belvidere (your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Countries ſo diſtant, your Religion ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent); you, with an Engliſhwoman; than you could have been with each other. Mrs. Beaumont has

owned to me in private, that you often in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her, even while you had hope of calling Clementina yours, lamented, for her ſake, as well as your own, the unhappy ſituation, with reſpect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you were both in; and that you had declared more than once to her, as indeed you did once to us, that in a <hi>beginning</hi> addreſs you would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed thus with a Princeſs. May we not expect every-thing, my Grandiſon, from your magnanimity? We hope it is in your <hi>power,</hi> and we doubt not your <hi>will,</hi> to contribute to our happineſs. But whatever be the event, I beſeech you, my dear friend, continue to love</p>

               <p>CAN I forgive your pride, your petulance?—No, Harriet; poſitively no! I write to ſcold you; and having <hi>ordered</hi> my Lord to ſup abroad, I ſhall perhaps <hi>oblige</hi> you with a long Letter. We honeſt folks, who have not abundance of Love-fooling upon our hands, find ourſelves happy in a good deal of quiet leiſure; and I love to chide and correct you wiſe ones.—Thus then I begin—</p>
               <p>Ridiculous parade among you! I blame you all. Could he not have been Mrs. Shirley's gueſt, if he was not to be permitted to repoſe under the ſame roof with his ſovereign Lady and Miſtreſs? But muſt you let him go to an inn?—What for? Why to ſhew the world he was but on a foot, at preſent, with your other humble ſervants; and be <hi>thought</hi> no more, by the inſolent Greville, and affronted as an invader of his rights. Our Sex is a fooliſh Sex: Too little or too much parade. Lord help us! Were it not that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1185400106:94"/>
we muſt be afraid to appear over-forward to the man <hi>himſelf,</hi> the world is a contemptible thing, and we ſhould treat it as ſuch.</p>
               <p>And yet, after all, what with Lady Clementina, what with the world, and what with our own puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, and palpitating hearts, and-ſo-forth, and all that, and more than all that; I own you are pretty nicely circumſtanced. But, my life for yours, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have like a ſimpleton, on occaſion of his next addreſs to you: And why? Did you ever know that people did not, who are full of apprehenſions, who aimed at being very delicate, who were ſolicitous to take their meaſures from the judgment of thoſe without them; pragmatical ſouls, perhaps, who from their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either on what they have <hi>read,</hi> or by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to them of their own ſilly fellows, aukward and unmeaning, and by no means to be compared, for integrity, underſtanding, politeneſs, to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Conſider, child, that he having ſeen, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent countries, perhaps a hundred women, equally ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with the preſent miſtreſs of his deſtiny, were form and outward grace to be the attractives, is <hi>there—fore</hi> ſitter to <hi>give</hi> than <hi>take</hi> the example.</p>
               <p>But, Harriet, I write to charge you not to increaſe your own difficulties by too much parade: Your frankneſs of heart is a prime conſideration with him. He expects not to meet with the <hi>girl,</hi> but the <hi>ſenſible woman,</hi> in his addreſs to you. He is purſuing a laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end—Don't teaze him with pug's tricks—<q rend="inline">'What, ſignifies aſking me now?'</q> Did you not lay your heads together? And the wiſeſt which ever were ſet on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens ſhoulders? But indeed I never knew conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any kind turn to account. It is only a parcel of people getting together, propoſing doubts, and puzzling one another, and ending as they began, if not worſe. Doctors differ. So many perſons, ſo many minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1185400106:95"/>
And O how our petulant heart throbbed with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe he came not to breakfaſt with you! What benefit has a polite man over an unpolite one, where the latter ſhall have his ruſticity allowed for <hi>(O that is his way!)</hi> and when the other has expectations drawn upon him, which, if not <hi>critically</hi> anſwered, he is not to be forgiven!—He is a <hi>prudent</hi> man! He may have <hi>overſlept</hi> himſelf—Might dream of <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.</hi> Then it was a fault in him, that he ſtayed to dine on the road—His horſes might want reſt, truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Upon my word, Harriet, a woman in Love, is—a woman in Love. Wiſe or fooliſh before, we are all equally fooliſh then: The ſame froward, petulant, captious, babies!—I proteſt, we are very ſilly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all of us, in theſe circumſtances; and did not Love make men as great fools as ourſelves, they would hardly think us worthy of their purſuit. Yet I am ſo true to the Free-maſonry myſelf, that I would think the man who ſhould dare to ſay half I have written, of our <hi>Dollſhips,</hi> ought not to go away with his life.</p>
               <p>My ſiſter and I are troubled about this Greville. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, the moment you can, of the particulars of what paſſed between my brother and him; pray do. We long alſo to ſee the Letter he has put into your hands, from Bologna. It is on the road, we hope.</p>
               <p>Caroline and I are as much concerned for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, your punctilio, as you, or any of you, can be. But by the account you give me of my brother's addreſs to you in preſence of your grandmother and aunt, as well as from our knowledge of his politeneſs, neither you nor we need to trouble our heads about it: It may be all left to him. He knows ſo well what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the character of the woman whom he hopes to call his wife, that you will be ſure of your dignity being preſerved, if you place a confidence in him. And yet no man is ſo much above mere formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards as he is. Let me enumerate inſtances, from your Letter before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1185400106:96"/>
His own intention, in the firſt place, not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you by his viſits, as you apprehended he would, which would have made him look like a man of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imagined conſequence to you—His providing himſelf with accommodations at an inn; and not giving way to the invitation, even of your <hi>ſagacious</hi> uncle Selby [I muſt raily him. Does he ſpare me?]—His ſingling you out on Friday from your men-friends, yet giving you the opportunity of your aunt's and grandmother's company, to make his perſonal application to you for your favour—His requeſting the intereſt of your other friends with you, as if he preſumed not on your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acquaintance, and this after an application, not diſcouraged, made to your friends and you.</p>
               <p>As to his equanimity in his firſt addreſs to you; his retaining your hand, forſooth, before all your friends, and ſo-forth; never find fault with that, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet. [Indeed you do make an excuſe for the very freedom you blame—So Lover-like!—] He is the very man, that a conſcious young woman, as you are, ſhould wiſh to be addreſſed by: So much courage, yet ſo much true modeſty—What, I warrant, you would have had a man chalked out for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſhould have ſtood at diſtance, bowed, ſcraped, tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; while you had nothing to do, but bridle, and make ſtiff courteſies to him, with your hands before you—Plagued with <hi>his</hi> doubts, and with <hi>your can</hi> diſſidences; afraid he would <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>now,</hi> pop out the queſtion; which he had not the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to put; and ſo running on, ſimpering, fretting, fearing, two parrallel lines, ſide by ſide, and never meeting; till ſome interpoſing friends, in pity to you both, put one's head pointing to the other's head, and ſtroking and clapping the ſhoulder of each, ſet you at each other, as men do by other dunghil-bred creatures.</p>
               <p>You own, he took no notice of your emotion, when he firſt addreſſed himſelf to you; ſo gave you
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1185400106:97"/>
an opportunity to look up, which otherwiſe you would have wanted. Now don't you think you know a man creature or two, who would on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, have grinned you quite out of countenance, and inſulted you with their pity for being modeſt?—But you own, that he had emotion too, when he firſt opened his mind to you—What a duce would the girl have?—Orme and Fowler in your head, no doubt! The tremblings of rejected men, and the phantaſies of romantic women, were to be a rule to my brother, I ſuppoſe with your mock-majeſty!—Ah, Harriet! Did I not ſay that we women are very ſilly creatures?—But my brother is a <hi>good</hi> man—So we muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to find fault with him for.—Hah, hah, hah, hah, What do you laugh at, Charlotte?—What do I laugh at, Harriet?—Why, at the idea of a couple of <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> taken each with a violent ague-fit, at their firſt approach to each other—Hands ſhaking—Knees trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling—Lips quivering—Tongue faultering—Teeth chattering—I had a good mind to preſent you with an ague-dialogue between ſuch a trembling couple.—I, I, I, I, ſays the Lover—You, you, you, you, ſays the girl, if able to ſpeak at all. But, Harriet, you ſhall have the whole, on demand. Rave at me, if you will: But Love, as it is called by boys and girls, ſhall ever be the ſubject of my ridicule. Does it not lead us girls into all manner of abſurdities, inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, undutifulneſs, diſgrace?—Villainous Cupidity!—It does.</p>
               <p>To be ſerious—Neither does my brother addreſs you in a ſtile that impeaches either his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or yours.—Another fault, Harriet, is it not?—But ſure you are not ſo <hi>very</hi> a girl!</p>
               <p>The juſtice he does to Lady Clementina and her family [Let me be very ſerious, when I ſpeak of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina] is a glorious inſtance as well of his greatneſs of mind, as of his ſincerity. He has no need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate one Lady, to help him to exalt (or do juſtice,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1185400106:98"/>
I ſhould rather ſay, to) another. By praiſing her, he makes noble court to you, in ſuppoſing you, as you are, one of the moſt generous of women. How great is his compliment to <hi>both</hi> Ladies, when he calls Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina the Miſs Byron of Italy! Who, my dear, ever courted woman as my brother courts you? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there can be but very few men who have ſuch a woman to court.</p>
               <p>He ſuffers you not to aſk for an account of the ſtate of his heart from the time he knew you firſt, till now. He gives it to you, unaſked. And how glorious is that account, both to you, and himſelf!</p>
               <p>Let us look back upon his conduct when laſt in Italy, and when every ſtep ſeemed to lead to his being huſband of another woman.</p>
               <p>The recovery of Clementina, and of her noble brother, ſeem to be the <hi>conſequence</hi> of his friendly goodneſs. The grateful family all join to reward him with their darling's hand; her heart ſuppoſed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready his. He, like the man of honour he is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes himſelf bound by his former offers. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him upon thoſe terms. The Lady's merits thine out with tranſcendent luſtre in the eyes of every one, even of us his ſiſters, and of <hi>you,</hi> Harriet, and your beſt friends: Muſt they not in <hi>his,</hi> to whom <hi>Merit</hi> was ever the <hi>firſt, Beauty</hi> but the <hi>ſecond</hi> attractive? He had no tie to any other woman on earth: He had only the tenderneſs of his own heart, with regard to Miſs Byron, to contend with. <hi>Ought</hi> he not to have contended with it? He <hi>did;</hi> and ſo far conquered, as to enable himſelf to be <hi>juſt</hi> to the Lady, whoſe great qualities, and the concurrence of her friends in his favour, had converted Compaſſion for her into Love. And who, that hear her ſtory, can forbear to Love her? But with what tenderneſs, with what politeneſs, does he, in his Letter to his choſen correſpondent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf of Miſs Byron! He declares, that if <hi>ſhe</hi> were not to be happy, it would be a great abatement
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1185400106:99"/>
of his own felicity. You, however, remember how politely he recals his apprehenſions that you may not, on his account, be altogether ſo happy as he wiſhes, as the ſuggeſtions of his own preſumption; and cenſures himſelf for barely ſuppoſing, that he had been of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence enough with you to give you pain.</p>
               <p>How much to your honour before he went over, does he account for your ſmiles, for yourfrankneſs of heart, in his company! He would not build upon them: Nor indeed could he know the ſtate of your heart, as <hi>we</hi> did: He had not the opportunity. How ſilly was your punctilio, that made you ſometimes fanſy it was out of mere compaſſion that he revealed to you the ſtate of his engagement abroad! You ſee he tells you, that ſuch was his opinion of your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, that he thought he had no other way but to put it in your power to check him, if his Love for you ſhould ſtimulate him to an act of neglect to the Lady to whom (ſhe having never refuſed him, and not being then in a condition either to claim him or ſet him free) he thought himſelf under obligation. Don't you revere him for his honour to her, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her malady conſidered? What muſt he have ſuffered, in this conflict!</p>
               <p>Well, and now by a ſtrange turn in the Lady, but glorious to herſelf, as he obſerves, the obſtacle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, he applies to Miſs Byron for her favour. How ſenſible is he of what delicacy requires from her! How juſtly (reſpecting his Love for you) does he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for not poſtponing, for the ſake of <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dull</hi> form, as he juſtly expreſſes it, his addreſs to you! How greatly does the Letter he delivered to you, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his argument! Ah the poor Clementina! <hi>Cruel</hi> perſuades her relations! I hate and pity them, in a breath. Never, before, did hatred and pity meet in the ſame boſom, as they do in mine, on this occaſion. His difficulties, my dear, and the uncommon ſituation he is in, as if he were offering you but a divided Love,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1185400106:100"/>
enhance your glory. You are reinſtated on the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male throne, to the lowermoſt footſtep of which you once was afraid you had deſcended. You are offered a man, whoſe perplexities have not proceeded from the entanglements of intrigue, inconſtancy, perfidy; but from his own compaſſionate nature: And could you, by any other way in the world than by this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed divided Love, have had it in your power, by accepting his humbly-offered hand, to lay him under obligation to you, which he thinks he never ſhall be able to diſcharge? Lay <hi>him</hi>—Who?—Sir CHARLES GRANDISON—For whom ſo many virgin hearts have ſighed in vain!—And what a triumph to our Sex is this, as well as to my Harriet!</p>
               <p>And now, Harriet, let me tell you, that my ſiſter and I are both in great expectations of your next Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is, it muſt be, written before you will have this. My brother is more than man: You have only to ſhew yourſelf to be ſuperior to the <hi>forms</hi> of woman. If you play the fool with him, now, that you have the power you and we have ſo long wiſhed you; if you give pain to his noble, becauſe ſincere heart, by any the leaſt ſhadow of Female affectation; you, who have hitherto been diſtinguiſhed for ſo amiable a frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; you, who cannot doubt his honour—the honour of a man who ſolicits your favour in even a <hi>great</hi> manner, a manner in which no man before him ever courted a woman, becauſe few men before him have ever been ſo particularly circumſtanced; a manner that gives you an opportunity to outſhine, in your acceptance of him, even the noble Clementina in her refuſal; as bigotry muſt have been, in part, her motive; if, I ſay, you act fooliſhly, weakly, now—Look to it—You will depreciate, if not caſt away your own glory. Remember, you have a man to deal with, who, from our behaviour to Mrs. Oldham, at his firſt return to England, took meaſure of our minds, and, without loving us the leſs for it, looked
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1185400106:101"/>
down upon us with pity; and made us, ever ſince, look upon ourſelves in a diminiſhing light, and as ſiſters who have greater reaſon to glory in their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than he has in them. Would you not rather, you who are to ſtand in a ſtill nearer relation to him, invite his admiration, than his pity? Till Friday night laſt you had it: What Saturday has produced, we ſhall ſoon gueſs.</p>
               <p>Not either Lord L. or Lord G. not Emily, not aunt Eleanor, now, either ſee or hear read what you write, except here-and-there a paſſage, which you yourſelf would not ſcruple to hear read to them. Are you not our third ſiſter? To each of us our next Self: And, what gives you ſtill more dignity, the elected wife of our brother!</p>

               <p>MR Fenwick has juſt now been telling us, from the account given him by that Greville, vile man, how the affair was between him and Sir Charles Grandiſon. Take it briefly, as follows:</p>
               <p>About Eight yeſterday morning, that audacious wretch went to the George at Northampton; and, after making his enquiries, demanded an audience of Sir Charles Grandiſon. Sir Charles was near dreſſed, and had ordered his chariot to be ready, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to viſit us early.</p>
               <p>He admitted of Mr. Greville's viſit. Mr. Greville confeſſes, that his own behaviour was <hi>peremptory</hi> (his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1185400106:102"/>
word for <hi>inſolent.</hi> I ſuppoſe). I hear, Sir, ſaid he, that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u are come down into this country in order to carry off from u the richeſt jewel in it—I need not ſay whom. My name is Greville: I have long made my addreſſes to her, and have bound myſelf under a vow, that, were a Prince to be my competitor, I would diſpute his title to her.</p>
               <p>You ſeem to be a <hi>princely</hi> man, Sir, ſaid Sir Charles, offended with his air and words, no doubt. You need not, Mr. Greville, have told me your name: I have heard of you. What <hi>your</hi> pretenſions are, I know not; your vow is nothing to me: I am maſter of my own actions; and ſhall not account to you, or any man living, for them.</p>
               <p>I preſume, Sir, you came down with the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have hinted at? I beg only your anſwer as to that. I beg it a favour, gentleman to gentleman?</p>
               <p>The manner of your addreſs to me, Sir, is not ſuch as will intitle you to an anſwer for your <hi>own</hi> ſake. I will tell you, however, that I am come down to pay my devoirs to Miſs Byron. I hope for acceptance; and know not that I am to make allowance for the claim of any man on earth.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles Grandiſon, I know your character: I know your bravery. It is from that knowlege that I conſider you as a ſit man for me to talk to. I am not a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, Sir.</p>
               <p>I make no account of <hi>who</hi> or <hi>what</hi> you are, Mr. Greville. Your viſit is not, at this time, a welcome one: I am going to breakfaſt with Miſs Byron. I ſhall be here in the evening, and at leiſure, then, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any-thing you ſhall think yourſelf authorized to ſay to me, on this or any other ſubject.</p>
               <p>We may be overheard, Sir—Shall I beg you to walk with me into the garden below? You are going to breakfaſt, you ſay, with Miſs Byron. <hi>Dear</hi> Sir Charles Grandiſon, oblige me with an audience, of five minutes only, in the back-yard, or garden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1185400106:103"/>
In the evening, Mr. Greville, command me any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: But I will not be broken in upon now.</p>
               <p>I will not leave you at liberty, Sir Charles, to make your viſit where you are going, till I am gratified with one five minutes conference with you below.</p>
               <p>Excuſe me then, M. Greville, that I give orders, as if you were not here. Sir Charles ran. Up came one of his ſervants—Is the chariot ready?—Almoſt ready, was the anſwer.—Make haſte. Saunders may ſee his friends in this neighbourhood: He may ſtay with them till Monday. Frederick and you attend me.</p>
               <p>He took out a Letter, and read in it, as he walked about the room, with great compoſure, not regarding Mr. Greville, who ſtood ſwelling, as he owned, at one of the windows, till the ſervant withdrew; and then he addreſſed himſelf to Sir Charles in language of reproach on this contemptuous treatment.—Mr. Greville, ſaid Sir Charles, you may be thankful, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that you are in my own apartment: This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion is a very ungentlemanly one.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles was angry, and expreſſed impatience to be gone. Mr. Greville owned, that he knew not how to contain himſelf, to ſee his rival, with ſo many advantages in his perſon and air, dreſſed avowedly to attend the woman he had ſo long—Shall I ſay been troubleſome to? For I am ſure he had never the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of countenance from me.</p>
               <p>I repeat my demand, Sir Charles, of a conference of five minutes below.</p>
               <p>You have no right to make any demand upon me, Mr. Greville: If you think you have, the evening will be time enough. But, even then, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have more like a gentleman, than you have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, to intitle youſelf to be conſidered as on a foot with me.</p>
               <p>Not on a foot with you, Sir!—And he put his hand upon his ſword. A gentleman is on a foot with a Prince, Sir, in a point of honour—</p>
               <p>

Go, then, and find out your prince, Mr. Greville: I am no Prince. And you have as much reaſon to addreſs yourſelf to the man you never ſaw, as to me.</p>
               <p>His ſervant juſt then ſhewing himſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing; Mr. Greville, added he, I leave you in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this apartment. Your ſervant, Sir. In the evening I ſhall be at your command.</p>
               <p>One word with you, Sir Charles—One word—</p>
               <p>What would Mr. Greville? turning back.</p>
               <p>Have you made propoſals? Are your propoſals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?</p>
               <p>I repeat, that you ought to have behaved differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, Mr. Greville, to be intitled to an anſwer to theſe queſtions.</p>
               <p>Anſwer me, however, Sir: I beg it as a favour.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles took out his watch.—After Nine: I ſhall make them wait. But thus I anſwer you: I <hi>have</hi> made propoſals; and, as I told you before, I hope I ſhall he accepted.</p>
               <p>Were you any other man in the world, Sir, the man before you might queſtion your ſucceſs with a woman whoſe difficulties are augmented by the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs of her admirers. But ſuch a man as you, would not have come down on a fool's errand. I love Miſs Byron to diſtraction. I could not ſhew my face in the county, and ſuffer any man out of it to carry away ſuch a prize.</p>
               <p>Out of the county, Mr. Greville! What narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this! But I pity you for your Love of Miſs Byron: And—</p>
               <p>You <hi>pity</hi> me, Sir! interrupted he.—I bear not ſuch haughty tokens of ſuperiority. Either give up your pretenſions to Miſs Byron, or make me ſenſible of it, in the way of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greville, your ſervant: And he went down.</p>
               <p>The wretch followed him; and when they came to the yard, and Sir Charles was ſtepping into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, he took his hand, ſeveral perſons preſent—We
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1185400106:105"/>
are obſerved, Sir Charles, whiſpered he. Withdraw with me, for a few moments. By the great God of Heaven, you muſt not refuſe me. I cannot bear that you ſhould go thus triumphantly on the buſineſs you are going upon.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles ſuffered himſelf to be led hy the wretch: And when they were come to a private ſpot, Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville drew, and demanded Sir Charles to do the like, putting himſelf in a poſture of defence.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles put his hand on his ſword, but drew it not. Mr. Greville, ſaid he, know your own ſafety; and was turning from him, when the wretch ſwore he would admit of no alternative, but his giving up his pretenſions to Miſs Byron.</p>
               <p>His rage, as Mr. Fenwick deſcribes it from himſelf, making him dangerous, Sir Charles drew.—I only defend myſelf, ſaid he—Greville, you keep no guard—He put by his paſs with his ſword; and, without making a puſh, cloſed in with him, twiſted his ſword out of his hand; and, pointing his own to his breaſt, You ſee my power, Sir—Take your life, and your ſword.—But if you are either wiſe, or would be thought a man of honour, tempt not again your fate.</p>
               <p>And am I again maſter of my ſword, and unhurt? 'Tis generous—The evening, you ſay?</p>
               <p>Still I ſay, I will be yours in the evening, either at your own houſe, or at my inn; but not as a Duelliſt, Sir: You know my principles.</p>
               <p>How can this be? and he ſwore—How was it done? Expoſe me not at Selby-houſe. How the devil could this be?—I expect you in the evening here.</p>
               <p>And he went off a back-way. Sir Charles, inſtead of going directly into his chariot, went up to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; wrote his Billet to my aunt to excuſe himſelf, finding it full late to get hither in time, and being ſomewhat diſcompoſed in his temper, as he owned to us: And then he took an airing in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, till he came hither to dine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1185400106:106"/>
But how ſhould we have been alarmed, had we known that Sir Charles declined ſupping here, in order to meet the violent man again at his inn! And how did we again blame ourſelves for taking amiſs his not ſupping with us!</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenwick ſays, that Mr. Greville got <hi>him</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the George.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles apologized, with great civility, to Mr. Greville, for making him wait for him. Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, had he been diſpoſed for miſchief, had no uſe of his right-arm. It was ſprained by the twiſting of his ſword from it, and in a ſling.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles behaved to them both with great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs; and Mr. Greville owned, that he had acted nobly by him, in returning his ſword, even before his paſſion was calmed, and in not uſing his own. But it was ſome time, it ſeems, before he was brought into this temper. And what a good deal contributed to it, was, Sir Charles's acquainting him, that he had not given particulars at Selby-houſe, or to any-body, of the fray between them; but referred it to himſelf to give them, as he ſhould think proper. This forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he highly applauded, and was even thankful for it. Fenwick ſhall, in confidence, ſaid he, report this matter to your honour, and my own mortification, as the truth requires, at Selby-houſe. Let me not be hated by Miſs Byron, on this account. My paſſion gave me diſadvantage. I will try to honour you, Sir Charles: But I muſt hate you, if you ſucceed. One condition, however, I make: That you reconcile me to the Selbys, and Miſs Byron; and if you are likely to be ſucceſsful, let me have the credit of reporting, that it is by my conſent.</p>
               <p>They parted with civility; but not, it ſeems, till a late hour. Sir Charles, as Mr. Beauchamp and Dr. Bartlett have told us, was always happy in making, by his equanimity, generoſity, and forgiveingneſs, faſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1185400106:107"/>
friends of inveterate enemies. Thank God, the iſſue was not unhappy!</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenwick ſays, that the rencounter is very little gueſſed at, or talked of [Thank God for that too!]; and to thoſe few, who have enquired of Mr. Greville or Mr. Fenwick about it, it has been denied; and now Greville, as Mr. Fenwick had done before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he will give out, that he yields up all his hopes of Miſs Byron; but ſays, that Sir Charles Grandiſon, of whoſe addreſs every-body already talks, is the only man in England to whom he could reſign his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>He inſiſts upon Sir Charles's dining with him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow; Mr. Fenwick's alſo. Sir Charles is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that the neighbourhood ſhould conclude, that he and theſe gentlemen are on a foot of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he made the leſs ſcruple, for every-one's ſake, to accept of his invitation.</p>
               <p>I am very, very thankful, my deareſt Lady G. that the conſtant bluſterings of this violent man, for ſo many months paſt, are ſo happily overblown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenwick, as I gueſſed he would, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to my aunt and me for my Lucy. Lucy has a fine fortune: But if ſhe had not, he ſhall not have her! Indeed he is not worthy of Lucy's mind. He muſt be related to <hi>me,</hi> he ſaid: But I anſwered, No man muſt call Lucy Selby his, who can have any other motive for his wiſhes but her merit.</p>
               <p>We hourly expect your brother. The new danger he has been in, on my account, endears him ſtill more to us all. How, how will you forbear, ſaid my uncle, throwing yourſelf in his arms at once, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the reſult of our deliberations? If I follow Mr. Deane's advice. I am to give him my hand at the <hi>firſt</hi> word: If Lucy's and Nancy's, he is not to aſk me <hi>twice:</hi> If my grandmamma's and aunt's (They are always good) I am to act as occaſion requires, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1185400106:108"/>
as my own confided-in prudence will ſuggeſt at the time; but to be ſure not to be guilty of affectation. But ſtill, my dear Ladies, ſomething ſticks with me (and ought it not?) in relation to the noble Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina!</p>

               <p>NOW, my dear Ladies L. and G. let me lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, juſt as it happened, for your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or cenſure, all that has paſſed between the beſt of men and your Harriet. Happy ſhall I be, If I can be acquitted by his ſiſters.</p>
               <p>My grandmamma went home laſt night, but was here before Sir Charles; yet he came a little after Eleven. We were all in the great parlour when he came. He addreſſed us ſeverally with his uſual polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and my grandmother, particularly, with ſuch an air of reverence, as did himſelf credit, becauſe of her years and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>We all congratulated him on what we had heard from Mr. Fenwick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greville and I, ſaid he, are on every good terms. When I have the preſumption to think <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> a welcome gueſt, I am to introduce him as my friend. Mr. Greville, tho' ſo long your neighbour, modeſtly doubts his own welcome.</p>
               <p>Well he may, ſaid my aunt Selby, after—No <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> dear madam, if you mean any-thing that has paſſed between him and me.</p>
               <p>He again addreſſed himſelf to me. I rejoice, Sir, ſaid I, that you have quieted ſo happily a ſpirit always thought uncontroulable.</p>
               <p>You muſt tell me, madam, replyed he, when I can be allowed to introduce Mr. Greville to you?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:1185400106:109"/>
Shall <hi>I</hi> anſwer for my couſin, ſaid Lucy?—I did not, Sir Charles, think you ſuch a deſigner.—You were not, you know, to introduce Mr. Greville, till you were aſſured of being yourſelf a <hi>very</hi> welcome gueſt to my couſin.</p>
               <p>I own my plot, replied he: I had an intent to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe Miſs Byron into an implied favour to myſelf.</p>
               <p>You need not, Sir Charles, thought I, take ſuch a method.</p>
               <p>On his taking very kind notice of my couſin James; Do you know, Sir Charles, ſaid my uncle (whoſe joy, when it overflows, ſeldom ſuffers the dear man to conſult ſeaſonableneſs) that that boy is already in Love with your Emily?—The youth bluſhed—</p>
               <p>I am obliged to every-body who loves my Emily. She is a favourite of Miſs Byron—Muſt ſhe not then be a good girl?</p>
               <p>She is indeed a favourite, ſaid I; and ſo great a one, that I know not <hi>who</hi> can deſerve her.</p>
               <p>I ſaid this, leſt Sir Charles ſhould think (on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that my uncle meant ſomething) that my couſin had <hi>my</hi> countenance.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles then addreſſed himſelf to my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and aunt, ſpeaking low—I hope, Ladies, I may be allowed in your preſence to reſume the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of yeſterday with Miſs Byron?</p>
               <p>No, Sir Charles, anſwered my grandmamma, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to look ſerious, that muſt not be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſt not be,</hi> madam! and he ſeemed ſurpriſed, and <hi>affected</hi> too. My aunt was a little ſtartled; but not ſo much as ſhe would have been, had ſhe not known the lively turns which that excellent parent ſometimes gives to ſubjects of converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſt not be,</hi> I repent, Sir Charles: But I will not ſuffer you to be long in ſuſpenſe. We have always, when propoſals of this kind have been made, referred ourſelves to our Harriet. She has prudence: She has gratitude. We will leave her and you together, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1185400106:110"/>
ſhe is inclined to hear you on the intereſting ſubject. I know I am right. Harriet is above diſguiſes. She will be obliged to ſpeak for herſelf, when ſhe has not either her aunt or me to refer to. She and you are not acquaintance of yeſterday. You, Sir, I dare ſay, will not he diſpleaſed with the opportunity—</p>
               <p>Neither Miſs Byron nor I, madam, could wiſh for the abſence of two ſuch parental relations. But this reference I will preſume to conſtrue as a hopeful prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic. May I <hi>now,</hi> through your mediation, madam <hi>(to my aunt)</hi> hope for the opportunity of addreſſing myſelf to Miſs Byron?</p>
               <p>My aunt, taking me to the window, told me what had paſſed. I was a little ſurpriſed at my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma's reference to myſelf only. I expoſtulated with my aunt: It is plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> madam, that Sir Charles expected not this compliment.</p>
               <p>Your grandmamma's motion ſurpriſed me a little my dear: It proceeded from the fulneſs of her joy: She meant a compliment to you both: There is now no receding. Let us withdraw together.</p>
               <p>What, madam, at <hi>his</hi> propoſal? As if <hi>expecting</hi> to be followed?—See how my uncle looks at me! E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one's eyes are upon me!—In the afternoon, if it muſt be—as by accident. But I had rather you and my grandmamma were to be preſent. I mean not to be guilty of affeciation to him:. I know my own heart, and will not diſguiſe it. I ſhall <hi>want</hi> to refer to you. I ſhall be ſilly: I dare not truſt myſelf.</p>
               <p>I wiſh the compliment had not been made, replied my aunt. But, my dear, come along with me.</p>
               <p>She went out. I followed her; a little reluctantly, however; and Lucy tells me, that I looked ſo ſilly, as was enough, of itſelf to inform every-body of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my withdrawing, and that I expected Sir Charles would follow me.</p>
               <p>She was very cruel, I told her; and in my caſe would have looked as ſilly as I; while <hi>I</hi> ſhould have pitied <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1185400106:111"/>
I led to my cloſet. My aunt ſeating me there, was going from me. Well. madam, and ſo I am to ſtay here quietly, I ſuppoſe, till Sir Charles vouchſafes to come? Would Clementina have done ſo?</p>
               <p>No hint to him of Clementina in this way, I charge you: It would look ungrateful, and girliſh. I will introduce him to you—</p>
               <p>And ſtay with me, I hope, madam, when he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. I tell you, Lady G. all my foibles. Away went my aunt; but ſoon returned, and with her the man of men.</p>
               <p>She but turned herſelf round, and ſaw him take my hand, which he did with a compliment that would have made me proud at another time, and left us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>I was reſolved then to aſſume all my courage, and, if poſſible, to be preſent to myſelf. He <hi>was</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet had a modeſty and politeneſs in his manner, which ſoftened the dignity of his addreſs.</p>
               <p>Some men, I fancy, would have begun with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring, or pretending to admire, the pieces of my own workmanſhip, which you have ſeen hang here: But not he. After another compliment made (as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, to re-aſſure me) on my reſtored complexion (I did indeed feel my face glow); he ſpoke directly to his ſubject.</p>
               <p>I need not, I am ſure, ſaid he, repeat to my dear Miſs Byron what I ſaid yeſterday, as to the delicacy of my ſituation, with regard to what ſome would deem a divided or double Love. I need not repeat to you the very great regard I have, and ever ſhall have, for the Lady abroad. Her merit, and your greatneſs of mind, render any apology for ſo juſt a regard needleſs. But it may be neceſſary to ſay, what I can with truth ſay, that I love not my own Soul better than I love Miſs Byron. You ſee, madam, I am wholly free, with regard to that Lady—free by her own choice, by her own will.—You ſee, that the whole family build
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1185400106:112"/>
a part of their happineſs on the ſucceſs of my addreſs to a Lady of my own country. Clementina's wiſh always was, that I would marry; and only be careful, that my choice ſhould not diſgrace the regard ſhe vouchſafed to own for me. Clementina, when ſhe has the pleaſure of knowing the dear Lady before me, if that <hi>may</hi> be, by the name of Grandiſon, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that my choice has done the higheſt credit to the favour ſhe honoured me with.</p>
               <p>And will you not, my dear Lady G. be ready to aſk, Could Sir Charles Grandiſon be really in earneſt in this humble court (as if he doubted her favour) to a creature, every wiſh of whoſe heart was devoted to him? Did he not rather for his own ſake, in order to give her the conſequence which a wife of his ought to have, reſolve to dignify the poor girl, who had ſo long been mortified by cruel ſuſpenſe, and who had ſo often deſpaired of ever being happy with the Lord of her heart? O no, my dear, your brother <hi>looked</hi> the humble, the modeſt Lover; yet the man of ſenſe, of dignity, in Love. I could not but be aſſured of his affection, notwithſtanding all that had paſſed. And what <hi>had</hi> paſſed, that he could poſſibly have helped?—His pleas of the day before, the contents of Signor Jeronymo's Letter, were all in my mind.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed to expect my anſwer. He only, whoſe generouſly-<hi>doubting</hi> eye kept down mine, can tell how I looked, how I behaved—But heſitatingly, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly, both voice, and knees, as I ſat; thus broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as near as I remember, I anſwered, not withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand, tho', as I ſpoke, he more than once preſſed it with his lips:—The honour of Sir Charles Grandiſon—Sir Charles Grandiſon's honour—no one ever did, or ever can, doubt.—I muſt own—I muſt confeſs—There I pauſed.</p>
               <p>What does my dear Miſs Byron own?—What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs?—Aſſure yourſelf, madam, of my honour, of my gratitude.—Should you have <hi>doubts,</hi> ſpeak them. I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1185400106:113"/>
deſire your favour but as I clear up your doubts. I <hi>would</hi> ſpeak them for you—I <hi>have</hi> ſpoken them for you. I own to you, madam, that there may be force in your doubts, which nothing but your generoſity, and affiance in the honour of the man before you, can induce you to get over. And thus far I will own againſt myſelf, that were the Lady, in whoſe heart I ſhould hope an intereſt, to have been circumſtanced as I was, my own delicacy would have been hurt; owing, indeed, to the high notion I have of the true Female delicacy.—Now ſay, now <hi>own,</hi> now <hi>confeſs,</hi> my dear Miſs Byron—what you were going to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is my confeſſion—and it is the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a heart which I hope is as ſincere as your own—That I am dazled, confounded, ſhall I ſay? at the ſuperior merits of the Lady you ſo nobly, ſo like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, glory ſtill in eſteeming as ſhe well deſerves to be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Joy ſeemed to flaſh from his eyes—He bowed on my hand, and preſſed it with his lips; but was either ſilent by choice, or could not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>I proceeded, tho' with a heſitating voice, a glowing cheek, and downcaſt eyes—I fear not, Sir, any more than <hi>ſhe</hi> did, your honour, your Juſtice, no nor your indulgent tenderneſs—<hi>Your</hi> character, <hi>your</hi> principles, Sir, are full ſecurity to the woman who ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſerve from you that indulgence—But ſo juſtly high do I think of Lady Clementina, and her conduct, that I fear—ah, Sir, I fear—that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible—</p>
               <p>I ſtopt—I am ſure I was in earneſt, and muſt <hi>look</hi> to be ſo, or my countenance and my heart were not allied.</p>
               <p>What <hi>impoſſible!</hi>—What fears my dear Miſs Byron is <hi>impoſſible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why (thus kindly urged, and by a man of unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable honour) ſhall I not ſpeak all that is in my
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1185400106:114"/>
mind? The poor Harrier Byron fears, ſhe <hi>juſtly</hi> fears, when ſhe contemplates the magnanimity of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Lady, that with all her care, with all her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſhe never ſhall be able to make the figure to HERSELF, which is neceſſary for her own tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (however <hi>you</hi> might generouſly endeavour to <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> her doubting mind). This, Sir, is my doubt—And—<hi>all</hi> my doubt.</p>
               <p>Generous, kind, noble Miſs Byron! in a rapturous accent—And is this <hi>all</hi> your doubt? Then muſt yet the man before you be a happy man; for he queſtions not, if life be lent him, to make you one of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of women. Clementina has acted gloriouſly in preferring to all other conſiderations her Religion and her Country: I can allow this in her favour, againſt myſelf: And ſhall I not be doubly bound in gratitude to her ſiſter-excellence, who, having not thoſe trials, yet the moſt delicate of human minds, ſhews in my favour a frankneſs of heart which ſets her above little forms and affectation, and at the ſame time a genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity with regard to the merits of another Lady which has few examples?</p>
               <p>He then on one knee, taking my paſſive hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both his, and kiſſing it, once, twice, thrice—Repeat, dear, and ever-dear, Miſs Byron, that this is <hi>all</hi> your doubt [I bowed aſſentingly: I could not ſpeak]—A happy, an eaſy taſk, is mine! Be aſſured, deareſt madam, that I will diſavow every action of my life, every thought of my heart, every word of my mouth, which tends not to diſſipate that doubt.</p>
               <p>I took out my handkerchief—</p>
               <p>My dear Miſs Byron, proceeded he, with an ardour that beſpoke his heart, you are goodneſs itſelf. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached you with diffidence, with <hi>more</hi> than diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with apprehenſion, becauſe of your known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy; which I was afraid, on this occaſion, would <hi>deſcend</hi> into punctiliouſneſs.—My bleſſings attend my future life, as my grateful heart ſhall acknowlege this goodneſs!—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1185400106:115"/>
Again he kiſſed my hand, riſing with dignity. I could have received his vows on my knees; but I was motionleſs, yet I had joy to be enabled to give him joy.—Joy to your brother! to Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon!</p>
               <p>He ſaw me greatly affected, and indeed my emotion increaſed on reflection. He conſiderately ſaid, I will leave you, my dear Miſs Byron, to intitle myſelf to the congratulations of all our friends below. From this moment, after a thouſand ſuſpences and ſtrange events, which, unſought for, have chequered my paſt life, I date my happineſs.</p>
               <p>He moſt reſpectfully left me.</p>
               <p>I was glad he did: Yet my eyes followed him. His very ſhadow was grateful to me, as he went down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs. And there, it ſeems, he congratulated himſelf, and called for the congratulations of every one preſent, in ſo <hi>noble</hi> a manner, that every eye run over with joy.</p>
               <p>Was I not right, ſaid my grandmamma to my aunt (You half-blamed me, my dear) in leaving Sir Charles and my Harriet together? Harriet ever was above diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe Sir Charles might have <hi>gueſſed</hi> at her heart; but he would not have <hi>known</hi> it from her own lips, had ſhe had you and me to refer to.</p>
               <p>Whatever <hi>you</hi> do, madam, anſwered my aunt, muſt be right.</p>
               <p>My aunt came up to me. She found me in a very thoughtful mood. I had ſometimes been accuſing myſelf of forwardneſs, and at others was acquitting myſelf or endeavouring to do ſo—yet mingling, tho' thus early, a hundred delightful circumſtances with my accuſations and acquittals, which were likely to bleſs my future lot. Such as, his relations and friends being mine, mine his; and I run them over all by name. But my Emily, my dear Emily! I conſidered as <hi>my</hi> ward, as well as his. In this way my aunt found me. She embraced me, applauded me, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1185400106:116"/>
cleared up all my ſelf-doubtings, as to forwardneſs; and told me of their mutual congratulations below, and how happy I had made them all. What ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence did her approbation give me!—And as ſhe aſſured me that my uncle would not railly, but extol me, I went down, with ſpirits much higher than I went up with.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles and my grandmamma were talking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſitting ſide by ſide, when I entered the room. All the company ſtood up at my entrance.—O my dear! what a Princeſs in every one's eye will the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Love of ſuch a man make me! How will all the conſequence I had before, among my partial friends and favourers, be augmented!</p>
               <p>My uncle ſaid, <hi>ſideling</hi> by me (kindly intending not to daſh me) My ſweet ſparkler! [That was the name he uſed to call me, before Sir Charles Grandiſon taught me a leſſon that made me thoughtful] You are now again my delight, and my joy. I thank you for not being—a fool—that's all. Egad, I was afraid of your <hi>Femality,</hi> when you came face to face.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles came to me, and, with an air of the moſt reſpectful love, taking my hand, led me to a ſeat between himſelf and my grandmamma.</p>
               <p>My ever-dear Harriet, ſaid ſhe, and condeſcended to lift up my hand to her lips, I will not abaſh you; but muſt juſt ſay, that you have acquitted yourſelf as I wiſhed you to do. I knew I could truſt to a heart that ever was above affectation or diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles Grandiſon, madam, ſaid I, has the generoſity to diſtinguiſh and encourage a doubting mind.</p>
               <p>Infinitely obliging Miſs Byron, replied he, preſſing one hand between both his, as my grandmamma held the other, your condeſcenſion attracts both my Love and Reverence. Permit me to ſay, That had not Heaven given a Miſs Byron for the object of my hope, I had hardly, after what had befallen me <hi>abroad,</hi> ever looked forward to a wedded Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1185400106:117"/>
One favour I have to beg of you, Sir, reſumed my grandmamma: It is, that you will never uſe the word <hi>abroad</hi> or expreſs <hi>perſons</hi> by their <hi>countries</hi>; in fine, that you will never ſpeak with reſerve, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Clementina is in your thoughts. Mention her name with freedom, my dear Sir, to my child, to me, and to my daughter Selby—you may—We always loved and reverenced her: Still we do ſo. She has given an example to all her Sex, of a paſſion properly ſubdued—Of temporal conſiderations yielding to eternal!</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid I, bowing as I ſat, I join in this requeſt.</p>
               <p>His eyes gliſtened with grateful joy. He bowed low to each, but ſpoke not.</p>
               <p>My aunt came to us, and ſat down by Sir Charles, refuſing his ſeat, becauſe it was next me. Let me, ſaid ſhe, enjoy your converſation: I have heard part of your ſubject, and ſubſcribe to it, with all my heart. Lady G. can teſtify for us all three, that we cannot be ſo mean, as to intend you a compliment, Sir, by what has been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Nor can I, madam, as to imagine it. You exalt <hi>yourſelves</hi> even more than you do Clementina. I will let my Jeronymo know ſome of the particulars which have given joy to <hi>my</hi> heart. They will make <hi>him</hi> happy; and the excellent Clementina (I will <hi>not</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear her name) will rejoice in the happy proſpects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. She wanted but to be aſſured that the friend ſhe ſo greatly honoured with her regard, was not likely (either in the qualities of the Lady's mind, or in her family-connections) to be a ſufferer by her declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his addreſs.</p>
               <p>May nothing now happen, my dear Lady G. to overcloud—But I will not be apprehenſive. I will thankfully enjoy the preſent moment, and leave the future to the All-wiſe Dipoſer of events. If Sir Charles Grandiſon be mine, and reward by his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs my Love, what can befal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me, that I ought not to bear with reſignation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1185400106:118"/>
But, my dear Ladies, let me here aſk you a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or two.</p>
               <p>Tell me, Did I ever, as you remember, ſuffer by ſuſpenſes, by <hi>any</hi> -thing?—Was there ever really ſuch a man as Sir Hargrave Pollexfen?—Did I not tell you my <hi>dreams,</hi> when I told you of what I believed I had undergone from his perſecuting inſults? It is well, for the ſake of preſerving to me the grace of humility, and for the ſake of warning (for all my days <hi>preceding</hi> that inſult had been happy) that I wrote down <hi>at the time</hi> an account of thoſe ſufferings, thoſe ſufferings, or I ſhould have been apt to forget now, that I ever was unhappy.</p>
               <p>And, pray, let me aſk, Ladies, Can you gueſs what is become of my illneſs? I was very ill, you know, when you, Lady G. did us the honour of a viſit; ſo ill, that I could not hide it from you, and my other dear friends, as fain I would have done. I did not think it was an illneſs of ſuch a nature, as that its cure depended on an eaſy heart. I wa ſo much convinced of the merits of Lady Clementina, and that no other woman in the world ought to be Lady Grandiſon, that I thought I had pretty tolerably quieted my heart in that expectation. I hope I brag not too ſoon. But, my dear, I now ſee! ſo eaſy, ſo light, ſo happy—that I hardly know what's the matter with me—But I hope nobody will <hi>find</hi> the malady I have <hi>loſt.</hi> May no diſappointed heart be invaded by it! Let it not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to Italy! The dear Lady there has ſuffered enough from a worſe malady! Nor, if it ſtay in the iſland, let it come near the ſighing heart of my Emily! That dear girl ſhall be happy, if it be in my power to make her ſo. Pray, Ladies, tell her ſhe ſhall.—No, but don't: I will tell her ſo myſelf by the next poſt. Nor let it, I pray God, attack Lady Anne S. or any of the half-ſcore Ladies, of whom once I was ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1185400106:119"/>
Our diſcourſe at table was on various ſubjects. My couſin James was again very inquiſitive after the principal courts, and places of note, in Italy.</p>
               <p>What pleaſure do I hope one day to receive from the peruſal (if I ſhall be favoured with it) of Sir Charles's LITERARY JOURNAL, mentioned to Dr. Bartlett, in ſome of his Letters from Italy: For it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, I preſume, a deſcription of palaces, cities, cabinets of the curious, diverſions, amuſements, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, of different nations. How attentive were we all, to the anſwers he made to my couſin James's que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions! My memory ſerves but for a few generals; and thoſe I will not trouble you with. Sir Charles told my couſin that if he were determined on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion abroad, he would furniſh him with recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Letters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greville and his inſult were one of our ſubjects after dinner, when the ſervants were withdrawn. Lucy expreſſed her wonder, that he was ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Sir Charles, after the menaces he had for years paſt thrown out againſt any man who ſhould be likely to ſucceed with me.</p>
               <p>My uncle obſerved, that Mr. Greville had not for a long time had any hopes; that he always was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that if Sir Charles Grandiſon were to make his addreſſes, he would ſucceed: That it had been his and Fenwick's cuſtom, to endeavour to bluſter away their competitors <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Vol. 1. Letter ii. p. 5. 6.</note>. He poſſibly, my uncle added, might hope to intimidate Sir Charles; or at leaſt, knowing his principles, might ſuppoſe he ran no riſque in the attempt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deane ſaid, Mr. Greville had told him, that the moment he knew Miſs Byron had choſen her man, he would give up his pretenſions; but that, as long as ſhe remained ſingle, he was determined to perſecute her, as he himſelf called it. Perſeverance he had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1185400106:120"/>
known do every-thing, after an admired woman had run through her circle of humble ſervants, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps found herſelf diſappointed in her own choice; and for his part, but with <hi>her,</hi> he had no fondneſs for the married life; he cared not who knew it.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles ſpoke of Mr. Greville with candour. He thought him a man of rough manners, but not ill-natured. He affected to be a joker, and often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be taken for a worſe man than he really was. He believed him to be careleſs of his reputation, and one who ſeemed to think there were wit and bravery in advancing free and uncommon things; and gloried in bold ſurprizes. For my part, continued he, I ſhould hardly have conſented to cultivate his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, much leſs to dine with him to-morrow, but as he inſiſted upon it, as a token of my for giving in him a behaviour that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> really what a gentleman ſhould not have pardoned himſelf for. I conſidered him, proceed Sir Charles, as a neighbour to this family, with whom you had lived, and perhaps choſe to live, upon good terms. Bad neighbours are nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances, eſpecially if they are people of fortune: It is in the power of ſuch to be very troubleſome in their own <hi>perſons;</hi> and they will often let looſe their <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> to defy, provoke, inſult, and do miſchief to thoſe they love not. Mr. Greville I thought, added he, deſerved to be the more indulged, for the ſake of his Love to Miſs Byron. He is a proud man, and muſt be mortified enough in having it generally known that ſhe had conſtantly rejected his ſuit.</p>
               <p>Why that's true, ſaid my uncle. Sir Charles, you conſider every-body. But I hope all's over between you.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but it is, Mr. Selby. Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's whole aim now, ſeems to be, to come off with as little abatement of his pride, as poſſible. He thinks, if he can paſs to the world as one who having no hope himſelf, is deſirous to pronounce the cauſe of his friend,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1185400106:121"/>
as he will acknowledge me to be, it will give him conſequence in the eye of the world, and be a gentle method of letting his pride down eaſy.</p>
               <p>Very well, ſaid my uncle; and a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance for a proud man, I think.</p>
               <p>It is an expedient of his friend Fenwick, replied Sir Charles; and Mr. Greville is not a little fond of it. And what, Ladies and Gentlemen, will you ſay, if you ſhould ſee me come to church to-morrow with him, ſit with him in the ſame pew, and go with him to dinner in his coach? It is his requeſt that I will. He thinks this will put an end to the whiſpers which have paſſed, in ſpite of all his precaution, of a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter between him and me: For he has given out, that he ſtrained his wriſt and arm by a fall from his horſe. Tell me, dear Ladies, ſhall I, or ſhall I not, oblige him in this requeſt? He is to be with me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, for an anſwer.</p>
               <p>My grandmamma ſaid, that Mr. Greville was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a very odd, a very particular man. She thought Sir Charles very kind to <hi>us</hi> in being ſo willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate with him. My uncle declared, that he was very deſirous to live on good terms with all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, particularly with Mr. Greville, a part of whoſe eſtate being intermixed with his, it might be in his power to be vexations, at leaſt to his tenants. Mr. Deane thought the compromiſe was a happy one; and he ſuppoſed entirely agreeable to Sir Charles's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous wiſhes to promote the good underſtanding of neighbours; and to the compaſſion it was in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſhew, to an unſucceſsful rival.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles then turning to Lucy; May I, Miſs Selby, ſaid he, do you think, without being too deep a <hi>deſigner,</hi> aſk leave of Miſs Byron, on the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of her goodneſs to me, to bring Mr. Greville to drink tea with her to-morrow in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Your ſervant, Sir Charles, anſwered Lucy, ſmiling. But what ſay you, couſin Byron, to this queſtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1185400106:122"/>
This houſe is not mine, replied I; but I dare ſay. I may be allowed the liberty, in the names of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and aunt, to anſwer, that any perſon will be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Selby-houſe, whom Sir Charles Grandiſon ſhall think proper to bring with him.</p>
               <p>Mr Greville, ſaid Sir Charles, profeſſes himſelf unable to ſee any of you (Miſs Byron, in particular) without an introductor. He makes a high compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, when he ſuppoſes me to be a proper one. If you give me leave, bowing to my uncle and aunt, I will anſwer him to his wiſhes; and hope, when he comes, every-thing will be paſſed by in ſilence that happened between him and me.</p>
               <p>Two or three lively things paſſed between Lucy and Sir Charles, on his repetition of her word <hi>deſigner.</hi> She began with advantage, but did not hold it; yet he gave her conſequence in the little debate, at his own expence.</p>
               <p>My grandmamma will go to her own church; but will be here at dinner, and the reſt of the day. I have a thouſand things more to ſay, all agreeable; but it is now late, and a drowſy fit has come upon me. I will welcome it. Adieu, adieu, my dear Ladies! Felicitate, I am ſure you will,</p>

                  <p>WE were told, there would be a crouded church this morning, in expectation of ſeeing the new humble ſervant of Miſs Byron attending her thither: For it is every-where known, that Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon is come down to make his addreſſes to the young creature who is happy in every one's love and good
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1185400106:123"/>
wiſhes, and all is now ſaid to have been ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us, by his noble ſiſter, and Lord G. and Dr. Bartlett, when they were with us.—And we are to be married—O my dear Lady G! you cannot imagine how ſoon. You ſee what credit you did us by your kind viſit, my dear.</p>
                  <p>Many of the neighbourhood ſeemed diſappointed, when they ſaw me led in by my uncle, as Mr. Deane led my aunt, and Nancy and Lucy only attended by their brother. But it was not long before Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, Mr. Fenwick, and Sir Charles, entered and went into the pew of the former, which is over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ours. Mr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick bowed low to us, ſeverally, the moment they went into the pew, and to ſeveral others of the gentry.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles had firſt other devoirs to pay: To falſe ſhame, you have ſaid, he was always ſuperior. I was delighted to ſee the example he ſet. He paid us his ſecond compliments with a grace peculiar to himſelf. I felt my face glow, on the whiſpering that went round. I thought I read in every eye, admiration of him, even through the ſticks of ſome of the Ladies fans.</p>
                  <p>What a difference was there between the two men and him, in their behaviour, throughout both the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſermon! Yet who ever beheld two of the three ſo decent, ſo atttentive, ſo <hi>reverent,</hi> I may ſay, before? Were all who call themſelves gentlemen (thought I, more than once) like <hi>this,</hi> the world would yet be a good world.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Greville had his arm in a ſling. He ſeemed highly delighted with his gueſt; ſo did Mr. Fenwick. When the ſermon was ended, Mr. Greville held the pew-door ready opened, to attend our movements; and when we were in motion to go, he, taking offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly Sir Charles's hand, bent towards us Sir Charles met us at our pew-door: He approached us with that eaſy grace peculiar to himſelf, and offered, with a profound reſpect his hand to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1185400106:124"/>
This was equal to a public declaration. It took every-body's attention. He is not aſhamed to avow in public, what he thinks fit to own in private.</p>
                  <p>I was humbled more than exalted by the general notice. Mr. Greville (bold, yet low man! made a motion, as if he gave the hand that Sir Charles took. Mr. Fenwick offered his hand to Lucy. Mr. Greville led my aunt; and not ſpeaking low (ſubtle as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent!) My plaguy horſe, ſaid he, looking at his ſling, knew not his maſter. I invite myſelf to tea with you, madam, in the afternoon. You will ſupply my lame arm, I hope, yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch thing as keeping private one's movements in a country-town, if one would. One of our ſervants reported the general approbation. It is a pleaſure, ſurely, my dear Ladies, to be addreſſed to by a man of whom every one approves. What a poor figure muſt ſhe make, who gives way to a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from a man whom every-body blames her for encouraging! Such women indeed generally confeſs indirectly the ſolly, by carrying on the affair clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely.</p>

                  <p>O MY dear! I have been ſtrangely diſconcerted by means of Mr. Greville. He is a ſtrange man. But I will lead to it in courſe.</p>
                  <p>We all went to church again in the afternoon. Every-body who knew Mr. Greville, took it for a high pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Are you not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, my dear Lady G. that wickedneſs may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways put out of countenance by a perſon who has an eſtabliſhed character for goodneſs, and who is not aſhamed of doing his duty in the public eye?

                  </p>
                  <p>Sir Charles conducted my aunt to her coach, as Mr. Greville officiouſly, but properly for hi views, did me. We found Mr. Fenwick at Selby-houſe talking to my grandmamma on the new ſubject. She dined with us; but, not being very well, choſe to retire to her devotions in my cloſet, while we went to church, ſhe having been at her own in the morning.</p>
                  <p>We all received Mr. Greville with civility. He affects to be thought a wit, you know, and a great joker. Some men cannot appear to advantage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making their friend a butt to ſhoot at. Fenwick and he tried to play upon each other, as uſual. Sir Charles lent each his ſmile; and, whatever he thought of them, ſhewed not a contempt of their great-boy ſnip-ſnap. But, at laſt, my grandmamma and aunt engaged Sir Charles in a converſation, which made the gentlemen ſo ſilent, and ſo attentive, that had they not flaſhed a good deal at each other before, one might have thought them a little diſcreet.</p>
                  <p>Nobody took the leaſt notice of what had paſſed between Mr. Greville and Sir Charles, till Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville touched upon the ſubject to me. He deſired an audience of ten minutes, as he ſaid; and, upon his declaration, that it was the laſt he would ever ask of me on the ſubject; and, upon my grandmamma's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oblige Mr. Greville, my dear; I permitted him to draw me to the window.</p>
                  <p>His addreſs was nearly in the following words; not ſpeaking ſo low, but every one might hear him, tho' he ſaid aloud, Nobody muſt but me:</p>
                  <p>I muſt account myſelf very unhappy, madam, in having never been able to incline you to ſhew me
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1185400106:126"/>
favour. You may think me vain: I believe I am ſo: But I may take to myſelf the advantages and qualities which every-body allows me. I have an eſtate that will warrant my addreſſes to a woman of the firſt rank; and it it is free, and unincumbered. I am not an ill-natured man. I love my jeſt, 'tis true; but I love my friend. You good women generally do not like a man the leſs for having ſomething to mend in him. I could ſay a great deal more in my own behalf, but that Sir Charles Grandiſon (looking at him) quite eclipſes me. Devil fetch me, if I can tell how to think myſelf <hi>any</hi> -thing before him. I was always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him. But when I heard he was gone abroad, in purſuit of a former Love, I thought I had another chance for it.</p>
                  <p>Yet I was half-afraid of Lord D. His mother would manage a Machiavel. He has a great eſtate; a title; he has good qualities for a nobleman. But when I found that you could ſo ſteadily refuſe him, as well as me; There muſt be ſome man, thought I, who is lord of her heart. <hi>Fenwick</hi> is as ſad a dog as I; it cannot be he. <hi>Orme,</hi> poor ſoul! ſhe will not have ſuch a milk-ſop as that, neither—</p>
                  <p>Mr. Orme, Sir, interrupted I, and was going to praiſe him—But he ſaid, I will be heard out now: This is my dying ſpeech; I will not be interrupted.</p>
                  <p>Well then, Sir, ſmiling, come to your laſt words, as ſoon as you can.</p>
                  <p>I have told you, before now, Miſs Byron, that I will not bear your ſmiles. But now ſmiles or frowns, I care not. I have no hopes left; and I am reſolved to abuſe you before I have done.</p>
                  <p>Abuſe me! I hope not, Sir.</p>
                  <p>'Hope not!' What ſignify <hi>your</hi> hopes, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave me any? But hear me out. I ſhall ſay ſome thing that will diſpleaſe you; but more of another nature. I went on gueſſing who could be the happy man. That <hi>ſecond</hi> Orme, Fowler, cannot be he,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1185400106:127"/>
thought I. Is it the newly-arrived Beauchamp? He is a pretty fellow enough [I had all your footſteps watched, as I told you I would.] No, anſwered I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe refuſed Lord D. and a whole tribe of us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Beauchamp came to England—Who the devil can he be?—But when I heard that the dangerous man, whom I hadt hought gone abroad to his matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial deſtiny, was returned, unmarried; when I heard that he was actually coming northward; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be again afraid of him.</p>
                  <p>Laſt Thurſday night I had intelligence, that he was ſeen at Dunſtable in the morning, in his way towards us. Then did my heart fail me. I had my ſpies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Selby-houſe: I own it. What will not Love and Jealouſy make a man do? I underſtood, that your uncle and Mr. Deane, and a tribe of ſervants for train-ſake, were ſet out to meet him. How I raved! How I curſed! How I ſwore!—They will not ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thought I, allow my rival, at his <hi>firſt</hi> viſit, to take up his reſidence under the ſame roof with this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witch!</p>
                  <p>Witch! Mr. Greville—</p>
                  <p>Witch! Yes, Witch! I called you ten thouſand names, in my rage, all as bad as that. Here, Jack, Will, Tom, George, get ready inſtantly each a dozen firebrands! I will light up Selby-houſe for a bonfire, to welcome the arrival of the invader of my freehold! And prongs and pitchforks ſhall be got ready to puſh every ſoul of the family back into the flames, that not one of it may eſcape my vengeance—</p>
                  <p>Horrid man! I will hear no more.</p>
                  <p>You muſt! You ſhall! It is my dying ſpeech, I tell you.—</p>
                  <p>A dying man ſhould be penitent.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe?—I can have no hope. What is to be expected <hi>for</hi> or <hi>from</hi> a deſpairing man?—But then I had intelligence brought me, that my rival was not admitted to take up his abode with you. This
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1185400106:128"/>
ſaved Selby-houſe. All my malice then was againſt the George at Northampton. The keeper of it owes, ſaid I to myſelf, a hundred thouſand obligations to me; yet to afford a retirement to my deadlieſt foe!—But 'tis more manly, thought I, m perſon, to call this invader to account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he pretends an intereſt at Selby-houſe; and to force him to relinquiſh his pretenſions to the Queen of it; as I had made more than one gallant fellow do before, by dint of bluſter.</p>
                  <p>I ſlept not all that night. In the morning I made my viſit at the inn. I pretend to know, as well as any man, what belongs to civility and good manners: but I knew the character of the man I had to deal with: I knew he was cool, yet reſolute. My rage would not let me be civil; and if it would, I knew I muſt be rude to provoke him. I <hi>was</hi> rude. I was perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory.</p>
                  <p>Never was there ſuch cold, ſuch phlegmatlc con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts paſſed upon man, as he paſſed upon me. I came to a point with him. I heard he would not fight: I was reſolved he ſhould. I followed him to his chariot. I got him to a private place; but I had the devil, and no man, to deal with. He cautioned me, by way of inſult, as I took it, to keep a guard. I took his hint. I had better not; for he knew all the tricks of the weapon. He was in with me in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I had no ſword left me, and my life was at the mercy of his. He gave me up my own ſword—Cautioned me to regard my ſafety—Put up his; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.—I found myſelf ſenſible of a damnable ſtrain. I had no right-arm. I ſlunk away like a thief. He mounted his triumphal car; and purſued his courſe to to the Lady of Selby-houſe. I went home, curſed, ſwore, fell down, and bit the earth.</p>
                  <p>My uncle looked impatient: Sir Charles ſeemed in ſuſpenſe, but attentive. Mr. Greville proceeded:</p>
                  <p>I got Fenwick to go with me, to attend him at night, by appointment. Cripple as I was, I would
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1185400106:129"/>
have provoked him: He would not be provoked: And when I found that he had not expoſed me at Selby-houſe; when I remembered that I owed my ſword and my life to his moderation; when I recollected his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; what he had done by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen; what Bagenhall had told me of him: Why the plague, thought I, ſhould I (hopeleſs as I am of ſucceeding with my charming Byron, whether <hi>he</hi> lives or dies) ſet my face againſt ſuch a man? He is incapable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of inſult or arrogance: Let me (Fenwick adviſed a ſcheme) let me make him my friend to ſave my pride, and the devil take the reſt, Harriet Byron, and all—</p>
                  <p>Wicked man!—You was dying a thouſand words ago—I am ſick of you!—</p>
                  <p>You have not, madam, heard half my dying words yet—But I would not terrify you—Are you terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?—</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles motioned as if he would approach us; but kept his place, on my grandmamma's ſaying, Let us hear his humour out: Mr. Greville was always particular.</p>
                  <p>Terrified, madam! What is <hi>your</hi> being terrified to the ſleepleſs nights, to the tormenting days, you have given me? Curſing darkneſs, curſing light, and moſt myſelf!—O madam! with ſhut teeth, What a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of torments have you been to me!—Well, but now I will haſten to a concluſion, in mercy to you, who, however, never ſhewed me any—</p>
                  <p>I never was cruel, Mr. Greville—</p>
                  <p>But you was; and moſt cruel, when moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered. It was to that ſmiling obligingneſs that I owed my ruin! That gave me hope: that radiance of countenance; and that frozen heart!—O you are a dear deceiver!—But I haſten to conclude my dying ſpeech—Give me your hand!—I will have it—<hi>I will not eat it,</hi> as once I had like to have done.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">'And now madam, hear my parting words—You will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1185400106:130"/>
have the glory of giving to the beſt of men, the beſt of wives. Let it not be long before you do; for the ſake of many, who will hope on till then. As your <hi>Lover,</hi> I muſt hate him: As your <hi>Huſband,</hi> I will love him. He will, he muſt, be kind, affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, grateful, to you; and you will deſerve all his tenderneſs. May you live (the ornaments of human nature as you are) to ſee your children's children; all promiſing to be as good, as worthy, as happy, as yourſelves! And, full of years, full of honour, in one hour may you be tranſlated to that Heaven where only you can be more happy, than you will be, if you are both as happy as I wiſh and expect you to be!'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tears dropt on my cheek, at this unexpected bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo like that of the wicked prophet of old, bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he was expected to curſe <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Balaam, Numb. xxii. &amp; ſeq.</note>.</p>
                  <p>He ſtill held my hand—I will not, without your leave, madam—May I, before I part with it?—He looked at me as if for leave to kiſs my hand, bowing his head upon it.</p>
                  <p>My heart was opened. God bleſs you, Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville! as you have bleſſed me—Be a good man, and he will.—I withdrew not my hand.</p>
                  <p>He kneeled on one knee; eagerly kiſſed my hand, more than once. Tears were in his own eyes. He aroſe, hurried me to Sir Charles, and holding to him my then, through ſurpriſe, half-withdrawn hand—Let me have the pride, the glory, Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, to quit this dear hand to yours. It is only to yours that I would quit it—<hi>Happy, happy, happy, pair!—None but the brave deſerves the fair.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles took my hand—Let this precious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be mine, ſaid he (kiſſing it), mine, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared aſſent of every one here; and preſented me to my grandmamma and aunt. I was frighted by the hurry the ſtrange man had put me into—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1185400106:131"/>
May I <hi>but</hi> live to ſee her yours, Sir! ſaid my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma, in a kind of rapture!</p>
                  <p>The moment he had put my hand into Sir Charles's, he ran out of the room, with the utmoſt precipitation. He was gone, quite gone, when he came to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after; and every-body was uneaſy for him, till we were told, by one of the ſervants, that he took from the window of the outward parlour his hat and ſword; and by anotehr, that he met him, his ſervant after him, hurrying away, and even ſobbing as he flew.—Was there ever ſo ſtrange a man?</p>
                  <p>Don't you pity Mr. Greville, my dear?</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles was generouſly uneaſy for him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Greville, ſaid Lucy (who had always charity for him) has frequently ſurpriſed us with his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities; but I hope, from the laſt part of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that he is not the free-thinking man he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times affects to be thought. I flatter myſelf, that Sir Charles had a righter notion of him than we, in what he ſaid of him yeſterday.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles waited on my grandmamma home; ſo we had him not to ſupper. We are all to dine with her to-morrow. Your brother, you may ſuppoſe, will be a principal gueſt.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE a Letter from my Emily; by which I find, ſhe is with you; tho' ſhe has not dated it. You was very kind in ſhewing the dear girl the overflowings of my heart in her favour.

by ſeveral ſtages. And yet, from what he intimated laſt night, as he waited on my grandmamma to Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-manor, I find, that his expectations are forwarder than it will be poſſible for me to anſwer: And I muſt, without intending the leaſt affectation, for common decorum-ſake, take the management of this point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on myſelf. For, my dear, we are every one of us here ſo much in Love with him, that the moment he ſhould declare his wiſhes, they would be as ready to urge me t oblige him, were he even to limit me but to two or three days; as if they were afraid he would not repeat his requeſt.</p>
                  <p>I have a Letter from Mr. Beauchamp. He writes, that there are no hopes of Sir Harry's recovery. I am very ſorry for it. He does me great honour to write to me to give him conſolation. His is a charming Letter—So full of ſilial piety!—Excellent young man! He breathes in it the true ſpirit of his <hi>friend.</hi>

                  <p>Sir Charles and his Beauchamp, and Dr. Bartlett, correſpond, I preſume, as uſual. What would I give to ſee all Sir Charles writes that relates to us!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Fenwick juſt now tells us, that Mr. Greville is not well, and keeps his chamber. He has my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial wiſhes for his health. His laſt behaviour to me appears, the more I think of it, more ſtrange, from ſuch a man. I expected not that he would conclude with ſuch generous wiſhes. Nancy, who does not love him, ſays, that it was ſuch an overſtrain of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity from him, that it might well over-ſet him.

               <p>WE have been very happy this day at my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma's. Your brother makes himſelf more and more beloved by all my friends; who yet declare, that they thought they could not have loved him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they did before. My couſin Holles's ſay, they could ſooner lay open their hearts to him, than to any man they ever ſaw; yet their freedom would never make them loſe ſight of their reſpect.</p>
               <p>He told me, that he had breakfaſted with Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville. How does he conciliate the mind of every one to him! He ſaid kind and compaſſionate things of Mr. Greville; and <hi>ſo</hi> unaffectedly!—I was delighted with him. For, regardful as he would be, and is, of his own honour; no low, narrow jealouſy, I dare ſay, will ever have entrance into his heart. <hi>Charity think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no evil!</hi> Of what a charming text is that a part <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii. 5.</note>!—What is there equal to it, in any of the writings of the philoſophers?</p>
               <p>My dear Miſs Byron, ſaid he to me, Mr. Greville loves you more than you can poſſibly imagine. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of ſucceſs with you, he has aſſumed airs of bravery; but your name is written in large letters in his heart. He gave me continued he, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of aſking my <hi>leave</hi> to love you ſtill.—What <hi>ought</hi> I to have anſwered?—</p>
               <p>What <hi>did</hi> you anſwer, Sir?</p>
               <p>That ſo far as I might preſume to give it, I gave it.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1185400106:134"/>
Had I the honour, added I, of calling Miſs Byron mine, I would not barely <hi>allow</hi> your love of her; I would <hi>demand</hi> it.—Have I not aſſured you, Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, that I look upon you as my <hi>friend?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will quite ſubdue Mr. Greville, Sir, ſaid I. You will, by the generoſity of your treatment of him, do more than any-body elſe ever could—You will make him a good man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Greville, madam, deſerves pity, on more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts than one. A wife, ſuch a one as his good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel led him to wiſh for, would have ſettled his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. He wants ſteadineſs: But he is not, I hope, a bad man. I was not concerned for his cavalier treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of you yeſterday, but on your own account; leſt his roughneſs ſhould give you pain. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding wiſhes, and his preference of a rival to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, together with the manner of his departure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as he was to withſtand his own emotions, and the effect it had upon his ſpirits, ſo as to confine him to his chamber, had ſomething great in it—And I ſhall value him for it, as long as he will permit me.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles and my grandmamma had a good deal of talk together. Dearly does ſhe love to ſingle him out. What a pretty picture would they make, could they be both drawn ſo as not to cauſe a <hi>profane</hi> jeſter to fall into miſtakes; as if it were an old Lady make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love to a handſome young man.</p>
               <p>Let me ſketch it out—See, then, the dear Lady, with a countenance full of benignity, years written by venerableneſs, rather than by wrinkles, in her face; dignity and familiarity in her manner; one hand on his, talking to him: His ſine countenance ſhining with modeſty and reverence, looking down, delighted, as admiring her wiſdom, and not a little regardful of her half-pointing finger (Let that be, for fear of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes) to a creature young enough to be her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter; who, to avoid ſhewing too much ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſhall ſeem to be talking to two other young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1185400106:135"/>
(Nancy and Lucy, ſuppoſe); but, in order to diſtinguiſh the young creature, let her, with a bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheek, caſt a fly eye on the grandmamma and young gentleman, while the other two ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to look more free and unconcerned.</p>
               <p>See, my dear, how fanciful I am: But I had a mind to tell you, in a new manner, how my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and Sir Charles ſeem to admire each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deane and he had alſo ſome talk together; my uncle joined them: And I bluſhed in <hi>earneſt</hi> at the ſubject I only <hi>gueſſed</hi> at from the following words of Mr. Deane, at Sir Charles's riſing to come from them to my aunt and me, who both of us ſat in the bow-window. My dear Sir Charles Grandiſon, ſaid Mr. Deane, you love to give pleaſure: I never was ſo happy in my life, as I am in view of this long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhed-for event. You <hi>muſt</hi> oblige me: I inſiſt upon it.</p>
               <p>My aunt took it, as I did.—A generous contention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid ſhe. O my dear! we ſhall all be too happy. God grant that nothing may fall out to diſconcert us! If there <hi>ſhould,</hi> how many broken hearts—</p>
               <p>The firſt broken one, madam, interrupted I, would be the happieſt: I, in that caſe, ſhould have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of every-body.</p>
               <p>Dear love! you are too ſerious (Tears were in my eyes): Sir Charles's unqueſtionable honour is our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity!—If Clementina be ſtedfaſt; if life and health be ſpared you and him—If—</p>
               <p>Dear, dear madam, no more <hi>Ifs!</hi> Let there be but one <hi>If,</hi> and that on Lady Clementina's reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In that caſe, I will ſubmit; and God only [as indeed He always ought] ſhall be my reliance for the reſt of my life.</p>
               <p>Lucy, Nancy, and my two couſin Holles's came and ſpread, two and two, the other ſeats of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>window [there are but three] with their vaſt hoops: undoubtedly, becauſe they ſaw Sir Charles coming to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1185400106:136"/>
us. It is difficult, whiſpered I to my aunt [petulantly enough], to get him one moment to one's ſelf. My couſin James (Silly youth! thought I) <hi>ſtopt</hi> him in his way to me: but Sir Charles would not long be ſtopt: He led the interrupter towards us; and a ſeat not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at hand, while the young Ladies were making a buſtle to give him a place between them [toſſing their hoops above their ſhoulders on one ſide] and my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin James was haſtening to bring him a chair; he threw himſelf at the ſeet of my aunt and me, making the floor his feat.</p>
               <p>I don't know how it was; but I thought I never ſaw him look to more advantage. His attitude and behaviour had ſuch a Lover-like appearance—Don't you ſee him, my dear?—His amiable countenance, <hi>ſo</hi> artleſs, yet <hi>ſo</hi> obliging, caſt up to my aunt and me: His fine eyes meeting ours; mine, particularly, in their <hi>own</hi> way; for I could not help looking down, with a kind of proud baſhfulneſs, as Lucy told me afterwards. How affected muſt I have appeared, had I either turned my head aſide, or looked ſtiffly up, to avoid his!</p>
               <p>I believe, my dear, we women in courtſhp don't love, that men, if ever ſo wiſe, ſhould keep up to <hi>us</hi> the dignity of wiſdom; much leſs that they ſhould be ſolemn, formal, grave—Yet are we fond of reſpect and obſervance too.—How is it?—Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon can tell.—Did you think of your brother, Lady G. when you once ſaid, that the man who would commend himſelf to the general favour of us young women, ſhould be a Rake in his addreſs, and a Saint in his heart? Yet might you not have choſen a better word than <hi>Rake?</hi> Are there not more clumſy and fooliſh Rakes, than polite ones; except we can be ſo miſtaken, as to give to impudence the name of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able freedom?</p>
               <p>Sir Charles ſell immediately into the eaſieſt (ſhall I ſay the gallanteſt?) the moſt agreeable converſation, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1185400106:137"/>
if he muſt be all of a piece with the freedom of his attitude; and mingled in his talk, two or three very pretty humourous ſtories; ſo that nobody thought of helping him again to a chair, or wiſhing him in one.</p>
               <p>How did this little incident familiarize the amiable man, as a ſtill <hi>more</hi> amiable man than before, to my heart! In one of the little tales, which was of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in Spain ſerenading his miſtreſs; we aſked him, if he could not remember a ſonnet he ſpoke of, as a pretty one? He, without anſwering, ſung it in a moſt agreeable manner; and, at Lucy's requeſt, gave us the Engliſh of it.</p>
               <p>It is a very pretty ſonnet, I will aſk him for a copy, and ſend it to you, who underſtand the language.</p>
               <p>My grandmamma, on Sir Charles's ſinging, beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to my couſin James who going to her, ſhe whiſpered him. He ſtept out, and preſently returned with a violin, and ſtruck up, as he entered, a minuet-tune Harriet, my love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called out my grandmama. Without any other intimation, the moſt agreeable of men, in an inſtant, was on his feet, reached his hat, and took me out.</p>
               <p>How were we applauded! How was my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma delighted! The words charming couple, were whiſpered round, but loud enough to be heard. And when we had done, he led me to my ſeat with an air that had all the real fine gentleman in it. But then he ſat not down as before.—</p>
               <p>I wonder if Lady Clementina ever danced with him.</p>
               <p>My aunt, at Lucy's whiſpered requeſt, propoſed a dance between Sir Charles and her. You, Lady G. obſerved, more than once, that Lucy dances finely. Inſulter! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

An admirable converſation followed at tea, in which my grandmother, aunt, my Lucy, and Sir Charles, bore the chief parts; every other perſon delighting to be ſilent.</p>
               <p>Had we not, Lady G. a charming day?</p>
               <p>In my next I ſhall have an opportunity, perhaps, to tell you what kind of a travelling companion Sir Charles is. For, be pleaſed to know, that for ſome time paſt a change of air, and a little excurſion from place to place, have been preſcribed for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my health, by one of the honeſteſt phyſicians in England. The day before Sir Charles came into theſe parts, it was fixed, that to-morrow we ſhould ſet out upon this tour. On his arrival, we had thoughts of poſtponing it; but, having underſtood our intention, he inſiſted upon its being proſecuted; and, offering his company, there was no declining the favour, you know, <hi>early</hi> days as they, however, are: And altho' every body abroad talks of the occaſion of his viſit to us; he has been ſo far from directing his ſervants to make a ſecret of it, that he has ordered his Saunders to anſwer to every curious queſtioner, that Sir Charles and I were of longer acquaintance than yeſterday. But, is not this, my dear, a cogent intimation that Sir Charles thinks ſome parade, ſome delay, neceſſary? Yet don't <hi>he</hi> and <hi>we</hi> know how little a while ago it is, that he made his firſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What, my dear (ſhould he be ſolicitous for an early day) is the inference? My uncle, too, ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that I am afraid of him.</p>
               <p>We are to ſet out to-morrow morning. Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough is to be our furtheſt ſtage, one way. Mr. Deane inſiſts, that we ſhall paſs two or three days with him. All of us, but my grandmamma, are to be of his party.</p>
               <p>O MY dear Lady G. what a Letter is juſt brought me, by the hand that carried up mine on Saturday!
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1185400106:139"/>
Bleſs me! what an anſwer!—This wicked wiſh!—But I have not time to enter into ſo large a field. Let me only ſay, That for ſome parts I moſt heartily thank you and dear Lady L.; for others, I do not; and imagine Lady L. would not have ſubſcribed her beloved name, had ſhe read the whole. What charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits have you, my dear, dear Lady G.!—But, Adieu, my ever-amiable Ladies, both!</p>

                  <p>WE paſſed ſeveral hours at Boughton <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The ſeat of the late Duke of Montagu.</note>, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here in the afternoon. Mr. Deane had inſiſted that we ſhould put up at a nephew's of his, in the neighbourhood of this town. The young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man met us at Oundle, and conducted us to the houſe. I have got ſuch a habit of ſcribbling, that I cannot forbear applying to my pen at every opportunity. The leſs wonder, when I have your brother for my ſubject; and the two beloved ſiſters of that brother to write to.</p>
                  <p>It would be almoſt impertinent to praiſe a man for his horſemanſhip, who in his early youth was ſo noted for the performance of all his exerciſes, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and General W. thought of the military life for him. Eaſe and unaffected dignity diſtinguiſh him in all his accompliſhments. Bleſs me, madam! ſaid Lucy to my aunt, on more occaſions than one, this man is every-thing!</p>
                  <p>Shall I own, that I am retired to my pen, juſt now, from a very bad motive? <hi>Anger.</hi> I am, in my heart, even peeviſh with <hi>all</hi> my friends, for cluſtering ſo about Sir Charles, that he can hardly obtain a moment
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1185400106:140"/>
(which he ſeems to ſeek for too) to talk with me alone. My uncle [He <hi>does</hi> dote upon him] always inconſiderately ſtands in his way; and can I ſay to a man ſo <hi>very</hi> inclinable to raillery, that he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>me</hi> more, and <hi>himſelf</hi> leſs, of Sir Charles's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? I wonder my <hi>aunt</hi> does not give my uncle a hint. But ſhe loves Sir Charles's company as well as my uncle.</p>
                  <p>This, however, is nothing to the diſtreſs my uncle gave me at dinner this day. Sir Charles was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon the diſpoſition of one part of the gardens at Boughton, That Art was to be but the handmaid of Nature—I have heard, Sir Charle, ſaid my uncle, that you have made that a rule with you at Grandiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall. With what pleaſure ſhould I make a viſit there to <hi>you and my niece</hi>—</p>
                  <p>He ſtopt. He <hi>needed not:</hi> He might have ſaid any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after this. Sir Charles looked as if concerned for <hi>me;</hi> yet ſaid, that would be a joyful viſit to him. My aunt was vexed for <hi>my</hi> ſake. Lucy gave my uncle <hi>ſuch</hi> a look!—</p>
                  <p>My uncle afterwards indeed apologized to me—<hi>Ads-heart,</hi> I was a little blunt, I believe. But what <hi>a duce</hi> need there be theſe niceties obſerved when you are <hi>ſure?</hi>—I am ſorry, however—But it would out—Yet you, Harriet, made it worſe by looking ſo ſilly.</p>
                  <p>WHAT, Lady G. can I do with this dear man? My uncle, I mean. He has been juſt making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal to me, as he calls it, and with ſuch <hi>honeſt</hi> looks of forecaſt and wiſdom—Look-ye, Harriet—I ſhall be always blundering about your <hi>ſcrupuloſities.</hi> I am come to propoſe ſomething to you that will put it out of my power to make miſtake—I beg of you and your aunt to allow me to enter with Sir Charles into a certain ſubject; and this not for your ſake—I know you won't allow of that—But for the <hi>eaſe of Sir Charles's own heart.</hi> Gratitude is <hi>my</hi> motive, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1185400106:141"/>
ought to be <hi>yours.</hi> I am ſure he loves the very ground you tread upon.</p>
                  <p>I beſought him for <hi>every</hi> ſake dear to himſelf, not to interfere in the matter; but to leave theſe ſubjects to my aunt and me.—Conſider, Sir, ſaid I, <hi>conſider,</hi> how very lately the firſt perſonal declaration was made.</p>
                  <p>I do, I will conſider every-thing—But there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger between the cup and the lip.</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir (my hands and eyes lifted up) was all the anſwer I could make. He went from me haſtily, muttering good-naturedly againſt <hi>Femalities.</hi>

                  <p>MR. DEANE'S pretty box you have ſeen. Sir Charles is pleaſed with it. We looked in at Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingay-caſtle <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The priſon of Mary Queen of Scots.</note>, Milton <note n="(b)" place="bottom">The ſeat of Earl Fitzwilliams.</note>, &amp;c. Mr. Charles Deane, a very obliging and ſenſible young gentleman, attended his uncle all the way.</p>
                  <p>What charming deſcriptions of fine houſes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities abroad did Sir Charles give us when we ſtopt to bait, or to view the pictures, furniture, gardens, of the houſes we ſaw!</p>
                  <p>In every place, on every occaſion, on the road, or when we alighted, or put up, he ſhewed himſelf ſo conſiderate, ſo gallant, ſo courteous, to allow who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, and <hi>ſo</hi> charitable!—Yet not indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately to every-body that aſked him: But he was bountiful indeed, on repreſentation of the miſery of two honeſt families. Beggars born, or thoſe who make begging a trade, if in health, and not lame or blind, have ſeldom, it ſeems, any ſhare in his muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicence: But perſons fallen from competence, and ſuch as ſtruggle with ſome inſtant diſtreſs, or have large families, which they have not ability to maintain; theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the objects of his bounty. Richard Saunders, who is ſometimes his almoner,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1185400106:142"/>
told my Sally, that he never goes out but ſomebody is the better for him: and that his <hi>manner</hi> of beſtowing his charity is <hi>ſuch,</hi> as, together with the poor peoples bleſſings and prayers for him, often draws tears from his eyes.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE over-heard a dialogue that has juſt now paſſed between my uncle and aunt. There is but a thin partition between the room they were in, and mine; and he ſpoke loud; my aunt now low; yet earneſt only, not angry. He had been propoſing to her, as he had done to me, to enter into a certain ſubject, in pity to Sir Charles: None had he for his poor niece. No doubt, but he thought he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging me; and that my objection was only owing to <hi>Femality,</hi> as he calls it; a word I don't like. I never heard it from Sir Charles.</p>
                  <p>My aunt was not at all pleaſed with his motion. She wiſhed, as <hi>I</hi> had done, that he would not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in theſe <hi>nice</hi> matters. He took offence at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion becauſe of the word <hi>nice.</hi> She ſaid, He was too precipitating, a great deal: She did not doubt but Sir Charles would be full early in letting me know his expectations.</p>
                  <p>She ſpoke more deciſively than ſhe is uſed to do. He cannot bear her chidings, tho' ever ſo gentle. I need not tell you, that he both loves and reveres her; but, as one of the lords of the creation, is apt to be jealous of his prerogatives. You uſed to be diverted with his honeſt particularities.</p>
                  <p>What an <hi>ignoramus</hi> you women and girls make of me, Dame Selby! ſaid he. I know nothing of the world, nor of men and women, that's certain. I am always to be <hi>documented</hi> by you and your <hi>minxes!</hi> But the <hi>duce</hi> take your <hi>niceties:</hi> You don't, you can't, poor ſouls, as you are, diſtinguiſh <hi>men.</hi> You muſt all of you go on in one <hi>rig-my-roll</hi> way; in one beaten track. Who the <hi>duce</hi> would have thought it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1185400106:143"/>
needful, when a girl, and we all were wiſhing till our very hearts were <hi>burſting,</hi> for this man, when he was not in his own power, would think you muſt now come with your <hi>hums,</hi> and your <hi>haws,</hi> and the whole <hi>circum-roundabouts</hi> of female nonſenſe, to <hi>ſtave off</hi> the point your hearts and ſouls are ſet upon? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Dame Selby, tho' ſo long ago, how <hi>you</hi> treated your future Lord and Maſter when you <hi>prank'd</hi> it, as Lady and Miſtreſs. You vexed my very Soul, I can tell you that! And often, and often, when I left you, I ſwore bitterly, that I never would come again as a Lover—tho' I was a poor forſworn wretch—God forgive me!</p>
                  <p>My dear Mr. Selby, you ſhould not remember paſt things. You had very odd ways—I was afraid, for a good while, of venturing with you at all—</p>
                  <p>Now, Dame Selby, I have you at a <hi>why-not,</hi> or I never had; tho', by the way, your <hi>un</hi> -evenneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed my oddneſs.—But what oddneſs is in Sir Charles Grandiſon? If he is not <hi>even,</hi> neither you nor I were ever <hi>odd.</hi> What reaſon is there for <hi>him</hi> to run the <hi>Female gauntlope?</hi> I pity the excellent man; remembering how I was formerly vexed myſelf—I hate this <hi>ſhilly-ſhally</hi> fooling; the <hi>know your-mind</hi> and <hi>not</hi> know-your-mind nonſenſe. As I hope to <hi>live and breathe,</hi> I'll, I'll, I'll blow you all up, without <hi>gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder</hi> or <hi>oatmeal,</hi> if an honeſt gentleman is thus to be fooled with; and after ſuch a Letter too from his friend Jeronymo, in the names of the whole family, Lady G. for my money! [Ah, thought I, Lady G. gives better advice than ſhe even <hi>wiſhes</hi> to know how to take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] I like her notion of parallel lines!—Sir Charles Grandiſon is none of your <hi>gew-gaw-whip-jacks,</hi> that you know not where to have. But I tell you, Dame Selby, that neither you nor your niece know how, with your <hi>fine</hi> ſouls, and <hi>fine</hi> ſenſe, to go out of the common <hi>ſemality-path,</hi> when you get a man into your gin, however ſuperior he is to common
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1185400106:144"/>
                     <hi>infanglements,</hi> and low chicanery, and <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> forms, as Sir Charles properly called them, in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the little <hi>pug's-face.</hi> [I <hi>do</hi> love her, with all her pretty ape's tricks: For what are you all, but, right or wrong, apes of one another?] And do you think, with <hi>all your wiſdom,</hi> he ſees not through you? He does; and, as a wiſe man, muſt deſpiſe you all, with your <hi>femalities</hi> and <hi>forſooths</hi>—</p>
                  <p>No femality, Mr. Selby, is deſigned—No—</p>
                  <p>I am impatient, Dame Selby, light of my eye, and dear to my heart and ſoul, as you are; I will take my own way, in this. I have no mind that the two deareſt creatures in the world, to me, ſhould render themſelves <hi>deſpiſable</hi> in the eyes of a man they want to think highly of them. And here if I put in, and ſay but a wry word, as you think it—I am to be called to account.—</p>
                  <p>My dear, did you not begin the ſubject? ſaid my aunt.</p>
                  <p>I am to be cloſetted, and to be <hi>documentized,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded he—Not another word of your <hi>documentations,</hi> Dame Selby! I am not in a humour to bear them: I will take my own way—And that's enough.</p>
                  <p>And then, I ſuppoſe, he ſtuck his hands in his ſides, as he does when he is good-humouredly angry; and my aunt, at ſuch times, gives up, till a more convenient opportunity, and then ſhe always carries her point (And why? Becauſe ſhe is always reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able); for which he calls her a <hi>Parthian</hi> woman.</p>
                  <p>I heard her ſay, as he ſtalked out royally, repeating, that he would take his own way; I ſay no more, Mr. Selby—Only conſider—</p>
                  <p>Oy, and let Harriet conſider, and do <hi>you</hi> conſider, Dame Selby: Sir Charles Grandiſon is not a common man.</p>
                  <p>I did not let my aunt know that I heard this ſpeech of my uncle: She only ſaid to me, when ſhe ſaw me, I have had a little debate with your uncle: We muſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1185400106:145"/>
do as well as we can with him, my dear. He means well.</p>

Lucy was the laſt that went; and the moment ſhe was withdrawn, while I was thinking to retire to dreſs, he placed himſelf by me: Think me not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, my dear Miſs Byron, ſaid he, that I take al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only opportunity which has offered of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a ſubject that is next my heart.</p>
                  <p>I found my face glow. I was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>You have given me hope, madam: All your friends encourage that hope. I love, I revere, your friends. What I have now to petition for, is, A confirmation of the hope I have preſumed upon. CAN you, madam (the Female delicacy is more delicate than that of man <hi>can</hi> be) unequally as you may think yourſelf circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced with a man who owns that once he could have devoted himſelf to another Lady; CAN you ſay, that the man before you is the man whom you CAN, whom you DO, prefer to any other?</p>
                  <p>He ſtopt; expecting my anſwer.</p>
                  <p>After ſome heſitations, I have been accuſtomed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, ſaid I, by thoſe friends whom you ſo <hi>deſervedly</hi> value, to ſpeak nothing but the ſimpleſt truth. In an article of this moment, I ſhould be inexcuſable, if—</p>
                  <p>I ſtopt. His eyes were fixed upon my face. For my life I could not ſpeak; yet wiſhed to be able to ſpeak—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If,</hi> If <hi>what,</hi> madam? and he ſnatched my hand, bowed his face upon it, held it there, not looking up to mine. I could then ſpeak—If thus urged, and by SIR CHARLES GRANDISON—I did not ſpeak my heart—I anſwer—Sir—I CAN—I DO. I wanted, I thought, juſt then, to ſhrink into myſelf.</p>
                  <p>He kiſſed my hand with fervour; dropt down on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1185400106:146"/>
one knee; again kiſſed it—You have laid me, madam, under everlaſting obligation: And will you permit me, before I riſe—lovelieſt of women, will you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, to beg an early day?—I have many affairs on my hands; many more in deſign, now I am come, as I hope, to ſettle in my native country for the reſt of my life. My chief glory will be, to behave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably in the <hi>private</hi> life. I wiſh not to be a <hi>public</hi> man; and it muſt be a very particular call, for the Service of my King and Country united, that ſhall draw me out into public notice. Make me, madam, ſoon, the happy <hi>husband</hi> I hope to be. I preſcribe not to you the time: But you are above empty forms. May I preſume to hope, it will be before the end of a month to come?</p>
                  <p>He had forgot himſelf. He ſaid, he would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to me.</p>
                  <p>After ſome involuntary heſitations—I am afraid of nothing ſo much, juſt now, Sir, ſaid I, as appearing, to a man of your honour and penetration, affected. Riſe, Sir, I beſeech you! I cannot bear—</p>
                  <p>I will, madam, and riſe as well as kneel, to thank you, when you have anſwered a queſtion ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to my happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Before I could reſume, Only believe me, madam, ſaid he, that my urgency is not the inſolent urgency of one who imagines a Lady will receive as a <hi>compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> his impatience. And if you have no ſcruple that you think of <hi>high</hi> importance, add, I beſeech you, to the obligation you have laid him under to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending goodneſs (and add with that frankneſs of heart which has diſtinguiſhed you in my eyes above all women) the very high one, of an early day.</p>
                  <p>I looked down—I could not look up—I was afraid of being thought affected—Yet how could I ſo ſoon think of obliging him?</p>
                  <p>He proceeded—You are ſilent, madam!—Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious be your ſilence! Allow me to enquire of your
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1185400106:147"/>
                     <hi>aunt,</hi> for your kind, your condeſcending acquieſcence. I will not now urge you further: I will be all hope.</p>
                  <p>Let me ſay, Sir, that I muſt not be precipitated. Theſe are very early days.</p>
                  <p>Much more was in my mind to ſay; but I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated—I could not ſpeak. Surely, my dear Ladies, it was too-too eary an urgency. And can a woman be wholly unobſervant of cuſtom, and the laws of her Sex?—Something is due to faſhion in dreſs, however abſurd that dreſs might have appeared in the laſt age (as theirs do to us) or may in the next: And ſhall not thoſe cuſtoms which have their foundation in modeſty, and are characteriſtic of the gentler Sex, be intitled to excuſe, and more than excuſe?</p>
                  <p>He ſaw my confuſion. Let me not, my deareſt life, diſtreſs you, ſaid he. Beautiful as your emotion is, I cannot enjoy it, if it give you pain. Yet is the queſtion ſo important to me; ſo much is my heart concerned in the favourable anſwer I hope for from your goodneſs; that I muſt not let this opportunity ſlip, except it be your pleaſure that I attend your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination from Mrs. Selby's mouth.—Yet <hi>that</hi> I chooſe not, neither; becauſe I preſume for more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from your own, than you will, on <hi>cold</hi> delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, allow your aunt to ſhew me. Love will plead for its faithful votary in a ſingle breaſt, when conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſuppoſed fit and unfit, the object abſent, will produce delay. But I will retire, for two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You ſhall be my priſoner mean time. Not a ſoul ſhall come in to interrupt us, unleſs it be at your call. I will return, and receive your determination; and if that be the fixing of my happy day, how will you rejoice me!</p>
                  <p>While I was debating within myſelf, whether I ſhould be angry or pleaſed, he returned, and found me walking about the room.—Soul of my hope, ſaid he, taking with reverence my hand; I now preſume that you <hi>can,</hi> that you <hi>will,</hi> oblige me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1185400106:148"/>
You have given me no time, Sir: But let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that you will not expect an anſwer, in relation to the early day you <hi>ſo</hi> early aſk for, till after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of your next Letters from Italy. You ſee how the admirable Lady is urged; how reluctantly ſhe has given them but <hi>diſtant</hi> hopes of complying with their wiſhes. I ſhould be glad to wait for the next Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for thoſe, at leaſt, which will be an anſwer to yours, acquainting them, that there is a woman with whom you think you could be happy. I am earneſt in this requeſt, Sir. Think it not owing to affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I acquieſce, madam. The anſwer to thoſe Letters will ſoon be here. It will indeed be ſome time before I can receive a reply to that I wrote in anſwer to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymo's laſt Letter. I impute not affectation to my deareſt Miſs Byron. I can eaſily comprehend your motive: It is a generous one. But it beſits me to ſay, that the next Letters from Italy, whatever may be their contents, can <hi>now</hi> make no alteration on my part. Have I not declared myſelf to your friends, to you, and to the world?</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, they may make an alteration on mine, highly as I think of the honour Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon does me by his good opinion. For, pardon me, ſhould the moſt excellent of women think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a place in your heart—</p>
                  <p>Let me interrupt you, madam.—It cannot <hi>be,</hi> that Lady Clementina, proceeding, as ſhe has done, on motives of piety, zealous in her religion, and all her relations now earneſt in another man's favour, can alter her mind. I ſhould not have acted with juſtice, with gratitude, to her, had I not tried her ſtedfaſtneſs by every way I could deviſe: Nor, in juſtice to <hi>both</hi> Ladies, would I allow myſelf to apply for <hi>your</hi> favour till I had <hi>her</hi> reſolution confirmed to me under her own hand after my arrival in England. But were it <hi>now</hi> poſſible that ſhe ſhould vary, and were you, madam,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1185400106:149"/>
to hold your determination in my favour ſuſpended; the conſequence would be this; I ſhould never, while that ſuſpence laſted, be the huſband of <hi>any woman on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope, Sir, you will not be diſpleaſed. I did not think you would ſo <hi>ſoon</hi> be ſo <hi>very</hi> earneſt. But this, Sir, I ſay, Let me have reaſon to think, that my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will not be the misfortune of a more excellent woman, and it ſhall be my endeavour to make the man happy who <hi>only</hi> can make me ſo.</p>
                  <p>He claſped me in his arms with an ardor—that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed me not—on reflexion—But at the time ſtartled me. He then thanked me again on one knee. I held out the hand he held not in his, with intent to raiſe him; for I could not ſpeak. He received it as a token of favour; kiſſed it with ardor; aroſe; <hi>again</hi> preſſed my cheek with his lips. I was too much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to repulſe him with anger: But was he not too free? Am I a prude, my dear? In the odious ſenſe of the abuſed word, I am ſure, I am not: But in the beſt ſenſe, as derived from <hi>prudence,</hi> and uſed in oppoſition to a word that denotes a worſe character, I own my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of thoſe who would wiſh to reſtore it to its natural reſpectable ſignification, for the ſake of virtue; which, as Sir Charles himſelf once hinted <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vol. IV. p. 139.</note>, is in danger of ſuffering by the abuſe of it; as Religion once did, by that of the word <hi>Puritan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir Charles, on my making towards the door that led to the ſtairs, withdrew with ſuch a grace, as ſhewed he was capable of recollection.</p>
                  <p>Again I aſk, was he not too free? I will tell you how I judge that he was: When I came to conclude my narrative to my aunt and Lucy, of all that paſſed between him and me, I bluſhed, and could not tell them how free he was. Yet you ſee, Ladies, that I can write it to you two.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles, my uncle, and Mr. Deane, took a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1185400106:150"/>
little walk, and returned juſt as dinner was ready. My uncle took me aſide, and whiſpered to me; I am glad at my heart and ſoul the ice is broken. This is the man of true ſpirit—<hi>Ads-heart,</hi> Harriet, you will be Lady Grandiſon in a fortnight, at furtheſt, I hope. You have had a charming <hi>confabulation,</hi> I doubt not. I can gueſs you have, by Sir Charles's declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more and more delighted with you. And he owns, that he put the queſtion to you.—Hay, Harriet!—Smiling in my face.</p>
                  <p>Every one's eyes were upon me. Sir Charles, I believe, ſaw me look as if I were apprehenſive of my uncle's raillery. He came up to us: My dear Miſs Byron, ſaid he, in my uncle's hearing, I have owned to Mr. Selby, the requeſt I preſumed to make you. I am afraid that he, as well as you, think me too bold and forward. If <hi>you</hi> do, madam, I aſk your pardon: My hopes ſhall always be controuled by your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>This made my uncle complaiſant to me. I was re-aſſured. I was pleaſed to be ſo ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>

                  <p>YOU muſt not, my dear Ladies, expect me to be ſo <hi>very</hi> minute: if I am, muſt I not loſe a hundred charming converſations? One, however, I will give you a little particularly.</p>
                  <p>Your brother deſired leave to attend me in my dreſſing-room—But how can I attempt to deſcribe his air, his manner, or repeat the thouſand agreeable things he ſaid? Inſenſibly he fell into talking of future ſchemes, in a way that punctillo itſelf could not be diſpleaſed with.</p>
                  <p>He had been telling me, that our dear Mr. Deane, having been affected by his laſt indiſpoſition had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my uncle, my aunt, and him, to permit him to lay before them the ſtate of this affairs, and the kind things he intended to do by his own relations; who
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1185400106:151"/>
however, were all in happy circumſtances. After which, he inſiſted upon Sir Charles's being his ſole executor, which he ſcrupled, unleſs ſome other perſon were joined with him in the truſt: But Mr. Deane, being very earneſt on this head, Sir Charles ſaid, I hope I know my own heart. My dear Mr. Deane, you muſt do as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>After ſome other diſcourſe, I ſuppoſe, ſaid I, the good man will not part with us till the beginning of next week.</p>
                  <p>Whenever you leave him, anſwered he, it will be to his regret; it may therefore as well be ſoon: But I am ſorry, methinks, that he, who has qualities which endear him to every one, ſhould be ſo much alone as he is here. I have a great deſire, when I can be ſo happy as to find myſelf a ſettled man, to draw into my neighbourhood friends who will dignify it. Mr. Deane will, I hope, be often our viſiter at the Hall. The love he bears to his dear god-daughter will be his inducement; and the air and ſoil being more dry and wholſome than this ſo near the fens, may be a means to prolong his valuable life.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Bartlett, continued he, has already carried into execution ſome ſchemes which relate to my indigent neighbours, and the lower claſs of my tenants. How does that excellent man revere Miſs Byron!—My Beauchamp, with our two ſiſters and their Lords, will be often with us. Your worthy couſin Reeves's, Lord W. and his deſerving Lady, will alſo be our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiters, and we theirs, in turn. The Mansfield family are already within a few miles of me: And our Northamptonſhire friends!—Viſiters and viſited—What happineſs do I propoſe to myſelf, and the beloved of my heart!—And if (as you have generouſly wiſhed) the dear Clementina may be happy, at leaſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and her brother Jeronymo recover? what, in this world, can be wanting to crown our felicity?</p>
                  <p>Tears of joy ſtrayed down my cheek, unperceived
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1185400106:152"/>
by me, till they fell upon his hand, as it had mine in it. He kiſſed them away. I was abaſhed. If my dear Miſs Byron permit me to go on, I have her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to aſk.—I bowed my aſſent. My heart throbbed with painful joy: I could not ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Will <hi>it not be too early,</hi> madam, to aſk you about ſome matters of domeſtic concern? The leaſe of the houſe in St. James's Square is expired. Some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are made to renew it, unleſs on terms which I think unreaſonable. I do not eaſily ſubmit to impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Is there any-thing that you particularly like in the ſituation of that houſe?</p>
                  <p>Houſes, Sir, nay, Countries, will be alike to me, in the company of thoſe I value.</p>
                  <p>You are all goodneſs, madam. I will leave it to my ſiſters, to enquire after another houſe. I hope you will allow them to conſult you, as any one may offer. I will write to the owner of my preſent houſe (who is ſolicitous to know my determination, and ſays he has a tenant ready, if I relinquiſh it) that it will be at his command in three months time. When my dear Miſs Byron ſhall bleſs me with her hand, and our Northamptonſhire friends will part with her, if ſhe pleaſes, we will go directly to the Hall.</p>
                  <p>I bowed, and intended to look as one who thought herſelf obliged.</p>
                  <p>Reſtrain, check me, madam, whenever I ſeem to treſpaſs on your goodneſs. Yet how ſhall I forbear to wiſh you to haſten the day that ſhall make you wholly mine?—You will the rather allow me to wiſh it, as you will then be more than ever your own miſtreſs; tho' you have always been generouſly left to a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that never was more deſervedly truſted to. Your will, madam, will ever comprehend mine.</p>
                  <p>You leave me, Sir, only room to ſay, that if gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiude can make me a merit with you, <hi>that</hi> began with the firſt knowlege I had of you; and it has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ever ſince—I hope I never ſhall be ungratefull
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1185400106:153"/>
Tears again ſtrayed down my check. Why did I weep?</p>
                  <p>Delicate ſenſibility! ſaid he. He claſped his arms about me—But inſtantly withdrew them, as if recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf—Pardon me, madam! Admiration will ſometimes mingle with reverence. I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my gratitude as a man—May my happy day be not far diſtant, that I may have no bound to my joy!—He took my hand, and again preſſed it with his lips. My heart, madam, ſaid he, is in your hand: You cannot but treat it graciouſly.</p>
                  <p>Juſt then came in my Nancy [Why came ſhe in?] with the general expectation of us to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt!—Breakfaſt!—What, thought I, is breakfaſt!—The <hi>world,</hi> my Charlotte—But huſh!—Withdraw, fond heart, from my pen! Can the <hi>deareſt</hi> friend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the acknowlegement of impulſes ſo fervent, and which, writing to the moment, as I may ſay, the moment only can juſtify revealing?</p>
                  <p>He led me down-ſtairs, and to my very ſeat, with an air <hi>ſo</hi> noble, yet <hi>ſo</hi> tender—My aunt, my Lucy, every-body—looked at me. My eyes betrayed my hardly-conquered emotion.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles's looks and behaviour were ſo reſpectful, that every one addreſſed me as a perſon of increaſed conſequence. Do you think, Lady G. that Lord G's and Lord L's reſpectful behaviour to their wives do not as much credit to their own hearts, as to their Ladies? How happy are you, that you have recollected yourſelf, and now encourage not others, by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to make a jeſt of a <hi>huſband</hi>'s Love!—Will you forgive me the recollection, for the ſake of the joy I have in the reformation?—</p>
                  <p>I HAVE read this Letter, juſt now, to my aunt and Lucy, all except this laſt ſaucy hint to you. They claſped me each in their arms, and ſaid, They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>him,</hi> and were pleaſed with <hi>me.</hi> Inſtruct me, my dear Ladies, how to behave in ſuch a manner, as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1185400106:154"/>
may ſhew my gratitude (I had almoſt ſaid my Love); yet not go ſo very far, as to leave the day, the hour every-thing, to his determination!</p>
                  <p>But, on reading to my aunt and Lucy what I had written, I was aſhamed to find, that when he was enumerating the friends he hoped to have near him, or about him, I had forgot to remind him of my Emily. Ungrateful Harriet!—But don't tell her that I was ſo abſorbed in Self, and that the converſation was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, that my heart was more of a paſſive than an active machine at the time. I will ſoon <hi>find,</hi> or <hi>make,</hi> an occaſion to be her ſolicitreſs. You once thought that Emily, for her <hi>own</hi> ſake, ſhould not live with us; but her heart is ſet upon it. Dear creature! I love her! I will ſooth her! I will take her to my boſom!—I will, by my ſiſterly compaſſion, intitle myſelf to all her confidence! She ſhall have all mine. Nor ſhall her guardian ſuſpect her.—I will be as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her ſecret, as you and Lady L. were (thankfully I remember it!) to mine. Don't you think, my dear, that if Lady Clementina [I how to her merit whenever I name her to myſelf] had had ſuch a true, ſuch a ſoothing friend, to whom ſhe could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the ſecret that oppreſſed her noble heart, while her paſſion was young, it would have been attended with ſuch a deprivation of her reaſon, as made unhappy all who had the honour of being related to her?</p>

               <p>I WAS all confuſion when he, looking as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious as he uſed to do, entred my dreſſing-room. I turned my face from him. He ſeemed ſurpriſed at my concern. Miſs Byron, I hope, is well. Has any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſturbed you, madam?</p>
               <p>My paper, my paper! You took it up—For the world I would not—The poor Emily!—Give it me; Give it me; and I burſt into tears.—</p>
               <p>Was there ever ſuch a fool? What buſineſs had I to name Emily;</p>
               <p>He took it out of his pocket. I came to give it to you; putting it into my hand. I ſaw it was your writing, madam: I folded it up immediately: It has not been unfolded ſince: Not a ſingle ſentence did I permit myſelf to read.</p>
               <p>Are you ſure, Sir, you have not read it? nor any</p>
               <p>Part of it!—</p>
               <p>Upon my honour, I have not.</p>

I cleared up at once. A bleſſed reward, thought I, for denying my own curioſity, when preſſed by my Charlotte, to read a Letter clandeſtinely obtained!</p>
               <p>A thouſand, thouſand thanks to you, Sir, for not giving way to your curioſity. I ſhould have been miſerable, perhaps, for months, had you read that paper.</p>
               <p>You now indeed raiſe my curioſity, madam. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps your generoſity will permit you to gratify it; tho' I ſhould not have forgiven myſelf, had I taken advantage of ſuch an accident.</p>
               <p>I will tell you the contents of ſome parts of it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which relate to my Emily, if you pleaſe, madam. The <hi>poor</hi> Emily, you ſaid.—You have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And his face glowed, with impatience.</p>
               <p>No harm, Sir, of Emily!—Only a requeſt of the dear girl! [What letter uſe could I have made of my fright, Lady G?] But the <hi>manner</hi> of my mentioning it, I would not for the world you ſhould have ſeen.</p>
               <p>No harm, you ſay!—I was afraid, by your concern for her—But can <hi>you</hi> love her, as well as ever? If you can, Emily muſt ſtill be good.</p>
               <p>I can: I do.</p>
               <p>What then, dear madam, of <hi>poor</hi> Emily? Why <hi>poor</hi> Emily?—</p>
               <p>I will tell you. The dear girl makes it her requeſt, that I will procure of you one favour for her: Her heart is ſet upon it.</p>
               <p>If Emily continue good, ſhe ſhall only ſignify her wiſh, and I will comply. If <hi>I</hi> am not a Father to her, is ſhe not fatherleſs?</p>
               <p>Allow me, Sir, to call you kind! good! hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane!</p>
               <p>What I want of thoſe qualities, Miſs Byron will
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1185400106:157"/>
teach me, by her example.—But what would my Emily?—</p>
               <p>She would live with her guardian, Sir—</p>
               <p>With <hi>me,</hi> madam?—And with <hi>you,</hi> madam—Tell me, own to me, madam, <hi>And</hi> with you?</p>
               <p>That is her wiſh—</p>
               <p>And does my beloved Miſs Byron think it a <hi>right</hi> wiſh to be granted; Will <hi>ſhe</hi> be the inſtructing friend, the examplary ſiſter, now in that time of the dear girl's life, when the eye, rather than the judgment, is uſually the director of a young woman's affections?</p>
               <p>I love the ſweet Innocent: I could wiſh her to be always with me.</p>
               <p>Obliging goodneſs! Then is one of my cares over. A young woman, from Fourteen to Twenty, is often a troubleſome charge upon a Friendly heart. I could not have aſked this favour of you. You rejoice me by mentioning it. Shall I write a Letter, in your name, to Emily?</p>
               <p>There, Sir, is pen, ink, and paper.</p>
               <p>In <hi>your</hi> name, madam?</p>
               <p>I bowed aſſent; miſtruſting nothing.</p>
               <p>He wrote; and doubling down, ſhewed me only theſe words—<q rend="inline margQuotes">'My dear Miſs Jervois, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for you the deſired favour—Will you not continue to be as good as you have hitherto been?—That is all which is required of my Emily, by her ever affectionate'</q>—</p>
               <p>I inſtantly wrote, <hi>'Harriet Byron.'</hi>—But, Sir, what have you doubled down?</p>
               <p>Charming confidence!—What muſt he be, who could attempt to abuſe it?—Read, madam, what you have ſigned.—</p>
               <p>I did. How my heart throbbed.—And <hi>could</hi> Sir Charles Grandiſon, ſaid I, thus <hi>intend</hi> to deceive? <hi>Could</hi> Sir Charles Grandiſon be ſuch a plotter? Thank God you are not a bad man.</p>

If you are there in leſs than a fortnight, I will endeavour to be with you in a fortnight after. I ſacrifice, at leaſt, another fortnight's punctilio to oblige you.

               <p>If I have, why ſhould I not ſend it away; and, as Miſs Byron cannot deny her hand-writing, hope to receive the benefit of the ſuppoſed deceit?

                  <hi>Was</hi> it not a pretty piece of deceit, Lady G? Shall I own, that my heart was more inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than puniſh him for it? And really, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thought of the impracticableneſs of complying with the requeſt, as if I was ſeriouſly pondering upon it, and was ſorry it was not practicable. To get away from my dear Mr. Deane, thought I, who will not be in haſte to part with us; ſome female buſtlings to be got over on our return to Selby-houſe; propoſal renewed, and a little paraded with [Why, Lady G. did you tell me that our Sex is a fooliſh Sex?]; the preparation; the ceremony; the awful ceremony! the parting with the deareſt and moſt indulgent

friends that ever young creaure was bleſſed with; and to be at Grandiſon-hall, <hi>all</hi> within one month!—Was there ever ſo precipitating a man?</p>
               <p>I believe verily, that I appeared to him as if I were conſidering of it; for he took advantage of my ſilence, and urged me to permit him to ſend away to Emily what he had written; and offered to give reaſons for his urgency: Written as it is, ſaid he, by me, and ſigned by you, how will the dear girl rejoice at the conſent of both, under our hands! And will ſhe not take the caution given her in it from me, as kindly as ſhe will your mediation in her favour?</p>
               <p>Sure, Sir, ſaid I, you expect not a ſerious anſwer!—Upon his honour, he did—How, Sir! Ought you not rather to be thankful, if I forgive you, for letting me ſee that Sir Charles Grandiſon was capable of ſuch an artifice, tho' but in jeſt; and for his reflection upon me, and perhaps meant on our Sex, as if decorum were but <hi>punctilio?</hi> I beg my Lucy's pardon, added I, for being half-angry with her when ſhe called you a <hi>deſigner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My deareſt creature, ſaid he, I <hi>am</hi> a deſigner. Who, to accelerate a happineſs on which that of his whole life depends, would not be innocently ſo? I am, in this inſtance, ſelfiſh: But I glory in my ſelfiſhneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am determined, if power be lent me, that every one, within the circle of our acquaintance, ſhall have reaſon to congratulate you as one of the happieſt of women.</p>
               <p>Till this artifice, Sir, ſhewed me what you <hi>could</hi> do, were you not a man of the ſtricteſt honour, I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but affiance in you. Give me the paper, Sir; and, for your own ſake, I will deſtroy it, that it may not furniſh me with an argument, that there is not <hi>one</hi> man in the world who is to be implicitly confided in by a woman.</p>
               <p>Take it, madam (preſenting it to me, with his uſual gracefulneſs); deſtroy it not, however, till you have
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1185400106:160"/>
expoſed me as <hi>ſuch</hi> a breach of confidence <hi>deſerves,</hi> to your aunt, your Lucy—To your uncle Selby; and Mr. <hi>Deane,</hi> if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Ah, Sir! you know your advantages! I will not, in this caſe, refer to them: I could ſooner rely, dearly as they love their Harriet, on Sir Charles Grandiſon's juſtice, than on their favour, in <hi>any</hi> debate that ſhould happen between him and me.</p>
               <p>There never, madam, except in the caſe before us, can be room for a reference: Your prudence, and my gratitude, muſt ſecure us both. Even now, impatient as I am to call you mine, which makes me willing to lay hold of every opportunity to urge you for an early day, I will endeavour to ſubdue that impatience, and ſubmit to your will. Yet let me ſay, that if I did not think your heart one of the moſt laudably unreſerved, yet truly delicate, that woman ever boaſted, and your prudence equal, you would not have found me ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcent a Lover, early as you <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> my urgency for the happy day.</p>
               <p>And is it <hi>not</hi> early, Sir? Can Sir Charles Grandiſon think me punctilious?—But you will permit me to write to Miſs Jervois <hi>myſelf,</hi> and acquaint her with her granted wiſh, if—</p>
               <p>If! No <hi>if,</hi> madam—Whatever you think right to be done, in this caſe, that do. Emily will be more particularly your ward than mine, if you condeſcend to take the truſt upon you.</p>
               <p>You will be pleaſed, dear Lady G. to acquaint Emily with the grant of her wiſh: She will rejoice. God give the dear creature reaſon for joy; and then I ſhall have double pleaſure in having contributed to her obtaining of it. But, on ſecond thoughts, I will write to her myſelf; for I allow not that ſhe ſhall ſee or hear read every-thing I write to you. [Shall I own to you, that my grandmamma, and aunt, and Lucy, are of your mind? They all three wiſh]—But who can deny the dear Innocent the grant of a requeſt on which ſhe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1185400106:161"/>
has ſo long ſet her heart? And would it not be pity, methinks I hear the world ſay, ſome time hence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any miſhap [God forbid it!] ſhould befal her, that Sir Charles Grandiſon, the moſt honourable of men, ſhould ſo marry, as that a young Lady of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and merit, and miſtreſs of a fortune, which, it might be foreſeen, would encourage the attempts of deſigning men, could not have lived with his wife?—Poor child!—Then would the <hi>world</hi> have ſhaken its wiſe head (allow the expreſſion); and well for me if it had judged ſo mildly of me.</p>
               <p>Our dear Mr. Deane, tho' reluctantly, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that we ſhall leave him on Monday next. We ſhall ſet out directly for Selby-houſe, where we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be the ſame night. My aunt and I have been urgent with him to go back with us; but he is croſs, and <hi>will</hi> be excuſed.</p>
               <p>Juſt now Lucy tells me, that Mr. Deane declared to my uncle, aunt, and her, that he will not viſit us at Selby-houſe till we ſend for him and the ſettlements together, which he will have ready in a week—Strange expedition! Sure they are afraid your brother will change his mind, and are willing to put it out of the poor man's power to recede! Lucy ſmiles at me, and is ſure, ſhe ſays, that ſhe may in confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal all theſe matters to me, without endangering my <hi>life.</hi> My next Letter will be from Selby-houſe.</p>

               <p>GO on, go on, with your narratives, my dear. Hitherto Caroline and I know not how either
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1185400106:162"/>
much to blame you, or totally to acquit you of <hi>parade</hi> the man and his ſituation conſidered; and the ſtate of your heart for ſo many months paſt; every one of your friends—conſenting, ſhall I ſay?—<hi>more</hi> than conſenting—<hi>ardent,</hi> to be related to him. Hark ye, Harriet, let me whiſper you—My brother, whether he come honeſtly, or not, by his knowlege, I dare ſay, thinks not ſo highly of the Free-maſonry part of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as you do—You ſtart. O Charlotte! you cry—And, O Harriet! too—But, my dear girl, let my brother ſee, that you think (and no woman in the world does, if you don't) that the true modeſty, after hearts are united, is to think little of parade, and much of the ſocial happineſs that awaits two worthy minds united by Love, and conformity of ſentiment—After all, we are ſilly creatures, Harriet: We are afraid of wiſe men. No wonder that we ſeldom chooſe them, when a fool offers. I wiſh I knew the man, however, who dare to ſay this in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Your grandmother Shirley is more than woman: My brother prodigiouſly admires her. I think you may truſt to her judgment, if you ſuppoſe him too precipitating. Your aunt is an excellent woman! But I never knew a woman or man, who valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on delicacy, and found themſelves conſulted upon it, but was apt to over-do the matter. Is not this a little, a <hi>very</hi> little, Mrs. Selby's caſe? Let her know, that I bid you aſk this queſtion of herſelf: She muſt be aſſured that I equally love and honour her; ſo won't be angry.</p>
               <p>Your uncle is an odd, but a very honeſt Dunſtable ſoul! Tell him, I ſay ſo; but withal, that he ſhould leave women to act as <hi>women,</hi> in theſe matters. <hi>What a duce, what a pize,</hi> would he expect perfection from them? He, whoſe arguments always run in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating ſtrain? If he <hi>would,</hi> aſk him, <hi>Where</hi> ſhould they have it, converſing, as they are obliged to do, with men? Men for their fathers, for their brothers,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1185400106:163"/>
for their uncles—They <hi>muſt</hi> be a <hi>little</hi> ſilly, had they not a <hi>fund</hi> of ſillineſs in themſelves.—But I would not have them be moſt <hi>out</hi> in matters where they ſhould be moſt <hi>in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think, however, ſo does Lady L. that ſo far as you have proceeded, you are tolerable; tho' not, half ſo clever as he, conſidering ſituations. Upon my word, Harriet, allowing for every-thing, neither of Sir Charles Grandiſon's ſiſters expected that their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have made ſo ardent, ſo polite, a Lover. He is ſo <hi>prudent</hi> a man, and that once had like to have been one of <hi>your,</hi> even <hi>your</hi> objections.—Yet ſo nobly ſincere—ſo manly. O that my ape—But come, Harriet, as men go in this age of monkeys and Sir Foplings, Lord G. (for all <hi>you</hi> ) is not to be deſpiſed. I, as a good wiſe ought, will take his part, whoever runs him down. Where much is not given, much, and-ſo-forth—</p>
               <p>I have told Emily the good news: I could not help it, tho' you promiſe to write to her.</p>
               <p>Poor thing! ſhe is all ecſtaſy! ſhe is not the only one who ſeeks, as her greateſt good, what may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prove her greateſt misfortune. But, for her ſake for your ſake, and my brother's, I hope, under your directing eye, and by prudent management (the flame ſo young) a <hi>little</hi> cold water will do; and that if it <hi>will</hi> blaze, it may be directed towards Beauchamp's houſe.</p>
               <p>Let me whiſper you again, Harriet—Young girls finding themſelves veſted with new powers, and a ſet of new inclinations, turn their ſtaring eyes out of themſelves; and the firſt man they ſee, they imagine, if he be a ſingle man, and but ſimpers at them, they muſt receive him as a Lover: Then they return downcaſt for ogle, that he may ogle on without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. They are ſoon brought to write anſwers to Letters which confeſs flames the writer's heart never felt. The girl doubts not her own gifts, her own
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1185400106:164"/>
conſequence; ſhe wonders that her father, mother, and other friends, never told her of theſe new-found excellencies: She is more and more beautiful in her own eyes, as he more and more flatters her. If her parents are <hi>a</hi> -verſe, the girl is <hi>per</hi> -verſe; and the more, the leſs diſcretion there is in her paſſion. She adopts the word <hi>conſtancy;</hi> ſhe declaims againſt <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;</hi> ſhe calls her idle flame, LOVE; which only was a Something ſhe knew not what to make of—and, like a wandering bee, had it not ſettled on this flower, would on the next, were it either bitter or ſweet.</p>
               <p>And this generally, with the thoughtleſs, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and progreſs of that formidable invader, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called <hi>Love;</hi> a word very happily at hand, to help giddy creatures to talk with, and look without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of face on, a man telling them a thouſand lyes, and hoping, perhaps by illaudable means, to attain an end not in <hi>itſelf</hi> illaudable, when duty and diſcretion are, the one the guide, the other the gentle reſtraint.</p>
               <p>But as to Emily—I depend on her <hi>principles,</hi> as well as on your affectionate diſcretion (when you will be pleaſed, among ye, to permit my brother <hi>to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally yours)</hi> for reſtraining her imagination. There never beat in Female boſom an honeſter heart. Poor thing! ſhe is <hi>but</hi> a girl! And who is the woman, or child, that looks on my brother without love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence?</p>
               <p>For Emily's ſake, you ſee, you muſt not have too many of your honeſt uncle's <hi>circum-roundabouts.</hi> He makes us laugh. I love to have him angry with his Dame Selby. Dear Harriet! when your heart's quite at caſe, give us the courtſhip of the odd ſoul to <hi>the light of his eyes; his</hi> oddneſs, and <hi>her</hi> delicay! A charming contraſt! You <hi>did</hi> help us to a little of it once <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See p. 141, &amp; ſeq.</note>, you know. Theirs, on the woman's ſide, could not be a match of Love at firſt: But who ſo happy as they? I am convinced, Harriet, that Love
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1185400106:165"/>
on one ſide, and diſcretion on the other, is enough in conſcience; and, in ſhort, much better than Love on both: For what room can there be for diſcretion, in the latter caſe? The man is guilty of an heterodoxy in Love, you know, who is <hi>prudent,</hi> or but ſuſpected of being ſo!—Ah! Harriet, Harriet! once more I ſay, we women are fooliſh creatures in our Love-affairs; and know not what's beſt for ourſelves.—In your ſtile—<q rend="inline">'Don't you think ſo, Lucy?'</q>—Yet I admire Lucy—She got over an improperly-placed Love; and now, her mad fit over [We have <hi>all</hi> little or much of it; <hi>begun,</hi> as I told you how] ſhe is <hi>ſo</hi> cool, <hi>ſo</hi> quiet, <hi>ſo</hi> ſedate—Yet once I make no doubt, looking forward to her preſent happy quieſcence, would have thought it a ſtate of inſipidity. Dearly do we love racketing; and, another whiſper, ſome of us to be racketed—But not <hi>you!</hi> you are an exception. Yes, to be ſure!—But I believe you'll think me mad.</p>
               <p>We like my brother's little trick upon you in the Billet he wrote, and which you ſigned, as if to Emily. You ſee how earneſt he is, my dear. I long for his next Letters from Italy. I think that is a lucky plea enough for you, if you ſuppoſe parade neceſſary.</p>
               <p>We have got Everard among us again. The ſorry fellow—O Harriet! had you ſeen him, with his hat upon his two thumbs, bowing, cringing, bluſhing, confounded, when firſt he came into my royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence—But I, from my throne, extended the golden ſceptre to him, as I knew I ſhould pleaſe my brother by it. He ſat down when I bid him, twiſted his lips, curdled his chin, hemm'd, ſtole a look of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at me, looked down when his eyes met mine; <hi>mine</hi> bold as innocence, <hi>his</hi> conſcious as guilt; hemm'd again, turned his hat about; then with one of his not quite-forgotten airs of pertneſs, putting it under his arm, ſhook his ears, tried to look up, then his eye ſunk again under my broader eye.—O my dear!—What a paltry creature is a man vice-bitten! and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of detected folly, and obligation!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1185400106:166"/>
Sir Charles has made a man of him, once more. His dreſs is as gay as ever; and, I dare ſay, he ſtruts as much in it as ever, in company that knows not how he came by it. <hi>He</hi> reformed!—Bad habits are of the Jeruſalem artichoke-kind; once planted, there is no getting them out of the ground.</p>
               <p>Our good Dr Bartlett is alſo with us, at preſent: He is in hopes of ſeeing my brother in town—<q rend="inline margQuotes">'In town,'</q> Harriet!—and the great affair un-ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized!—Woe be to you, if—But let's ſee how you act when left to yourſelf. Prudent people, in other's matters are not always prudent in their own; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their Love-affairs. A little over-nicety at ſetting out, will carry them into a road they never intended to amble in; and then they are ſometimes obliged to the <hi>leſs</hi> prudent to put them in the path they ſet out from. Remember, my dear, <hi>I</hi> am at hand, if you bewilder yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bartlett tells us, that my brother has extricated this poor creature from his entanglements with his woman, by his interpoſition only by Letter: Some money, I ſuppoſe. The Doctor deſires to be ſilent, on the means; but hints, however, that Everard will ſoon be in circumſtances not unhappy.</p>
               <p>I HAVE got the Doctor to explain himſelf. Every day produces ſome new inſtances of womens follies. What would poor battered rakes and younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, when on their laſt legs, were it not for good-natured widows?—Ay, and ſometimes for forward maids? This wretch, it ſeems, has acquitted himſelf ſo handſomely in the diſcharge of the 100<hi>l.</hi> which he owed to his wine-merchant's relict, and the Lady was ſo full of acknowlegements, and obligations, and all that, for being paid but her due, that he has ventured to make addreſſes to her (Love, as it is called): and is well received. He behaves with more ſpirit before her, I ſuppoſe, than he does before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1185400106:167"/>
The widow had a plain, diligent, honeſt man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. She has what is called <hi>taſte,</hi> forſooth, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhe has. She thinks Mr. Grandiſon a finer gentleman than him who left her in a condition to be thougbt worthy of the addreſs of a gayer man. She prides herſelf, it ſeems, in the relation that her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will give her to a man of Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon's character. Much <hi>worſe</hi> reaſons will have weight, when a woman finds herſelf inclined to change her condition. But Everard is very earneſt that my brother ſhould know nothing of the matter till all is over: So you (as I) have this piece of news in confidence. Lady L. has not been told it. His couſin, he ſays, who refuſed him his intereſt with Miſs Mansfield, Lady W's ſiſter, becauſe he thought a further time of probation, with regard to his avowed good reſolutions, neceſſary, would perhaps, for the widow's ſake, if applied to, <hi>put a ſpoke in his wheel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Everard, I can hardly allow myſelf to call him Grandiſon, avows a vehement paſſion for the widow. She is <hi>rich.</hi>—When they are ſet out together in <hi>taſte,</hi> as ſhe calls it, trade, or buſineſs, her firſt riſe, quite forgot, what a gay, what a frolick dance will ſhe and her new huſband, in a little while, lead up, on the grave of her poor, plain, deſpiſed one!</p>
               <p>'Tis well, 'tis well, my dear Harriet, that I have a multitude of faults myſelf [Witneſs, to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back, this Letter] or I ſhould deſpiſe nine parts of the world out of ten.</p>
               <p>I find that Sir Charles, and Beauchamp, and Dr. Bartlett, correſpond. Light is hardly more active than my brother, nor lightning more quick, when he has any-thing to execute that muſt or ought to be done. I believe I told you early, that was a part of his character. You muſt not then wonder, or be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended [Shall I uſe the word <hi>offended,</hi> my dear?] that you, in your turn, now he has found himſelf at liberty to addreſs you, ſhould be affected by his adroitneſs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1185400106:168"/>
and vivacity in your <hi>Femalities,</hi> as uncle Selby calls them: Aptly enough, I think; tho' I do not love that men ſhould be ſo impudent, as either to find us out, or abuſe us. You cannot always, were you to <hi>think</hi> him too precipitating, ſeparate bad qualities from good in the ſame perſon; ſince, perhaps, the one is the conſtitutional occaſion of the other. Could he, for example, be half ſo uſeful a friend as he is, if he were to dream over a Love-affair, as you would ſeem to have him; in other words, gape over his ripened fruit till it dropt into his yaw-yaw-yawning mouth? He'll certainly get you, Harriet, within, or near, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed time. Look about you: He'll have you, before you know where you are. By <hi>book,</hi> as the ſaying is, will he pull you to him, ſtruggle as you will (he has already got hold of you) <hi>or by crook;</hi> inviting, nay compelling you, by his generoſity, gentle ſhepherd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to nymph as gentle. What you do, therefore, do with ſuch a grace as may preſerve to you the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of having it in your power to lay an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon him. It is the opinion of both his ſiſters, that he values you more for your noble expanſion of heart, and not ignorant, but generous frankneſs of manners, yet mingled with dignity; than for—even—your Beauty, Harriet—Whether you, who are in ſuch full poſſeſſion of every grace of perſon, care, as a woman, to hear of that, or not. His gay parterre ſimilitude you remember, my dear. It is my firm belief, that thoſe are the greateſt admirers of fine flowers, who love to ſee them in their borders, and ſeldomeſt pluck the fading fragrance. The other wretches crop, put them in their boſoms, and in an hour or two, roſe, carnation, or whatever, after one parting ſmell, throw them away.</p>
               <p>He is very buſy, where-ever he is. At his inn, I ſuppoſe, moſt. But he boaſts not to you, or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, of what he does.</p>
               <p>He writes now-and-then a Letter to aunt Nell, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1185400106:169"/>
ſhe is <hi>ſo</hi> proud of the favour—Look you here, niece; Look you here!—But I ſha'n't ſhew you <hi>all</hi> he writes.—On go the ſpectacles—for ſhe will not for the world part with the Letter out of her hands.—She reads one paragraph, one ſentence, then another—On and off go the ſpectacles, while ſhe conjectures, explains, animadverts, applauds; and ſo goes on till ſhe leaves not a line unread: Then folding it up carefully in its cover, puts it in her Letter or Ribband-caſe, which ſhall I call it? For having but few Letters to put in it, the caſe is filled with bits and ends of ribbands, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and-ſo-forth, of all manner of colours, faded and freſh; with intermingledoms of gold-beaters ſkin, plaiſters for a cut finger, for a chopt lip, a kibe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for corns; which ſhe diſpenſes occaſionally very bountifully, and values herſelf, as we ſee at ſuch times by a double chin made triple, for being not unuſeful in her generation. Chide me, if you will; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour's upon me; hang me, if I care: You are only Harriet Byron, as yet. Change your name, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your conſequence.</p>
               <p>I have written a long Letter already; and to what end? Only to expoſe myſelf, ſay you? True enough. But now, Harriet, to bribe you into paſſing a milder cenſure, let me tell you all I can pick up from the Doctor, relating to my brother's matters. Bribe ſhall I call this, or gratitude, for your free communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Matters between the Mansfields and the Keelings are brought very forward. Hang particulars: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body's affairs lie near my heart, but yours. The two families have already begun to viſit. When my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returns, all the gentry in the neighbourhood are to be invited, to rejoice with the parties on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Be ſo kind, my dear, as to diſmiſs the good man, as ſoon as your punctilio will admit. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that while he lays himſelf out ſo much in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1185400106:170"/>
ſervice of others, he ſhould do ſomething for himſelf. You, my dear, we look upon as a high reward for his many great and good actions. But as he is a man who has a deep ſenſe of favours granted, and values not the bleſſing the more, when it <hi>ought</hi> to be within his reach, becauſe it is dear (as is the caſe of the ſorry fellows in general) I would have you conſider of it—that's all.</p>
               <p>The Doctor tells me, alſo, that the wicked Bolton's ward is dead; and that every-thing is included, to Sir Charles's ſatisfaction, with him; and the Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields (reinſtated in all their rights) are once more a happy family.</p>
               <p>Sir Hargrave is in a lamentable way; Dr. Bartlett has great compaſſion for him. Would you have <hi>me</hi> pity him, Harriet?—You would, you ſay—Well, then, I'll try for it: As it was by his means you and we, and my brother, came acquainted, I think I <hi>may.</hi> He is to be brought to town.</p>
               <p>Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp! He is paſt recovery. Had the phyſicians given him over when they firſt undertook him, he might, they ſay, have had a chance for it.</p>
               <p>I told you, that Emily's mother was turned Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt. She has converted her huſband. A ſtrange alteration! But it is natural for ſuch ſort of people to paſs from one extreme to another. Emily every now-and-then viſits them. They are ready to worſhip her for her duty and goodneſs. She is a lovely girl: She every day improves in her perſon, as well as in her mind. She is ſometimes with me; ſometimes with Lady L; ſometimes with aunt Eleanor; ſometimes with your Mrs. Reeves—We are ready to fight for her: But you will ſoon rob all of us. She is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for her journey to you. Poor girl! I pity her. <hi>Such</hi> a conflict in her mind, between her love of you, and tenderneſs for her guardian! Her Anne has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to me, that ſhe weeps one half of the night;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1185400106:171"/>
yet forces herſelf to be lively in company—After the example of Miſs Byron, ſhe ſays, when ſhe viſited you at Selby houſe. I hope, my dear, all will be right. But to go to live with a beloved object—I don't underſtand it. You, Harriet, may. I never was in Love, God help me!</p>
               <p>I am afraid the dear girl does too much for her mother. As they have ſo handſome an annuity, 400 <hi>l.</hi> a year, ſo much beyond their expectation; I think ſhe ſhould not give, nor ſhould they receive, any-thing conſiderable of her, without her guardian's knowlege. She is laying out a great deal of money in new cloaths, to do you and her guardian credit—on your nuptials, poor thing! ſhe ſays, with tears in her eyes—but whether of joy, or ſenſibility, it is hard to decide; but I believe of both.</p>
               <p>What makes me imagine ſhe does more than ſhe ſhould, is, that a week ago ſhe borrowed fifty guineas of me; and but yeſterday came to me—I ſhould do a very wrong thing, ſaid ſhe, bluſhing up to the ears, ſhould I aſk Lady L. to lend me a ſum of money till my next quarter comes due, after I made myſelf your debtor ſo lately: But if you <hi>could</hi> lend me thirty or forty guineas more, you would do me a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>My dear! ſaid I; and ſtared at her!</p>
               <p>Don't queſtion, don't chide me, this one time. I never will run in debt again: I hate to be in debt. But you have bid me tell you all my wants.</p>
               <p>I will not, my love, ſay another word. I will fetch you fifty guineas more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More,</hi> my dear Lady G! that is a pretty rub: But I will always, for the future, be within bounds: And don't let my guardian know it—He would kill me, by his generoſity; yet perhaps, in his own heart, wonder what I did with my money. If <hi>he</hi> thought ill of me, or that I was extravagant, it would break my heart.</p>
               <p>Only, my dear, ſaid I, remember that 400 <hi>l.</hi> a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1185400106:172"/>
year—Mrs. O-Hara cannot want any-thing to be done for her now.</p>
               <p>Don't call her Mrs. O-Hara! She is very good: Call her my mother.</p>
               <p>I kiſſed the ſweet girl, and fetched her the other fifty guineas.</p>
               <p>I thought it not amiſs to give you this hint, my dear, againſt ſhe goes down to you. But do you think it right, after all, to have her with my brother and you?</p>
               <p>Lady L. keeps cloſe—She faſts, cries, prays, is vaſtly apprehenſive: She makes me uneaſy for her and myſelf. Theſe vile men! I believe I ſhall hate them all. Did <hi>they</hi> partake—But not half ſo grateful as the blackbirds: They rather look big with inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than perch near, and ſing a ſong to confort the poor ſouls they have ſo dreadfully mortified. Other birds, as I have obſerved (ſparrows, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) ſit hour and hour, he's and ſhe's, in turn; and I have ſeen the hen, when her rogue has ſtaid too long, rattle at him, while he circles about her with ſweeping wings, and diſplayed plumage, his head and breaſt of various dyes, ardently ſhining, peep, peep, peep; as much as to ſay, I beg your pardon, love—I was forced to go a great way off for my dinner.—Sirrah! I have thought ſhe has ſaid, in an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving accent—Do your duty now—Sit cloſe—Peep, peep, peep—I will, I will, I will—Away has ſhe ſkimmed, and returned to relieve him—when ſhe thought fit.</p>
               <p>Don't Laugh at us, Harriet, in our mortified ſtate [Begone, wretch—<hi>What have I done, madam?</hi> ſtare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! What have you done!—My ſorry fellow came in, wheedling, courting, juſt as I was pitying two meek ſiſters: Was it not enough to vex one?] Don't laugh at us, I ſay—<hi>If you do!</hi>—May my brother, all in good time, avenge us on <hi>you,</hi> prays, in malice,</p>

               <p>FIE upon you, Lady G! What a Letter have you written! There is no ſeparating the good from the bad in it. With what dangerous talents are you entruſted! and what uſe do you make of them! I have written two long Letters, continuing my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of our proceedings; but I muſt take you to ſevere taſk for this before me; and <hi>this</hi> and <hi>they</hi> ſhall go together.</p>
               <p>Wicked wit! What a foe art thou to decent chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs!—In a <hi>woman</hi>'s hand ſuch a weapon! What might we not expect from it, were it in a man's? How you juſtify the very creatures of that Sex, whom you would be thought to deſpiſe!</p>
               <p>But you ſay, you would not allow in a man, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties you yourſelf take with your own Sex. How can you, my dear, be ſo partial to your faults, yet own them to be ſuch? Would you rank with the worſt of ſinners? They do juſt ſo.</p>
               <p>I may be a fool: I may be inconſiſtent: I may not know how with a grace to give effect to my own wiſhes: I may be able to adviſe better than act—Moſt pragmatical creatures think they can be counſellors in another's caſe, while their own affairs, as my uncle would ſay, <hi>lie at ſixes and ſevens.</hi> But how does this excuſe your freedoms with your whole Sex—With the Innocents of it, more particularly?</p>
               <p>Let me ſay, my dear, that you take odious, yes, <hi>odious,</hi> liberties; I won't recal the word: Liberties which I cannot, tho' to ſhame you, repeat. Fie upon you, Charlotte!</p>
               <p>And yet you ſay, that neither you nor Lady L. know how to blame me much, tho', the man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1185400106:174"/>
you will not totally acquit me of parade; and in another place, that ſo far as we have proceeded, we have behaved tolerably. Why, then, all this riot?—yes, riot, Charlotte! againſt us, and againſt our Sex? <hi>What,</hi> but for riot's ſake?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'The humour upon you!'</q>—The humour is upon you, with a witneſs! <q rend="inline">'Hang you, if you care!'</q>—But, my dear, it would be more to your credit if you <hi>did</hi> care; and if you checked the wicked humour.—Do you think nobody but you has ſuch talents? Fain would I lower you, ſince, as it is evident, you take pride in your <hi>licence</hi>—Forgive me, my dear—Yet I will not ſay all I think of your wicked wit. Think you, that there are not many who could be as ſmart, as ſurpriſing, as you, were they to indulge a vein of what you call humour? Do you think your brother is not one? Would not he be too hard for you at your own weapons? Has he not convinced you that he could? But he, a <hi>man,</hi> can check the overflowing freedom.</p>
               <p>But if I <hi>have</hi> ſet out wrong with your brother, I will do my endeavour to recover my path. You greatly oblige me with your conducting hand: But what neceſſity was there for you to lead me through briars and thorns, and to plunge me into two or three dirty puddles, in order to put me into the right path, when it lay before you in a direct line, without going a bow-ſhot about?</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed, however, to conſider ſituation, on <hi>my</hi> ſide, as well as on your brother's: I might be a little excuſable for my aukwardneſs, perhaps, were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the notion of a <hi>double</hi> or <hi>divided Love,</hi> on the man's part, came often into my head; indeed could not be long out; the Lady ſo ſuperlatively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent! his affection for her, ſo <hi>allowably,</hi> as well as <hi>avowedly,</hi> ſtrong! Was it poſſible to avoid little jealouſies, little petulancies, when ſlights were ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable? The more, for the excellency of the man;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1185400106:175"/>
the more for my paſt weakneſs of <hi>ſo many months?</hi> I pretend not, my deareſt Charlotte, to be got above nature: I know I am a weak ſilly girl: I am humbled in the ſenſe I have of his and Clementina's ſuperior merits. True Love will ever make a perſon think manly of himſelf, in proportion as ſhe thinks highly of the object. Pride will be up, ſometimes; but in the pull two ways, between that and mortification, a torn coat will be the conſequence: And muſt not the <hi>tatterdemallion</hi> (What a new language will my uncle teach me!) then look ſimply?</p>
               <p>You bid me aſk my aunt—You bid me tell my uncle—Naughty Charlotte! I will aſk, I will tell, them, nothing. Pray write me a Letter next, that I can read to <hi>them.</hi> I ſkipt this paſſage—Read that—'um—'um—'um—Then ſkipt again—Hey-day! What's come to the girl, cried my uncle? Can Lady G. write what Harriet cannot read? [There was a rebuke for you, Charlotte!] For the love of God, let me read it!—He buſtled, laughed, ſhook his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, rubbed his hands, at the imagination—Some pretty roguery, I warrant: Dearly do I love Lady G. If you love me, Harriet, let <hi>me</hi> read; and once he ſnatched one of the ſheets. I boldly ſtruggled with him for it—For ſhame, Mr. Selby, ſaid my aunt. My dear, ſaid my grandmother, if your uncle is ſo impetuous, you muſt ſhew him no more of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>He then gave it up—Conſider, Charlotte, what a fine piece of work we ſhould have had with my uncle, had he read it through!</p>
               <p>But, let me ſee,—What are the parts of this wicked Letter, for which I can ſincerely thank you?—O my dear, I cannot, cannot, without ſoiling my fingers, pick them out—Your intelligences, however, are among thoſe which I hold for favours.</p>
               <p>Poor Emily! that is a ſubject which delights, yet ſaddens, me—We are <hi>laudably</hi> fond of diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1185400106:176"/>
merit. But your brother's is ſo dazling—Every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is one's rival. But no more of my Emily! Dear creature! the ſubject pains me!—Yet I cannot quit it.—You aſk, If, after all, I think it right that ſhe ſhould live with me?—What can I ſay? For <hi>her</hi> ſake, perhaps, it will not: Yet how is her heart ſet upon it! For my own ſake, as there is no perfect happineſs to be expected in this life, I could be content to bear a little pain, were that dear girl to be either benefited or pleaſured by it. Indeed I love her, at my heart—And, what is more—I love myſelf for ſo ſincerely loving her.</p>
               <p>In the wicked part of your Letter, what you write of your aunt Eleanor—But I have no <hi>patience</hi> with you, ſinner as you are againſt light, and better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege! and derider of the infirmities, not of old maids, but of old age!—Don't you hope to live long, your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? That worthy Lady wears not ſpectacles, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, becauſe ſhe never was ſo <hi>happy</hi> as to be married. Wicked Charlotte! to owe ſuch obligation to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of good Lord G. for taking pity of you in time [Were you Four or Five-and-twenty when he honoured you with his hand at St. George's church?] and yet to treat him as you do, in more places than one, in this very Letter!</p>
               <p>But I will tell you what I will do with this ſame ſtrange Letter—I will tranſcribe all the good things in it. There are many which both delight and inſtruct; and ſome morning, before I dreſs for the day, I will [Sad taſk, Charlotte! But it ſhall be by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ſome of my faults and ſollies!] tranſcribe the intolerable paſſages; ſo make two Letters of it. One I will keep to ſhew my friends here, in order to increaſe, if it be poſſible, their admiration of my Charlotte; the bad one I will preſent to you. I know I ſhall tranſcribe it in a violent hurry—Not much matter whether it be legible, or not—The <hi>hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> it will cauſe in the reading, will make it appear
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1185400106:177"/>
worſe to you, than if you could read it as glibly as you write. If half of it <hi>be</hi> illegible, enough will be leſt to make you bluſh for the whole, and wonder what ſort of a pen it was that ſomebody, unknown to you, put into your ſtandiſh.</p>
               <p>After all, ſpare me not, my ever-dear, my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charming friend! ſpare only your <hi>ſelf:</hi> Don't let Charlotte run away from both G's. You will then be always equally ſure of my admiration and love. For dearly do I love you, with all your faults; ſo dearly, that when I conſider your faults by themſelves, I am ready to arraign my heart, and to think there is more of the roguery of my Charlotte in it than I will allow of.</p>
               <p>One puniſhment to you, I intend, my dear—In all my future Letters, I will write as if I had never ſeen this your naughty one. Indeed I am in a kind of way, faulty or not, that I cannot get out of, all at once; but as ſoon as I can, I will, that I may better juſtify my diſpleaſure at ſome parts of your Letter, by the obſervance I will pay to others. That is a ſweet ſentence of my Charlotte's: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Change your name, and increaſe your conſequence.'</q> Reflect, my dear—How naughty muſt you have been, that ſuch a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance of goodneſs could not bribe to ſpare you</p>

               <p>MR. Deane would not go back with us. He laid a ſtrict charge upon me, at parting, not to be punctilious.</p>
               <p>I am <hi>not,</hi> my dear Lady G. Do <hi>you</hi> think I am? The men are their own enemies, if they wiſh <hi>us</hi> to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1185400106:178"/>
be open-hearted and ſincere, and are not ſo <hi>themſelves.</hi> Let them enable us to depend on their candour, as much as we may on that of Sir Charles Grandiſon, and the women will be inexcuſable, who ſhall play either the prude or coquet with them. You will ſay, I am very cunning, perhaps, to form at the ſame time a rule <hi>from,</hi> and an excuſe <hi>for,</hi> my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to this excellent man: But be that as it will, it is truth.</p>
               <p>We ſent our duty laſt night to Shirley-manor; and expect every moment the dear parent there with us.</p>
               <p>She is come. I will go down; and if I get her by myſelf, or only with my aunt and Lucy, I will tell her a thouſand thouſand agreeable things, which have paſſed ſince laſt I had her tender bleſſing.</p>
               <p>WE have had this Greville and this Fenwick here. I could very well have ſpared them. Miſs Orme came hither alſo, uninvited, to breakfaſt; a favour ſhe often does us. I knew not at firſt how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have to Sir Charles before her: She looked ſo jealous of him! ſo cold! Under her bent brow ſhe looked at him: Yes, and No, were all her anſwers, with an air <hi>ſo</hi> ſtiff!—But this reſerve laſted not above a quarter of an hour. Sir Charles addreſſed himſelf to <hi>me,</hi> with ſo much reſpect; to <hi>her,</hi> with ſo polite a freedom; that ſhe could not hold her ſhyneſs.</p>
               <p>Her brow cleared up; her eyes looked larger, and more free: Her buttoned-up pretty mouth opened to a ſmile: She anſwered, ſhe aſked, queſtions; gave her required opinion on more topics than one, and was <hi>again</hi> all Miſs Orme.</p>
               <p>Every-body took great notice of Sir Charles's fine addreſs to her, and were charmed with him; for we all eſteem Mr. Orme, and love his ſiſter. How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant it was to ſee the ſunſhine break out in her ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able countenance, and the gloom vaniſhing, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1185400106:179"/>
She took me out into the leſſer parlour—What a ſtrange variable creature am I! ſaid ſhe: How I hated this Sir Charles Grandiſon, before I ſaw him! I was vexed to find him, at firſt ſight, anſwer what I had heard of him; for I was reſolved to diſlike him, tho' he had been an angel! But, ah, my poor brother!—I am afraid, I myſelf ſhall be ready to give up his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt!—No wonder, my dear Miſs Byron, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe would do, when you had ſeen this man!—But ſtill, let me beſpeak your pity for my brother!—Would to Heaven you had not gone to London!—What went you thither for?</p>
               <p>Sir Charles kindly enquired of her after Mr. Orme's health; praiſed him for his character; wiſhed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and to be allowed to cultivate the friendſhip of ſo worthy a man: And all this with an air ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;—But good men muſt love one another.</p>
               <p>SIR Charles has juſt now declared to my aunt, that he thinks of going up to town, or to Grandiſon-hall, I forget if they told me which, to-morrow or next day: Perhaps he knows not <hi>to which</hi> himſelf. I was ſurpriſed. Perhaps he is tired with us. Let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect—<hi>Thurſday was Se'nnight;</hi> Why indeed he has been down with us twelve days!—No leſs!</p>
               <p>But he has no doubts, no ſuſpences frum <hi>us,</hi> to keep Love awake: His path is plain and ſmooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He has demanded his day: We think we cannot immediately, and after ſo ſhort a time paſt ſince his declaring himſelf, give it him—And why ſhould he loſe his precious time among us? I ſuppoſe he will be ſo <hi>good</hi> as to hold himſelf in readineſs to obey <hi>our</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons—He expects a ſummons from <hi>us,</hi> perhaps!—</p>
               <p>O my dear Lady G! am I not perverſe? I believe I am. Yet where there is room, from paſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to dread a ſlight, tho' none may be intended, and truly as I honour and revere Lady Clementina, my mind is not always great enough (perhaps from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1185400106:180"/>
of demerit) to carry itſelf above apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and petulance, noble as is the man.</p>
               <p>My uncle is a little down upon it; and why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, truly, my grandmamma has told him, that it is really too early yet to fix the day; and he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as every body does, her judgment.</p>
               <p>But why, he aſks, cannot there be preparation making? Why may not ſomething be ſeen <hi>going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What?</hi> before the day is named? my aunt aſks—As Harriet had deſired to have his next Letters arrive before ſhe directly anſwered his queſtion, ſhe could <hi>not</hi> recede.</p>
               <p>He went from them both greatly diſſatisfied, and exclaiming againſt womens love of power, and never knowing how to make a right uſe of it.</p>
               <p>A meſſage from Sir Charles. He deſires to attend me. I believe I ſhall be a little ſullen: I know my heart: It is all his own; and I am <hi>loth</hi> to diſoblige him—But he was far, far more attendant on Lady Clementina's motions: Don't you think ſo, Lady G? But ſhe was all excellence—Well—But huſh!—I ſay no more!—</p>
               <p>I WILL give you an account of our converſation. I verily believe, that, had he not touched the poor ſnail with too haſty a ſinger, which made her ſhrink in again into her ſhell, I might have been brought to name the week, tho' not the day.</p>
               <p>But I will not anticipate.</p>
               <p>He entered with a very polite and affectionate air. He enquired after my health, and ſaid, I looked not well—Only <hi>vexed,</hi> thought I!</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible, I believe, to hold diſpleaſure in the preſence of a beloved object, with whom we are not mortally offended. My deareſt Miſs Byron, ſaid he, taking my paſſive hand, I am come to aſk your advice on twenty ſubjects. In the firſt place, here is a Letter
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1185400106:181"/>
from Lady G. recommending to me a houſe near her own [He gave it to me. I read it]. Should you, madam, approve of Groſvenor Square?</p>
               <p>I was ſilent: You will gueſs how my captious folly appeared to him, by what he ſaid to me. He reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully took my hand—Why ſo ſolemn, dear madam? Why ſo ſilent? Has any-thing diſturbed you? Some little diſpleaſure ſeems to hang upon that open counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Not at me, I hope?</p>
               <p>Yes it <hi>is,</hi> thought I! But I did not intend you ſhould ſee it.—I cleared up; and without anſwering his queſtion, ſaid, It is in the neighbourhood of Lady L. I hope?</p>
               <p>Thank you, madam, for that <hi>hope</hi>—It is. Nor far from your couſin Reeves's.</p>
               <p>I can have no objection, Sir.</p>
               <p>I will refer myſelf, on this ſublect, if you pleaſe, to my ſiſters, and Lord G. He values himſelf on his taſte in houſes and furniture, and will be delighted to be put into commiſſion with my ſiſters on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Or ſhall I ſtay till the happy day is over, and leave the choice wholly to yourſelf?</p>
               <p>Lady G. Sir, ſeems pleaſed with the houſe. She writes, that there is ſomebody elſe about it. It may not, then, be to be had.</p>
               <p>Shall I then commiſſion her to take it directly?</p>
               <p>What you pleaſe, Sir.</p>
               <p>He bowed to me, and ſaid, Then that matter is ſettled. And now, madam, let me own all my arts. You would penetrate into them, if I did not. You ſee that the great queſtion is never out of my view—I cannot but hope and believe, that you are above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding <hi>mere</hi> punctilio.—Have you, my deareſt Miſs Byron, thought, can you think, of ſome early weak, in which to fix my happy day?—Some preparation on your part, I preſume, will be thought neceſſary: As to mine, were you to bleſs me with your hand next week, I ſhould be aforehand in that particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:1185400106:182"/>
I was ſilent. I was conſidering how to find ſome middle way that ſhould make non-compliance appear neither diſobliging, nor affected.</p>
               <p>He looked up at me with Love and Tenderneſs in his aſpect; but, having no anſwer, proceeded:</p>
               <p>Your uncle, madam, and Mr. Deane, will inform you, that the ſettlements are ſuch as cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of. I expect every day ſome ſlight tokens of my affection for my dear Miſs Byron, which will be adorned by the lovely wearer: I have not been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in them, as ſhall make her think I build on toys for her approbation. She will allow me to give her my notions on this ſubject. In the article of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance, I think that propriety and degree ſhould be conſulted, as well as fortune. <hi>Our</hi> degree, <hi>our</hi> fortune, madam, is not mean? but I, who always wiſhed for the revival of Sumptuary Laws, have not ſought, in this article, to emulate Princes. In my own dreſs, I am generally a conformiſt to the faſhion. Singularity is uſually the indication of ſomething wrong in judgment. I rather perhaps dreſs too ſhewy, tho' a young man, for one who builds nothing on outward appearance: But my father loved to be dreſſed. In matters which regard not morals, I chooſe to appear to his friends and tenants, as not doing diſcredit to his magnificent ſpirit <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Miſs Byron obſerves, Vol. I. Let. xxxvi. p. 256. that Sir Charles's dreſs and equipage are rather gay than plain. She l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ttle thought, at that time, that he had ſuch a reaſon to give for it as he here ſuggeſts.</note>. I could not think it becoming, as thoſe perhaps do, who have the direction of the royal ſtamp on the coin, to ſet my face the contrary way to that of my predeceſſor. In a word, all my father's ſteps, in which I could tread, I did; and have choſen rather to build upon, than demoliſh, his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.—But how does my vanity miſlead me! I <hi>have</hi> vanity, madam; I have pride, and ſome conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial failings, which I cannot always get above: But,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1185400106:183"/>
anxious as I ever ſhall be for your approbation, my whole heart ſhall be open to you; and every motive, every ſpring of action, ſo far as I can trace it, be it to my advantage or not, ſhall be made known to you. Happy the day that I became acquainted with Dr. Bartlett! He will tell you, madam, that I am corrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. You muſt perfect, by your ſweet converſation, <hi>un</hi> -coupled with fear, what Dr. Bartlett has ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begun; and I ſhall then be more worthy of you than at preſent I am.</p>
               <p>O, Sir, you do me too much honour! You muſt be <hi>my</hi> monitor. As to the ornaments you ſpeak of, I hope I ſhall always look upon ſimplicity of manners a grateful return to the man I ſhall vow to honour, and a worthy behaviour to all around me, as my principal ornaments!</p>
               <p>His eyes gliſtened. He bowed his face upon my hand, to hide, as I thought, his emotion. Excellent Miſs Byron! ſaid he: Then, after a pauſe, Now let me ſay, that I have the happineſs to find my humble application to you acceptable to every one of your friends. The only woman on earth whom, beſides yourſelf, I ever could have wiſhed to call mine, and all her ever-to-be reſpected family (pleading their <hi>own</hi> ſakes) join their wiſhes in my favour; and, were you to deſire it, would, I am ſure, ſignify as much to you under their own hands. I know not whether I could ſo far have overcome my own ſcruples in behalf of your delicay (placing myſelf, as perſons always ought when they hope for favour, in the granter's place) as to ſupplicate you ſo <hi>ſoon</hi> as I have done, but at the earneſt requeſt of a family, and for the ſake of a Lady, I muſt ever hold dear. The world about you <hi>expects</hi> a ſpeedy celebration. I have not, I own, been back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>encourage</hi> the expectation: It was impoſſible to conceal from it the motive of my coming down, as my abode was at an inn. I came with an equipage, becauſe my pride (How great is my pride! permitted
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1185400106:184"/>
me not to own that I doubted. Have you, madam, a material objection to an early day? Be ſo good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, if you have. I wiſh to remove every ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of doubt from your heart.</p>
               <p>I was ſilent. He proceeded:</p>
               <p>Let me not pain you, madam!—lifting my hand to his lips—I would not pain you for the world. You have ſeen the unhappy Olivia! You have perhaps heard her ſtory from herſelf. What muſt be the cauſe upon which ſelf partiality cannot put a gloſs? Becauſe I knew not how (It was ſhocking to my nature) to repulſe a Lady, ſhe took my pity for encouragement. Pity from a <hi>Lady</hi> of a man, is noble—The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pity from a <hi>man</hi> for a woman, may be thought a vanity bordering upon inſult. Of ſuch a nature is <hi>not</hi> mine—She has ſome noble qualities—from my heart, for her character's ſake, I pity Olivia! and the more, for that violence of temper which ſhe never was taught to reſtrain. If, madam, you have any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on <hi>her</hi> account, own them: I will, for I honeſtly <hi>can,</hi> remove them.</p>
               <p>O Sir! None! None!—Not the leaſt, on that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Lady's account—</p>
               <p>Let me ſay, proceeded he, that Olivia reveres you, and wiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s you (I hope cordially, for ſhe is afraid ſtill of your ſiſter-excellence) to be mine. Give me leave to boaſt (It <hi>is</hi> my boaſt), that tho' I have had pain from individuals of your Sex, I can look back on my paſt life, and bleſs God that I never, from <hi>childhood</hi> to <hi>manhood,</hi> WILFULLY gave pain either to the MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERLY or SISTERLY heart <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See his mother's written acknowlegement to this purpoſe, Vol. II. p. 214.</note>; nor from <hi>manhood</hi> to the <hi>preſent hour,</hi> to any other woman.</p>
               <p>O Sir! Sir!—What is it you call <hi>pain,</hi> if at this inſtant (and I ſaid it with tears) <hi>that</hi> which your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes me feel, is not ſo?—The dear, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Clementina! What a perverſeneſs is in <hi>her</hi> fate! She, and ſhe <hi>only,</hi> could have deſerved you!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1185400106:185"/>
He bent his knee to the greatly-honoured Harriet—I acknowlege with tranſport, ſaid he, the joy you give me by your magnanimity; ſuch a more than ſiſterly magnanimity to that of Clementina. How nobly do you authorize my regard for <hi>her!</hi>—In <hi>you,</hi> madam, ſhall I have all <hi>her</hi> excellencies, without the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which muſt have been allowed, had ſhe been mine, from conſiderations of Religion and Country. Believe me, madam, that my Love of her, if I know my heart is of ſuch a nature, as never can abate the fervor of that I vow to you. To both of you, my principal attachment was to MIND: Yet let me ſay, that the <hi>perſonal</hi> union, to which you diſcourage me not to aſpire, and the <hi>duties</hi> of that moſt intimate of all connexions, will preſerve <hi>to you</hi> the <hi>due</hi> preference; as (allow me to ſay) it would have done to <hi>her,</hi> had ſhe accepted of my vows.</p>
               <p>O Sir! believe me incapable of affectation, of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance, of diſguiſe! My heart (Why ſhould I not ſpeak freely to Sir Charles Grandiſon?) is wholly yours!—It never knew another Lord! I will flatter myſelf, that, had you never known Lady Clementina, and had ſhe not been a prior Love, you never would have had a divided heart!—What pain muſt you have had in the conflict! My regard for you, bids me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege my own vanity, in my pity for you!</p>
               <p>I guſhed into tears—You muſt leave me, Sir—I cannot bear the exaltation you have given me!</p>
               <p>I turned away my face: I thought I ſhould have fainted.</p>
               <p>He claſped me to his boſom: He put his cheek to mine: For a moment we neither of us could ſpeak.</p>
               <p>He broke the ſhort ſilence. I dread the effects on your tender health, of the pain I, or rather your own greatneſs of mind, give you. Beloved of my heart! kiſſing my cheek, wet at that moment with the tears of both, forgive me!—And be aſſured, that Reverence will <hi>always</hi> accompany my Love. Will it be too
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1185400106:186"/>
much, juſt now, to re-urge the day that ſhall anſwer the wiſhes of Clementina, of her noble brothers, of all our own friends, and make you wholly mine?</p>
               <p>His air was ſo noble; his eyes ſhewed ſo much awe, yet ſuch manly dignity, that my heart gave way to its natural impulſe—Why, Sir, ſhould I not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my reliance on your candour? My honour, in the world's eye, I entruſt to you: But bid men ot do an improper thing, left my deſire of obliging you ſhould make me forget myſelf.</p>
               <p>Was not this a generous reſignation? Did it not deſerve a generous return? But he, even Sir Charles Grandiſon, endeavoured to make his advantage of it. Letters from Italy unreceived! as if he thought my reference to thoſe a punctilio alſo.</p>
               <p>What a depoſit!—Your honour, madam, is ſafely entruſted. Can punctilio be honour?—It is but the ſhadow of it. What but <hi>that</hi> ſtands againſt your grant of an early day?—Do not think me miſled by my impatience to call you mine, to take an undue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your condeſcenſion. Is it not the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>both</hi> that I wiſh to confirm? And ſhall I ſuffer falſe delicacy, falſe gratitude, to take place of the true?—Allow me, madam—But you ſeem uneaſy—I will prolong the time I had intended to beg you would permit me to limit you to. Let me requeſt from you the choice of ſome one happy day before the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the next <hi>fourteen</hi>—</p>
               <p>Conſider, Sir!—</p>
               <p>Nothing, madam, happening in my behaviour to cauſe you to revoke the generous truſt: From <hi>abroad</hi> there cannot.</p>
               <p>He looked to be in earneſt in his requeſt: Was it not <hi>almoſt</hi> an ungenerous return to my confidence in him? Twelve days only had elaſped ſince his perſonal declaration; the Letters from Italy which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me to wait for, unreceived; Lady D. one of the moſt delicate-minded of women, knowing too my
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1185400106:187"/>
preferable regard for your brother: And muſt not the <hi>hurry</hi> have the worſe appearance for <hi>that?</hi> No prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration yet thought of: My aunt thinking his former urgency, greatly as ſhe honours him, rather <hi>too</hi> preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating—My ſpirits, hurried before, were really af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Do not call me a ſilly girl, deareſt Lady G: I endeavoured to ſpeak; but, at the inſtant, could not diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry, madam, that what I have ſaid has ſo much diſturbed you. Surely, ſome one day in the fourteen—</p>
               <p>Indeed, indeed, Sir, interrupted I, you have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me: I did not think you could have wiſhed <hi>ſo</hi> to limit me—I did not expect—</p>
               <p>What, lovelieſt of women! will you <hi>allow</hi> me to expect? The day is ſtill at your own choice. Revoke not, however, the generous conceſſion, till Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Mrs. Selby, and our Lucy, are conſulted. Will you, deareſt madam, be determined by them?</p>
               <p>Say, not, Sir, to any of them, after ſuch an inſtance of my confidence in you—for the honour of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed generoſity, ſay it not—that you could ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me; and I will endeavour to forget it.</p>
               <p>Conſider, my deareſt Miſs Byron—</p>
               <p>I believe my grandmamma is come, ſaid I—</p>
               <p>They are all goodneſs: They will indulge me. I will tell you, madam, taking my hand, and ſeating me, what is my intention, if you approve of it. All the country ſuppoſe that my application for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour meets with encouragement: They expect, as I have told you, a ſpeedy ſolemnization. I took my lodgings at ſome little diſtance from you, at a place of public entertainment; perhaps (pardon me, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, for the ſake of my ingenuouſneſs) with ſome view, that the general talk [See, Lady G! it is well he is a good man!] would help to accelerate my happy day: But, madam, to continue my daily viſits from thence, when my happineſs is ſuppoſed to be

near, will not perhaps <hi>look</hi> ſo well [We <hi>are to be</hi> ſtudious of <hi>looks,</hi> it ſeems]—Indeed I would not be thought to deſpiſe the world's opinion: The world, when it will have patience to ſtay till it is maſter of facts, is not always wrong: It can judge of others, better than it can act itſelf—The change of my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to others in this houſe, or in Shirley-manor, will not perhaps be allowed till I am bleſſed with the hand of the deareſt relation of both: I therefore think of going up to town, <hi>declaredly</hi> (Why not?) to prepare for our nuptials; and to return near the time agreed upon for the happy celebration. Then will either this houſe, or Shirley-manor, be allowed to receive the happieſt of men.</p>
               <p>He ſtopt: I was ſilent. He proceeded, looking tenderly, yet ſmilingly, in my downcaſt face, ſtill holding my hand:—And now, dearer to me than life, let me aſk you—Can you think it an unpardonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion on your condeſcending goodneſs, that I make the time of my return to my Miſs Byron not over-tedious?—Fourteen days, were you to go to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of them, would be an age to me, who have been for ſo many days paſt the happieſt man that a perſon in expectation can be. I do aſſure you, madam, that I had not the inſolence to ſuppoſe I was making you a requeſt that was rather expected to be <hi>forgiven,</hi> than complied with. I thought myſelf not ungenerous to the confidence you repoſed in me, that I gave you <hi>ſo much</hi> time. I thought of a <hi>week,</hi> and began apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing, leſt you ſhould think it too ſhort; but, when I ſaw you diſturbed, I concluded with the mention of a <hi>fortnight.</hi> My deareſt creature, think me not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in my expectations of your compliance—</p>
               <p>What, Sir! in a fortnight?—</p>
               <p>As to preparations, madam, you know the pleaſure my ſiſters will have in executing any commiſſions you will favour them with on ſo joyful an occaſion. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte had not <hi>ſo much</hi> time for preparation. But were
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1185400106:189"/>
                  <hi>not</hi> every-thing to be in readineſs by the choſen day, there will be time enough for all you wiſh, before you would perhaps chooſe to ſee company—Conſider, my deareſt life, that if you regard punctilio merely; punctilio has no determinate end: Punctilio begets punctilio. You may not half a year hence imagine <hi>that</hi> to be ſufficiently gratified. Again I ſay, Do <hi>you,</hi> madam, conſider: Let me adhere to the fourteen days, and within them crown the hope you gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within</hi> them!—Sir! I did not expect—</p>
               <p>You tell me, my beloved Miſs Byron, interrupted he, what you did <hi>not</hi> expect—Tell me, I beſeech you, miſtreſs as you are of one of the nobleſt of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male hearts, what you <hi>did</hi> expect, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to make me the compliment, that, were it to be carried into effect, would engage my utmoſt gratitude.</p>
               <p>I had not thought of <hi>any</hi> particular time: But I could <hi>not</hi> have made you that compliment, had I thought of a day ſo <hi>very</hi> early.</p>
               <p>You have, madam, you <hi>ought</hi> to have, the option: Yet I own, that your declared generous confidence in me had elated me. The temptation was too great for me, not to wiſh to make uſe of the power you had, as I thought, put into my hands: And allow me to ſay, that I cannot give up my hope till your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and aunt decide that I ought.</p>
               <p>How, Sir!—And can you thus adhere?—But I will allow of your <hi>reference</hi>—</p>
               <p>And be determined by their advice, madam?</p>
               <p>But I will not truſt you, Sir, with pleading your own cauſe.</p>
               <p>Are you not arbitrary, madam?</p>
               <p>In this point, if I am, ought I <hi>not</hi> to be ſo?</p>
               <p>Yes, if you will <hi>reſume</hi> a power you had ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly reſigned.</p>
               <p>May I <hi>not,</hi> Sir, when I think it over-ſtrained in the hands of the perſon to whom, in better hopes, it was delegated?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1185400106:190"/>
That, dear Lady, is the point to be tried. You conſent to refer the merits of it to your grandmamma and aunt?</p>
               <p>If I <hi>do,</hi> Sir, you ought not to call me <hi>arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is gracious, bowing, in my ſovereign Lady, to ſubmit her abſolute will and pleaſure to arbitration.</p>
               <p>Very well, Sir!—But will you not ſubmit to <hi>my own</hi> award?</p>
               <p>Tell me dear Miſs Byron, tell me, if I do, how generous will you be?</p>
               <p>I was far from intending—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was,</hi> madam—I hope I may dwell upon that word, and repeat my queſtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Am,</hi> Sir. I <hi>am</hi> far from intending—</p>
               <p>No more, dear madam. I appeal to another tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, I will endeavour to recollect the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this converſation, and lay it, in writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judges you have named. Lucy ſhall be one.</p>
               <p>You will permit me, madam, to ſee your ſtate of the caſe, before you lay it before the judges?</p>
               <p>No, Sir! None but they muſt ſee it, till it makes part of a Letter to Lady G. who then ſhall ſhew it only to Lady L.</p>
               <p>It is the harder to be thus preſcribed to, my dear Miſs Byron, becauſe—</p>
               <p>What, Sir, in my day?—</p>
               <p>That was what I was going to urge, becauſe <hi>mine</hi> will never come. Every day, to the end of my life, will be yours [Dear man!]—Only, Sir, as I <hi>deſerve</hi> your kindneſs, I wiſh not for it on other terms. And you ſhall be then ſole judge of my deſerts. I will not appeal to any other tribunal.</p>
               <p>He gracefully bowed. I think, ſaid he, ſmiling, I muſt withdraw my intended appeal: I am half-afraid of my judges; and perhaps ought to rely wholly on your goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1185400106:191"/>
No, no, Sir! Your <hi>intention</hi> is your <hi>act.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> ſenſe you have appealed to Caeſar <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Alluding to Feſtus's anſwer to St. Paul, Acts xxv. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I never before was in Love with deſpotiſm. You mention writing to my ſiſters: You correſpond with them, I preſume, as you formerly did with <hi>our</hi> Lucy. Let me tell you, madam, that you had not been <hi>Miſs Byron,</hi> FOURTEEN days after I was favoured with the ſight of thoſe Letters, had I been at liberty to offer you my heart, and could I have prevailed on you to accept it. Your diſtreſs, your noble frankneſs of heart—</p>
               <p>And let me own, Sir, as an inſtance of the frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you are pleaſed to encourage, that gratitude for the deliverance you ſo nobly gave me, had as much power over <hi>my</hi> heart, as the openneſs of mine, and my diſtreſs, could have over yours.</p>
               <p>Sweet excellence!—Complete your generous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a grateful heart; it <hi>is</hi> a grateful one; and ſhorten the days of your <hi>ſingle</hi> power, in order to enlarge it!</p>
               <p>Lucy appeared; but ſeeing us engaged in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, was about to retire: But he, ſtepping to her, and taking both her hands—OUR Lucy, obligingly, ſaid he, you muſt come in—You are to be one judge of three in a certain cauſe, that will come before you—And I hope—</p>
               <p>No prejudgings, Sir Charles, ſaid I—You are not to plead at all—</p>
               <p>Yet deeply intereſted in the event, Miſs Selby! ſaid he.</p>
               <p>A bad ſign, couſin Byron! ſaid Lucy. I begin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to doubt the juſtice of your cauſe.</p>
               <p>When you hear it, Lucy, make, as you uſually do, the golden rule yours, and I have nothing to fear.</p>
               <p>I tell you, before-hand, I am inclined to favour Sir Charles. No three judges can be found, but will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, from his character, that <hi>he</hi> cannot be wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1185400106:192"/>
But from mine, that <hi>I</hi> may! O my Lucy! I did not expect this from my couſin. You muſt not, I think, be one of my judges.</p>
               <p>To this place, I have ſhewn my three judges. The following is their determination, drawn up by the dear Lady preſident, my grandmamma:</p>

                           <p>WE, the underwritten, do find, upon the caſe laid before us by the ſaid Harriet, That, in the whole converſation between the ſaid Sir Charles and her, ſhe has behaved herſelf with that true virgin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, yet with that laudable unreſervedneſs, that might be expected from <hi>her</hi> character, and <hi>his</hi> merits. We think, the gentleman has the advantage of the Lady in the arguments for the early day contended for; and, if ſhe had defended herſelf by little artifices and diſguiſes, we ſhould have had no ſcruple to decide againſt her: But as ſhe has ſhewn, throughout the converſation, noble inſtances of generoſity, truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and even acknowleged affection; we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them both a compromiſe.</p>
                           <p>We allow, therefore, Sir Charles Grandiſon to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his intentions of going up to town, <hi>declaredly</hi> to prepare for the happy day; and recommend it to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, in conſideration of the merits of the requeſter (who lays his whole heart open before her, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner too generous not to meet with a like return) to fix as early a day as in prudence ſhe can.</p>
                           <p>For the reſt, May the Almighty ſhower down his bleſſings on both! May all their contentions, like this, be thoſe of Love, and true Delicacy! May they live together many, very many, happy years, an example of conjugal felicity! And may their

exemplary virtues meet with an everlaſting reward!—So prays! ſo ſubſcribes!</p>

               <p>To-morrow morning, when Sir Charles comes to breakfaſt, this paper will be preſented to him by my grandmamma.</p>
               <p>I wonder whether Sir Charles writes to Dr. Bartlett an account of what paſſes here. If he does, what would I give to ſee his Letters! and particularly, what he thinks of the little delays he meets with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But do, dear Lady G. acquit me of affectation and parade. Indeed it is not that. I hope he himſelf acquits me, and cenſures himſelf; for, upon my word, he is unreaſonably haſty.</p>
               <p>I could not but expreſs a little curioſity about his hint of Lady Olivia's favourable opinion of me, tho' not at the time; and he was ſo good as to ſhew me, and my grandmamma and aunt, a moſt extraordinary character which ſhe gave me in a long Letter. I ſaw it was a long Letter (I was very <hi>Eve-iſh,</hi> my dear). Lucy ſaid afterwards, that I did <hi>ſo leer</hi> at it: An ugly word, importing <hi>ſlineſs!</hi> and, after I was angry at myſelf for giving her the idea that put her upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it, I chid her for uſing it.</p>
               <p>Lady Olivia writes ſuch high things, my dear! I bluſhed—I did not, could not, deſerve them. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pitied her, you know; but now you cannot imagine how much more than ever I pitied her. Do all of us, <hi>indeed,</hi> as the men ſay, love flattery?—I did not think I did—I ſhall find out all the <hi>obliquities</hi> of my heart, in time. I was ſuppoſed once to be ſo <hi>good</hi> a creature—as if none other were half ſo good!—Ah, my partial friends! you ſtudied your Harriet in the dark; but here comes the ſun darting into all the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1185400106:194"/>
crooked and obſcure corners of my heart; and I ſhrink from his dazling eye; and, compared to Him (and <hi>Clementina,</hi> let me add) appear to myſelf ſuch a Nothing—</p>
               <p>Nay, I have had the mortification, once or twice, to think myſelf leſs than the very Olivia, upon whom, but lately, ſecure of my mind's ſuperiority to her mind, I looked down with a kind of proud compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And whence this exaltation of Olivia, and ſelf-humiliation?—Why, from her magnifying beyond meaſure the poor Harriet, and yielding up her own hopes, entreating him, as ſhe does, to addreſs me; and that with ſuch honourable diſtinction, as if my acceptance of him were doubtful, and a condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could procure you a copy of what your brother read to me—Ah, my dear! it is very ſoothing to my pride!—But what is the <hi>foundation</hi> of that pride? Is it not my ambition to be thought worthily of by the beſt of men? And does not praiſe ſtimulate me to reſolve to <hi>deſerve</hi> praiſe? I will <hi>endeavour</hi> to deſerve it. But, my dear, this Olivia, a fine figure herſelf, and loving in ſpite of diſcouragement, can praiſe, to the object of her Love, the <hi>perſon,</hi> and ſtill more, the <hi>mind,</hi> of her rival!—Is not that great in Olivia? Could <hi>I</hi> be ſo great, if I thought myſelf in danger from <hi>her?</hi>

               <p>SIR Charles came not this morning till we were all aſſembled for breakfaſt. I had begun to think, whether, if I had been Sir Charles, and he had been Miſs Byron, I would not have been here an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, expecting the deciſion of the judges to whom a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1185400106:195"/>
certain cauſe was referred. O my dear Lady G.! how narrow minded I am, with all my quondam he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm! The knowlege of his paſt engagements with the excellent Clementina, and of his earneſt wiſhes then to be hers, makes me, on every occaſion that can be tortured into an appearance of neglect or coldneſs, <hi>ſo</hi> ſilly!—Indeed I am aſhamed of myſelf. But all my petulance was diſpelled, the inſtant he ſhone upon us.</p>
               <p>Well, my dear Ladies, ſaid he, the moment he took his place, whiſperingly to my grandmamma (who ſat between my aunt and Lucy), Is ſentence given?</p>
               <p>It is, Sir Charles—He took my hand, croſs my Nancy's lap, as ſhe ſat between him and me—I have hopes, my dear Miſs Byron [from the fooliſhneſs in my looks, I ſuppoſe] that you are <hi>caſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have patience, Sir, ſaid I—It is well that the beſt of us are not always to be our own carvers.</p>
               <p>He looked, Lucy ſaid afterwards, with eyes of love upon me, and of apprehenſion on his judges; and the diſcourſe turned upon different ſubjects.</p>
               <p>I retired as ſoon as breakfaſt was over; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſentence.</p>
               <p>My uncle was, as he called it, <hi>turned out of door</hi> before my grandmamma gave your brother the paper.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles read it—You are not ſerious upon it, Sir Charles, ſaid my grandmamma.—I am infinitely obliged to you, Ladies, replied he. I love to argue with my dear Miſs Byron: I muſt attend her, this moment.</p>
               <p>He ſent up Sally before him, and came up. I was in my cloſet; and ſcrupled not to admit him.</p>
               <p>Henceforth, my deareſt dear Miſs Byron, ſaid he, the moment he approached me (as I ſtood up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him) I ſalute you undoubtedly mine—And he ſaluted me with ardor—I knew not which way to look—So <hi>polite</hi> a Lover as I thought him!—Yet never man was ſo gracefully free!—It remains now,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1185400106:196"/>
madam, proceeded he, ſtill holding my hand, to put to trial your goodneſs to me [You have done that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, thought I!] in the greater queſtion, by which I am to conduct myſelf for the next week, or ten days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Week</hi> or <hi>ten days,</hi> thought I! Surely, Sir, you are an incroacher.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Sir, ſaid I, when a little recovered, what judges who, on ſuch points as theſe, cannot err, have determined.</p>
               <p>Yes, they <hi>can,</hi> interrupted he: As <hi>Ladies,</hi> they are parties—But I ſubmit. Their judgment muſt be a law to me—I will go up to town, as they adviſe. I cannot, however, be long abſent from you. When I return, I will not put up at a public place. Either your uncle, or your grandmother, muſt allow me to be their gueſt. This will oblige you, I hope, even for <hi>dear</hi> punctilio ſake, to honour me with your hand very ſoon after my return.</p>
               <p>He pauſed: I was ſilent. His firſt addreſs had put me out. Remember, madam, I ſaid, reſumed he, that I cannot be long abſent: You are above being governed by mere punctilio. Add to the obligations your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous acceptance of me has laid me under—Why ſighs my Angel? [It was, my dear Lady G. an involuntary ſigh!]—For the world, I would not give you either ſenſible or laſting pain. But if the ſame circumſtances would make your nomination of a day as painful to you, ſome time hence, as now, then bleſs me with as early a day as you CAN give me, to expreſs myſelf in the words of my judges.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, ſaid I (but I heſitated, and looked down) is one of the ſolemn points which precede one of the moſt ſolemn circumſtances of my life. You ſeem more in earneſt for an early day than I could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. When I have declared that affectation has no part in the more diſtant compliance, I may be allowed, by the niceſt of my own Sex, to lay open to a man ſo generous, tho' ſo precipitating, my whole heart. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1185400106:197"/>
Sir, it is wholly yours—I bluſhed, as I felt, and turned away my face. It <hi>was</hi> a free declaration: But I was reſolved to baniſh affectation. He bowed profoundly on my hand, and kiſſed it. Gratitude looked out in his eyes, and appeared in his graceful manner, tho' attentively ſilent.</p>
               <p>You was my deliverer, proceeded I. An eſteem founded on gratitude, the object ſo meritorious, ought to ſet me above mere forms—Our judges ſay that you have the advantage in the argument.</p>
               <p>I will lay no ſtreſs, madam, on this part of their judgment in my favour—To your goodneſs, and to that ſo nobly-acknowleged eſteem, I wholly refer my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>I myſelf think, proceeded I, that you have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the argument—All that is in my power, I would wiſh to do, to oblige you—</p>
               <p>Condeſcending goodneſs!—Again he bowed on my hand.</p>
               <p>Do you think, Sir—</p>
               <p>Why heſitates my Love?</p>
               <p>Do you think, ſix weeks—</p>
               <p>Six ages, my deareſt, deareſt creature?—Six weeks! For Heaven's ſake, madam—He looked, he ſpoke, impatience.</p>
               <p>What can a woman, who has owned your title to <hi>expect</hi> to be obliged, ſay?—let me, at leaſt, aſk (and I unaffectedly heſitated) a <hi>month,</hi> Sir—from this day—And that you will acknowlege yourſelf not perverſely or weakly treated.</p>
               <p>He dropt on one knee, and kiſſing my hand, once, twice, thrice, with rapture, <hi>Within</hi> the month! then I hope—I cannot live a month from you—Allow me to return in the firſt fortnight of the month—</p>
               <p>O Sir! and take up your reſidence with us, on your return.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly, madam.—Conſider, Sir—Do you alſo, deareſt madam, conſider; and baniſh me not from you for ſo very long a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1185400106:198"/>
My heart <hi>wanted,</hi> I thought, to oblige him; but to allow him to return ſooner, as he was to take up his abode with us, what was that, but, in effect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with his firſt propoſal?</p>
               <p>Permit me, Sir, to retire. Indeed you are too ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>He aſked my excuſe; but declared, that he would not give up his humble plea <hi>(humble</hi> he <hi>called</hi> it) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs my grandmamma and aunt told him, that he ought.</p>
               <p>On his leaving me to return to company below, he preſented me with four little boxes. Accept, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Miſs Byron, ſaid he, of theſe trifles. I received them not till this morning. While I had the Day to <hi>hope</hi> from you, my heart would not ſuffer me to offer them, leaſt you ſhould ſuſpect me mean enough to imagine an influence from them. I oblige myſelf by the tender, and I comply with cuſtom, which I am fond of doing, whenever I can innocently do it. But I know, that you, my dear Miſs Byron, value the heart more than a thouſand times the value of theſe—Mine, madam, is yours, and will be yours to the end of my life.</p>
               <p>What could I ſay?—My heart, on recollection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches me for my ungraceful acceptance. I courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied. I was ſilly. Sir Charles Grandiſon only can be preſent to every occaſion.</p>
               <p>He <hi>looked</hi> as if my <hi>not</hi> refuſing them was a favour more than equivalent to the value of the preſents. My deareſt life! ſaid he, on my putting them on my toilette, how much you oblige me!—Shall I conduct you to our friends below? Will you acquaint your grandmamma and aunt with our debate, and my bold expectation?</p>
               <p>I ſtood ſtill. He took my hand, preſſed it with his lips, and, with a reverence more than uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, as if he had <hi>received</hi> inſtead of <hi>conferred</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, withdrew. Never was a preſent ſo gracefully
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1185400106:199"/>
made! I cannot deſcribe the grace with which he made it.</p>
               <p>My uncle, it ſeems, as ſoon as he went down, aſked him, How we had ſettled the great affair? My grandmamma and aunt in a breath, as he paid his compliments to them, aſked him, If their Harriet had been good?—or, as good as he expected?</p>
               <p>Miſs Byron, ſaid he, has taken more time than I could have wiſhed ſhe had. A month, ſhe talks of.</p>
               <p>Has ſhe complied ſo far? ſaid my grandmamma. I am glad of it. I was afraid ſhe would have inſiſted upon more time—So was I, ſaid my aunt. But who can withſtand Sir Charles Grandiſon? Has the dear girl given you the very day, Sir?</p>
               <p>No, madam. If ſhe had, I ſhould have hoped it would have been conſiderably <hi>within</hi> the month. As yet, Ladies, I hope it will.</p>
               <p>Nay, Sir Charles, if you are not pleaſed with a month, ſaid my aunt—Huſh, dear Ladies!—Here comes the Angel.—Not a word, I beſeech you, on that ſide of the queſtion—She will think, if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud her, that ſhe has conſented to too ſhort a term—You muſt not make her uneaſy with herſelf.</p>
               <p>Does not this look as if he imagined there was <hi>room</hi> for me to be ſo?—I <hi>almoſt</hi> wiſh—I do'nt know what I wiſh; except I could think but half ſo well of myſelf as I do of him: For then ſhould I look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with leſs pain in my joy than now too often min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with it.</p>
               <p>Your brother excuſed himſelf from dining with us: That Greville has engaged him. Why would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to be engaged by him? Greville cannot love him: He can only admire him, and that every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body does, who has been but once in his company. Miſs Orme, even Miſs Orme, is in Love with him. I received a note from her while your brother was with us. Theſe are the contents:</p>

               </p>
               <p>But I am vexed at his dining with us to-day. So little time to ſtay with us! I wiſh him to be <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> to Mr. Greville; but need he be ſo <hi>very</hi> obliging? There are plots laying for his company all over the county.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1185400106:201"/>
Greville humourouſly declares, that he hates all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the ſake of one.</p>
               <p>WE have juſt opened the boxes. O my dear Lady G! your brother is either very proud, or his fortune is very high! Does he not ſay, that he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults fortune, as well as degree, in matters of outward appearance? He has not, in theſe preſents, I am ſure, conſulted either the fortune or degree of your Harriet—Of your <hi>happy</hi> Harriet, I had like to have written: But the word <hi>happy,</hi> in this place, would have looked as if I thought theſe jewels an addition to my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How does his bounty inſult me, on my narrow fortune!—Narrow, unleſs he ſubmit to accept of the offered contributions of my dear friends—<hi>Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!</hi>—Proud Harriet! how art thou, even in thy exaltation, humbled!—<hi>Trifles,</hi> he called them! The very ornamenting one's ſelf with ſuch <hi>toys,</hi> may, in his eye, be thought trifling, tho' he is not above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the faſhion, in things indifferent: But, the coſt and beauty of theſe jewels conſidered, they are <hi>not</hi> trifles. The jewel of jewels, however, is his heart!

                  <p>I Will hurry off a few lines. I am always ready before theſe fiddling girls: Lucy and Nancy, I mean. Never tedious, but in dreſſing! They will over-do the morning appearance. I could beat them. So well acquainted with propriety as they are; and knowing the beauty of elegant negligence. Were I not afraid of Lucy's repartee; and that ſhe would ſay I was laying out for a compliment; I would tell them they had a mind to try to eclipſe Miſs Clarkſon, and the Yorkſhire Ladies. Your brother <hi>ſupped,</hi> as well as dined, at that Greville's. Fie upon him! I did not think he had ſo little command of himſelf!—Vain Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet! Perhaps he <hi>choſe</hi> to be rather <hi>there</hi> than <hi>here,</hi> for <hi>novelty</hi> -ſake. I ſhall be ſaucy, by-and-by. He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſtrongly engaged in talk with my aunt—About <hi>me,</hi> I ſuppoſe: Ay, to be ſure! methinks your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſays. He can talk of nobody elſe!—Well, and what if one would wiſh he <hi>could</hi> not! <hi>[What are theſe girls about?]</hi> No leſs than one-and-twenty gentlemen at Greville's, beſides the Prince of them all. They all were ready to worſhip him. Fenwick looked in juſt now, and tells us ſo. He ſays, that your brother was the livelieſt man in the company. He led the mirth, he ſays, and viſibly exerted himſelf the more, finding the turn of the converſation likely to be what might be expected from ſuch a company of all men. Wretches! Can twenty of them, when met, be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable creatures, not a woman among them, to ſoften their manners, and give politeneſs to their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?—Fenwick ſays, they engaged him at one time into talk of different regions, cuſtoms, uſages. He was maſter of every ſubject. Half a ſcore mouths
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1185400106:203"/>
were open at once whenever he ſpoke, as if diſtended with <hi>gags,</hi> was his word; and every one's eyes broader than ever they were obſerved to be before. Fenwick has humour; a little: Not much; only by accident. So unlike <hi>himſelf</hi> at times, that he may paſs for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent man. His aping Greville, helps his oddneſs.—How I ramble! You'll think I am aping my dear Lady G. Mocking's catching!—<hi>[O theſe girls!]</hi>—I think time loſt when I am not writing to you. You cannot imagine what a thief I am to my company. I ſteal away myſelf, and get down, before I am miſſed, half a ſcore times in a couple of hours. Sir Charles ſung to the wretches: They all ſung. They encored him without mercy.—He talks of ſetting out for town on Saturday, early. Lord bleſs me! what ſhall I <hi>do,</hi> when he is gone?—Do you think <hi>I</hi> ſay this? If I <hi>do,</hi> I am kept in countenance: Every-body ſays ſo, as well as I—But ah, Lady G.!—He has invited all the gentlemen, the whole Twenty-one, and my couſin James, and my uncle, to dine with him at his inn, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow!—<hi>Inn!</hi> naſty inn! Why did we let him go thither?—I am afraid he is a reveller. Can he be ſo <hi>very</hi> good a man? O yes, yes, yes! wicked Harriet! What is in thy heart, to doubt it? A fine reflexion upon the age; as if there could not be <hi>one</hi> good man in it! and as if a good man could not be a man of vivacity and ſpirit! From whom can ſpirits, can chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, can debonnairneſs, be expected, if not from a <hi>good</hi> man?—I will ſhew theſe girls, by the quantity I have written, how they have made me wait. Prating I ſuppoſe, to my Sally, about Sir Charles: They can talk of nobody elſe.—<hi>Ready!</hi> Yes, you dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! So you ought to have been a leaf and half of my writing ago!—Adieu, Lady G. till our return from Miſs Orme's.</p>

                  <p>JUST come back from Miſs Orme's. Sir Charles and my grandmamma are now got together, in ſerious
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1185400106:204"/>
talk. I know I was the ſubject, by the dear parent's looking often ſmiling upon me, as I ſat at diſtance, and by his eyes (taking the reference, as I may call it, of her's) turned as often towards me; ſo I ſtole up to my pen.</p>
                  <p>We were very politely treated by Miſs Orme. Miſs Clarkſon is a charming young Lady: The three York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire ſiſters are lovely women. Sir Charles has told us, that mere Beauty attracts only his eyes, as fine flowers do in a gay parterre. I don't know <hi>that,</hi> my dear: That's the <hi>philoſophical</hi> deſcription of himſelf. The <hi>ſame</hi> men and women are not always the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons. The Ladies, one and all, when his back was turned, declared, that he was the gallanteſt man they ever were in company with. He ſaid the eaſieſt, politeſt things, they ever heard ſpoken.—They never were in his company <hi>before:</hi> They might elſe have heard <hi>as</hi> fine. Such dignity they obſerved (ſo does every-body), yet ſo much eaſe, in all he ſaid, as well as in his whole behaviour—<hi>Born</hi> to be a public man, would his pride permit him to aim at being ſo!—Not a ſyllable, however, but what might be ſaid to each with the ſtricteſt truth. Sir Charles Grandiſon [It is Lucy's obſervation, as well as mine] addreſſes himſelf to women, <hi>as</hi> women, not as goddeſſes; yet does honour to the perſons, and to the ſex. Other men, not knowing what better to ſay, make Angels of them, all at once. The higheſt things are ever ſaid by men of the loweſt underſtandings; and, their bolts once ſhot, the poor ſouls can go no further. So ſilly!—Has not your Ladyſhip ſome of theſe in your eye, who make out the reſt, by grinning in our faces, in order to convince us of their <hi>ſincerity?</hi> Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental men don't conſider, that if the women they egregiouſly flatter were what they would have them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they think them, they would not be ſeen in ſuch company.</p>
                  <p>But what do you think the elder ſiſter of the three
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1185400106:205"/>
ſaid of your brother?—She was ſure, thoſe eyes, and that vivacity and politeneſs, were not given him for nothing. <hi>Given him for nothing!</hi> What a phraſe is that! In ſhort, ſhe ſaid, that <hi>practice</hi> had improved his natural advantages. <hi>This</hi> I have a good mind to ſay of <hi>her</hi>—Either ſhe had not charity, or her heart has paid for enabling its miſtreſs to make ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. <hi>Practice!</hi> What meant ſhe by the word?—Indeed your brother was not quite ſo <hi>abſtractedly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive, <hi>I</hi> thought, to the Beauty of Miſs Clarkſon, but he might give ſome <hi>little ſhadow</hi> of ground for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to a cenſorious perſon.</p>
                  <p>I ſometimes think, that, free and open as his eyes are, his character might ſuffer, if one were to judge of his heart by them. Lord L. I remember, once ſaid, that Ladies abroad uſed to look upon him as their own man, the moment they beheld him.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently ſo, no doubt, and in their converſation-aſſemblies. Poor Lady Olivia, I ſuppoſe, was ſo caught! at an unhappy moment, perhaps when her caution was half-aſleep, and ſhe was loth to have it too rudely awakened. But ought I, your Harriet, to talk of this?—Where was <hi>my</hi> caution, when I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>myſelf</hi> to be ſurpriſed?—O but my <hi>gratitude</hi> was my excuſe. Who knows what Olivia might have to plead?—We have not her whole ſtory, you know. Poor Lady! I pity her! To croſs the ſeas, as ſhe did!—Ineffectually!</p>
                  <p>But can you bear this pen-prattling; the effects of a mind more at eaſe than it ever expected to be?</p>
                  <p>I will go down. <hi>Can</hi> I be ſo long ſpared? I am juſt thinking, that were I one of the creatures called Coquettes, the beſt way to attract attention, when it grew languid, is, to do as I do from zeal in writing to you—Be always going out and returning, and not ſtaying long enough in a place to tire one's company, or ſuffer them to turn their eyes upon any-body elſe. Did <hi>you</hi> ever try ſuch an experiment, Charlotte? But
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1185400106:206"/>
you never <hi>could</hi> tire your company. Yet I think you have a ſpice of that character in yours. Don't you think ſo, yourſelf?—But don't own it, if you do—Hey-day! What's the matter with me! I believe by my flippancy I am growing quite well, and as ſaucy as I uſed to be—Poor Lady Clementina! I wiſh ſhe were happy! Then ſhould I be ſo.</p>
                  <p>MY dear Lady G. we had a charming converſation this day: My grandmamma and your brother bore the principal parts in it. It began with dreſs, and faſhion, and ſuch-like trifling ſubjects; but ended in the nobleſt. You know my grandmamma's chearful piety. Sir Charles ſeemed at firſt only deſigning to attend to her wiſdom; but ſhe drew him in. O my dear! he ſeems to be, yet not to know it, as good a man, as ſhe is a woman! Yet years ſo different!—But auſterity, uncharitableneſs, on one hand; oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, affectation, on the other; theſe are qualities which can have no place in his heart. Such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious benevolence! Such enlarged ſentiments!—What a happy, thrice happy woman, thought I, ſeveral times, muſt ſhe be, who ſhall be conſidered as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his goodneſs! Who ſhall be bleſt not only <hi>in</hi> him, but <hi>for</hi> him; and be his, and he hers, to all eternity!</p>
                  <p>My aunt once, in the concluſion of this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, How happy would it be, if he could reform certain gentlemen of this neighbourhood! And as they were ſo fond of his company, ſhe hoped he would attempt it.</p>
                  <p>Example, he anſwered, and a <hi>ſilent</hi> one, would do more with ſuch men than <hi>precept. They have Moſes, and the prophets.</hi> They know when they do wrong, and what is right. They would be afraid of, and affronted at, a man pretending to inſtruct them. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, from ſuch men, is as much as can be expected. We live in ſuch an age, added he, that I believe more
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1185400106:207"/>
good may be done by ſeeming to relax a little, than by ſtrictneſs of behaviour. Yet I admire thoſe, who, from a full perſuaſion of their duty, do <hi>not</hi> relax; and the more, if they have got above moroſeneſs, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and uncharitableneſs.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, Mr. Milbourne, a very good man, miniſter of a Diſſenting congregation in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, accompanied by Dr. Curtis, called in upon us. They are good friends; made ſo by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my grandmamma, ſome years ago, when they did <hi>not</hi> ſo well underſtand each other. Dr. Curtis had been with us more than once, ſince Sir Charles was our viſiter. He greatly admires him, you need not doubt. It was beautiful, after compliments had paſſed between Sir Charles and the gentlemen, to ſee the <hi>modeſt man</hi> ſhine out in your brother's behaviour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was free and eaſy, but attentive, as expecting entertainment and inſtruction from <hi>them;</hi> and leading <hi>each</hi> of them to give it in his own way.</p>
                  <p>They ſtaid but a little while; and when they were gone, Sir Charles ſaid, He wanted no other proof of their being good men, than they gave by their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and friendſhip to each other. My uncle, who, you know, is a zealous man <hi>for the Church,</hi> ſpeaking a little ſeverely of perſons whom he called <hi>Sciſmatics;</hi> O Mr. Selby! ſaid Sir Charles, let us be afraid of preſcribing to tender conſciences. You and I, who have been abroad, in countries where they account us <hi>worſe</hi> than Schiſmatics, would have been loath to have been preſcribed to, or compelled, in articles for which we ourſelves are only anſwerable to the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>I believe in my conſcience, Sir Charles, replied my uncle, if the truth were known, you are of the mind of that King of Egypt, who ſaid, He looked upon the diverſity of religions in his kingdom with as much pleaſure as he did on the diverſity of flowers in his garden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1185400106:208"/>
I remember not the name of that King of Egypt, Mr. Selby; but I am <hi>not</hi> of his mind. I ſhould not, if I were a king, take <hi>pleaſure</hi> in ſuch a diverſity: But as the <hi>examples</hi> of Kings are of great force, I would, by making my own as faultleſs as I could, let my people ſee the excellence of my perſuaſion, and my uniform practical adherence to it; inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging erroneous ones by unjuſtifiable ſeverity. Religious zeal is generally a fiery thing: I would as ſoon quarrel with a man for his Face, as for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. A good man, if not over-hated by zeal, <hi>will be</hi> a good man, whatever be his faith; and ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be intitled to our eſteem, as he is to our good offices as a fellow-creature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> Sir Charles; What think you of the <hi>Methodiſts!</hi> Say you love 'em; and, and, and, adds-dines, you ſhall not be my nephew.</p>
                  <p>You, now, my dear Mr. Selby, make me afraid of you. You throw out a menace, the <hi>only</hi> one you could perhaps think of, that would make me temporize.</p>
                  <p>You need not, you need not, be afraid, Sir Charles, ſaid my uncle, laughing! What ſay <hi>you,</hi> Harriet? <hi>Need</hi> he? Hay? looking in my downcaſt face. Why ſpeak you not, <hi>lovely Love?</hi> Need Sir Charles, if he <hi>had</hi> diſobliged <hi>me,</hi> to have been <hi>afraid?</hi>—Hay?</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir! you have not of a long time been ſo—</p>
                  <p>So, <hi>what,</hi> Harriet? So, <hi>what,</hi> deareſt? looking me quite down.</p>
                  <p>Fie, Mr. Selby! ſaid my grandmamma. Sir Charles, ſtepping to me, very gallantly took my hand—O Mr. Selby, you are not kind, ſaid he: But allow me to make my advantage of your unkindneſs. My dear Miſs Byron, let you and I withdraw; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to Mr. Selby, let us withdraw: We will not hear him chidden, as I ſee the Ladies think he ought to be.</p>
                  <p>And he hurried me off. The ſurprize made me appear more reluctant than I was in my heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1185400106:209"/>
Every one was pleaſed with his air and manner; and by this means he relieved himſelf from ſubjects with which he ſeemed not delighted, and obtained an opportunity to get me to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here</hi> had he ſtopt, he would have been welcome: But hurrying me into the Cedar-parlour; I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, my Love, ſaid he; putting his arm round me: You ſeemed loth to retire with me. Forgive me: But thus I puniſh you, whenever you give me cauſe: And, dear Lady G. he downright kiſſed me—My lip; and not my cheek—and in ſo fervent a way—I tell you every-thing, my Charlotte—I could have been angry—had I known <hi>how,</hi> from ſurprize. Before I could recollect myſelf, he withdrew his arm; and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his uſual reſpectful air, it would have made me look affected, had I then taken notice of it. But I don't remember any inſtance of the like freedom uſed to Lady Clementina.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>lovely Love,</hi> ſaid he, to expreſs myſelf in your uncle's ſtile, which is that of my heart, tell me, Can you have pity for a poor man, when he is miſerable, who, on a certain occaſion, ſhewed <hi>you</hi> none? See what a Letter Sir Hargrave Pollexfen has written to Dr. Bartlett; who aſks my advice about attending him.</p>
                  <p>I obtained leave to communicate it to you, my dear Ladies. Be pleaſed to return it to me. I preſume, you will read it here.</p>

                        <p>CAN your company be diſpenſed with by the beſt of men, for one, two, three days?—I have not had a happy hour ſince I ſaw you and Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon at my houſe on the Foreſt. All is gloom and horror in my mind: My deſpondency is, muſt be, of the blackeſt kind. It is blacker than remorſe: It is all repining; but no repentance: I cannot, cannot, repent. Lord God of Heaven and Earth, what a

wretch am I! with ſuch a fortune; ſuch eſtates! I am rich as Craeſus, yet more miſerable than the wretch that begs his bread from door to door; and who oftener meets repulſes, than relief. What a glorious choice has your patron made! Youth unbroken; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience his friend; he cannot know an enemy. O that I had lived the life of your patron! I cannot ſee a creature who does not extol him. My wine-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's name is Danby—Good God! What ſtories does he tell of him! Lord Jeſus! What a heart muſt he have, that would permit him to do ſuch things as Danby reports of him, of his own knowlege! While I—As young a man as himſelf, for what I know—With power to do good, as great, perhaps greater, than his own.—Lord! Lord! Lord! what a hand have I made of it, for the laſt three or four years of my life! who might have reached Threeſcore-and-ten with comfort! whereas now, at Twenty-eight, I am on the very brink of the grave. It appears to me as ready dug: It yawns for me: I am neither fit to die, nor to live. My days are dreadful: My nights are worſe: My bed is a bed of nettles, and not of down. Not one comfortable thought, not one good action, to revolve, in which I had not ſome vile gratification to promote! Wretched man! It is come home to me, with a vengeance.</p>
                        <p>You prayed by me: You prayed for me. I have not been ſo happy ſince—Come, and make me eaſy—happy I can never be, in this world—For pity, for charity ſake, come and teach me how to bear life, or how to prepare for its ceſſation. And if Sir Charles Grandiſon would make me one more viſit, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally join in prayer with you and me, a glimpſe of comfort would once more dart in upon my mind.</p>
                        <p>Try your intereſt with him, my dear Sir, in my behalf; and come together. Where is he?—The great God of Heaven and Earth proſper to him all his wiſhes, be he where he will, and be they what they

will. Every-body will find their account in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. But I! what uſe have I made of the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given me?—Merceda gone to his account: Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhall undone: Jordan ſhunning me! Narrow-ſoul'd Jordan! He is reformed; but not able to divide the <hi>man</hi> from the <hi>crime,</hi> he thinks he cannot be in earneſt, but by hating both. God help me! I cannot, now, if I would, give him a bad example! He need not be afraid of my ſtaggering him in his good purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>One favour, for God's ſake, procure for me—It s, that the man whoſe life once I ſought, and thought myſelf juſtified by the provocation; who afterwards ſaved mine, for a <hi>time</hi> ſaved it, reſerved as I was for pains, for ſufferings, in mind and body, worſe than death—That <hi>this</hi> man will be the Executor of my laſt Will. I have not a friend left. My relations are hungering and watching for my death, as birds of prey over a field of battle. My next heirs are my worſt enemies, and moſt hated by me. Dear Sir Charles Grandiſon, my deliverer, my preſerver, from thoſe bloody Frenchmen, if you are the good man I think you, complete your kindneſs to him whom you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and ſay, you will be his Executor. I <hi>will</hi> (becauſe I <hi>muſt)</hi> do juſtice to the pretenſions of thoſe who will rejoice over my remains; and I will leave you a diſcretionary power, in articles wherein you may think I have ſhewn hatred. For juſtice-ſake, then, be my Executor. And do you, good Bartlett, put me in the way of repentance; and I ſhall then be happy. Draw me up, dear Sir, a Prayer, that ſhall include Confuſion. You cannot ſuppoſe me too bad a man, in a Chriſtian ſenſe. Thank God, I am a Chriſtian in belief, tho' I have been a Devil in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. You are a heavenly-minded man; give me words which may go to my heart; and tell me what I ſhall ſay to my God.</p>
                        <p>Tell Sir Charles Grandiſon, that he <hi>owes</hi> to me the ſervice I requeſt of him. For if he had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

ſo helliſhly as he did, on Hounſlow-heath, I had been the huſband of Miſs Byron in two hours; and ſhe would have thought it her duty to reform me: And, by the Great God of Heaven, I ſwear, it was my intention to be reformed, and to make her, if I could have had but her <hi>Civility,</hi> tho' not her <hi>Love,</hi> the beſt of huſbands. Lord God of Heaven and Earth! what a happy man had I then been!—Then had I never undertaken that damned expedition to France, which I have rued ever ſince. Let your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron know how much I owe to him my unhappineſs, and he will not, in juſtice, deny any reaſonable, any honeſt requeſt, that I ſhall make him.</p>
                        <p>Lord help me! What a long Letter is here! My Soul complains on paper: I do nothing but complain. It will be a relief, if your patron and you will viſit, will pray for, will pity,</p>

                  <p>Your brother's eye followed mine, as I read. I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wept. In a ſoothing, tender, and reſpectful manner, he put his arm round me, and, taking my own handkerchief, unreſiſted, wiped away the tears as they fell on my cheek. Theſe were his ſoothing words as my boſom heaved at the dreadful deſcription of the poor man's miſery and deſpair: Sweet humanity!—Charming ſenſibility—Check not the kindly guſh!—Dew-drops of Heaven! wiping away my tears, and kiſſing the handkerchief—Dew-drops of Heaven, from a mind, like that Heaven, mild and gracious!—Poor Sir Hargrave!—I will attend him.</p>
                  <p>You <hi>will,</hi> Sir! That is very good of you!—Poor man! What a hand, as he ſays, has he made of it!</p>
                  <p>A hand, indeed! repeated Sir Charles, his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign eyes gliſtening.</p>
                  <p>And will you be his Executor, Sir?—You will, I hope?</p>

                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1185400106:213"/>
I will do any-thing that my dear Miſs Byron wiſhes me to do; any-thing that may comfort the poor man, if indeed he has not a perſon in whom he <hi>ought</hi> to confide, whether he is <hi>willing</hi> to do ſo, or not. My endeavour ſhall be, to reconcile him to his relations: Perhaps he hates them becauſe they are likely to be his heirs: I have known men capable of ſuch narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>When we came to the place where the unhappy man mentions my having been likely to be his in two hours time, a chilneſs came over my heart; I ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Ah, Sir! ſaid I, how grateful ought I to be to <hi>my</hi> deliverer!</p>
                  <p>Ever-amiable goodneſs! reſumed he, How have I been, how am I, how ſhall I be, rewarded?—With tender awe he kiſſed my cheek—Forgive me, Angel of a woman! A man can ſhew his Love but <hi>as</hi> a man. Your heart is the heart I wiſh it to be! Love, Humanity, Graciouſneſs, Benevolence, Forgiveneſs, all the amiable qualities which can adorn the Female mind, are, in perfection, yours! Be your Siſter-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence happy! God grant it! and I ſhall be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man in the world. You, madam, who can pity your oppreſſor when in miſery, can allow of my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance of that admirable woman.</p>
                  <p>Your tender remembrance of Lady Clementina, Sir, will ever be grateful to me.—God Almighty make her happy!—for your ſake! for the ſake of your dear Jeronymo; and for mine!</p>
                  <p>There ſpoke Miſs Byron, and Clementina, both in one! Surely you two are informed by one mind! What is diſtance of countries! What obſtacles can there be, to diſſever Souls ſo paired!</p>
                  <p>But, Sir!—<hi>Muſt</hi> Clementina be <hi>compelled</hi> to marry? <hi>Muſt</hi> the woman who has loved Sir Charles Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; who ſtills avows her Love, and only prefers her God to him; be <hi>obliged</hi> to give her hand to another man?</p>

Would to Heaven that her friends, tender, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as they have always been to her, would not drive too faſt! But how can I, of all men, remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to them in this caſe, when they think nothing is wanting to obtain her compliance, but the knowlege that ſhe never <hi>can</hi> be mine?</p>
                  <p>O Sir! you ſhall <hi>ſtill</hi> call her yours, if the dear Lady changes her reſolution, and <hi>wiſhes</hi> to be ſo—<hi>Ought</hi> you not?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>could</hi> Miſs Byron—</p>
                  <p>She <hi>could,</hi> ſhe <hi>would,</hi> interrupted I—Yet dear, very dear, I am not aſhamed to own it, would now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation coſt me!</p>
                  <p>Exalted lovelineſs!</p>
                  <p>I never, but by ſuch a trial, can be as great as Clementina!—Then could <hi>I,</hi> as <hi>ſhe</hi> does, take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the brevity of human life Never, never, would <hi>I</hi> be the wife of any other man. And ſhall the <hi>nobler</hi> Clementina be compelled?</p>
                  <p>Good God! lifting by his hands and eyes, With what noble minds haſt thou diſtinguiſhed theſe two women!—Is it for this, madam, that you wiſh to wait for the next Letters from Italy? I have owned before, that I preſumed not to declare myſelf to you till I was ſure of Clementina's adherence to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſo nobly taken. We will, however, expect the next Letters. My ſituation has not been happy. Nothing but the conſciouſneſs of my own integrity (excuſe, madam, the ſeeming boaſt) and a firm truſt in Providence, could, at certain times, have ſupported me.</p>
                  <p>My mind, my Charlotte, ſeemed too high wrought. Seeing me much diſturbed, he reſumed the ſubject of Sir Hargrave's Letter, as a ſomewhat leſs-affecting one. You ſee, my deareſt Miſs Byron, ſaid he, a kind of neceſſity for my haſtening up. Another mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy occaſion offers: Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp deſires to ſee me, before he dies.—What a chequered life is this!—I received Sir Hargrave's Letter to Dr.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1185400106:215"/>
Bartlett, and this intimation from my Beauchamp, by a particular diſpatch, juſt before I came hither. I grudge the time I muſt loſe to-morrow: But we muſt make ſome ſacrifices to good neighbourhood and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. Poor Greville had a view, by inviting all his neighbours and me, to let himſelf down with a grace, in a certain caſe. He made a merit of his reſignation to me, before all the company; every one of which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired my dear Miſs Byron. Well received as I was, by every gentleman then preſent, I could not avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting them, in my turn; but I will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the time. Have I your approbation, madam, for ſetting out on Saturday morning, early?—I am afraid I muſt borrow of the Sunday ſome hours, on my journey. But viſiting the ſick is an act of mercy.</p>
                  <p>You will be ſo engaged to-morrow, Sir, ſaid I, with your numerous gueſts (and my uncle and couſin James will add to the number) that I ſuppoſe we ſhall hardly ſee you before you ſet out (early, as you ſay that will be) on Saturday morning.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, He had given orders already (and, for fear of miſtakes, ſhould inforce them to-night) for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of his gueſts; and he would do himſelf the pleaſure of breakfaſting with us in the morning.—Dear Lady Clementina, forgive me!—I ſhall not, I am afraid, know how to part with him, tho' but for a few weeks.—How could you let him depart from <hi>you;</hi> you knew not but it would be for ever?—But you are a wonder of a woman!—I am, at leaſt at this preſent writing, a poor creature, compared to you!</p>
                  <p>I aſked his leave to ſhew my grandmamma and aunt and my Lucy, as well as his two ſiſters, Sir Hargrave's Letter. He wiſhed that they <hi>only</hi> ſhould ſee it.</p>
                  <p>The peruſal coſt the three dear friends juſt named ſome tears. My grandmamma, Lucy tells me (for I was writing to you when they read it) made ſome fine obſervations upon the different ſituations in which the two gentlemen find themſelves at this time. I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1185400106:216"/>
could not but recollect the gay, fluttering figure that the poor Sir Hargrave made at Lady Betty Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's, perpetually laughing; and compare it with the dark ſcene he draws in the Letter before me; all brought about in ſo ſhort a ſpace!</p>
                  <p>There are, I am told, <hi>worſe</hi> men than this: Were thoſe who are but <hi>as bad,</hi> to be apprized of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Sir Hargrave's ſtory, as fully as we know them, would they not reflect and tremble at his ſate, even tho' that of Merceda (whoſe exit, I am told, was all horror and deſpair) and of the unhappy Bagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, were not taken into the ſhocking account?</p>
                  <p>This laſt wretch, it ſeems, his ſpirits and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both broken, is gone, nobody knows whither, having narrowly eſcaped in perſon, from an execution that was out againſt him, body and goods; the latter all ſeized upon: his wife, and an unhealthy child, and ſhe big with another, turned out of doors; a mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee in poſſeſſion of his eſtate: The poor woman wiſhing but for means to tranſport herſelf and child to her mean friends at Abbeville; a collection ſet on foot in her neighbourhood, for that purpoſe, failing; for the poor man was neither beloved, nor pitied.</p>
                  <p>Theſe particulars your brother's truſty Richard Saunders told my Sally; and in confidence, that your brother, a little before he came down, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her deſtitute condition, ſent her, by him, twenty guineas. He never ſaw a deeper ſcene of diſtreſs, he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The poor woman on her knees, received the bounty; bleſſed the donor; owned herſelf reduced to the laſt ſhilling; and that ſhe thought of applying to the pariſh for aſſiſtance to carry her over.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles ſtaid not to ſupper. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma, being deſirous to take leave of her favourite in the morning, has been prevailed upon to repoſe here to-night.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you, my Charlotte, all my fears, my

feelings, my follies: You are <hi>now,</hi> you know, my Lucy. Something ariſes in my heart, that makes me uneaſy: I cannot account to myſelf for this great and ſudden change of behaviour in Greville. His extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary civilities, even to fondneſs, to your brother! Are they conſiſtent with his bluſtring character, and conſtant threatnings of any man who was likely to ſucceed with me? A turn of behaviour ſo ſudden!

Muſt not that diſgrace incenſe him?—My uncle ſays, he cannot be a true ſpirit; witneſs his compromiſe with Fenwick, after a rencounter, which being reported to be on my account, had like to have killed me at the time.

                  <p>THE apprehenſions with which I was ſo weak as to trouble you, in the concluſion of my laſt, laid ſo faſt hold of my mind, that, going immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from my pen to my reſt, I had it broken and diſturbed by dreadful, ſhocking, wandering dreams. The terror they gave me, ſeveral times awakened me; but ſtill, as I cloſed my eyes, I fell into them again. Whence, my dear, proceed theſe ideal vagaries, which, for the time, realize pain or pleaſure to us, according to their hue or complexion, or rather according to our own?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1185400106:218"/>
But ſuch <hi>contradictory</hi> vagaries never did I know in my ſlumbers. Incoherences of incoherence!—For example—I was married to the beſt of men: I was <hi>not</hi> married: I was rejected with ſcorn, as a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous creature. I ſought to hide myſelf in holes and corners. I was dragged out of a ſubterraneous cavern, which the ſea had made when it once broke bounds, and ſeemed the dwelling of howling and conflicting winds; and when I expected to be puniſhed for my audaciouſneſs, and for repining at my lot, I was turned into an Angel of light; ſtars of diamonds, like a glory, encompaſſing my head: A dear little baby was put into my arms. Once it was Lucy's; another time it was Emily's; and at another time Lady Clementina's!—I was fond of it, beyond expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>I again dreamed I was married: Sir Charles again was the man. He did not love me. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma and aunt, on their knees, and with tears, beſought him to love their child; and pleaded to him my love of him of long ſtanding, begun in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and that he was the only man I ever loved. O how I wept in my dream! My face and boſom were wet with my real tears.</p>
                  <p>My ſobs, and my diſtreſs and <hi>theirs,</hi> awakenod me; but I dropt aſleep, and fell into the very ſame reſverie. He upbraided me with being the cauſe that he had not Lady Clementina. He ſaid, and <hi>ſo</hi> ſternly! I am ſure he cannot look ſo ſternly, that he thought me a much better creature than I proved to be: Yet methought, in my own heart, I was not altered. I fell down at his feet. I called it my misfortune, that he could not love me: I would not ſay it was his fault. It might, perhaps, be his misfortune too!—And then I ſaid, Love and Hatred are not always in one's power. If you cannot love the poor creature who kneels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, <hi>that</hi> ſhall be a cauſe ſufficient with me for a divorce: I deſire not to faſten myſelf on the man who cannot love me. Let me be divorced from you, Sir—
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1185400106:219"/>
You ſhall be at liberty to aſſign any cauſe for the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but <hi>crime.</hi> I will bind myſelf never, never to marry again; but you ſhall be free—And God bleſs you, and her you can love better than your poor Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet.—Fool! I weep as I write!—What a weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am, ſince I have not been well!</p>
                  <p>In another part of my reſverie he loved me dearly; but when he nearly approached me, or I him, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways became a ghoſt, and flitted from me. Scenes once changed from England to Italy, from Italy to England: Italy, I thought, was a dreary wild, covered with ſnow, and pinched with froſt: England, on the contrary, was a country glorious to the eye; gilded with a ſun not too fervid; the air perfumed with odours, wafted by the moſt balmy Zephyrs from orange-trees, citrons, myrtles and jeſſamines. In Italy, at one time, Jeronymo's wounds were healed; at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they were breaking out afreſh. Mr. Lowther was obliged to fly the country: Why, did not appear. There was a fourth brother, I thought; and he, taking part with the cruel Laurana, was killed by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Father Mareſcotti was at one time a martyr for his Religion; at another, a Cardinal; and talked of for Pope.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill, what was more ſhocking, and which ſo terrified me that I awoke in a horror which put an end to all my reſveries (for I ſlept no more that night)—Sir Charles, I thought was aſſaſſinated by Greville. Greville fled his country for it, and became a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, a Cain, the Accurſed, I thought, of God and Man—I, your poor Harriet, a widow; left in the moſt calamitous circumſtance that a woman can be in—Good Heaven!—But, avaunt, recollection!—Painful, <hi>moſt</hi> painful recollection of ideas ſo terrible! none of your intruſions—</p>
                  <p>No more of theſe horrid, horrid incongruities, will I trouble you with! How have they run away with me! I am hardly now recovered from the tremblings into which they threw me!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1185400106:220"/>
What, my dear, is the reaſon, that tho' we know theſe dreams, theſe fleeting ſhadows of the night, to be no more than <hi>dreams,</hi> illuſions of the working mind, fettered and debaſed as it is by the organs through which it conveys its confined powers to the groſſer matter, body, then ſleeping, inactive, as in the ſhades of death; yet that we cannot help being ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them, and meditating interpretation of the flying vapours, when reaſon is broad awake, and tells us, that it is weakneſs to be diſturbed at them?—But Superſtition is, more or leſs, I believe, in every mind, a natural defect. Happily poiſed is that mind, which, on the one hand, is too ſtrong to be affected by the ſlaviſh fears it brings with it; and, on the other, runs not into the contrary extreme, Scepticiſm, the parent of infidelity!</p>
                  <p>You cannot imagine, my dear, the pleaſure I had, the more for my various dream, when your brother, ſo amiably ſerene, Love, Condeſcenſion, Affability, ſhining in his manly countenance, alighted, as I ſaw him through my window, at the ſame time I had the call to breakfaſt—Dear Sir! I could have ſaid, Have not you been diſturbed by cruel, perplexing, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory viſions! Souls may be near, when Bodies are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. But are we not one Soul? Could yours be unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, when mine was ſo much diſturbed?—But, thank God, you are come? Come ſafe, unhurt, pleaſed with me! My fond arms, were the ceremony paſſed, ſhould welcome you to your Harriet. I would tell you all my diſturbances from the abſurd illuſions of the paſt night, and my mind ſhould gather ſtrength from the confeſſion of its weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>He talked of ſetting out early to-morrow morning. His firſt viſit, he ſaid, ſhould be to Sir Harry Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ; his next to Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. Poor Sir Harry! he ſaid, and ſighed for him.</p>
                  <p>Tender-hearted man! as Clementina often called your brother! he pitied Lady Beauchamp. His poor
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1185400106:221"/>
Beauchamp!—The loſs of a father, he ſaid, where a great eſtate was to deſcend to the ſon, was the teſt of a noble heart. He could anſwer for the ſincerity of his Beauchamp's grief, on this trying occaſion. Of what joy, ſaid he [ſitting between two of the beſt of women, equally fond of him, ſpeaking low] was I, was <hi>my</hi> father, deprived! He had allowed me to think of returning to the arms of his paternal love. I make no doubt, but on looking into his affairs (his ſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his ſteward) he would have done for his daughters, what I have done for my ſiſters. We ſhould both of us have had a new life to begin, and purſue: A happy one, from my duty and his indulgence, it muſt have been. I had planned it out.—With all humility I would, by degrees, have laid it before him, firſt one part, then another, as his condeſcenſion would have countenanced me.</p>
                  <p>Vile, vile reſveries!—Muſt not this young man be the peculiar care of Heaven? How could my diſturbed imagination terrify me but in a dream, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of the darkeſt mind (as his muſt be [Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is not ſo bad a man] who could meditate violence againſt virtue ſo ſacredly guarded) could be permitted to prevail againſt his life!</p>
                  <p>My grandmamma once, with tears in her eyes, as he talked of taking leave, laid her hand upon his, and inſtantly withdrew it, as if ſhe thought the action too free. He took her hand, and, with both his, lifted it to his lips—Venerable goodneſs! he called her. She looked <hi>ſo</hi> proud, and <hi>ſo</hi> comforted! every one <hi>ſo</hi> pleaſed!—It is a charming thing to ſee blooming youth fond of declining age!</p>
                  <p>They dropt away one by one, and I found myſelf left alone with him. Sweetly tender was his addreſs to me! How ſhall I part with my Harriet? ſaid he. My eyes were ready to overflow. By a twinkling motion, I thought to diſperſe over the whole eye the ſelf-felt too ready tear: My upper-lip had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1185400106:222"/>
in it, throbbing, like the pulſation which we call the life-blood—I was afraid to ſpeak, for fear of burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a fit of tenderneſs; yet was conſcious that my very ſilence was more expreſſive of tenderneſs than ſpeech could have been. With what delight did his eager eye (as mine, now-and-then glancing upward, diſcovered) meditate my downcaſt face, and ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern! Yet ſuch was his delicacy, that he took not that notice of it, in words, which, if he had, would have added to my confuſion: It was enough for him, that he ſaw it. As he was contented <hi>ſilently</hi> to enjoy the apparent affection, I am not ſorry he <hi>did</hi> ſee it. He merited even open and unreſerved aſſurances of Love. But I the ſooner recovered my ſpirits, for his delicate non-obſervance. I could not, circumſtanced as we were, ſay I <hi>wiſhed</hi> for his ſpeedy return; yet, my dear, my pureſt wiſhes were, that he would not be long abſent. My grandmamma pleaſes herſelf with having the dear man for her inmate, on his return: There is therefore no need, for the ſake of the world's ſpeech, to abridge my month; yet <hi>ought</hi> we to be ſhy of giving conſequence to a man who through delicacy is afraid to let us ſee that he aſſumes conſequence from our ſpeechleſs tenderneſs for him?—He reſtored me to ſpeech, by a change of ſubject—</p>
                  <p>Two melancholy offices ſhall I have to perform, ſaid he, before I have the honour to attend again my deareſt Miſs Byron: What muſt be the heart that melts not at another's woe!—As to Sir Hargrave, I don't apprehend that he is near his end; as is the caſe of poor Sir Harry. Sir Hargrave labours under bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pains, from the attack made upon him in France, and from a conſtitution ruined perhaps by riot: And, having nothing of conſolation to give himſelf from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on his paſt life, as we ſee by his Letter, his fears are too ſtrong for his hopes. But ſhall I tell him, if I find it will give him comfort, that <hi>you</hi> wiſh his recovery, and are ſorry for his indiſpoſition? Small
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1185400106:223"/>
crevices let in light, ſometimes upon a benighted ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. He muſt conſider his attempt upon your free-will (tho' not meant upon your honour) as one of the enormities of his paſt life.</p>
                  <p>I was overpowered with this inſtance of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous goodneſs Teach me, Sir, to be good, to be generous, to be forgiving—like you!—Bid me do what you think proper for me to do—Say to the poor man, whoſe inſults upon you in his challenge were then my terror (O how much my terror!) in my name ſay, all that you think will tend to give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
                  <p>Sweet excellence! Did I ever hope to meet in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with ſuch an enlargement of heart!—Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina only, of all the women I ever knew, can be ſet in compariſon with you: And <hi>had</hi> ſhe been granted to me, the union of minds between us from difference of Religion, could not have been ſo perfect, as yours and mine muſt be.</p>
                  <p>Greatly gratified as I was by the compliment, I was ſorry, methought, that it was made me at the expence of my Sex. His words, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Did I ever hope to meet in woman with ſuch an enlargement of heart!'</q> piqued me a little. Are not women as capable as men, thought I, of enlarged ſentiments?</p>
                  <p>The leave he took of me was extremely tender. I endeavoured to check my ſenſibility. He departed with the bleſſings of the whole family, as well as mine. I was forced to go up to my cloſet: I came not down till near dinner-time; I <hi>could</hi> not; and yet my uncle accompanied my couſin James to North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton: So that I had no apprehenſions of his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. One <hi>wants</hi> trials ſometimes, I believe, to make one ſupport one's ſelf with ſome degree of <hi>outward</hi> fortitude, at leaſt. Had my uncle been at home, I ſhould not have dared to have given ſo much way to my concern: But ſoothing and indulgence, ſometimes, I believe, add to our imbecility of mind, inſtead of ſtrengthening our reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:1185400106:224"/>
MY uncle made it near eleven at night before he returned, with my couſin James. Not one of the company, at his quitting it, ſeemed inclinable to move. He praiſed the elegance of the entertainment, and the eaſe and chearfulneſs, even to vivacity, of Sir Charles. How <hi>could</hi> he be ſo lively!—How many ways have men to divert themſelves, when any-thing arduous attacks them!—While we poor women!—But your town-diverſions—Your Ranelaghs, Vaux-halls—bid fair to divert ſuch of us as can carry ourſelves out of ourſelves!—Yet are we likely to pay dear for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; ſince we thereby render our Sex cheap in the eyes of men, harden our fronts, and are in danger of loſing that modeſty, at leaſt of <hi>outward</hi> behaviour, which is the characteriſtic of women!</p>

                  <p>HE is gone: Gone indeed! Went early this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every mouth was laſt night, it ſeems, full of his praiſes: The men admire him as much as the women. I am glad of it, methinks; ſince that is an indirect confeſſion, that there are few among them like him. Not ſo much ſuperiority over our Sex therefore, in the other, in general, with their <hi>enlarged hearts.</hi> Have not we a Clementina, a Mrs. Shirley, and a long &amp;c?—I praiſe <hi>you</hi> not, my dear Lady L. and Lady G. to your faces; ſo I leave the &amp;c. untranſlated. We do <hi>ſo</hi> look upon one another here! Are <hi>ſo</hi> unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ourſelves! We are not half ſo good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as we were <hi>before</hi> Sir Charles came among us. How can that be? But my Grandmamma has left us too!—that's one thing. She is retired to Shirley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manor, to mortify, after ſo rich a regale: Thoſe were her words.</p>
                  <p>I hope your brother will write to us. Should I not have aſked him? To be ſure he will; except his next Letters from Italy ſhould be—But, no doubt, he will
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1185400106:225"/>
write to us. Mr. Greville vows to my uncle, he will not come near me. He can leſs and leſs, he ſays, bear to think of my marrying; tho' he does what he can to comfort himſelf with reflecting on the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary merit of the man, who alone, he ſays, can deſerve me. He wiſhes the day were over; and the D—l's in him, he adds, if the irrevocableneſs of the event does not cure him. Mr. Fenwick had yeſterday his final anſwer from Lucy; and he is to ſet out on Monday for Carliſle. He declares, that he will not return without a wife: So, thank Heaven, his heart is whole, notwithſtanding his double diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>BUT my heart is ſet on hearing how the excellent Clementina takes the news of your brother's actual addreſs, and probability of ſucceeding. I ſhould not think it at all ſupriſing, if, urged as ſhe is, to marry a man indifferent to her (the Lord of her heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married) ſhe ſhould retract—O my Charlotte!—What a variety of ſtrange, ſtrange, What-ſhall-I-call them? would reſult from ſuch a retractation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of claim! I never thought myſelf ſuperſtitious; but the happineſs before me is ſo much beyond my merit, that I can hardly flatter myſelf, at times, that it will take place.</p>
                  <p>WHAT think you, my dear, made me write ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively?—My aunt had juſt ſhewn me a Letter ſhe had written to you—deſiring you—to exerciſe for us your fancy, your judgment. I have no affectation on this ſubject—I long ago gave affectation to the winds—But ſo haſty!—So undoubting!—Are there not many poſſibilities, and ſome probabilities, againſt us?—Something preſumptuous!—Lord bleſs me, my dear, ſhould any-thing happen—Jewels bought, and already preſented—Appare!—How would all theſe preparations aggravate! My aunt ſays, he <hi>ſhall</hi> be obliged: Lucy, Nancy, the Miſs Holles's, join with

her. They long to be exerciſing their fancies upon the patterns which they ſuppoſe your Ladyſhip and Lady L. will ſend down. My uncle hurries my aunt. So as <hi>ſomething</hi> is going forward, he ſays, he ſhall be eaſy. There is no reſiſting ſo ſtrong a tide: So let them take their courſe.

               <p>YOUR humanity, my dear and ever-dear Miſs Byron, was ſo much engaged by the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Letter of Sir Hargrave to Dr. Bartlett, which I communicated to you; and by the diſtreſs of my Beauchamp, on the deſperate ſtate of his father's health; that I know you will be pleaſed to hear that I have been enabled to give ſome conſolation to both.</p>
               <p>Sir Harry, who is in town, wanted to open his mind to me with regard (to ſome affairs which made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uneaſy; and which, he ſaid, he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to any-body elſe. He ſhewed ſome reluctance to entruſt the ſecrets to <hi>my</hi> boſom. There ſhall they ever reſt. He has found himſelf eaſier ſince. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to me on the good underſtanding ſubſiſting, and likely to ſubſiſt, between his Lady and Son. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to excuſe him for joining me with them, without aſking my leave, in the truſts created by his Will: And on this occaſion, ſending for his Lady, he put her hand in mine, and recommended her and her intereſts, as thoſe of the moſt obliging of wives, to my care.</p>
               <p>I found Sir Hargrave at his houſe in Cavendiſh-Square.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1185400106:227"/>
He is exceſſively low-ſpirited. Dr. Bartlett viſited him at Windſor, ſeveral times. The Doctor prevailed on him to retain a worthy clergyman, as his chaplain.</p>
               <p>The poor man aſked after you, madam. He had heard, he ſaid, that I was ſoon likely to be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of men: Was it ſo? He wept at my anſwer; lamented the wretched hand, as he called it, that <hi>he</hi> had made of it, bleſſed as he was with ſuch proſperous circumſtances, in the prime of youth; and wiſhed he had his days to come over again, and his company to chooſe. Unhappy man! He was willing to remove from <hi>himſelf</hi> the load which lay upon him. No doubt but this was the recourſe of his companions, likewiſe, in extremity. He bleſſed my deareſt Miſs Byron, when I told him, ſhe pitied him. He called himſelf by harſh, and even ſhocking names, for having been capable of offending ſo much goodneſs.</p>
               <p>What ſubjects are theſe, to entertain my Angel with!—But tho' we ſhould not <hi>ſeek,</hi> yet we ought not perhaps to <hi>ſhun</hi> them, when they naturally, as I may ſay, offer themſelves to our knowlege.</p>
               <p>But <hi>another</hi> ſubject calls for the attention of my deareſt, lovelieſt of women: A ſubject that will lay a ſtill ſtronger claim to it than either of the ſolemn ones I have touched upon. I incloſe the Letter which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it. You will be ſo good as to read it in Engliſh to ſuch of our friends as read not Italian.</p>
               <p>This Letter was left to Mrs. Beaumont to diſpatch to me; whence its unwiſhed-for delay: For ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, to ſend with it an equally-obliging one of her own. The contents of this welcome Letter, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſs Byron, will render it unneceſſary to wait for an anſwer to my laſt to Signor Jeronymo; in which I acquaint him with my actual addreſs, and the hopes I preſume to flatter myſelf with. I humbly hope you will think ſo.</p>
               <p>I am not afraid that one of the moſt generous of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1185400106:228"/>
women will be affected with the paſſage in which Signor Jeronymo expreſſes his pity for her, becauſe of the affection, he ſays, I muſt ever retain for his noble ſiſter <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See p. 236.</note>. He ſays right. And it is my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that you, the ſiſter-excellence of the admirable Clementina, will allow me to glory in my <hi>gratitude</hi> to her. You will ſtill more readily allow me ſo to do, when you have peruſed this Letter. Shall not the man who hopes to be qualified for the Supreme Love, of which the pureſt Earthly is but a type, and who aims at an univerſal benevolence, be able to admire, in the mind of Clementina, the ſame great qualities which ſhine out with ſuch luſtre in that of Miſs Byron?</p>
               <p>With what pride do I look forward to the viſit that ſeveral of this noble family intend to make us, becauſe of the <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> aſſurance that they will rejoice in my happineſs, and admire the Angel who is allowed to take place in my affections, of the Angel who would not have ſcrupled to accept of my vows, had it not been, as ſhe expreſſes herſelf <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See p. 240.</note>, for the <hi>interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of invincible obſtacles!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Beaumont, in her Letter, gives me the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the converſation between her and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, almoſt in the ſame words with thoſe of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymo, in the Letter incloſed. She makes no doubt that Lady Clementina will, in time, yield to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of her friends in favour of a man againſt whom, if ſhe can be prevailed upon to forego her wiſhes to aſſume the veil, ſhe can have no one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. You will ſee madam, by the incloſed, what they hope for in Italy from us; what Clementina, what Jeronymo, what a whole excellent family, hope for. You know how ardently my <hi>own</hi> family wiſh you to accelerate the happy day: Yours refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to you—Pardon me, my deareſt Miſs Byron, I will tell you what are my hopes—They are,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1185400106:229"/>
that, when I am permitted to return to Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, the happy day ſhall not be poſtponed <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, lovelieſt and deareſt of women! allow me to expect the honour of a line, to let me know how much of the tedious month, from laſt Thurſday you will be ſo good as to abate. Permit me to ſay, that I can have nothing that needs to detain me from the beloved of my heart, after Friday next.</p>
               <p>If, madam, you inſiſt upon the <hi>whole</hi> month, I beg to know, out of what part of our nuptial life, the LAST or the FIRST (happy, as I hope it will be) you would be willing to deduct the week, the fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that will be carried into the blank ſpace of courtſhip, by the delay? I hope, my dear Miſs Byron, that I ſhall be able to tell <hi>you,</hi> years and years after we are ONE, that there is not an hour of thoſe paſt, or of thoſe to come, that I would abate, or wiſh to throw into that <hi>blank.</hi> Permit me ſo to call it. The days of courtſhip cannot be <hi>our</hi> happieſt. Who cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates the day of their firſt acquaintance, tho' it may be remembred with pleaſure?—Do not the happy pair date their happineſs from the day of marriage? How juſtly then when hearts are <hi>aſſured,</hi> when minds <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter,</hi> are thoſe which precede it, to be deemed a blank!</p>
               <p>After all, your <hi>chearful</hi> compliance with my wiſhes, is the great deſireable. Whatever ſhall be your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, muſt determine me. My utmoſt gratitude will be engaged by the condeſcenſion, <hi>whenever</hi> you ſhall diſtinguiſh the day of the year, diſtinguiſhed as it will be to the end of my life, that ſhall give me the greateſt bleſſing of it, and confirm me</p>

               <p>I Gave you, my dear Grandiſon, in mine of the 5th, the copy of a paper written by my ſiſter, which filled us with hopes of her compliance with the wiſhes of all her family. She took time for deliberation; time was given her; but ſtill ſhe inſiſted on receiving your next Letters before ſhe came to any reſolution. Mrs. Beaumont herſelf was of opinion, that the dear creature only meditated delay: That alſo was ours. What, invincibly determined, as ſhe is, to adhere to the reſolution ſhe has ſo greatly taken, can ſhe hope for, (ſaid we among ourſelves) from the expected Letters? For ſhe had declared herſelf to be <hi>ſo</hi> determined, to my brother Giacomo, who actually aſſured her of all our conſents to an alliance with you, if ſhe repented of that reſolution.</p>
               <p>All this time we offered not to introduce, nor even to name, to her, the Count of Belvedere. Awed by her former calamity, and by an excurſiveneſs of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which at times ſhewed itſelf in her words and behaviour, we avoided ſaying or doing any-thing that was likely to diſturb her. Giacomo himſelf, tho' he wanted to return to Naples, had patience with her pretty trifling, beyond our expectation. At laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived yours of the 29th of September <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Letter v. p. 13.</note>; kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing a copy of yours to her, of the ſame date <note n="(b)" place="bottom">See Letter iv. p. 11.</note>. We queſtion not but your reply to mine of the 5th current, is on the road; not that the contents will be ſuch as we may hope for, from conſiderations of our happineſs and your own: But theſe, we thought,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1185400106:231"/>
without waiting for that, would anſwer the deſired end. I will tell you what was ſaid by every one, on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of both.</p>
               <p>Is this the man, ſaid the General, whom I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo rudely treated? I rejoice that we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled before he left us. I had formed a notion to his diſadvantage; that he was capable of art, and hoped to keep his hold in my ſiſter's affections, in view of ſome turn in his favour: But he is the moſt ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted of men. Theſe two Letters will ſtrengthen our arguments. Clementina, who has more than once declared that ſhe wiſhes him married to an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh woman, cannot now, that ſhe will ſee there is a woman with whom he thinks he can be happy, wiſh to ſtand in his way. Theſe will furniſh us with means to attack her in her ſtrongeſt hold; in her generoſity, her delicacy; and will bring to the teſt her vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The contents of theſe Letters will confirm her before half-taken reſolution, as in her paper, to oblige us <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See p. 88. of this Volume.</note>. Let <hi>Laurana,</hi> as the Chevalier ſays, go into a nunnery: Clementina will marry, or ſhe is a falſe girl; and the Sforza woman will be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>My mother applauded you, and rejoiced to hear that there is a woman of your own nation who is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making you more happy than her daughter could.</p>
               <p>What difficulties, ſaid the young Marchioneſs, (ever your friend) muſt a ſituation ſo critical have laid him under! A man ſo humane! And what further difficulties muſt he have to ſurmunt, in offering to a woman, whom even Olivia, as he ſays, admires, a hand that has been refuſed by another? May this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired woman be propitious to his ſuit!</p>
               <p>She muſt, ſhe muſt, ſaid the Biſhop. If ſhe has a heart diſengaged, ſhe cannot refuſe a man ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Jeronymo, haſten to be well. If ſhe favour him, we will all go over, and congratulate them both.</p>

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:1185400106:232"/>
I, for my part, ſaid I, would give up years of life to ſee my friend as happy in marriage as he deſerves to be.</p>
               <p>We muſt tell Clementina, ſaid my father, as our Giacomo has hinted, that it will not become her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity to ſtand in the way of the Chevalier's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>We ſent up your Letter to our ſiſter, by Camilla. She was buſy (Mrs. Beaumont ſitting by her at work) in correcting the proportion which once you found fault with, in a figure in her piece of Noah's Ark, and the riſing Deluge. A Letter, madam, from the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier—To me! ſaid ſhe; and overturned the table on which her materials lay, in haſte to take it.</p>
               <p>When we thought ſhe had had time to conſider of the contents, we ſent up to requeſt the favour of ſpeaking with Mrs. Beaumont. We owned to her, that we had a copy of your Letter to Clementina; and aſked, What the dear creature ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it?</p>
               <p>She read it, anſwered Mrs. Beaumont, in her own cloſet. I thought ſhe was too long by herſelf. I went to her. She was in tears. O Mrs. Beaumont! as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, holding out the Letter—See here!—The <hi>Chevalier</hi> is againſt me!—Cruel, I could <hi>almoſt</hi> ſay, cruel Grandiſon!—He turns my own words upon me. I have furniſhed him with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt myſelf—What ſhall I do?—I have for many days paſt repented that I gave, under my hand, reaſon to my friends to expect my compliance. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, cannot, confirm the hopes I gave!—What ſhall I do?</p>
               <p>I took it, read it, continued Mrs. Beaumont, and told her, that the Chevalier's arguments were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable. I dwelt upon ſome of them. She wept, and was ſilent.</p>
               <p>We then, my dear Grandiſon, ſhewed Mrs. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont your Letter to me. She read it—How, ſaid
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1185400106:233"/>
ſhe, has this excellent young man been embaraſſed! I know, from ſome of my countrymen, the character of the Lady whom he mentions: She is an excellent woman!—May I take up this Letter, and read it to Lady Clementina?</p>
               <p>By all means, anſwered the General; and ſupport, dear madam, the contents of both with your weight. It will be from perverſeneſs <hi>now,</hi> if ſhe withſtand us. Bid her remember, that ſhe has had once at her feet a kneeling father! Bid her remember the written hopes ſhe has given us!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Beaumont went up with it. I will give you an account of what my ſiſter ſaid as ſhe read it. O Grandiſon! read it but curſorily: You will more and more admire and love the Clementina, who, before her malady, was always conſidered as one of the firſt of women; and the glory of our houſe!</p>
               <p>She deſired to have it in her own hands: Mrs. Beaumont, to whoſe pen we owe the account, looked over her, and followed her eye, as ſhe read <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Letter v. p. 13. of this Volume.</note>.</p>

you in writing; and I ſhall paſs happily through this ſhort life; a life that deſerves not the buſtle which we make about it.

               <p>When ſhe came to the concluding part of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and your wiſhes for her perfect recovery, health and welfare, and for the happineſs of us all; May every bleſſing, ſaid ſhe, he wiſhes us, be his!</p>
               <p>Then folding up the Letter, and putting it in her boſom; This Letter, and that which accompanied it, (meaning yours to her) I muſt read over and over!</p>
               <p>Shall I ſay, my Grandiſon, that I half-pity the lovely Harriet Byron, tho' her name ſhould be changed to yours? You <hi>muſt</hi> love Clementina: Were a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princeſs her rival, you <hi>muſt.</hi> Clementina! who ſo generouſly can give up a Love as fervent as ever glowed in a virgin heart, on ſuperior motives; motives which regard Eternity; and receive joy in the proſpect of your happineſs with another woman, on a perſuaſion that that woman can make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than ſhe herſelf could, becauſe of a difference in Religion.</p>
               <p>My ſiſter chooſing to retire to her cloſet, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruſe the two Letters, Mrs. Beaumont, knowing our curioſity, put down what had paſſed; intending, as ſhe ſaid, to write a copy of it for you.</p>
               <p>How were we all, on peruſing it, charmed with our Clementina!—I inſiſted, that nothing, at preſent, ſhould be ſaid to her of the Count of Belvedere, and of our wiſhes in his favour. My father gave into my opinion. He ſaid, he thought the propereſt time to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1185400106:238"/>
mention the Count to her was, when we had an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Letter I wrote to you on the 5th current, if that could give us aſſurances that you had made your addreſſes to the charming Byron, and were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. The General was impatient; but he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced, on finding every one come into my motion; but ſaid, that if all this lenity did not do, he muſt beg leave to have his own meaſures purſued.</p>
               <p>SOME little particularity has appeared in the dear creature ſince I have written the above. She has been exceedingly earneſt with her mother, to uſe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with my father, and us, to be allowed to go to England: But deſires not the permiſſion till you are actually married. She pleads my health, becauſe of the ſalutary ſprings you mention to me.</p>
               <p>Several other pleas ſhe offered; but, to ſay truth, they carried with them ſuch an air of flightineſs, that I am loth to mention them: Yet all of them were innocent, all of them were even laudable. But (ſhall I ſay?) that ſome of them appeared too romantic for a ſettled brain to be ſo earneſt, as ſhe was, in having them carried into execution.</p>
               <p>We have no doubt, but all her view is, to avoid marriage, by ſuch a ſtrange excurſion. Dear creature, ſaid the Biſhop, ſpeaking of her juſt now, the veil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her, ſhe muſt have <hi>ſome</hi> point to carry: I wiſh we ſaw leſs rapidity in her manner.</p>
               <p>I, Grandiſon, for my part, remember how much ſhe and we all ſuffered by denying her the farewel-viſit from you, on your taking leave of Italy the time before the laſt.</p>
               <p>But we think an expedient has offered, that will divert her from this <hi>wildneſs,</hi> as I muſt call it: Mrs. Beaumont has requeſted, that ſhe may be allowed to take her with her to Florence for ſome weeks. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina is pleaſed with our readineſs to oblige them both; and they will ſoon go.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:1185400106:239"/>
But all this time ſhe is uniform and ſteady in her wiſhes for your marriage. She delights to hear Mrs. Beaumont talk of the perfections of the Lady to whom we are all deſirous of hearing you are united. You had written, it ſeems, to Mrs. Beaumont, a character given of this young Lady by Olivia, upon a perſonal knowlege of her. Mrs. Beaumont ſhewed it to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina.</p>
               <p>How generouſly did the dear creature rejoice in it! Juſt ſuch a woman, ſaid ſhe, did I wiſh for the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier. Olivia has ſhewn greatneſs of mind in this inſtance. Perhaps I have thought too hardly of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via. Little did I think, I ſhould ever have requeſted a copy of any-thing written by Olivia. Ill-will diſables us from ſeeing thoſe beauties in the perſon who is the object of it, which would otherwiſe ſtrike us to her advantage. You muſt oblige me, added ſhe, with a copy of this Extract.</p>

                     <p>This morning ſhe came down with her work into my chamber. I invite myſelf, Jeronymo, ſaid ſhe. I will ſit down by you, till you are diſpoſed to riſe.

I don't know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downright compulſion is not more tolerable than over-earneſt entreaty. A child, in the firſt inſtance, may contract herſelf, as I may ſay, within her own compaſs; may be hardened: But the entreaty of ſuch

friends as undoubtedly mean one's good, dilates and diſarms one's heart, and makes one wiſh to oblige them; and ſo renders one miſerable, whether we do or do not comply.

How little do I deſerve this fine compliment!—Magnanimity, my brother!—You know not what I yet, at times, ſuffer!—And have you not ſeen my reaſon vanquiſhed in the unequal conflict? She wept. But let the Chevalier be married, and to the Angel that is talked of; and let me confort myſelf, that he is not a ſufferer by my with-holding my hand—And <hi>then</hi> let me be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in the ſingle life, in a place conſecrated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement from this vain world; and we ſhall <hi>both</hi> be happy!</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Beaumont came to ſeek her. I prevailed on her to ſit down, and on my ſiſter to ſtay a little longer. I extolled my ſiſter to her: She joined in the juſt praiſe. But one act of magnanimity, ſaid Mrs. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, ſeems wanting to complete the greatneſs of your character, my Love, in this particular caſe of the expected marriage of the Chevalier Grandiſon.</p>
                     <p>What is that, Mrs. Beaumont?—All attention.</p>
                     <p>You ſee his doubts, his apprehenſions, of appearing worthy of the Lady ſo highly ſpoken of, becauſe of that delicacy of ſituation (which, as you obſerve, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via alſo hints at) from what may be called a divided Love: Miſs Byron may very well imagine, as his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1185400106:241"/>
Love of you commenced before he knew her, that ſhe may injure you if ſhe receive his addreſſes: You had the generoſity to wiſh, when you were reading thoſe his apprehenſions, that you <hi>knew</hi> the Lady, and were able to influence her in his favour.</p>
                     <p>Well, Mrs. Beaumont—</p>
                     <p>Can I doubt that Lady Clementina is <hi>able</hi> to ſet her name to the noble ſentiments, that ſo lately, on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Letter, flowed from her lips?</p>
                     <p>What would Mrs. Beaumont have me do?</p>
                     <p>Let me lead you to your own cloſet. Pen, ink, and paper, are always before you there. Aſſume your whole noble Self, and we ſhall ſee what that aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will produce.</p>
                     <p>All that is in my power, to do, replied ſhe, for promoting the happineſs of a man who has ſuffered ſo much through my means, it is my duty to do.</p>
                     <p>She gave her hand to Mrs. Beaumont; who led her to her cloſet, and left her there. The following is the reſult. Generous, noble creature!—But does it not ſhew a raiſed imagination? eſpecially in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the lines?</p>

               <p>HOW, Sir, have the contents of your friend Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymo's Letter affected me!—I am more and more convinced, that, however diſtinguiſhed my lot <hi>may</hi> be, Clementina only can deſerve you. What a vain creature muſt I be, if I did <hi>not</hi> think ſo! And

               <p>YOU will think your ward very bold to addreſs you by Letter; eſpecially as ſhe is a very poor inditer, and as you are in town: But her heart is in trouble, and ſhe muſt write; and muſt beg the favour of you, the moſt indulgent guardian that ever poor Orphan had, to anſwer her by pen and ink. For whether you can forgive her or not, ſhe will be equally incapable of bearing your goodneſs, or your diſpleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How weakly I expreſs myſelf! I find I ſhall write worſe to you, than to any-body elſe. And why? Becauſe I wiſh to write, beſt. But I have great awe, and no genius. I am a poor girl in <hi>every</hi> ſenſe, as you ſhall hear by-and-by. I hope you won't be <hi>very</hi> angry with me. If you are, I ſhall be worſe than poor—I ſhall be miſerable.</p>
               <p>But to come before my guardian as a delinquent, when I have ambition enough to wiſh to ſhine in his eyes, if ſo it could have been!—It is a very great mortification indeed!—If you were to acquit me, I ſhall have had great puniſhment in that thought.</p>
               <p>But to open my troubled heart to you—Yet how ſhall I; I thought to tell it you yeſterday; but for my
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1185400106:245"/>
life I could not. Did you not obſerve me once, Sir, hanging upon the back of your chair, unable to ſtand in your ſight? O how I felt my face glow!—<hi>Then</hi> it <hi>was</hi> I thought to have ſpoken my mind; but you were ſo kind, ſo good to me, I could not, might I have had the world. You took my hand—I ſhall be very bold to repeat it; but am always ſo proud of your kind notice, that I can't help it: And you ſaid, drawing me gently to you, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Why keeps my Emily behind me? What can I do for my Emily! Tell me, child; Is there any-thing I can do for my ward?'</q> Yet, tho' the occaſion was ſo fair, I could not tell you. But I ſhall tire you, before I came to the point (to the fault, I ſhould ſay) that has emboldened me to write.</p>
               <p>This then is the truth of the matter:</p>
               <p>My poor mother, Sir, is very good now, you know. You have taken from her all her cares about this world: She and her huſband live together happily and elegantly: They want for nothing; and are grown quite religious: So that they have leiſure to think of their Souls good. They make me cry for joy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I go to them. They pray for you, and heap bleſſings upon you; and cry to think they ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, I took it into my head, knowing it was a vaſt way for them to go from Soho to ſomewhere in Moorfields to hear the preacher they admire ſo much, and coach-hire, and charities, and <hi>contributions,</hi> of one kind or other (for their miniſter has no eſtabliſhment) and old debts paying off, that at preſent, tho' I believe they are frugal enough, they can't be much afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand—So, thought I, ſhall I ride in my guardian's coach, at one time, in Lady G's at another, in Lady L's at another, tho' ſo much better able to walk than my poor mother; while ſhe is growing into years, and when infirmities are coming on; and my guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian's example before me, ſo opening to one's heart?—I ventured, therefore, unknown to my mother and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1185400106:246"/>
her huſband, unknown to any-body, by way of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to beſpeak a plain neat chariot, and agreed for a coachman, and a pair of horſes; for I had about 130 guineas by me when I beſpoke it. Out of this, thought I (which is my own money, without account) I ſhall be able to ſpare enough for the firſt half-year's expences; after which, they will be in circumſtances to keep it on: And as quarters come round, thought I, I will ſtint myſelf, and throw in ſomething towards it; and then my poor mother and her huſband can go to ſerve God, and take ſometimes an airing, or ſo, where they pleaſe; and make an appearance in the world, as the mother of the girl who is intitled to ſo large a fortune. And I don't grudge Mr. O-Hara; for he is vaſtly tender of my mother now: Which muſt be a great comfort to her, you know, Sir, now ſhe is come to be ſorry for paſt things, and apt to be very ſpiritleſs, when ſhe looks back—Poor dear wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!</p>
               <p>But here, Sir, was the thing: Believing it became me, as Lady L. Lady G. and Mrs. Eleanor Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, intended to ſhew their reſpect to you, on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain happy occaſion, by new cloaths, to ſhew mine the ſame way; I went to the mercer's, and was ſo tempted by two patterns, that, not knowing which to chooſe, I bought of both; not thinking, at the time, of the beſpoken chariot. To be ſure I ought to have conſulted Lady L. or Lady G.; but, fooliſh creature as I was, I muſt be for ſurpriſing them too, with my fine fancy.</p>
               <p>Then I laid out a good deal more than I intended, in milanery matters: Not but I had my pennyworths for my penny: But the milaners are ſo very obliging; they ſhew one this pretty thing, and that faſhionable one; and are ſo apt to praiſe one's taſte; and one is ſo willing to believe them, and to be thought mighty clever; that there is no reſiſting the vanity they raiſe. I own all my folly: I ever will, Sir, when I am guilty
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1185400106:247"/>
of any greater ſillineſs than ordinary; for I have no bad heart, I hope, tho' I am one of the flowers I once heard you compare ſome of us to, who are late before they blow into diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But now, good Sir, came on my diſtreſs: For the beſpoken chariot was ready; ready ſooner by a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, than I expected. I thought my quarter would be nearer ended; and I had made a vaſt hole in my money. I pulled up a courage; I had need of it; and borrowed fifty guineas of Lady G.; but, from this fooliſh love of ſurprizes, cared not to tell her for what. And having occaſion to pay two or three bills (I was a thoughtleſs creature, to be ſure) which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, tho' I had aſked for them before, were brought in juſt then, I borrowed another ſum, but <hi>yet</hi> told not Lady G. for what; and the dear Lady, I believe, thought me an extravagant girl; I ſaw ſhe did, by her looks.</p>
               <p>But, however, I cauſed the new chariot to be brought privately to me. I went in it, and it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to Soho; and there, on my knees, made my preſent to my mother.</p>
               <p>But do you think, Sir, that ſhe and Mr. O-Hara, when I confeſſed that I had not conſulted you upon it, and that neither Lady L. nor Lady G. nor yet Mrs. Eleanor Grandiſon, knew a ſyllable of the matter, would accept of it? They would not: But yet they both cried over me for joy, and bleſſed me.</p>
               <p>It is put up ſomewhere And there it lies, till I have obtained your pardon firſt, and your direction after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And what ſhall I do, if you are angry at your por ward, who has done ſo inconſiderate a thing, and run herſelf into debt?</p>
               <p>Chide me, honoured Sir, if you pleaſe. Indeed you never <hi>yet</hi> did chide me. But yours will be chide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Love; of <hi>paternal</hi> Love, Sir.</p>
               <p>But if you are angry with me more than a day; if you give me reaſon to believe you think meanly of me,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1185400106:248"/>
tho', alas! I may deſerve it; and that this raſhneſs is but a prelude to other raſh or conceited ſteps (for that is the fear which moſt terrifies me) and is therefore to be reſented with ſeverity; then will I fly to my dear Miſs Byron, that now is!—And if ſhe cannot ſoften your diſpleaſure, and reſtore me to your <hi>good opinion</hi>—(Mere pardon will not be enough for your truly-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ward) then will I ſay, Burſt, heart! Ingrateful, inconſiderate Emily! Thou haſt offended thy Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian! What is there left in this life, that is worth thy cares!</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, I have laid my troubled heart open before you. I know you will not ſo much blame the thing, even ſhould you not approve of it, as the manner; doing it (after you had been ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generous and inconſiderate to my mother) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting either you, or your ſiſters. O my vanity and conceit! They, they have miſled me. They never ſhall again, whether you forgive me, or not.</p>
               <p>But good, indulgent, honoured Sir, my Guardian, my Protector, let not my puniſhment be the reverſing of the gracious grant which my heart has been ſo long wiſhing to obtain, and which you had conſented to, of being allowed to live immediately in your own eye, and in the preſence of my dear Miſs Byron, that now is. This raſh action ſhould rather induce you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, than reverſe it. And I promiſe to be very good. I ever loved her. I ſhall add filial honour, as I may ſay, to my love of her. I never will do any-thing without conſulting her; and but what you, the kindeſt Guardian that ever poor Orphan had, would wiſh me to do.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, honour me with a few lines from your own hand; were it but to ſhew me that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence has not ſo far tired you, as (ſhould you think it juſt to baniſh me from your preſence for <hi>ſome time)</hi>

               <p>I Write to the dear child of my tendereſt cares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe requeſts me to write: Elſe, I had haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to her in perſon, to comfort her doubting heart; and to aſſure her, that nothing but a fault premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and perſiſted in, that might have affected her preſent or future reputation, and conſequently her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, could make me, for half an hour, offended with her. Your good intentions, my dear child, will ever be your ſecurity with me. Men, as well as women, are often miſled by their love of ſurprizes: But the greateſt ſurprize my Emily could give me, would be, if ſhe could do any <hi>one</hi> thing that would ſhew a faulty heart.</p>
               <p>Once more, my dear, pay your duty to your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the chariot which has been the cauſleſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo much concern to you; and tell her, and Mr. O-Hara, that they have greatly obliged me in declining the acceptance of the chariot, ſo dutifully preſented, till they knew my mind: But that, not ſo much in the compliment paid to me, as your <hi>guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> as becauſe it has given me an opinion of their own generoſity and diſcretion. Tell them, that I greatly approve of this inſtance of your duty to your mother, and of your regard, for her ſake, to Mr. O-Hara: Tell them, that I join with my ever-amiable ward in requeſting their acceptance of it; and do you,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1185400106:250"/>
my dear, tell Miſs Jervois, that I greatly honour her for this new inſtance of her goodneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>I incloſe a note, and will, to make you eaſy, carry it to its proper account, that will enable you to pay the debt which you with ſo dutiful an intention have contracted.—Forgive you, my dear! I love, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, you for it. I will not have you <hi>ſtint</hi> yourſelf, as you call it, in order to contribute to the future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the chariot. The preſent is but a handſome one, reſpecting your fortune. Be therefore, for your mother's life, the whole expence yours; and it may poſſibly contribute not a little to the eaſe of mind of both (as they now live together not unhappily) if you have the goodneſs to aſſure Mr. O-Hara, that you are ſo well ſatisfied with his kind treatment of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you will, on ſuppoſition of the continuance of it, before you enter into engagements which may limit your own power, or make your will dependent on that of another perſon, ſecure a handſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him, for his life, in caſe he ſurvive your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I thank you, my deareſt ward, for the affection you expreſs for my beloved Miſs Byron. She loves you ſo tenderly, that it would have been a concern to me, had ſhe <hi>not</hi> engaged your love and confidence. You highly oblige me by promiſing to conſult her on all material occaſions. The benefit <hi>you</hi> will receive from her prudent advice and example, and the delight <hi>ſhe</hi> will receive from your company, will be a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all three. My Emily may depend upon every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make it completely ſo, that ſhall be in the power of</p>

               <p>A Few lines, Sir; a very few—Not to ſhew my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, my pride, in being allowed to write to my Guardian; nor to preſume to draw him into an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Letters. No, Sir, I write only to thank you, which I do a thouſand thouſand times, for the eaſe, the joy, you have given to my heart. O how I dreaded to open your Letter! But I could not have expected it to be ſo <hi>very</hi> indulgent to a faulty girl. Not <hi>one</hi> rebuke! O Sir! how <hi>very</hi> good you are! And to ſend me the money to clear my debts! To bid me make my preſent! In ſo <hi>gracious</hi> a manner to bid me! And to put me upon promiſing a proviſion for life for Mr. O-Hara, if he ſurvive my mother; which will not oblige them to live a narrower life while they are together, in order to ſave, in view of ſuch an unhappy event—I flew to them, with the good news—I read the whole Letter to them. O how their hearts bleſſed you at their eyes, for they could not preſently ſpeak; and how my tears mingled with theirs! O Sir, you made us all infants!—I, for my part, am ſtill a baby!—Did I ever cry ſo much for grief, as you have made me cry for joy?—It is well ſomething now-and-then comes to check one's joy; there would be no bearing it, elſe. But I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on your precious time. Thank you, thank you, Sir, a hundred thouſand times. My mother is happy! Mr. O-Hara is happy! My Miſs Byron will ſoon be the happieſt of all human beings, thank God!—You, my Guardian, muſt be one of the happieſt of men! May every-body elſe be happy that you wiſh to be ſo! And then how happy will be, good Sir,</p>

                  <p>I Have laid before you, my dear Lady G. your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's and Signor Jeronymo's Letters; as alſo my anſwer to your brother's: My ſpirits never were ſo unequal. All joy at one time; apprehenſion at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that ſomething will ſtill happen.—Greville is reported to be ſo gloomy! ſo ſilent! He hates me, he ſays.—And here, unexpectedly, is poor Mr. Orme returned. Amended in his health a little, thoſe who have ſeen him ſay, and he thinks ſo—I am glad of it. And here are we ſitting in judgment, my aunt Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſident, on the patterns you have ſent: My uncle too will have his opinion be taken—And Mr. Deane, who threatened he would not come to Selby-houſe till the Settlements were to be ſigned, or read, I cannot tell what—will be here on Saturday.</p>
                  <p>MR. Orme has deſired leave to viſit me to-morrow. My uncle ſo hurries my ſpirit; not with his raillery, as he uſed to do—but with his joy. He talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the coming down of your brother, and the limited three days after; and numbers the days, nay, the hours, as they fly: For he ſuppoſes Sir Charles will be here on Monday, at furtheſt; and calls that a delay of particular grace and favour. For has he not ſaid, ſays he, that nothing after Friday can, on his part, detain him from us?</p>
                  <p>But, Lady G. will he not write, before he comes, to my laſt? Say my uncle what he pleaſes, your
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1185400106:253"/>
brother can't be down before Saturday ſe'nnight, at ſooneſt.</p>
                  <p>Your fancy and Lady L's determine us. My aunt has undertaken this province: She therefore will write to you what ſhe thinks fit. Is there not too much glare in the flowered ſilver, as you deſcribe it? Don't, my dear, let me be a bride in a maſquerade habit. Humility becomes perſons of ſome degree. We want not glare: We are <hi>known</hi> to be able to afford rich dreſſes; need them not, therefore to give us conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: Simplicity only can be elegance. Let me not be gaudy: Let not fancy, or art, or ſtudy, be ſeen in my dreſſes. Something muſt be done, I grant, on our <hi>appearance;</hi> for an an appearance we muſt not diſpenſe with here in the country, whatever you wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality may do in town. But let me not, I beſeech you, or as little as poſſible, be marked out for a <hi>luſtre;</hi> and be ſo good as to throw in a hint to this purpoſe to the dear buſy girls here, as from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they are exerciſing their fancies, as if I were to be a Queen of the May. Your authorities will ſupport me, if they give me cauſe to differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from them.</p>
                  <p>MISS Orme has juſt been with me. She confirms her brother's amendment. She is ſorry that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience has brought him over, when the climate was ſo favourable to him. She ſays, I ſhall find him ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely diſpoſed to congratulate me on my happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; of which ſhe has given him ample particulars. He could not, ſhe ſays, but expreſs himſelf pleaſed, that neither Fenwick nor Greville, but that one of ſo ſuperior a character, is to be the man.</p>
                  <p>What greater felicity can a young creature propoſe to herſelf, in the days of courtſhip, than to find every one in her family, and out of it, applauding her choice? Could I, a few weeks ago, have thought—But huſhed be vanity! Pride, withdraw! Meek-eyed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1185400106:254"/>
Humility, ſtand forth!—Am I indeed to be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of women? Will nothing happen—O no, no! Heaven will protect your brother—Yet this Greville is a trouble to me. Not becauſe of my horrid dream; I am not ſo ſuperſtitious as to let that diſturb me: But from a hint he gave Miſs Orme.</p>
                  <p>She met him this morning at a neighbouring Lady's. He thus accoſted her: I underſtand, madam, that your brother is returned. He is a happy man. Juſt in time, to ſee Miſs Byron, married. Fenwick, a dog! is gone to howl at Carliſle, on the occaſion. Your brother and I have nothing to do but howl in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative to each other, here.</p>
                  <p>My brother, Mr. Greville, ſaid Miſs Orme, I am ſure, will behave like a man on the occaſion: Nor can you have reaſon to howl, as you call it. Sir Charles Grandiſon is <hi>your</hi> particular friend, you know.</p>
                  <p>True, Miſs Orme, affecting to laugh off this hit, I thought I could have braved it out; but now the matter comes near, it ſticks here, juſt here pointing to his throat: I cannot get it through my gizzard. Plaguy hard of digeſtion! making faces, in his light way.</p>
                  <p>But will your brother, proceeded he, be contented to ſtay within the noiſe of the bells, which will, (in a few days perhaps) be ſet a ringing, for ten m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>les round? Sir Charles drives on at a d—nable rate, I hear. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'But he muſt let me die decently, I can tell him: We will not part for ever with the flower of our county, without conditions.'</q> Shall <hi>you</hi> ſee the Siren, madam? If you do, tell her, that I have no chance for peace, but in hating her heartily. But (whiſpering Miſs Orme) bid her NOT TO BE TOO SECURE.</p>
                  <p>I was ſtrangely ſtruck with theſe words; for my ſpirits were not high before. I repeated them; I dwelt upon them, and wept.—Fool that I was! But
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1185400106:255"/>
I ſoon recollected myſelf; and deſired Miſs Orme not to take notice of my tender folly.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE had a viſit from Mr. Orme. He has given <hi>me</hi> ſome pleaſure. I added not to <hi>his</hi> melancholy. He aſked me ſeveral intereſting queſtions, which I would not have anſwered any other man, as I told him. I ſhall always value Mr. Orme. Your brother is the moſt generous of men: But were he not ſo very generous, he ought to allow for my <hi>civility</hi> to this worthy man; ſince I can applaud <hi>him</hi> with my whole heart, for <hi>loving</hi> the noble Clementina. What a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-hearted creature muſt I be, if I did not? But as a woman's honour is of a more delicate nature, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than a man's with regard to <hi>perſonal</hi> love; ſo perhaps (if this be allowed me) a man may be as jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of a woman's <hi>civility</hi> (in general caſes, I mean) as a woman may be of a man's <hi>Love</hi> to another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This may ſound ſtrange, at firſt hearing, Lady G. but I know what I mean. Nobody elſe does, Harriet, perhaps you will ſay. But they would, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, if I were to explain myſelf; which at preſent, if you apprehend me not, I have no inclination to do.</p>
                  <p>How did this worthy man praiſe Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon! He muſt ſee that my pride, no, not pride, my gratitude, was raiſed by it, as well to the <hi>praiſer</hi> as <hi>praiſed.</hi> He concluded with a bleſſing on us both, which he uttered in a different manner from what that Balaam-Greville uttered his: It was followed with tears, good man! and he left me almoſt unable to ſpeak. How grateful in our ears are the praiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on thoſe whom we fondly love!</p>
                  <p>Lucy thinks I had beſt go to my grandmamma's before he comes down; and that he ſhould viſit me there from Selby-houſe. Neither my aunt nor I am of this opinion; but that he ſhould himſelf go to Shirley-manor, and viſit us from thence. For is not Selby-houſe my uſual place of reſidence? My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1185400106:256"/>
will be delighted with his company, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. But as he cannot think of coming down before the latter end of next week, at the ſooneſt, it is time enough to conſider of theſe things. Yet can a young creature, the awful ſolemnity ſo near, and with a man whom ſhe prefers to all others, find room in her head for any other topic?</p>
                  <p>I have a Letter from my good Mrs. Reeves. She and my couſin are ſo full of this happy ſubject, that they invite themſelves down to us; and hope we will excuſe them for their earneſtneſs on this occaſion. They are prodigiouſly earneſt. I wonder my couſin can think of leaving her little boy! My aunt ſays, there is no denying them. How ſo?—Surely one may excuſe one's ſelf to friends one ſo dearly loves! Your preſence, my Charlotte, I own, would be a high ſatisfaction to me: Yet you would be a little unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable, I doubt. There can be no hope of Lady L's: But if there were, neither ſhe, nor any-body elſe, could keep you orderly.—Poor dear Emily!—My aunt wiſhes, that we <hi>could</hi> have had her with us: But, for her own ſake, it muſt not be. How often do I revolve that reflexion of your brother's; that, in our happieſt proſpects, the ſighing heart will confeſs imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! But I will not add another word, after I have aſſured you, my deareſt Ladies, that I am, and ever will be,</p>

                  <p>O MY deareſt Lady G! what ſhall we do? All quarrels are at an end! all petulance! all folly!—I may never, never, be his at all!—I may, before the expected time of his arrival, be the moſt miſerable of women!—Your brother, beſt of men!—may be—Ah—my Charl—</p>
                  <p>TERRIFIED to death, my pen fell from my fingers—I fainted away—Nobody came near me. I know I was not along inſenſible—My terrors broke through even the fit I fell into—Nothing but death itſelf could make me long inſenſible, on ſuch an occaſion—O how I ſhall terrify you!—Deareſt Lady G.—But here, here comes my Lucy—Let her give the occaſion of my anguiſh.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE met this morning ſoul-leſs, and forlorn, all equally unable either to give or receive conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. The officious note was taken up, laid down, taken up again; the hand endeavoured to be gueſſed at: And at laſt it was concluded, to diſpatch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to Mr. Greville's, to learn news of the ſuppoſed traitor.</p>
                  <p>But, behold! before the ſervant could return, in a riding-dreſs, having alighted at the outward gate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the hall your noble brother. I was the firſt whom he ſaw; the firſt who ſaw him. I was juſt going out, intending (yet hardly knowing my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to walk in the Elm-row fronting the houſe, in order to ſhorten the way of the returning ſervant with news.</p>
                  <p>He caſt himſelf at my feet. Something he ſaid, and more he intended to ſay; excuſing his early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and thanking me for my favour of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday before; when my joyful ſurprize overpowered both my ſpeech and ſenſes.—And what will you ſay to me, when I tell you, that, on my recovery, I found myſelf in his arms, mine claſped about his neck?</p>
                  <p>He was ſurpriſed at my emotion! Well he might—Every one, in a moment, crouded about him—My
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1185400106:263"/>
aunt alſo folded her arms around him—Welcome, welcome, welcome, was all ſhe could, at the inſtant, ſay.</p>
                  <p>I, utterly abaſned, trembling, and doubting my feet, motioned to quit the hall for the parlour—But nobody minded me; all were buſied in congratulating the joy of every heart; till Sally preſenting herſelf, I leaned upon her, and, ſtaggering to the parlour, threw myſelf into an elbow-chair.</p>
                  <p>Your brother, attended by all my friends, followed me in. My heart again bid him welcome, tho' my eye could not, at that inſtant, bear his. He took my hand, as I ſat, between both his, and, in the moſt reſpectful manner preſſing it with his lips, beſought me to compoſe myſelf.</p>
                  <p>They had hinted to him in the hall, the cauſe of all our emotions—They had as much reaſon to bluſh, as I had.—Nancy, it ſeems, even Nancy, ſnatched his hand, and kiſſed it, in raptures. How dear is he to us all! He ſees it, now: There can be no reſerves to him, after this. Punctilio! <hi>Family Punctilio!</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned he in his Letter!—We have now no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to it—</p>
                  <p>His eyes ſhone with grateful ſenſibility. Look down upon me, lovelieſt of women, ſaid he, with a bent knee; Look down upon me, and tell me, you forgive me, for my early return. But tho' returned, I am entirely at your devotion.</p>
                  <p>Lucy ſays, ſhe never ſaw me more to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I looked down upon him, as he bid me, ſmiling through my tears. He ſtole gently my handkerchief from my half-hid face; with it he dried my unaverted cheek, and put it, ſhe ſays, in his boſom. I have loſt it.</p>
                  <p>My uncle and aunt withdrew with him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with all particulars. To them he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged, in words of eloquent Love, my uncle ſaid, the honour done him by me, and by us all, in the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1185400106:264"/>
demonſtrations we had given of our tender regard for him.</p>
                  <p>I was, by the time of their return to us, pretty well recovered. Sir Charles approached me, without take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of the emotion I had been in. Mr. and Mrs. Selby tell me, ſaid he, to me, that I am to be favoured with a reſidence at our venerable Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's. This, tho' a high honour, looks a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; ſo would the next door, if it were not under the ſame roof with my Miſs Byron: But, ſmiling tenderly upon me, I ſhall preſume to hope, that this very diſtance will turn to my account. Mrs. Shirley's Harriet cannot decline paying her accuſtomed duty to the beſt of grandmothers.</p>
                  <p>Bowing, I ſhall not, Sir, ſaid I, be the more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to pay my duty to my grandmamma, for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging her with your company.</p>
                  <p>Thus, reſumed he, ſnatching my hand, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently preſſing it with his lips, do I honour to myſelf for the honour done me. How poor is man! that he cannot expreſs his gratitude to the object of his vows, for obligations conferred, but by owning to her new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation!</p>
                  <p>Then turning round to my aunt—It is incumbent upon me, madam, ſaid he, to pay my early devoirs to Mrs. Shirley, the <hi>hoſpitable</hi> Mrs. Shirley, repeated he, ſmiling; which looked as if he expected to be here. <hi>There,</hi> beſides, (looking pleaſantly upon my aunt) I may be aſked—<hi>here</hi> I am not—to break my faſt.</p>
                  <p>This ſet us all into motion. My uncle ran out to look after Sir Charles's ſervants, who, it ſeems, in our hurry, were diſregarded: Their horſes in the court-yard; three of them walking about, waiting their maſter's orders. My uncle was ready, in the true taſte of old Engliſh hoſpitality, to <hi>pull</hi> them in.</p>
                  <p>Chocolate was inſtantly brought for their maſter; and a diſh for each of us. We had made but a poor
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1185400106:265"/>
breakfaſt, any of us. I could get nothing down before. My aunt put a ſecond diſh into my hand: I took her kind meaning, and preſented it to Sir Charles. How gratefully did he receive it! Wiil it <hi>always</hi> be ſo, Lady G.? My love, heightened by my duty, ſhall not, when the obligation is doubled, make me leſs deſerving of his politeneſs, if I can help it.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill this dreadful note, and Greville's reported moodineſs, made us uneaſy. The ſervant we ſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, with information that Mr. Greville came home late laſt night. He was not ſtirring, it ſeems, tho' Eleven o'Clock, when the ſervant reached his houſe. He is ſaid to be not well; and, as one ſervant of his told ours, ſo very fretful, and ill-tempered, that they none of them know how to ſpeak to him. God grant—But let me keep to myſelf ſuch of my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as are founded on conjecture—Why ſhould I not hope the beſt? Is not your beloved brother at preſent ſafe? And is he not the care of Providence?—I humbly truſt he is.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles took the note. I think I have ſeen the hand, ſaid he: If I have, I ſhall find out the writer. I dare ſay, it is written with a good intention.</p>
                  <p>My uncle and we all expreſſed, ſome in words, ſome by looks, our apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>There cannot poſſibly be room for any, ſaid Sir Charles, always preſent to himſelf. Mr. Greville loves Miſs Byron. It is no wonder, as his apprehenſions of loſing all hopes of her for ever, grow ſtronger, that he ſhould be uneaſy. He would make but an ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to her merit, and his own ſincerity, if he were not. But ſuch a ſtake as he has in his country, he cannot have deſperate intentions. I remember, to his advantage, his laſt behavour here. I will make him a viſit. I muſt engage Mr. Greville to rank me in the number of his friends.</p>
                  <p>What he ſaid gave us comfort. No wonder if we women love courage in a man: We <hi>ought,</hi> if it be true
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1185400106:266"/>
courage, like that of your excellent brother. After all, my dear, I think we muſt allow a natural ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the minds of men over women. Do we not want protection? And does not that want imply infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority?—Yet if there be two ſorts of courage, an <hi>acquired</hi> and a <hi>natural;</hi> why may not the former be obtained by women, as well as by men, were they to have the ſame education? NATURAL courage, may belong to either. Had Miſs Barnevelt, for example, had a boy's education, ſhe would have probably chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged her man, on provocation given; and he might have come off but poorly.</p>
                  <p>But we have more ſilly antipathies than men, which help to keep us down: Whether thoſe may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be owing to affectation, do you, Lady G. who, however, have as little affectation as ever woman had, determine. A frog, a toad, a ſpider, a beetle, an earwig, will give us mighty pretty tender terror; while the heroic men will trample the inſect under foot, and look the more brave for their barbarity, and for our <hi>delicate</hi> ſcreaming. But for an <hi>adventure,</hi> if a Lover get us into one, we frequently leave him a great way behind us. Don't you think ſo, Lady G.?—Were not this Greville ſtill in my head, methinks I could be as pert as ever.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles told us, that he ſhould have been with us laſt night, but for a viſit he was obliged to pay to Sir Harry Beauchamp; to make up for which hindrance, he took horſe, and ordered his equipage to follow him.</p>
                  <p>He is gone to pay his duty, as he is pleaſed to call it, to my grandmamma, in my uncle's coach, my uncle with him. If they cannot prevail on my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma to come hither to dinner, and if ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous Sir Charles ſhould dine with her, he will oblige her—<hi>by my aunt's leave,</hi> was his addreſs to her. But perhaps ſhe will have the goodneſs to add her company to his, as ſhe knows <hi>that</hi> will give us all double plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1185400106:267"/>
She loves to give pleaſure. Often does the dear Lady ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'How can palſied age, which is but a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying object to youth, expect the indulgence, the love, of the young and gay, if it does not ſtudy to promote thoſe pleaſures which itſelf was fond of in youth? Enjoy innocently your ſeaſon, girls, once ſaid ſhe, ſetting half a ſcore of us into country dances.

                  <p>MY uncle and Sir Charles came back to dinner; my grandmamma with them. She was ſo good as to give me her company, at the firſt word. Sir Charles, as we ſat at dinner, and afterwards, ſaw me weak in mind, baſhful, and not quite recovered; and he ſeemed to watch my uncle's eyes, and ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him and all of us, that my uncle had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to put forth, as uſual. How did this kind protection aſſure me! I thought myſelf quite well; and was ſo chearfully ſilent when Sir Charles talked, that my grandmamma and aunt, who had placed me between them, whiſpered me ſeverally—You look charmingly eaſy, love—You look like yourſelf, my dear. Yet ſtill this miſchievous Greville ran in my head.</p>
                  <p>My uncle took notice, that Sir Charles had ſaid, he gueſſed at the writer of the note. He wiſhed he would give him an <hi>item,</hi> as he called it, whom he thought of.</p>
                  <p>You obſerve, Sir, anſwered Sir Charles, that the writer ſays, Mr. Greville was in wine. He profeſſes to be an encourager of the people of the George in Northampton. He often appoints company to meet him there. I imagine the writer to be the head waiter of the houſe: The bills delivered me in, ſeem to have been writen in ſuch a hand as the note, as far as I can carry the hand writing in my eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1185400106:268"/>
Ads-heart, ſaid my uncle, that's undoubtedly right: Your name's up, Sir, I can tell you, among men, women, and children. This man, in his note, calls you (Look, elſe!) the moſt generous and noble of men. He ſays, we <hi>ſhall never know the writer!</hi>—Ads-dines! the man muſt deal in art magic, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals himſelf from you, if you have a mind to find him out.</p>
                  <p>Well, but, ſaid Lucy, if this be ſo, I am concerned for the reality of the information. Such threatenings as Mr. Greville throws out, are not to be ſlighted. Very true, ſaid my uncle. Mr. Deane and I (Mr. Deane will certainly be here by-and-by) will go, and diſcourſe with Greville himſelf to-morrow, pleaſe the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles begged that this matter might be left to his management. Mr. Greville and I, ſaid he, are upon ſuch a foot, as, whether he be ſo ſincerely my friend as I am his, or not, will warrant a viſit to him; and he cannot but take it as a civility, on my return into theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Should he be affronting, Sir Charles? Said my uncle—</p>
                  <p>I can have patience, if he ſhould. He cannot be groſly ſo.</p>
                  <p>I know not <hi>that,</hi> replied my uncle: Mr. Greville is a <hi>roiſter!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, dear Mr. Selby, leave this matter to me. <hi>Were</hi> there to be danger; the way to avoid it, is not to appear to be afraid of it. One man's fear gives another courage. I have no manner of doubt of being able to bring Mr. Greville with me to an amicable diſh of tea, or to dinner, which you pleaſe, to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>Ads-heart, Sir, I wiſh not to ſee at <hi>either,</hi> the wretch who could threaten the life of a man ſo dear to us all.</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles bowed to my uncle for his ſincere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment. I have nothing to do, ſaid he, but to invite myſelf either to breakfaſt, or dine with <hi>him.</hi> His
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1185400106:269"/>
former ſcheme of appearing to the world well with me, in order to ſave his ſpirit, will be reſumed; and all will be right.</p>
                  <p>My aunt expreſſed her fears, however, and looked at me, as I did at her, with a countenance, I ſuppoſe, far from being unapprehenſive: But Sir Charles ſaid, You muſt leave me, my dear friends, to my own methods; nor be anxious for my ſafty. I am not a raſh man: I can pity Mr. Greville; and the man I pity, cannot eaſily provoke me.</p>
                  <p>We were all the eaſier for what the charmingly-cool, becauſe truely brave, man ſaid on a ſubject which has given us all ſo much terror.</p>
                  <p>But was he not very good, my dear, not to ſay one word all this day of the important errand on which he came down? And to <hi>lead</hi> the ſubjects of converſation with deſign, as my aunt and grandmamma both thought, as well as I, that my uncle ſhould <hi>not?</hi> and to give me time to recover my ſpirits? Yet when he did addreſs himſelf to me, never were tenderneſs and reſpect ſo engagingly mingled. This my uncle obſerved, as well as my aunt and Lucy. How the duce, ſaid he, does this Sir Charles manage it? He has a way no man but him ever found out—He can court without ſpeech: He can take one's heart, and ſay never a word. Hay, Harriet! looking archly.</p>
                  <p>MR. Deane is come—In charming health and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits—Thank God! With what cordiality did Sir Charles and he embrace each other!</p>
                  <p>Sir Charles attended my grandmamma home: So we had not his company at ſupper. Now convenience without its contrary. He is her own ſon: She is his own parent. Such an unaffected love on both ſides!—Such a ſweetly-eaſy, yet reſpectful, familiarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them! What additional pleaſures muſt a young woman in my ſituation have, when ſhe can conſider herſelf as the bond of union between the family ſhe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1185400106:270"/>
is of, and that ſhe is entering into! How dreadful, on the contrary, muſt be <hi>her</hi> caſe, who is the occaſion of propagating diſſention, irreconcilable hatred, and abhorrence between her own relations and thoſe of the man to whom ſhe for life engages herſelf!</p>
                  <p>My grandmother and Sir Charles were no ſooner gone, than my uncle began to talk with Mr. Deane on the ſubject that is neareſt all our hearts. I was afraid the converſation would not be managed to my liking; and having too juſt an excuſe to aſk leave to withdraw, from bad, or rather no reſt, laſt night, I made uſe of it; and here in my cloſet (preparing now, however, for it) am I</p>

               <p>SIR Charles let my grandmother come hither by herſelf. He is gone to viſit that Greville. We are all in pain for him: But Mr. Deane comforts us.</p>
               <p>After breakfaſt, thus began my uncle upon me.</p>
               <p>Here, Dame Selby, are we ſtill <hi>at a fault.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet knows not what ſhe would be at; and you uphold her in her <hi>nonſenſes.</hi> Delicacy! Delicacy! The duce take me, if I have any notion of it!—What a <hi>pize</hi> are you about?</p>
               <p>Dear Sir! why am I blamed? ſaid I. What would you have me do, that I have <hi>not</hi> done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do!</hi> why I would have you give him his Day, and keep to it; <hi>that</hi> I would have you do: And not ſhilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhally for ever—and ſubject the beſt of men to inſults. All your men will be eaſy and quiet, when the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is over, and they know there is no remedy.</p>
               <p>My good Mr. Selby, ſaid my grandmamma, you
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1185400106:271"/>
now blame without reaſon. Sir Charles was full haſty. Harriet was a little more nice, perhaps, her Lover conſidered, than ſhe needed to be. Yet I don't know, but I, in her caſe, ſhould have done as ſhe did; and expected as much time as ſhe was willing to take. It was not a <hi>very</hi> long one, Mr. Selby, from the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he made; and he is a man himſelf of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy. Harriet very readily acknowleged to him the preference ſhe gave him to all them; and when ſhe found him very earneſt for a ſhort day, ſhe, by her laſt Letter, threw herſelf generouſly into his power. He is full of acknowlegements upon it; and ſo he ought to be. To me he has ſaid all that a man ſhould ſay of his gratitude, upon the occaſion; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me laſt night, that it was with difficulty he forbore taking advantage of her goodneſs to him: But that he checked himſelf, and led to other ſubjects, ſeeing how much the dear creature was diſordered, and being apprehenſive, that if he had begun upon one ſo intereſting, or even wiſhed to talk with her alone, he ſhould have increaſed her diſorder.</p>
               <p>Oy, Oy! Sir Charles is conſiderate; and Harriet ſhould be grateful: But indeed my Dame Selby is as ſilly, to the full, as Harriet. She is for having Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet keep <hi>her</hi> in countenance in the dance ſhe led me, ſo many years ago—Lady G. for my money. She finds you all out in your Maſonry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby, ſaid my aunt, I only refer myſelf to what our venerable parent juſt ſaid.</p>
               <p>And ſo don't think it worth while to hold an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with me, I ſuppoſe?</p>
               <p>I did not know, my dear, that you wanted to hold an argument.</p>
               <p>Your ſervant, madam—with that ſly leer—<hi>So</hi> like Harriet! and Harriet <hi>ſo</hi> like you!</p>
               <p>But, Mr. Selby, ſaid my grandmamma, will you be pleaſed to tell the dear child, if you think her wrong, what is the next ſtep ſhe ſhould take?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:1185400106:272"/>
Think her wrong!—Next ſtep!—Why the next ſtep is, as ſhe has promiſed to oblige him, and to be directed by him, to keep her word; and not <hi>hum</hi> nor <hi>haw</hi> about the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deane, who had been ſhewn and told every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that had paſſed ſince we ſaw him laſt, ſaid, You don't <hi>know</hi> that my daughter Byron will make unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parade, Mr. Selby. Sir Charles you find, in tenderneſs to her, aſked no queſtions yeſterday; made no claim—<hi>She</hi> could not begin the ſubject.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid Lucy, I cannot but ſay, that my couſin is in ſome fault.</p>
               <p>Look you there, now! ſaid my uncle.</p>
               <p>We all ſtared at Lucy; for ſhe ſpoke and looked very ſeriouſly.</p>
               <p>Might ſhe not have ſaid, proceeded ſhe, when Sir Charles ſurprized her at his firſt arrival (what tho' her heart was divided between paſt terror, and preſent joy?) Here I am, Sir, at your ſervice: Are you prepared for to-morrow?—And then made him one of her beſt courteſies.</p>
               <p>Sauce-box!—Well, well, I believe I have been a little haſty in my judgment (rapping under the table with his knuckles): But I am ſo afraid that ſomething will happen between the cup and the lip—Here, laſt night, I dreamt that Lady Clementina and he were going to be married—Give me your hand, my dear Harriet, and don't revoke the <hi>kindneſs</hi> in your laſt Letter to him, but whatever be the day he propoſes, comply; and you will win my heart for ever.</p>
               <p>As Sir Charles <hi>leads,</hi> Harriet muſt <hi>follow,</hi> reſumed my grandmamma. You men are ſad preſcribers in theſe delicate caſes, Mr. Selby. You will be put to it, my dear love, taking my hand, before this day is over, now you ſeem ſo purely recovered. Sir Charles Grandiſon is not a dreaming Lover. Prepare your mind, my child: You'll be put to it, I do aſſure you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:1185400106:273"/>
Why, oy; I can't but ſay, Sir Charles is a man—Don't you, my <hi>lovely Love,</hi> be too much a woman!—Too cloſe a copier of your aunt Selby here!—and, as I ſaid, you will have my heart for ever—Oy, and Sir Charles's too; for he is not one of your ſorry fellows that can't diſtinguiſh between a favour and a folly.</p>
               <p>My uncle then went out with a flouriſh, and took Mr. Deane with him; leaving only my grandmamma, my aunt, my Lucy, and your Harriet, together.</p>
               <p>We had a good deal of talk upon the important ſubject. The concluſion was, that I would refer Sir Charles to my grandmamma, if he were urgent for the day, and ſhe was veſted with a diſcretionary power to determine for her girl.</p>
               <p>Such of my cloaths, then, as were near finiſhed, were ordered to be produced, with ſome of the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ornaments. They were all to ſit in judgment upon them.</p>
               <p>Surely, Lady G. theſe are ſolemn circumſtances, lightly as my uncle thinks of them. Muſt not every thoughtful young creature, on ſo great a change, and for life, have conflicts in her mind, be her proſpects ever ſo happy, as the day approaches? Of what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials muſt the hearts of runaways, and of fugitives, to men half-ſtrangers to them, be compounded?</p>
               <p>My aunt has juſt left with me the following Billet, from Sir Charles, directed to my uncle, from Mr. Greville's:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>I Regret every moment that I paſs out of Selby-houſe, or Shirley-manor: And as I have ſo few particular friends in theſe parts out of your family, I think I ought to account to you for the hours I do: Nor will I, now our friendſhip is ſo unalterably fixed and acknowleged, apologize for giving myſelf, by this means, the conſequence with your family, that every one of yours, for their ſingle ſakes, are of to me,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1185400106:274"/>
ſuperadded to the tendereſt attachments to one dear perſon of it.</p>
                     <p>I found the gentleman in a leſs happy diſpoſition than I expected.</p>
                     <p>It is with inexpreſſible reluctance that he thinks, as my happy day draws near, of giving up all hopes of an object ſo dear to him. He ſeemed ſtrangely ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing on this ſubject, when I was introduced to him. He inſtantly propoſed to me, and with ſome fierceneſs, that I would ſuſpend all thoughts of marriage for <hi>two</hi> months to come, or at leaſt for <hi>one.</hi> I received his requeſt with proper indignation. He pretended to give reaſons reſpecting himſelf: I allowed not of them.</p>
                     <p>After ſome canvaſſings, he ſwore, that he would be complied with in <hi>ſomething.</hi> His alternative was, the dining with him, and with ſome of his choſen friends, whom he had invited.</p>
                     <p>I have reaſon to think theſe friends are thoſe to whom he expreſſed himſelf with violence at the George, as overheard, I ſuppoſe, by the waiter there.</p>
                     <p>He rode out, he owned, yeſterday morning, with intent to meet me; for he boaſts that he knows all my motions, and thoſe of a certain beloved young Lady. Let him; let every-body, who think it their concern to watch our ſteps, be made acquainted with them: The honeſt heart aims not at ſecrets. I ſhould glory in receiving Miſs Byron's hand, from yours, Sir, before ten thouſand witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Greville had rode out the night before; he did not ſay to meet me; but he knew I was expected at Selby-houſe, either on Monday night, or yeſterday morning: And on his return, not meeting me, he and his friends paſſed their night at the George, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and rode out together in the morning—In hopes of meeting me, he ſaid; and to engage me to ſuſpend my happy day. Poor man! Had he been in his <hi>right mind,</hi> he could not have hoped (had he met
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1185400106:275"/>
me on the road) to have been <hi>heard</hi> on ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>An act of oblivion, and thorough reconciliation, he calls it, is to paſs, in preſence of his expected friends.</p>
                     <p>You will not take notice of what I have hinted at, out of the family, whatever was deſigned.</p>
                     <p>In the temper he would have found me in, had he met me, nothing unhappy could have happened; for he is really to be pitied.</p>
                     <p>We are now perfect friends. He is full of good wiſhes. He talks of a viſit to Lady Frampton, of a month. I write thus particularly, that I may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch a ſubject as this to interfere with that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one which engroſſes my whole attention; and which I hope, in the evening, will be honoured with the attention of the beloved and admired of every heart, as well as of that of</p>

               <p>SIR Charles broke away, and came hither by our tea-time. I was in my cloſet writing. They all crouded about him. He avoided particulars: Only ſaid, that all was friendſhip between Mr. Greville and himſelf; and that Mr. Greville came with him part of the way; full of his reſumed ſcheme, of appearing to be upon a good underſtanding with him, and a friend to the alliance between him and us.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles looked about him, as if for ſomebody he ſaw not. My aunt came up to me: My dear, do you know who is come? She then told me the above particulars. We had a ſummons to tea. Down we haſtened. He met us both at the parlour-door. O madam, ſaid he, what precious hours have I loſt!—I have been patience itſelf!</p>
               <p>I congratulated him on what my aunt had told me. I found he intended, as he ſays in his Billet, that the particulars he gave in it ſhould anſwer our curioſity; and to have done with the ſubject. What a charming poſſeſſion of himſelf, that he could be in ſuch a brangle, as I may call it, and which might have had fatal conſequences; yet to be ſo wholly, and ſo ſoon, diveſted of the ſubject; and ſo infinitely agreeable upon half a ſcore others, as they offered from one or other as we ſat at tea!</p>
               <p>Tea was no ſooner over, but he ſingled me out—May I, madam, beg the favour of a half-hour's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>Sir, Sir! heſitated the ſimpleton, and was going to betray my expectation, by expreſſing ſome little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance; but, recollecting myſelf, I ſuffered him to lead me into the Cedar parlour. When there, ſeating
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1185400106:277"/>
me—Now, madam, let me again thank you, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times, for the honour of your laſt condeſcending Letter.</p>
               <p>He but juſt touched my hand, and appeared ſo <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragingly</hi> reſpectful!—I muſt have loved him then, if I had not before.</p>
               <p>You have, my deareſt Miſs Byron, a man before you, that never can be ungrateful. Believe me, my deareſt Life, tho' I have urged you as I have, you are abſolutely your own miſtreſs of the day, and of every day of my life, as far as it ſhall be in my power to make you ſo. You part with power, my lovely Miſs Byron, but to find it with an increaſe. Only let me beſeech you, now I have given it you back again, not to permit your heart to be ſwayed by <hi>mere</hi> motives of punctilio.</p>
               <p>A charming glow had overſpread his cheek; and he looked as when I beheld him in his ſiſter's dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, after he had reſcued me from the hands of the then cruel, now mortified, Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</p>
               <p>Punctilio, <hi>mere</hi> punctilio, Sir, ſhall <hi>not</hi> weigh with me. What I wrote to you, I intend to comply with. My heart, Sir, is—<hi>Yours!</hi>—I would have ſaid—Why would not my tongue ſpeak it?—My, my, I ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered—Why did I ſtammer?—Had I not owned it <hi>before</hi> to be ſo?—My grandmamma, Sir, and aunt—I could not at that inſtant, for my life, ſay another word.</p>
               <p>Sweet confuſion! I urge you no more on this topic, juſt now: I joyfully take your reference. Then drawing a chair next me, he kiſſed his own hand, and held it out, as it were, courting mine. I yielded it to him, as by an involuntary motion—yet my heart was forwarder than my hand. He tenderly graſped it—retaining it—and inſtead of urging the approaching day, talked to me as if it were paſt.</p>
               <p>I have a requeſt to make to your grandmother, your uncle and aunt, your Lucy, and our Mr. Deane; it
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1185400106:278"/>
is a very bold one: That when I have been bleſſed with your hand, they will be ſo good as to accompany their beloved Harriet, then no more Byron, but Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, to my family-ſeat, and ſee the beloved of every heart happily fixed, and in poſſeſſion of it. The houſe is venerable (I will not call it old); but large and convenient. Compaſſion for your neighbouring admirers, will induce you to ſupport me in this requeſt. You cannot bear, I imagine, without a leſſening of your own joy (if I prove the juſt, the grateful man to you, that, if I know myſelf, I ſhall be) either to ſee at church, or in your viſits, thoſe men who preferred you to all women; or, if they forbear the one or the other, to account with a gentle ſigh for their forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Other women might triumph ſecretly on ſuch occaſions; but I, even I, the ſucceſsful, the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed man, ſhall not forbear ſome inward pity for them. Now, madam, an excurſion of a month or two, if no more, made by thoſe dear friends, who otherwiſe will be loth, ſo ſoon as I wiſh, to part with you; will <hi>wean,</hi> as I may ſay, theſe unhappy men from you. Mr. Orme, Mr. Greville, will not then be obliged to quit their own houſes, and this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. I ſhall not, whenever I ſtep into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſee dejected men, whoſe dejection is owing, as they will think, to my happineſs: All your <hi>new</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will attend you, in turn, in the houſe that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loved, and wiſhed to ſettle in; your own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with you, and witneſſes of our mutual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—Support me, generouſly ſupport me, in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, when I ſhall be intitled, by your goodneſs, to make it.—Silent, my deareſt Love!—If I have been too early in thus opening my heart to you, do me the juſtice to ſuppoſe that it is owing to my wiſhes to paſs over another intereſting ſubject which muſt take place before my propoſal can; and which, however, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages my whole heart.</p>
               <p>I might well be ſilent: I could not find utterance

for the emotions of my heart. I withdrew my hand to take my handkerchief (You have often told me, Lady G. that I was born in an April morning); but putting it into my other hand, I gratefully (I hope not too fondly) laid it in his way to take it again. He did, with an air that had both veneration and gratitude in it—My deareſt Life, tenderly graſping it—how amiable this goodneſs!—You are not, I ſee, diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>Diſpleaſed!—O, Sir Charles!—But, alas! while I am too-too happy, the exalted Lady abroad!—She, ſhe, only! Your friend Jeronymo's laſt Letter—</p>
               <p>Thus brokenly did I expreſs (what my heart was full of) her worthineſs, my inferiority.</p>
               <p>Exalted creature!—Angelic goodneſs! You are Clementina and Harriet, both in one: One mind cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informs you both.</p>
               <p>Juſt then came in my aunt Selby. I have, madam, ſaid he to her, been making a requeſt to your beloved niece: I am exceedingly earneſt in it. She will be ſo good as to break it to you; and I hope—</p>
               <p>O Sir! interrupted my too eager aunt, ſuppoſing it had been for the Day, Mrs. Shirley has the power—</p>
               <p>My dear aunt Selby! ſaid I.</p>
               <p>What have I ſaid, Love?—</p>
               <p>He caught eagerly at it—Happy miſtake! ſaid he. My dear Mrs. Selby, I thank you!</p>
               <p>He bowed, kiſſed my hand, and left me to go to my grandmamma, to inform himſelf of what he had to hope for, as to the Day, from her.</p>
               <p>I told my aunt what the requeſt was, and what a converſation we had had: And what, madam, ſaid I, have you done!</p>
               <p>My aunt approved of his propoſal. It will be the pride of your uncle's heart and mine, to ſee you ſettled in Grandiſon-hall.</p>
               <p>What ſhort work did my grandmamma make of it! In leſs than a quarter of an hour Sir Charles returned, overjoyed, with an open Billet in his hand, from the venerable parent. This is it:</p>

               <p>Had you ſeen, my dear Charlotte, with what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſpect your brother approached me, and with what an inimitable grace he offered me the open Billet, how would you have been charmed with him! The excellent Mrs. Shirley, ſaid he, would not permit me to bring this ineſtimable paper folded. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the propitious lines all the way. On my knee let me thank you, my dear Miſs Byron, for your acquieſcence with her determination. He kiſſed my hand on one knee.</p>
               <p>He ſaw me diſturbed [Could I help it? There is ſomething awful in the fixing of the <hi>very</hi> Day, Lady G. but I tried to recover myſelf. I would fain avoid appearing guilty of affection in his eyes]. I will not add a word more, my Angel ſaid he, on the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubject.

               <p>There is no deſcribing to you, my dear Lady G. the looks, the manner, with which it was received, by the moſt ardent, and yet moſt reſpectful, of Lovers.</p>
               <p>I had ſcare approaced my grandmamma, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to utter ſomething of the <hi>much</hi> my heart was filled with, when my Uncle and Mr. Deane (by miſtake, I believe) were admitted.</p>

Well, let us know every-thing about it, ſaid my uncle—I hope Sir Charles is pleaſed. I hope—</p>
               <p>The Day was named to him.</p>
               <p>Well, well, thank God! And he ſpoke in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that expreſſed his joy.</p>
               <p>Your niece has pleaſed you now, I hope, Mr. Selby, ſaid my grandmamma.</p>
               <p>Pretty well! pretty well! God grant that we meet with no <hi>Put-offs!</hi> I hardly longed ſo much for my own Day with my Dame Selby there, as I have done, and do, to ſee my Harriet Lady Grandiſon—God, God, bleſs you, my deareſt love! and kiſſed my cheek—You have been very, <hi>very</hi> good, in the main—And, but for Dame Selby, would have been better, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>You don't do me juſtice, my dear, replied my aunt.</p>
               <p>Don't I?—Nor did I ever—taking kindly her hand—It was impoſſible, my dear Sir Charles Grandiſon, for ſuch a man as I to do juſtice to this excellent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>You</hi> never, Sir, will be ſo <hi>froppiſh</hi> as I have been: It was in my nature: I could not help it: But I was always ſorry for it <hi>afterwards.</hi>—But if Harriet make you no worſe a wife than my Dame Selby has made me, you will not be unhappy—And yet I was led a tedious dance after her, before I knew what ſhe would be at—I had like to have forgot that. But one thing I have to requeſt, proceeded my uncle—Mr. Deane and I have been talking of it—God bleſs your dear ſouls, all of you, oblige me—It is, That we may have a joyful Day of it; and that all our neighbours and tenants may rejoice with us. I muſt make the village ſmoke. No <hi>hugger-mugger</hi> doings—Let pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate weddings be for doubtful <hi>happineſs</hi>—</p>
               <p>O my uncle! ſaid I—</p>
               <p>And O my niece, too! I <hi>muſt</hi> have it ſo. Sir Charles, what ſay <hi>you?</hi> Are you for chamber-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages?—I <hi>ſay,</hi> that ſuch are neither <hi>decent,</hi> nor <hi>godly.</hi>

But you would not allow Lady G. to come off ſo—And in your <hi>own</hi> caſe—</p>
               <p>Am for doing as in Lady G's. I muſt hope to pay my vows at the Altar to this excellent Lady. What ſays my Miſs Byron?</p>
               <p>I, Sir, hope to return mine in the ſame ſacred place (my face, as I felt, in a glow); but yet I ſhall wiſh to have it as private as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Why, oy, to be ſure—When a woman is to do any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhe is aſhamed of—I think ſhe is right to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, for <hi>example</hi> -ſake. Shall <hi>you</hi> be aſhamed, Sir Charles?</p>
               <p>Sir Charles has given it under his hand, this very day, ſaid Lucy, interrupting him, as he was going to ſpeak, that he ſhall glory in receiving my couſin's hand before ten thouſand witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Make but my deareſt Miſs Byron eaſy on this head, ſaid Sir Charles (That taſk, Ladies, be yours); and, ſo the Church be the place, I ſhall be happy in the manner.</p>
               <p>The ceremony, ſaid my grandmamma, <hi>cannot</hi> be a private one with us: Every-body's eyes are upon us. It would be an affectation in us, that would rather raiſe, than allay, curioſity.</p>
               <p>And I have as good as promiſed the two pretty Nedhams, ſaid my uncle—and Miſs Watſon and her couſin are in expectation.</p>
               <p>O my uncle!</p>
               <p>Dear Harriet, forgive me! Theſe are your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from childhood! You can treat them but once in your life in this way. They would be glad at heart to return the favour.</p>
               <p>I withdrew: Lucy followed me—<hi>You,</hi> Lucy, I ſee, ſaid I, are for theſe public doings—But you would not, if it were your own caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your</hi> caſe is <hi>my</hi> caſe, Harriet. I ſhould hardly bear being made a ſhew of with any other man: But with ſuch a man as yours, if I did not <hi>hold up my head,</hi> I

ſhould give leer for ſtare, to ſee how envy ſat upon the womens faces. <hi>You</hi> may leer at the <hi>men</hi> for the ſame reaſon. It will be a wicked day after all, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet; for a general envy will poſſeſs the hearts of all beholders.</p>
               <p>Lucy, you know, my dear Lady G. is a whimſical girl.</p>
               <p>So, my dear, the ſolemn Day is fixed. If you could favour me with your ſupporting preſence—I know, if you come, you will be very good, now I have not, as I hope you will think, been guilty, of much, no not of any, parade—Lucy will write Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for me to Lady D. to my couſin Reeves's, and will undertake all matters of ceremony for her Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet. May I but have the happineſs to know that Lady Clementina—What <hi>can</hi> I wiſh for Lady Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina?—But ſhould ſhe be unhappy—that would be an abatement of my felicity indeed!</p>
               <p>There is no ſuch thing as thinking of the dear Emily. What a happineſs, could I have ſeen Lady L. here!—But that cannot be! May the Day that will in its <hi>anniverſary</hi> be the happieſt of <hi>my</hi> life, give to <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady L.</hi> their moſt earneſt wiſhes!</p>
               <p>Sir Charles diſpatches Frederick to-morrow to town with Letters: He will bring you mine. I would not go to reſt till I had finiſhed it.</p>
               <p>What have I more to ſay?—I ſeem to have a great deal. My head and my heart are full: Yet it is time to draw to a concluſion.</p>
               <p>Let me, my deareſt Lady G. know, if I am to have any hopes of your preſence? Will you be ſo good as to manage with Emily?</p>
               <p>My aunt bids me ſuppoſe to you, that ſince we are to have all the world of <hi>our</hi> acquaintance, you ſhould bring down your aunt Grandiſon with you.—We have at both houſes a great deal of room.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles juſt now aſked my grandmamma, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. Curtis would be ſatisfied with a handſome

preſent, if every one's dear Dr. Bartlett were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ceremony? My grandmamma anſwered, That Dr. Curtis was one of my admiring friends. He had for years, even from my girlhood, prided himſelf with the hopes of joining my hand in marriage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the office were performed in Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. She was afraid he would think himſelf ſlighted; and he was a worthy man.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles acquieſced. But, greatly as I reſpect Dr. Curtis, I ſhould have preferred the venerable Dr. Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett to any man in the world. A ſolemn, ſolemn ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, tho' a joyful one!</p>
               <p>Adieu, adieu, my dear Lady G. Be ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love me. I will, if poſſible, deſerve your Love.</p>

               <p>EXpect a Letter of hurry, in anſwer to one, two, three, four, five, ſix, I don't know how many, of yours; ſome filled with tenderneſs, ſome with love, ſome with nicety, ſenſe, and nonſenſe. I ſhall reckon with you ſoon for one of them, in which you take intolerable liberties with me. O Harriet! tremble at my reſentment. You are downright ſcurrilous, my dear.</p>
               <p>I imputed extravagance to Emily, in my laſt. The girl's a good girl. I was too haſty. I will ſhew you two Letters of hers, and one of my brother, which clears up the imputation. I love her more and more. Poor girl! Love peeps out in twenty places of hers: In his, he is the beſt of men: But that you knew before.</p>
               <p>And ſo the honeſt man kiſſed you; kiſſed your lip!
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1185400106:285"/>
O Lud! O Lud! how could you bear him afterwards in your ſight?—Forgiving creature!—And ſo you were friends with him before you had time to ſhew your anger.—Nothing like doing impudent things in a hurry.—Sometimes reſpectful, ſometimes free: Why this is the way of all the fellows, Harriet!—And ſo they go on till the reſpectfulneſs is drawn off, and nothing but the lees are left; and after two or three months are over, the once ſqueamiſh palate will be glad of <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I like your uncle better than I like either your aunt or you—He likes me.</p>
               <p>What a miſerable dog (Take the word for ſhortneſs, I am in haſte) is Sir Hargrave!</p>
               <p>Your plea againſt Clementina being <hi>compelled,</hi> or <hi>over</hi> -perſuaded (the ſame thing) I much like. You are a good girl.</p>
               <p>Betwixt her excellencies and yours, how muſt my brother's ſoul be divided!—I wonder he thinks of either of you. Aſs and two bundles of hay, Harriet. But my brother is a nobler animal: He won't ſtarve. But I think, in my conſcience, he ſhould have you both. There might be a law made, that the caſe ſhould not be brought into precedent till two ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be found, and ſuch a man; and all three in the like ſituation.</p>
               <p>Bagenhall! a miſerable devil! Excellent warning-pieces!</p>
               <p>Wicked Harriet! You infected me with your hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible inferences from Greville's temper, threatenings, and-ſo-forth. The concluſion of this Letter left me a wretch!—If theſe megrims are the effect of Love, thank Heaven, I never knew what it was.—<hi>Sufficient to the day,</hi> and-ſo-forth.</p>
               <p>Deviliſh girl! to torment me with your dreams! If you ever tell me of any more of them, except they are of a different ſort, woe be to you!</p>
               <p>I like your parting ſeene, and all that. Your

                  <hi>realities,</hi> thank Heaven, are more delightful than your <hi>reſveries.</hi> I hope you'll always find them ſo.</p>
               <p>And ſo you were full of apprehenſions on the favour your aunt did me in employing me about your <hi>nuptial equipments.</hi> Long ago <q rend="inline margQuotes">'you gave affectation to the winds.'</q> Good! But the winds would not accept of your preſent. They puffed it you back again, and your ſervants never told you it was brought home. I repeat, my dear, that my brother is much more clever, in theſe ſcenes of Love and Courtſhip, than his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. You are a pretty cow, my Love: You give good ſtore of milk, but you have a very careleſs heel. Yet when you <hi>bethink</hi> you, you are very good; but not always the ſame Harriet. Your nurſe in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, <hi>ſee-ſawed</hi> you—<hi>Margery-dawn</hi>—and you can't put the pretty play out of your practice, tho' it is out of your memory. I can look back, and ſometimes by your frowardneſs, ſometimes by your crowing, know how it was with you eighteen years ago.</p>
               <p>My brother's Letter to you, after he has mentioned his viſits to the two ſick Baronets, is that of a man who ſhews you genteelly, and politely, that he is ſenſible he has a pretty trifler to deal with. I wiſh you would ſquare your conduct, by what you muſt imagine a man of his ſenſe would think of you. I ſhould be too proud a minx, in your caſe, to owe obligation to my man for bearing with me—Spare me, ſpare me, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet! I have hit myſelf a terrible box o' the ear. But we can find faults in others, which we will not allow to be ſuch in ourſelves—But here is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your conduct now, and what mine was. I <hi>knew</hi> I was wrong, and reſolved one day to amend. You think yourſelf right, and, while you ſo think, will hardly ever mend, till your man ties you down to good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Jeronymo's Letter! O the next to divine Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina! Indeed, Harriet, I think ſhe out-ſoars you. I adore her. But will ſhe be prevailed upon to marry?—
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1185400106:287"/>
She will!—If ſhe does—Then—But, dear Soul!—Preſſed as ſhe is—Having refuſed, inſtead of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the beloved of her heart, ſhe will ſtill be greater than any of her Sex, if ſhe does; the man propoſed, ſo unexceptionable; ſo tenderly loving her, in the height of her calamity, as well as in her proſperity!—Gratitude to him, as well as Duty to her parents; parents ſo indulgent as they have always been to her; will incline her to marry. May ſhe be happy! I am pleaſed with your ſolicitude for her happineſs.</p>
               <p>I like your anſwer to my brother: A good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved reſignation. Let's ſee how you keep to it.</p>
               <p>You do keep to it—<hi>as I expected</hi>—Ah, Harriet! you are quite a girl, ſometimes; tho', at others, more than woman! <q rend="inline">'Will he not aſk leave to come down?'</q> Fine reſignation!—<q rend="inline">'Will he not write, firſt?'</q>—Yes, yes, <hi>he</hi> will do every-thing he ought to do. Look to your own behaviour, child; don't fear but <hi>his</hi> will be all as it ſhould be. As to your finery, how now, Harriet! Are <hi>you</hi> to direct every-thing; yet pretend to aſk advice? Be contented that every-thing is <hi>done for you</hi> of this ſort, and learn to be humble. Sure we that have paſſed the Rubicon, are not to be directed by you, who never came in ſight of the river. But you, maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, are poor, proud, pragmatical mortals. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ignorance; but in <hi>heart</hi> imagine you are at the tip-top of your wiſdom.</p>
               <p>But here you come with your horrid fears again. Would to the Lord the Day were over; and you and my brother <hi>were</hi>—Upon my life—you are a—But I won't call you names.</p>
               <p>Lucy thinks you ſhould go to Shirley-manor when my brother comes down. Egregious folly! I did not think Lucy could have been ſo ſilly.</p>
               <p>Concerning our couſin Reeves's wanting to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at your nuptials—your invitation to me—and what you ſay of Emily—more anon.</p>
               <p>Well, and ſo my brother has ſent you the expected
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1185400106:288"/>
Letter. Does it pleaſe you, Harriet? The duce is in you, if it don't.</p>
               <p>But you are <hi>not</hi> pleaſed with it, it ſeems. He is too haſty for you. Where's the boaſted-of reſignation, Harriet? True <hi>Female</hi> reſignation!</p>
               <p>Tell Lucy, I am obliged to her, for her tranſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I ſhall be very proud of her correſpondence.</p>
               <p>'Your <hi>aunt</hi> thinks he is full haſty.'—Your aunt's a ſimpleton, as well as you. My ſervice to her.</p>
               <p>But is the D—I in the girl again? What would have become of Lady L. and me, had you not ſent both Letters together that relate to Greville's ſuppoſed malignance? I tremble, nevertheleſs, at the thought of what might have been. But I will not forgive Lucy for adviſing you to ſend to us your horribly-painted terrors. What could poſſeſs <hi>her</hi> to adviſe you to do ſo, and <hi>you,</hi> to follow her advice? I forgive not either of you. In revenge I will remind you, that you are one of the <hi>good women</hi> to whom he owes all the embarraſments of his paſt life.</p>
               <p>But a caution, Harriet!—Never, never, let fooliſh dreams claim a moment of your attention—Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as ſeemed the danger, your ſuperſtition made more dreadful to you than otherwiſe it would have been. You have a mind ſuperior to ſuch foibles: Act up to its native dignity, and let not the follies of your nurſes, in your infantile ſtate, be carried into your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer age, to depreciate your womanly reaſon. Do you think I don't dream, as well as you?</p>
               <p>Well might ye all rejoice in his ſafety. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Hang about his neck, for joy!'</q> So you ought, if you thought it would do him honour. Huſh, huſh, proud girl! don't ſcold me! I think, were a king your man, he would have been honoured by the charming free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <q rend="inline">'Caſt himſelf at your feet!'</q> And you ought to have caſt yourſelf at his. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'There can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to him after this,'</q> you ſay.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1185400106:289"/>
by Letter, that you would reſign to his generoſity? Let me whiſper you, Harriet—Sure you proud maiden minxes <hi>think</hi>—But <hi>I</hi> did once—I wonder in my heart, oftentimes—But men and women are chears to one another. But we may, in a great meaſure, thank the poetical tribe for the faſcination. I hate them all. Are they not inflamers of the worſt paſſions? With regard to the <hi>Epics,</hi> would Alexander, madman as he was, have been ſo <hi>much</hi> a madman, had it not been for Homer? Of what violences, murders, depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have not the Epic poets been the occaſion, by propagating falſe honour, falſe glory, and falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Thoſe of the <hi>amorous claſs</hi> ought in all ages (could their future genius's for tinkling ſound and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have been known) to have been ſtrangled in their cradles. Abuſers of talents given them for better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes (for all this time, I put Sacred poeſy out of the queſtion); and <hi>avowedly</hi> claiming a right to be <hi>licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and to overleap the bounds of decency, truth, and nature.</p>
               <p>What a rant! How came theſe fellows into my rambling head? O, I remember—My whiſper to you led me into all this ſtuff.</p>
               <p>Well, and you at laſt recollected the trouble you have given my brother about you. Good girl! Had I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that, I would have ſpared you my reflexions upon the poets and poetaſters of all ages, the <hi>truly</hi> -inſpired ones excepted: And yet I think the others ſhould have been baniſhed <hi>our</hi> commonwealth, as well as Plato's.</p>
               <p>Well, but, to ſhorten <hi>my</hi> nonſenſe, now <hi>you</hi> have ſhortened yours—The Day is at laſt fixed—Joy, joy, joy, to you, my lovely Harriet, and to my Brother! And it muſt be a public affair!—Why—that's right, ſince it would be impoſſible to make it a private one. My honeſt man is mad for joy. He fell down on his knees, to beg of me to accept of <hi>your</hi> invitation, and of <hi>his</hi> company. I made a merit of obliging him,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1185400106:290"/>
tho' I would have been as humble to <hi>him,</hi> rather than not be with you; and yet, by one ſaucy line, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you had rather be without me.</p>
               <p>Your couſin Reeves's are ready to ſet out.</p>
               <p>God bleſs you, invite aunt Nell: She thinks herſelf neglected. A nephew whom ſhe ſo dearly loves! Very hard! ſhe ſays.—And ſhe never was but at one wedding, and has forgot how it was; and may never be at another—Pink and yellow, all is ready provided, go down or not—O but, if you chooſe not her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I will tell you how to come off—Give her your word and honour that ſhe ſhall be a perſon of prime account at your firſt Chriſtening. Yet ſhe would be glad to be preſent on both occaſions.</p>
               <p>But ah, the poor Emily!—She has alſo been on her knees to me, to take her down with me—What ſhall I do?—Dear Soul! ſhe embarraſſes me! I have put her upon writing to her Guardian, for his leave: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe has written. If ſhe knew her own caſe, I think ſhe would not deſire it.</p>
               <p>Poor Lady L!—She is robbed, ſhe ſays, of one of the greateſt pleaſures of her life. Ah, Charlotte! ſaid ſhe to me, wringing my hand, theſe huſbands owe us a great deal. This is an humbling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Were not my Lord and yours the beſt of huſbands—</p>
               <p>The beſt of huſbands! Wretches! ſaid I. You may forgive yours, Caroline—You are a good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but not I mine. And ſomething elſe I ſaid, that made her laugh in the midſt of her <hi>lacrymals.</hi> But ſhe begs and prays of me, not to go down to you, unleſs all ſhould be over with her. I can do her no good; and only increaſe my own apprehenſions, if I am with her. A bleſſed way two poor ſouls of ſiſters of us are in. Sorry fellows!</p>
               <p>And yet, Harriet, with ſuch proſpects as theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſome girls leap windows, ſwim rivers, climb walls—Duce take their folly: Their choice is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1185400106:291"/>
their puniſhment. Who can pity ſuch raſh ſouls as thoſe? Thanks be praiſed, you, Harriet, are going on to keep in countenance the two anxious ſiſters,

               <p>Good news! joyful news!—I ſhall, I ſhall, go down to you. Nothing to hinder me! Lord L. proud as a peacock, is this moment come for me: I am hurrying away with him. A fine boy!—Siſter ſafe!—Harriet, Lucy, Nancy, for your own future encouragement! Huzzah, girls!—I am gone.</p>

                  <p>MY aunt is ſo much afraid that every-thing will not be ready, that ſhe puts me upon writting to you, to haſten what remains—I am more than half a fool—But that I always was. My ſpirits ſink at the thoughts of ſo public a Day. The mind, my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma ſays, can but be full; and it would have been filled by the circumſtance, had not the publicneſs of the Day given me ſomething more of grievance.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid, ſometimes, that I ſhall not ſupport my ſpirits; that I ſhall be ill—Then I think ſomething will happen—Can it be, that I ſhall be the wife of Sir Charles Grandiſon? I can hardly believe it.—Sir Charles is tenderly concered for me. It would be impoſſible, he ſays, that the Day could be private, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I were to go to London; and the very propoſing of that would put my uncle out of all patience, who prides himſelf in the thought of having his Harriet married from his own houſe: Nor could I expect my
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1185400106:292"/>
grandmamma's preſence. He does all he can to aſſure my heart, and divert me: A thouſand agreeable lively things he ſays: So tender, ſo conſiderate, in his joy!—ſurely I ſhall be too happy. But will you come? Can you? And if you do, will you be good? Will you make my caſe your own?</p>
                  <p>My uncle, at times, is prodigiouſly headſtrong. Every hour he does or ſays ſomething wrong; yet we dare not chide him. Thurſday next will be one of the greateſt days of his life, he ſays; and it ſhall be all his own. He either ſings, hums, or whiſtles, in every motion. He reſolves, he ſays, to get his beſt dancing legs in readineſs. He ſtarted up from table after dinner this day, and caught hold of Lucy's hand, and whiſked her round the room. <hi>Dear toad,</hi> he called her; a comman addreſs of his to Lucy (I ſay, becauſe ſhe has a jewel in her head); and flouriſhing about with her in a very humorous manner, put her quite out, on purpoſe to laugh at her; for ſhe would have been in, if he would have let her, for the humour-ſake. He was a fine dancer in his youth.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Orme breakfaſted with us this morning. She, no doubt, threw herſelf in our way on purpoſe to hear the news of the appointed Day confirmed. My uncle officiouſly told her, it would be one day next week. She named the very day, and turned pale, on his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was not miſtaken. She hoped, ſhe ſaid, her brother would bear the ſhock, as he had been long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of hope. But, ſaid ſhe, he promiſed me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went abroad, to carry me to London on a viſit to ſome relations there. I will remind him; and hope to prevail on him to ſet out next Monday or Tueſday.</p>
                  <p>God bleſs you! my dear Miſs Byron, ſaid ſhe, at parting; may your buſtle be happily over! I ſhall pity you. You will pay for being ſo univerſally admired. But your penance will be but for two days; the <hi>very</hi> Day, and that of your <hi>appearance;</hi> and in both your man will bear you out: His merit, his perſon, his

               <p>I Write a few lines, if, writing to you, I can write a few, by the ſpecial meſſenger that carries down all the remaining apparatus, which was committed to my care. We women are ſad creatures for delaying things to the laſt moment. We hurry the men: We hurry our workwomen, milaners, mantuamakers, friends, allies, confederates, and ourſelves. When once we have given the Day, night <hi>and</hi> day, we neither take reſt, nor give it: When, if we had the <hi>rare</hi> felicity of knowing our minds ſooner, all might go on fair and ſoftly. But then the gentle paſſion, I doubt, would glide into inſipidity. Well, and I have heard my brother ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That things in general are beſt as they are.'</q> Why I believe ſo; for all theſe honeſt ſouls, as mantuamakers, attire-women, work-women,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1185400106:295"/>
                  <hi>enjoy</hi> a hurry that is occaſioned by a wedding, and are half as well pleaſed with it, as if it were their own. They ſimper, ſmirk, goſſip, over Bridal finery; ſpread this upon their arms or ſhoulders; admire that—Look you here—Look you there! And is not this?—Is not that?—And, Did you ever!—No, never, in my born days!—And is the Bride, do you ſay, ſuch a lovely creature?—And is the Bridegroom as handſome a man, as ſhe a woman!—O lud! O dear!—Would to Heaven Northamptonſhire were nearer, that one might ſee how charming, how graceful, how becoming! and ſo-forth.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould not we women, after all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to make hurry-ſkurries [You ſee how I correct myſelf as I go along] and make the world think our affairs a great part of the buſineſs of it, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done without us? Since, after a few months are over, new novelties take place, and we get into corners, ſigh, groan, look ſilly and meagre, and at laſt are thrown into <hi>ſtraw,</hi> as it is called; poor Caroline's caſe; who repines, that ſhe can't be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on this new buſtle in the family. But I am to write her word of every-thing—Look to your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Harriet, on the great occaſion.</p>
               <p>But a word about Caroline—Were it not for her being deprived of this pleaſure, the good creature would be very happy. Lord L. and ſhe are as fond as apes. She has quite forgot all her ſufferings for him. He thanks her for his boy. She follows with her eye the little ſtranger, and is delighted with all that is done <hi>with</hi> him, <hi>to</hi> him, <hi>for</hi> him: Is pleaſed with every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, even with the very ſervants, who croud in, by permiſſion to ſee his little Lordſhip, and already claim an intereſt in him. Upon my word, ſhe makes a very pretty fond mother. And aunt Nell, who, by the way, was at the Crying-out, and was then <hi>ſo</hi> frighted! <hi>ſo</hi> thankful to God! and <hi>ſo</hi> happy in her own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! [No, not for the world, would ſhe be other than ſhe was!] now grudges the nurſes half their cares.</p>

What good creatures are we women!</p>
               <p>Well, but I don't know what to do about Emily. The firſt vice of the firſt woman was curioſity, and it runs through all her daughters. She has written to her Guardian, and nothing but an abſolute prohibition will hinder her from making one in your train. Did the dear girl know the ſtate of her own heart, ſhe would chooſe to be a thouſand miles off, rather than go. I have ſet her woman and mine to diſcourage her. I have reaſoned with her myſelf; but there is no ſuch thing as giving her one's <hi>true</hi> reaſons; nor would I, willingly: Becauſe ſhe herſelf, having not found out her Love to be Love, I hope the fire may be ſmothered in her own heart, by the aid of time and diſcretion, before diſcovery; whereas, if the doors of it were to be opened, and the air let in, it might ſet the whole tenement in a blaze. Her Guardian's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or aſſent will come, perhaps, in time; yet <hi>hardly,</hi> neither; for we ſhall ſet out on Monday. Aunt Nell is ſo pleaſed with her nurſery of the <hi>little Peer,</hi> as ſhe primly calls him, that you are rid of even her <hi>wiſhes</hi> to be with you. Being ſure of this, I complimented her, that I knew your aunt Selby would have invited her, but that Lady L. would not be able to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her company, all the world, and the world's wiſe, attentive and engroſſed by your affair. She, good creature! was pleaſed—So as ſhe could but be thought of importance by ſomebody, I knew ſhe would be happy. I told her, that you invited nobody, but left all to your friends—Ay, poor dear Soul, ſaid ſhe; ſhe has enough to think of, well as ſhe loves your brother—and ſighed for <hi>you</hi>—Worthy Ancient! The ſigh a little deeper, perhaps, for ſome of her own Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Reeves would not ſtay for us. What will you do with us all?—Croud you, I ſear. But diſpoſe of <hi>us,</hi> at Shirley-manor, or Selby-houſe, as you pleaſe. Yours, and aunt Selby's, and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1185400106:297"/>
Shirley's concern for us, is all we are ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about. But ſervants rooms, nay, cocklofts, hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofts, will do. We like to be put to our ſhifts now-and-then—Something to talk of—</p>
               <p>But I can tell you, if you don't know it already, Lord W. and his Lady are reſolved to do you honour on this occaſion; but they will be but little trouble to you. My Lord's ſteward has a half-brother, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-farmer, in your neighbourhood—Sheldon—They will be there: But perhaps you know of this a better way. They will make a ſplendid part of your train. Gratitude is their inducement.</p>
               <p>Lord L. has juſt now told me, that my ſiſter, in tenderneſs to him, and in honour to you, has beſought <hi>him</hi> to be preſent. O Harriet! what will you do with yourſelf?—Aunt Nell and I have the heart-burn for you. But Lord L. <hi>muſt</hi> be welcome: He is one of thoſe who ſo faithfully kept your ſecret.</p>
               <p>So, in <hi>our</hi> equipages, will be Lord L. my honeſt man, Emily, and your Charlotte: Lord L's equipages will be at the ſervice of any of your gueſts; as will our ſpare one—I wiſh Beauchamp could permit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be preſent (I hope he will) on the nuptials of the friend ſo dear to him, with a Lady he ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admires.</p>
               <p>My woman and Emily's will be all our Female at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: One nook will ſerve them both.</p>
               <p>My poor man will be mad, before the day comes. He <hi>does</hi> love you, Harriet. My brother, he ſays, will be the happieſt man in the world—<hi>himſelf excepted</hi>—A hypocrite! He juſt popt this in, to ſave himſelf—Why doſt make this exception, friend? ſaid I—Thou knoweſt it to be a mere compliment—Indeed, indeed <hi>(two</hi> indeeds, which implied, that <hi>one</hi> might have been doubted) I am <hi>now</hi> (A ſarcaſm in his word <hi>now)</hi> as happy as mortal man can be—Ah, flatterer! and ſhook my head—A recognition of my ſovereignty, however, in his being afraid to ſpeak his conſcience. A little of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1185400106:298"/>
the old leaven, Harriet! I can't help it. It is got out of my heart, half out of my head; but, when I take the pen, it will tingle now-and-then, at my finger's end.</p>
               <p>Adieu, my Love! God bleſs you;—I can enter into your joy. A Love ſo pure, and ſo fervent. The man Sir Charles Grandiſon.—And into your <hi>pain,</hi> alſo, in view of a ſolemnity ſo near, and to you ſo awful. With all my roguery, I ſympathize with you. I have not either a wicked or unfeeling heart. Such as yours, however, are the true ſpirits; ſuch as mine are only bully and flaſh.</p>
               <p>Lucy, you are a good girl. I like the whim of your concluding for Harriet; I alſo like your tenants dining-room, and other managements, as the affair muſt unavoidably be a public one.</p>
               <p>Neither of you ſay a word of good Mr. Deane: I hope he is with you. He cannot be a cypher where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be comes, except on the right-ſide of the figure, to increaſe its conſequence. Don't be afraid of your uncle; I, I, I, will manage him, never fear.</p>
               <p>There are other paſſages, Harriet, in your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I ought to have anſwered to—But forgive me, my dear; I had laid it by (tho' pleaſed with it in the main); and, having anſwered the moſt material part, by diſpatching your things, forgot it as much as if I had not received it, till the moment I came to conclude. Once more, Adieu, my deareſt Harriet.</p>

                  <p>IT would give me great pain to deny to my good Miſs Jervois the grant of any requeſt ſhe ſhall think fit to make to me. You ſhall know, you ſay, by the grant of this favour, that I have quite forgiven my ward. Was ſuch a teſt wanted, my dear?

               <p>WELL, my Siſter, my Friend, my dear Lady L. how do you? <hi>As well as can be expected,</hi> I hope: The anſwer of a thouſand years old, to every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, careful or ceremonious. And how does my dear little boy? As well <hi>as can be expected,</hi> too—I am glad of it.</p>
               <p>Here we are!—Every-body well, and happy.</p>
               <p>I was afraid my brother would have looked more <hi>polite</hi> upon us than <hi>familiar,</hi> as he invited us not: But, no!—He was all himſelf, as Harriet ſays. He
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1185400106:301"/>
met us at our coach-door. He handed out his ward. She could not ſpeak. Tears were in her eyes. I could have beat her with my fan. He kiſſed her cheek. My dear child, I thank you moſt ſincerely for your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your mother.</p>
               <p>I was afraid that her joy would then have been too much for her. She expanded, ſhe collected, her plumes. Her ſpread arms (ſoon, however, cloſed) ſhewed me, that ſhe with difficulty reſtrained herſelf from falling at his feet. He turned from her to me. My beſt Charlotte, how do you? The journey, I hope, has not incommoded you. He led me out, and, taking each of the honeſt men by the hand, My dean Lords, you do me honour. He then congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Lord L. on the preſent you had made him, and the family, he ſaid.</p>
               <p>At the inner-gate met us our ſweet Harriet, with joy upon one brow, half the cares of this mortal life on the other—She led us into the Cedar-parlour, my brother returning to welcome in the two honeſt men, and threw her arms about my neck—My deareſt Lady G. how much does your preſence rejoice me!—I hope (and looked at me) your journey—Be quiet, Harriet!—You muſt not think ſo much of theſe matters, my Love. She was a little abaſhed—Don't be afraid of me; I will be very good, ſaid I. Then will I be very thankful, replied ſhe.</p>
               <p>My lovely Emily! turning to her: How does my ſweet friend! Welcome, once more, to Selby-houſe.</p>
               <p>The girl's heart was full—She, thanking her only by a deep courteſy, abruptly withdrew to the window; and, trying for a third hem, in hopes to ſtifle her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it broke into a half-ſob, and tears followed.</p>
               <p>Harriet and I looked; <hi>ſhe</hi> compaſſionately, <hi>I</hi> vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, I believe; and both ſhook our heads at each other.</p>
               <p>Take no notice, ſaid I, ſeeing Harriet move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the window to her—It will go off of itſelf. Her joy to ſee Harriet, that's all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:1185400106:302"/>
But I <hi>muſt</hi> take notice (for ſhe found that Emily heard her) My dear Emily, my lovely young friend—why, why—</p>
               <p>I will tell you, madam, interrupted ſhe, and threw her arms about Harriet's neck, as Harriet (ſitting in the window) claſped her's about her waiſt; and I will tell you truth, and nothing but the truth—You wrote ſo cool to me, about my coming—And yet I to come! But I could not help it—And I thought you now looked a little ſeverely upon me—But Love, and I, will ſay, Duty to you, my deareſt Miſs Byron, AND NOTHING ELSE, made me ſo earneſt to come. Say you forgive me.</p>
               <p>Forgive you, my deareſt Emily!—I had only your ſake, my dear, in view. If I wrote with leſs warmth than you expected, forgive <hi>me.</hi> Conſider my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Love. You are, and ever will be, welcome to me. Your griefs, your joys, are mine—Give me which you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The girl! burſt into freſh tears—I, I, I am now as unable, ſobbed ſhe, to bear your goodneſs, as before I was your diſpleaſure—But hide, hide me! Here comes my Guardian!—What now, when he ſees me thus, will become of me?</p>
               <p>She heard his voice at the door, leading in the two Lords; and they followed by Mr. Selby, Mrs. Selby, Lucy, and Nancy.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles went to the two young Ladies. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet kept her ſeat, her arms folded about Emily; Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's glowing face in her boſom.</p>
               <p>Sweet emotion! ſaid he, my Emily in tears of joy!</p>
               <p>—What a charming picture!—O my Miſs Byron, how does your tenderneſs to this amiable child oblige me! I ſever you not; claſping his generous arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them both.</p>
               <p>I have afflicted my dear Emily, Sir, without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I wrote coldly, my precious young friend thinks; and her Love for me makes her ſweetly-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1185400106:303"/>
of my ſuppoſed ingratitude. But believe me, my dear, I love you with a true ſiſterly tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>I took the dear girl aſide, and gently expoſtulated with her, upon the childiſhneſs of her behaviour, and the uneaſineſs ſhe would give to Miſs Byron, as well as to herſelf, by repetitions of the like weakneſs of mind.</p>
               <p>She promiſed fair; but, Lady L. I wiſh there were more of the child, and leſs of the woman, in this affair. Poor thing! ſhe was very thankful for my advice; and expreſſed how wrong ſhe was, <hi>becauſe</hi> it might diſcourage her Guardian and Miſs Byron, that <hi>now was,</hi> from letting her live with them: But for my life, ſaid ſhe, whatever was the matter with me, I could not help my fooliſhneſs.</p>
               <p>Miſs Nancy Selby took Emily up with her; and uncle Selby and I had a little lively hit at each other, in the old ſtile. We drew my brother in. I had not tried his ſtrength a good while: But, as Harriet ſaid in one of the ſaucieſt Letters ſhe ever wrote, I ſoon found he was the wrong perſon to meddle with. Yet he is ſuch a charming raillier, that I wonder he can reſiſt his talent. <hi>No</hi> wonder, Harriet would ſay; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has talents ſo ſuperior to that which, ſhe ſays, runs away with his poor ſiſter.</p>
               <p>Emily came down to us very compoſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved prettily enough: But had my brother as much manniſh vanity as ſome of the ſorry fellows have, who have no pretence for it, he would diſcern the poor Emily's foible to have ſome little ſuſceptibility in it. I am glad he does not; for it would grieve him. I have already told him of the ſufferings of poor Lady Anne S. on her hearing he is near marriage; and he expreſſed great concern upon it for that really-worthy woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves, his wife, and Mr. Deane, were abroad when we arrived. They came in to tea. Our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual congratulations on the expected happy event, cheared our own hearts, and would have delighted
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1185400106:304"/>
yours. Charming, charming, is the behaviour of my brother to his Bride-elect. You can have no notion of it; becauſe at Colnebrook we always ſaw him acting under a reſtraint; owing, as ſince we have found, to Honour, Conſcience, and a prior Love.</p>
               <p>He diverts and turns the courſe of ſubjects that he thinks would be affecting to her; yet in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is hardly perceivable to be his intention to do ſo: For he makes ſomething of the begun ones contribute to the new ones; ſo that, before uncle Selby is aware of it, he finds himſelf in one that he had not in his head when he ſat out.—And then he comes with his <q rend="inline margQuotes">'What a pize was I going to ſay? But this is not what I had in my head.'</q> And then, as my brother knows he miſſes his ſcent, only becauſe it has not afforded the merry mortal ſomething to laugh at; he furniſhes him with ſome lively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent occaſion which produces that effect, and then Mr. Selby is ſatisfied. Mrs. Selby and Lucy ſee how my brother manages him; yet find it ſo delicately done, that ſomething ariſes from it that keeps the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man in credit with himſelf and every-body elſe, for facetiouſneſs, good-humour, good heart, and thoſe qualities which really are his due, and make him in his worſt ſubjects tolerable, and in his beſt valuable.</p>
               <p>Venerable Mrs. Shirley is to be here all to-morrow and next day. Mr. Deane has choſen Shirley-manor for his abode, for the time he ſtays; ſo has James Selby, in order to make more room at Selby-houſe for us women. There too Mr. and Mrs. Reeves take up, of choice, their lodgings, tho' here all day.</p>
               <p>Poor Harriet! She told <hi>me</hi> once, that fear makes cowards loving. She is ſo fond of me and Lucy, and her aunt, at times, it would be a ſin not to pity her. Yet Lucy once toſſed up her head, upon my ſaying ſo—Pity her! why, yes, I think I do, now you have put me in the head of it: But I don't know whether ſhe is not more to be envied. Lucy is a polite girl.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1185400106:305"/>
She loves her Harriet. But ſhe knew I ſhould be pleaſed with the compliment to my brother.</p>
               <p>Harriet has juſt now looked in upon me—Writing, Lady G. And of me?—To Lady L. I ſuppoſe?</p>
               <p>She claſped her arms about me: Ah, madam! Thurſday! Thurſday!</p>
               <p>What of Thurſday?</p>
               <p>Is the day after to-morrow!</p>
               <p>Every child can tell that, Harriet.</p>
               <p>Ah but I, with ſuch happineſs before me, am ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>than</hi> a child!</p>
               <p>Well, but I can tell you ſomething, Harriet.</p>
               <p>What is that?</p>
               <p>That the next day to Thurſday, is Friday—The next to that is Saturday—The next—</p>
               <p>Piſh! I'll ſtay no longer with you, giving me a gentle tap—I would not have anſwered you ſo.</p>
               <p>Away ſhe tript, deſiring her affectionate compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to dear Lady L.</p>
               <p>Let me ſee! Have I any more to write? I think not. But a call for ſupper makes me leave my paper unſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>EMILY behaved very prettily at ſupper; but it would have been as well, if ſhe had not thought ſo herſelf: For ſhe boaſted of her behaviour afterwards to me. That made it look like an <hi>extraordinary</hi> in her own account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby ſung us a ſong, with a good Fox-hunter air. There is ſomething very agreeable in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiouſneſs: But it would become nobody elſe. I think you and I agreed at Dunſtable, that he is a fine, jolly, hearty, handſome-<hi>iſh</hi> man—He looks ſhrewd, arch, open, a true country gentleman aſpect; what he ſays is <hi>ſo-ſo</hi>—What he means is better.—He is very fond of your Lord—But I think rather fonder of <hi>mine</hi>—A criterion, Lady L!</p>
               <p>As for Lord G. he is in the ſituation of Harriet's
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1185400106:306"/>
Singleton—He is prepared to laugh the moment Mr. Selby opens his mouth; eſpecially when he twiſts his neck about, turns a glaſs upſide-down, and looks under his bent brows, at the company round, yet the table always in his eye: For then we know, that ſomething is collected, and ready to burſt forth.</p>
               <p>Well, good night! good night! good night!—Has my Godſon-elect done crying yet? What a duce has <hi>he</hi> to cry at? Unſwaddled, unpinioned, unſwathed, legs and arms at full liberty: But they ſay crying does good to the brats—opens their pipes—and-ſo-forth—But tell him, that if he does not learn to laugh, as well as cry, he ſhall not be related to</p>

Emily, with her pretty impertinence. Neither Lord G. nor Emily, can be any-thing, when ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers come, and I ſtand not by them to ſhew their ſignification.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE two Miſs Nedhams, Miſs Watſon, Miſs Barclay, the two Miſs Holles's, Mr. Deane—<q rend="inline margQuotes">'So, ſo, ſo, Harriet, ſaid I, what is the meaning of this?'</q>—My uncle's doings! I have no ſpirits. Sir Charles ſhould not have been ſo paſſive: He, and no-body elſe, could have prevailed upon my uncle. My aunt has held him in, till her arms aked. O the dear reſtiff man! She has now let go; and you ſee how he prances over the whole meadow, the reins upon his neck.</p>
               <p>Dear girl! ſaid I, I am glad you are ſo fanciful.</p>
               <p>I would fain be lively, if I could, ſaid ſhe. Never any creature had more reaſon, Lady G.—My heart is all Gratitude, and, I will ſay, Love.</p>
               <p>Good girl! hold up your head, my dear, and all will be as it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles ſtaid to attend hither the moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of women. Mr. and Mrs. Revees are to come with them. You muſt, as you expect me to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, be content with bits and ſcraps, written by ſnatches of time. I pity you for your ſtill-life, my dear Lady L. and think your requeſt, that I will ſo write, as to make you ſuppoſe yourſelf on the ſpot, a reaſonable one.</p>
               <p>Here is come the man of men!</p>
               <p>WITH what reſpect (all his Reſpect has Love in it) did he attend Mrs. Shirley to her ſeat! And then haſtening to Lord and Lady W. he ſaluted them both, and acknowleged the honour done him by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1185400106:308"/>
an hour, he ſaid, that he could not have expected, nor therefore had the thought, the diſtance ſo great, of aſking for it.</p>
               <p>He then paid his compliments, in the moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate manner, to his amiable friend Beauchamp; who, on his thanking him for his uninvited preſence, ſaid, He could not deny himſelf being preſent at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity that was to complete the happineſs of the beſt of men, and beſt of friends.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles addreſſed himſelf to the young Ladies who were moſt ſtrangers to him; apologizing to them, as they were engaged with Mr. Selby, Mr. Deane and Lord G. that he did not at firſt. He ſat a few minutes with them: What he ſaid, I heard not; but they ſmiled, bluſhed, and looked delighted upon each other. Every-body followed him in his motions, with their eye. So much preſence of mind, never met with ſo much modeſty of behaviour, and ſo charming a vivacity.</p>
               <p>The young Ladies came only <hi>intendedly</hi> to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and that at Mr. Selby's odd invitation. They had the good ſenſe to apologize for their coming this day, as they were to make part of the cavalcade, as I may call it to-morrow. But the odd ſoul had met the four at a neighbouring Lady's, where he made a goſſiping viſit, and would make them come with him.</p>
               <p>I obſerved, that nobody cared to find fault with him; ſo I began to rate him; and a very whimſical dialogue paſſed between us at one end of the room, while Sir Charles, Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Lady W. and Harriet, were in cloſe talk at the other.</p>
               <p>I made the honeſt man aſhamed of himſelf; and every-body in our circle was pleaſed with us. This miſled me to go on; and ſo, by attending to his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and purſuing my own, I loſt the opportunity of hearing a converſation, which, I dare ſay, would have been worth repeating to you by pen and ink. Harriet ſhall write, and give it you.</p>

               <p>The gentlemen and ſome of the Ladies, myſelf (but not Harriet) among them, have been to look at the preparations made in the leſſer Park, for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tenants. Mr. Selby prided himſelf not a little on his contrivances there. When we returned, we found Harriet at one end of the great parlour, ſitting with Emily; her grandmother, Mr. Selby, Lucy, in converſation at the other; the good girl's hand in hers, Emily bluſhing, looking down, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, as it ſeemed; Harriet, with ſweetneſs, love, and compaſſion, intermingled in her aſpect, talking to her, and bending over her, her fine neck. I thought I never ſaw her look ſo lovely. Elder ſiſter like, and younger, one inſtructing in love, the other liſtening with pleaſure. They (unobſerved by themſelves) took every-body's attention, as the room filled with the company, who all crouded about Mrs. Shirley, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to heed the two friends. What would I give, ſaid Lady W. to Sir Charles and her Lord, for a picture of thoſe two young Ladies (Emily juſt then kiſſed the hand of her lovely friend with emotion, and Harriet lifted up Emily's to her lips) if Love, Dignity, and ſuch Expreſſion, could be drawn in the face of one Lady; and that Reverence, Gratitude, and modeſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in the other? I congratulate you, Sir Charles, with all my heart. I have obſerved with rapture, from every look, every word, and from the whole behaviour of Miſs Byron, that your goodneſs to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds will be <hi>greatly</hi> recompenſed. O my good Lord W. turning to him, Miſs Byron will pay all our debts.</p>
               <p>Every attitude, every look, of Miſs Byron's, ſaid my Lord, would furniſh out a fine picture. I cannot keep my eye from her, where-ever ſhe is.</p>
               <p>My brother bowed, delighted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:1185400106:310"/>
How pleaſed was Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby—Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body! But what a different man is Lord W. to what he once was! lifted up from low keeping, to a wife, who, by her behaviour, good ſenſe, politeneſs, gives him conſequence. Once I thought him one of the loweſt of men. I denied him, in my heart, a relation to my mother, and thought him a ſavage.</p>
               <p>The two young Ladies, finding themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſtood up, in a parting poſture; but Emily ſeeming eager to detain her dear friend's attention, Harriet took a hand of Emily's in each of hers.</p>
               <p>I had fidled that way—Yes, my dear, ſaid the lovely Harriet, friendſhip unalterable by time or fate, as you ſay. Deareſt Emily, command me ever.</p>
               <p>Emily looked about her—O madam, I want to <hi>kneel</hi> to you. I will ever, ever—My good Lady G. ſaid Harriet, approaching me, one of Emily's hands in hers, we have promiſed a friendſhip that is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of our lives. We are to tell each the other all her faults. How cauſeleſly has my Emily been accuſing herſelf!—The moſt ingenuous of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hearts is hers.</p>
               <p>She left Emily's hand in mine, and bent towards Mrs. Shirley, and the whole circle of friends ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding her chair.</p>
               <p>O my dear Lady G! ſaid Emily, whiſperingly, as we followed the meek-eyed Goodneſs of Wiſdom [Such her air, her manner, her amiableneſs, ſeemed in my thought, at that time, to make her], never, never was ſuch graciouſneſs! I cannot hear her goodneſs. What a happy creature ſhall I be, if I follow her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and obſerve her precepts!—You cannot, my dear, ſaid I, have a better guide: But, Love, you muſt not be capricious, as you were at firſt coming. She profeſſed ſhe would not. I have been excuſing myſelf to her, madam, ſaid the dear girl, and am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:1185400106:311"/>
My brother met the lovely creature. He took her hand, and, leading her towards her grandm ther, We have been attentive, my deareſt life, to you and Emily. You love <hi>her:</hi> She adores <hi>you.</hi> My Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ, you know not the hundredth part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of this admirable woman.</p>
               <p>You were born for each other. God preſerve you both, for an example to a world that wants it.</p>
               <p>Harriet courteſied to Beauchamp. Her face was overſpread with a fine crimſon; but ſhe attempted not to ſpeak. She ſqueezed herſelf, as it were, between the chairs of her grandmamma and aunt; then turned about, and looked <hi>ſo</hi> charmingly! Miſs Jervois, Sir, ſaid ſhe, to my brother, has the beſt of hearts. She <hi>deſerves</hi> your kind care. How happy is ſhe, in ſuch protection!</p>
               <p>And how much happier will ſhe be in yours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! replied he. Of what a care, my Emily, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, has this admirable Lady already relieved my heart! the care the greater, as you deſerve it all. In every-thing take her direction: It will be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of love and prudence. What an amiable companion will you make her! and how happy will your love of each other make me!</p>
               <p>Emily got behind me, as it were. Speak for me to my guardian, promiſe for me, madam—You never never, ſhall break your word through my fault.</p>
               <p>Beauchamp was affected. Graciouſneſs, ſaid he, looking at Harriet, and Goodneſs, looking at Emily, how are they here united! What a happy man will he be, who can intitle himſelf to a Lady formed upon ſuch an example!</p>
               <p>A ſun-beam from my brother's eye ſeemed to play upon his face, and dazle his eyes. The fine youth withdrew behind Lady W's chair. Mr. Selby, who had been ſo good as to give us his ſilent attention, then ſpoke, with a twang through his noſe. Adad, adad, ſaid he, I don't know what to make of myſelf—But go on, go on; I love to hear you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:1185400106:312"/>
Your good Lord, my dear, enjoyed the pleaſure we all had: Mine toſſed up his head, and ſeemed to ſnuff the wind: And yet, my dear Lady L. there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo very extraordinary ſaid; but the <hi>manner</hi> was the thing, which ſhewed a meaning, that left language behind it.</p>
               <p>My brother is abſolutely paſſive as to the oeconomy of the approaching ſolemnity. Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Lady W. your Charlotte, and Lucy, are the council appointed; but uncle Selby will put in, to marſhal this happy proceeding. <hi>What a pize,</hi> he ſays, is not Harriet <hi>his</hi> daughter? Will it not be his Day?</p>
               <p>Mrs Selby tries to ſmile off his oddity; but now-and-then we ſee her good-naturedly redden at it, as if for his ſake. Lucy looks at her uncle as if ſhe could hardly away with his particularities; but Mrs. Shirley has always ſomething to ſay for him. She enters into his character: She knows the honeſty, as well as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, of his heart: That it all proceeds from joy and love; and always allows for him—As I would have my friends allow for me: And, to ſay truth, I, for my own part, like him the better for wanting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances; becauſe his caſe, in that reſpect, is mine. Ah, my dear! it is the thoughtful, half-aſleep, half-awake, blinking cat, that catches the mouſe. Such as your Charlotte, with their kitteniſh tricks, do but fright away the prey; and, if they could catch it, had rather play with it, than kill it.</p>
               <p>Harriet is with her virgins: Her dreſs is left to her own choice. I ſtept in juſt now—She met me at her dreſſing-room door, and looked <hi>ſo</hi> lovely! <hi>ſo</hi> ſilly! and <hi>ſo</hi> full of unmeaning meaningneſs [Do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me, Lady L?] She ſighed—What would my Harriet ſay to me? ſaid I, taking her hand.—I don't know; again ſighed—But love me, Lady G.—Can I help it? ſaid I; and, putting my arms about her, kiſſed her cheek.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:1185400106:313"/>
Uncle Selby has provided ſeven gentlemen of the neighbourhood, to match the number of the Ladies; for there will be ſixteen of us: Mr. <hi>Godſrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Steele,</hi> Mr. <hi>Falconbridge,</hi> three agreeable young men, ſons of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, Mr. Selby's choſen friends and companions in his field-ſports; his couſin <hi>Holles,</hi> brother to the Miſs Holles's, an admirer of Miſs Nedham; young Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> an admirer of Miſs Barclay; Mr. <hi>Alleſtree,</hi> a nephew of Sir John, a young man of ſine qualities engaged to Miſs Dolly Nedham: and Lord <hi>Reresby</hi> of Ireland (related to Mr. Selby's favourite Sir Thomas Falconbridge), a young nobleman of ſhining parts, great modeſty, good-nature, and, what is worth them all, Mrs. Shirley ſays, a man of virtue.</p>
               <p>Lord W. was very deſirous of giving ſo rich a jewel as Harriet to his nephew, in return, as he ſaid, for <hi>as</hi> rich a jewel which he had preſented to him; but Mr. Selby would not admit of that. I told him, on his appeal to me, that he was right, once in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby talks much of the muſic he has provided for to-morrow. He ſpeaks of it as a <hi>band,</hi> I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>WE have had a moſt agreeable evening. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Soul of the company. His addreſs to his Harriet was reſpectfully-affectionate, yet, for her ſake, not very peculiar. Every-body, in turn, had his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt notice, and were happy in it. The next day's ſolemnity was oſten hinted at by Mr. Selby, and even by my flippant Lord—But Sir Charles always inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly led to more general ſubjects; and this ſupported the ſpirits of the too thoughtful Harriet, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved, on the whole, very prettily. His joy viſibly was joy; but it ſeemed to be joy of ſo familiar and eaſy a nature, as if it would laſt.</p>
               <p>He once occaſionally told the happy commencement
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1185400106:314"/>
of his acquaintance with Miſs Byron; on purpoſe, I ſaw, to remind her, that he ought not to be thought of as a ſtranger to her, and to engage her in an eaſy familiarity. But there was a delicacy obſerved by him in the remembered commencement. He put it not from the time that he reſcued her from Sir Hargrave; but from the firſt viſit ſhe made me in St. James's Square; tho' ſhe, with great gratitude, carried it back to its real commencement.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Shirley retired ſoon, as is her cuſtom, her Harriet attending her. The old Lady is lame, and infirm; but, as ſhe ſits, is a very fine woman; and every-body ſees that ſhe was once a beauty. I thought I never ſaw beauty in full bloom ſo beautiful as when it ſupported beauty in ruins, on the old Lady's retiring with a face <hi>ſo</hi> happy, leaning one arm on her lovely grandchild, a neat crutch-ſtick in the other, lightning her weight to the delicately-formed ſupporter of her old age. It was ſo ſtriking a picture, that every ſoul all ſtanding up, from reverence, or her retreating, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; and no one knew which obſerved it firſt, when the door ſhurt out the graceful figures.</p>
               <p>The old Lady's lameneſs is owing, it ſeems, to a ſprained ſinew, got in leading up a dance, not many years ago, propoſed by herſelf, in order to crown the reconciliation which ſhe had brought about, between a couple that had, till then been unhappy; and which her good-nature and joy made her not ſenſible of till ſhe ſat down. Pity, pity, that any-thing ſhould have hurt ſo benign, ſo chearful, ſo benevolent, a woman! Why did not Harriet tell us this circumſtance? It would have heightened our value for her: And the more, if ſhe had told us, as is the truth, that ſhe never conſiders it as a hurt (ſo honourably come by) but when ſhe thinks ſhe is troubleſome to thoſe about her.</p>
               <p>Harriet returned to company more chearful than when ſhe left it, enriched with her grandmother's
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1185400106:315"/>
bleſſings, and prayers for her and my brother (as ſhe whiſpered me) and in having been allowed to ſupport the tottering parent.</p>
               <p>Harriet, ſaid I, aloud, you were a very naughty girl to accuſe me, as once you did, of reflecting upon age. You never, in my eyes, looked more lovely than you did half an hour ago, ſupporting the beſt of old Ladies.</p>
               <p>We are of your Ladyſhip's mind, ſaid Lady W. A new grace, believe me, my dear, ſhone out in every graceful feature.</p>
               <p>Your kind notice, Ladies, bowing to me and Lady W. does me honour; but more to your own hearts.</p>
               <p>Moſt gracefully does the dear girl receive and return a compliment; but this, Lady L. I need not now ſay to you: We have both admired her on theſe occaſions. How happy will ſhe make a man, who can be ſo <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of his happineſs! And how happy will <hi>he</hi> make <hi>her! He,</hi> who has the moſt grateful and enlarged of human hearts!</p>
               <p>Mr. Deane, Sir Charles, Lord and Lady W. Mrs. Shirley, Mr. and Mrs. Selby, Lucy, Lord L. and I withdrew, to read, and ſee ſigned, the Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articles, ſoon after tea (I tell you things out of courſe, Lady L. as they come into my head): When they were ready to ſign, the dear Harriet was ſent for in. She would not come before. She begged, ſhe prayed, ſhe might not. The firſt line of each clauſe, and the laſt for form ſake, were run over, by Mr. Deane, as faſt as he could read. How the dear creature trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when ſhe came in, and all the time of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened reading! But when the pen was given her, to write her name, ſhe dropt it twice, on the parchment. Sir Charles ſaw her emotion with great concern; and held her up, as ſhe ſtood. My deareſt life, ſaid he, take time, take time—Do not hurry; putting the pen each time, with reverence, in her fingers. She tried to write, but twice her pen would not touch the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1185400106:316"/>
parchment, ſo as to mark it. She ſat down. Take time, take time, my Love, repeated he. She ſoon made another effort, his arm round her waiſt—She then ſigned them; but Sir Charles held her hand, and the parchments in them, when ſhe delivered them.—<q rend="inline">'As your act and deed, my deareſt Love?'</q> ſaid Sir Charles.—'Yes, indeed,' ſaid the dear creature, and made him a courteſy; hardly knowing what ſhe did.</p>
               <p>She muſt hear of this, when ſhe can bear it. You charged me to be very minute on the behaviour of our Harriet: You was ſure it would be a pattern. But, no! you ſee ſhe is too timid.</p>
               <p>She accompanied me to my chamber when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired for the night. She ſigned. I took notice of it.—O my Charlotte! ſaid ſhe, To-morrow! To-morrow!—</p>
               <p>Will be the beginning of your happineſs, my Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet!—What virgin heart, ſaid I, but muſt have had joy, on her contemplating the man of ſenſe and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had his behaviour of this night <hi>only</hi> been the teſt of her judgment of him?</p>
               <p>True! And I <hi>have</hi> joy: But the circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me is a ſolemn one: And does not the obligation lie all on his ſide?</p>
               <p>Does he behave to you, my Love, as if he thought <hi>any</hi> of it did?</p>
               <p>O no, no! But the fact is otherwiſe; and as <hi>I</hi> know it, the obligation is heightened by his polite goodneſs to me.</p>
               <p>Dearly does he love his Harriet (To-morrow will you be <hi>his</hi> Harriet for life). Are you not convinced that he loves you?</p>
               <p>I am, I am! But—</p>
               <p>But what, my dear?</p>
               <p>I never can deſerve him. Hapleſs, hapleſs Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina! ſhe <hi>only</hi> could! Let a ſortnight after to-morrow be over, and ſhe be not <hi>un</hi> -happy, and what a thrice happy creature ſhall I be!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:1185400106:317"/>
I kiſſed her glowing cheek.—Support yourſelf like a heroine to-morrow, my dear. You <hi>will</hi> have a taſk, becauſe of the crouds which will attend you; but it is the tax you pay for being ſo excellent, and ſo much beloved.</p>
               <p>Is it not ſtrange, Lady G. that my grandmamma ſhould join to ſupport my uncle in his vehemence for a public day? Had it been only <hi>his</hi> command, I would have rebelled!</p>
               <p>The pride they take in the alliance with my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not for his ſituation in life, but for his tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent merit, is their motive; your grandmother's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. She conſiders the day as one of the happieſt of her life: She has begged of me to ſupport you in undergoing it. She ſays, If there ſhould be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſpectators, ſhe knows it will give pleaſure to as many hearts; and to hers the more, for that reaſon. And you will be, continued I, ſo lovely a Pair, when joined, that every beholder, man and woman, will give him to you; you to him.</p>
               <p>You are very good, my dear Lady G. to encourage me thus: But I told my grandmother, this night, that ſhe knew not the hardſhip ſhe had impoſed on me, by inſiſting on a public day; but I would not begin ſo great a change, whatever it coſt me, by an act of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or diſobedience to the will of ſo dear a parent. But your <hi>brother,</hi> my dear Lady G. continued ſhe, who would have thought <hi>he</hi> would have given into it?</p>
               <p>As your friends mean a compliment to my brother, replied I; ſo he, by his acquieſcence, means one to you, and to them. He is not a conſident man: He looks upon Marriage in as awful a light as you do; but he is not ſhy of making a public declaration of his Love to the woman he has choſen. He has told me, talking of this very ſubject, that a public ceremony is not what, for your delicacy-ſake, he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: But <hi>being</hi> propoſed, he would not, by any means, decline it. He had no concern but for you;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1185400106:318"/>
and he took your acquieſcence as a noble inſtance of your duty and obligingneſs to one of the moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and worthy of parents.</p>
               <p>O my dear Lady G. how good was you to come down! Support me in the arduous taſk of To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row!—You will not want my ſupport, my love; you will have Sir Charles Grandiſon, bound, both by Duty and Love, to ſupport you.</p>
               <p>She threw her arms about me: I will endeavour to behave as I ought, in a circumſtance that ſhall intitle me to ſuch protection, and to ſuch a Siſter.</p>
               <p>My fidgeting Lord thruſt in (unſent for) his ſharp face; and I chiding him for his intruſion, ſhe ſlipt away, or I had deſigned to a tend her to her chamber; and there, perhaps, ſhould we have ſtaid together moſt part of the night. If I had, I don't ſuppoſe that I ſhould have deprived <hi>her</hi> of any reſt. What makes my fooliſh heart throb for her? ſo happy as ſhe is likely to be!—But ſincerely do I love her.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have told you, that Emily behaved very prettily. Mr. Beauchamp had a rich opportunity to engage her, while the ſettlements were executing.</p>
               <p>On our return to them, the poor girl was wiping her eyes. How now, Emily? ſaid I ſoftly. O ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Mr. Beauchamp has been telling me how ill Sir Harry is! His own eyes ſet mine the example. How I pity him! And how good he is!—No wonder my Guardian loves him.</p>
               <p>Beauchamp may poſſibly catch her in a weeping fit. The heart ſoftened by grief, will turn to a comforter. Our own grief produces pity for another: Pity, Love. They are next neighbours, and will call in to aſk kindly how a ſufferer does: And what a heart muſt that be, that will not adminiſter comfort when it makes a neigbourly call, if comfort be in its power?</p>

[From Selby-houſe to the Church, Half a mile, in Coaches; Foot-way not ſo much.]</p>
               <p>Emily was very earneſt to be Bride-maid, tho' ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beauchamp was a Brideman, at his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt alſo.</p>
               <p>I will go back to the early part of the morning.</p>
               <p>We are each of us ſerenaded, as I may ſay, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this joyful man uncle Selby <hi>(awakened,</hi> as he called it, to muſic) by James Selby, playing at each perſon's door an air or two, the words from an Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium (whoſe, I know not);</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Day is come, you wiſhed ſo long:</l>
                  <l>Love picked it out among the throng:</l>
                  <l>He deſtines to himſelf this Sun,</l>
                  <l>And takes the reins, and drives it on.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It is indeed a fine day. The ſun ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſome of us; but Harriet ſlept not a wink. No wonder.</p>
               <p>I haſtened up to ſalute her. She was ready dreſſed. Charming readineſs, my Love, ſaid I! I took the opportunity while I was able, anſwered ſhe.</p>
               <p>Lucy, Nancy, were with her, both dreſſed, as ſhe, for the Day; that they might have nothing to do but attend her. What joy in their faces! What ſweet carefulneſs in the lovely Harriet's!—And <hi>will</hi> this Day, ſaid ſhe once, in a low voice, to me, give me to the Lord of my Heart?—Let not <hi>grief</hi> come near it; <hi>joy</hi> can be enough painful!</p>
               <p>Her grandmamma was ſoon ready. Harriet hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in to her grandmamma'a apartment, to crave her bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Lucy.]My couſin, her ſpirits over-hurried, was ready to ſaint in her grandmother's arms; but, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by the ſoothings, the bleſſings, of her venerable parent, ſoon recovered. Let nobody be frighted, ſaid
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1185400106:323"/>
her grandmother: Affright not, by your hurryings, my lovely child! A little fatigued; her ſpirits are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: Her joy is too much for them.</p>
               <p>What a charming preſence of mind has Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley! Lady G. bids me write any-thing to your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, ſo I will but write; and forbids me apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing either for manner or words.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles was admitted. She ſtood up the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ſaw him, Love and Reverence in her ſweet aſpect. With a kind impatience he haſtened to her, and threw himſelf at her feet, taking her hand, and preſſing it with his lips—Reſume your magnanimity, my deareſt Life: With the man before you, by God's bleſſing, you will have <hi>more</hi> than a chance for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Forgive me, Sir, ſaid ſhe, ſitting down (She could hardly ſtand): I can have no doubt of your goodneſs: But it is a great Day! The Solemnity is an awful one!</p>
               <p>It is a great, a ſolemn, Day to <hi>me,</hi> my deareſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! But encourage my joy by your ſmiles. It can ſuffer abatement only by giving you pain.</p>
               <p>Generous goodneſs! But—</p>
               <p>But what, my Love?—In compliment to the beſt of Parents, to the kindeſt of Uncles, reſume your uſual preſence of mind. I elſe, who ſhall glory before a thouſand witneſſes in receiving the honour of your hand, ſhall be ready to regret that I acquieſced ſo chearfully with the wiſhes of thoſe parental friends for a public celebration.</p>
               <p>I have not been of late well, Sir: My mind is weakened. But it would be ungrateful, If I did not own to you, that my joy is as ſtrong as my fear: It overcame me. I hope I ſhall behave better. You ſhould not have been called to be a witneſs of my weakneſs—</p>
               <p>This Day, my deareſt Love, we call upon the world to witneſs to our mutual vows. Let us ſhew that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1185400106:324"/>
world, that our Hearts are one; and that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſacred as it is, cannot make them more ſo. The engagement is a holy one: Let us ſhew the Multitude as well as our ſurrounding Friends, that we think it a laudable one. Once more I call upon you, my deareſt Life, to juſtify my joy by your <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi> approbation. The world around you, lovelieſt of women, has been accuſtomed to ſee your <hi>Lovers;</hi> ſhew them now the huſband of your choice.</p>
               <p>O Sir! you have given me a motive! I will think of it throughout the whole Sacred Tranſaction. She looked around her, as if to ſee if every-body were ready that moment to attend her to Church.</p>
               <p>Lady G.] The Ceremony is happily over; and I am retired to oblige my Caroline. You have the form of the Proceſſion. When ever-thing was ready, Mr. Selby thought fit to call us down in order into the Great Hall, according to it, marſhalling his Fours; and great pride and pleaſure did he take in his office. At his firſt ſummons, down came the Angel, and the four young Ladies, and each of the four had her part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aſſigned her.</p>
               <p>Emily ſeemed, between the novelty and the parade, to be wholly engaged.</p>
               <p>Harriet, the moment ſhe came down, flew to her grandmamma, and kneeled to her, Sir Charles ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting her as ſhe kneeled, and as ſhe aroſe. A tender and ſweet fight!</p>
               <p>The old Lady threw her arms about her, and twice or thrice kiſſed her forehead; her voice faltring—God bleſs, bleſs, ſuſtain my child!—Her aunt kiſſing her cheek. Now, now, my deareſt Love, whiſpered ſhe, I call upon you for fortitude.</p>
               <p>She viſibly ſtruggled for reſolution, but ſeemed, in all her motions, to be in a hurry, as if afraid ſhe ſhould not hold it. She paſſed me with ſuch a ſweet confuſion! Charming girl! ſaid I, taking her hand,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1185400106:325"/>
as ſhe paſſed, and giving way to her quick motions for fear reſtraint ſhould diſconcert her.</p>
               <p>When her uncle gave the word for moving, and approached to take her hand, ſhe in her hurry, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting her cue, put it into Sir Charles's. Hold, hold ſaid her uncle, ſweeping his boſom with his chin, in his arch way, that muſt not yet be. My brother, kiſſing her hand, preſented it in a very gallant manner to her uncle. I yield it to you, Sir, ſaid he, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truſt; in an hour's time to be confimred mine by Divine, as well as human Sanctions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby led the lovely creature to the coach, but ſtopt at the door with her, for Mrs. Shirley's going in firſt: The ſervants at diſtance all admiring, and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, for their beloved young Lady.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles took the good Mrs. Shirley's hand in one of his, and put the other arm round her waiſt, to ſupport her. What honour you do me, Sir! ſaid ſhe. I think I may throw away <hi>this</hi> (meaning her ebony crutch-ſtick): Do I ail any-thing? Her feet, however, ſeconded not her ſpirits. My brother lifted her into the coach. It was ſo natural to him to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, that he offered his hand to his beloved Harriet; but was checked by her uncle (in his uſual pleaſant manner): Stay your time, too ready Sir, ſaid he. Thank God it will not be ſo long before <hi>both</hi> hands will be yours.</p>
               <p>We all followed, very exactly, the order that had been, with ſo much proud parade, preſcribed by Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſhal Selby.</p>
               <p>The coach-way was lined with ſpectators. Mr. Selby, it ſeems, bowed all the way, in return to the ſalutes of his acquaintance. Have you never, Lady L. called for the attention of your company in your coach, to ſomething that has paſſed in the ſtreets, or on the road, and at the ſame time thruſt your head through the windows ſo that nobody could ſee but yourſelf? So it was with Mr. Selby, I doubt not.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1185400106:326"/>
He wanted every one to look in at the Happy Pair; but took care that hardly any-body but himſelf ſhould be ſeen. I aſked him afterwards, If it were not ſo? He knew not, he ſaid, but it might. I told him, he had a very jolly comely face to ſhew, but no head. He does not ſpare me: But true jeſts are not always the moſt welcome. Tell a Lady of Forty, that ſhe is Sixty or Seventy, and ſhe will not be ſo angry as if ſhe were gueſſed to be Eight or Nine-and-thirty. The one nobody will believe; the other every-body. My Lord G. I can tell you, fares well in Mr. Selby's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Lucy, my dear girl, take the pen—You don't know you ſay, what I wrote laſt—Read it, my girl—You have it—Take the pen; I want to be among them.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lucy.] Lady G. muſt have her jeſt, whether in the right place, or not. Excuſe me, both Siſters. How <hi>could</hi> ſhe, however, in a part ſo intereſting? She ſays, I muſt give an account of the Proceſſion, and ſhe will conduct them into the Church; I out of it. I cannot, ſhe ſays, after ſo many wiſhes, ſo many ſuſpenſes, ſo much expectation, before it came to this, be too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. Every woman's heart leaps, ſhe ſays, when a Wedding is deſcribed; and wiſhes to know all, <hi>how and about it.</hi> Your Ladyſhip will know, that theſe words are Lady G's own: But what can I ſay of the Proceſſion?</p>
               <p>The poor Harriet—Fie upon me—The rich Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, was not ſorry, I believe, that her uncle's head, now on this ſide, now on the other, in a manner, filled the Coach: but when it ſtopt at the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, an incloſed one, whoſe walls keep off coaches near a ſtone's throw from the Church-porch, then was my lovely couſin put to it; eſpecially as her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother walked ſo ſlow. We were all out of our Coaches before the Father and the Bride entered the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1185400106:327"/>
Porch. I ſhould tell your Ladyſhip, that the paſſage from the entrance of the Church-yard to the Church is railed in. Every Sunday the croud (gathered to ſee the gentry go in and come out) are accuſtomed to be bounded by theſe rails and were the more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſo now: The whole Church-yard ſeemed one maſs (but for that ſeparating paſſage) of living matter, diſtinguiſhed only by ſeparate heads; not a hat on the mens; pulled off, perhaps, by general conſent, for the convenience of ſeeing, more than from deſigned regard in <hi>that</hi> particular. But, in the main, never was there ſuch ſilent reſpect ſhewn, on the like occaſion, by mortal mob. We all of us, Lady L. have the happineſs of being beloved by high and low.</p>
               <p>But one pretty ſpectacle it is impoſſible to paſs by. Four girls, tenants daughters, the eldeſt not above Thirteen, appeared with neat wicker-baſkets in their hands, filled with flowers of the ſeaſon. Chearful way was made for them. As ſoon as the Bride, and Father, and Sir Charles, and Mrs. Shirley, alighted, theſe pretty little Flora's, all dreſſed in white, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of flowers for head-dreſſes, large noſegays in their boſoms, white ribbands adorning their ſtays and their baſkets; ſome ſtreaming down, others tied round the handles in true-lover's knots; attended the company, two going before, two other here and there, and every-where, all ſtrewing flowers: A pretty thought of the tenants among themſelves. Sir Charles ſeemed much pleaſed with them: Pretty dears he called them, to one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> bleſs you, and <hi>God</hi> bleſs you, was echoed from many mouths. Your brother's attention was chiefly employed on Mrs. Shirley, becauſe of her age and lameneſs. Here my good Lady G. perhaps would ſtop to remark upon the worthy nature of the Engliſh populace, when good characters attract their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for even the populace took notice, how right a thing it was for the fineſt young Gentleman their eyes
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1185400106:328"/>
ever beheld, to take ſuch care of ſo good an old Lady. He <hi>deſerved</hi> to live to be old himſelf, one ſaid: They would warrant, others ſaid, that he was a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd man; and others, that he had a good heart. In the Proceſſion one of us picked up one praiſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other another. Tho' Lady G. Lady W. and the four Bride-maids, as well as the Lords, might have claimed high notice; yet not any of them received more than commendation: We were all conſidered but as Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to the Planetr that paſſed before us. What, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were more? But let me ſay, that Mrs. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley had her ſhare in Reverence, as the lovely Couple had theirs in Admiration. But O how my dear couſin was affected, when ſhe alighted from her uncle's coach!</p>
               <p>The Churchwardens themſelves were ſo complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as to ſtand at the Church-door, and opened it, on the approach of the Bride, and her Nuptial Father. But all the pews near the Altar were, however, filled (one or two excepted, which ſeemed to be left for the company) with Ladies and well-dreſſed women of the neighbourhood: And tho' they ſeemed to intend to ſhut the doors after we had all got in, the Church was full of people. Mr. Selby was diſpleaſed, for his Niece's ſake; who trembling, could hardly walk up to the Altar. Sir Charles ſeated <hi>his</hi> venerable charge on a covered bench on the left-ſide of the Altar; and by her, and on another covered bench on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, without the rails, we all, but the Bride-maids and their partners, took our ſeats. They ſtood, the Men on the Bridegroom's ſide; the Maids on Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet's—Never—</p>
               <p>Lady G.] <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Are you within the Church, Lucy?—You are, I proteſt. Let me read what you have done. Come, pretty well, pretty well.—You were going to praiſe my brother: Leave that to me. I have an excellent knack at it.'</q>

Never was man ſo much, and ſo deſervedly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. He ſaw his Harriet wanted ſupport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. The Miniſter ſtood ſuſpended, a few moments, as doubting whether ſhe would not faint. My deareſt Love, whiſpered Sir Charles, remember you are doing honour to the happy, thrice happy, man of your Choice: Shew he is your Choice, in the face of this Congregation. Pardon me, Sir! I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be all you wiſh me.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles bowed to the Miniſter to begin the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office. Mr. Selby, with all his bravery, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and, overcome by the Solemnity of the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, looked now pale, now red. The whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were huſhed and ſilent, as if nobody were in the Church but perſons immediately concerned to be there. Emily changed colour frequently. She had her handkerchief in her hand; and (pretty enough!) her ſiſter Bride-maids, little thinking that Emily had a reaſon for her emotion, which none of them had, pulled out <hi>their</hi> handkerchiefs too, and <hi>permitted</hi> a gentle tear or two to ſteal down their glowing cheeks. I fixed my eye on Emily, ſitting outward, to keep her in order. The Doctor began—<q rend="inline">'<hi>Dearly Beloved</hi>'</q>—Ah, Harriet! thought I; thou art much quieter now, than once thou wert at theſe words <note n="(a)" place="bottom">When Sir Hargrave Pollexfen would have compelled her to be his, Vol. I. p. 216.</note>.</p>
               <p>No <hi>impediments</hi> were confeſſed by either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they were referred to by the Miniſter, on this head. I ſuppoſe this reference would have been omitted by Sir Hargrave's ſnuffling Parſon. To the queſtion, to my brother, <q rend="inline">'<hi>Wilt thou have,</hi>'</q> &amp;c. he chearfully anſwered, <q rend="inline">

                     <hi>'I Charles, take thee, Harriet,</hi>'</q> &amp;c. on <hi>his</hi> part; which he audibly, and with apparent joy and reverence in his countenance, repeated after the Miniſter. But not quite ſo alert was Harriet, in <hi>her</hi> turn: Her hand was rather taken, than offered. Her lips, however, moved after the Miniſter; nor ſeemed to heſitate at the little piddling word <hi>obey,</hi> which, I remember, gave a qualm to my poor heart, on the like occaſion. The Ring was preſented. The Doctor gave it to Sir Charles; who, with his uſual grace, put it on the ſinger of the moſt charming woman in England; repeating after the Miniſter, audibly, <q rend="inline">'<hi>With this Ring I thee wed,</hi>'</q> &amp;c. She brightened up; when the Miniſter, joining their Right-hands, read, <hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Thoſe whom God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.'</q>
                  </hi> And the Miniſter's addreſs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, declaring the Marriage, and pronouncing them Man and Wife, in the name of the Holy Trinity; and his bleſſing them; ſwelled, ſhe owns, her grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, ready to burſting. In the Reſponſes, I could not but obſerve, that the Congregation generally joined, as if they were intereſted in the celebration.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles, with a joy that lighted up a more charming fluſh than uſual on his face, his lively Soul looking out at his fine eyes, yet with an air as modeſt as reſpectful, did credit to our Sex before the applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude, by bending his knee to his ſweet Bride, on taking her Hand, and ſaluting her, on the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ceremony—May God, my deareſt Life, ſaid he, audibly, be gracious to <hi>your</hi> Grandiſon, as he will be good to <hi>his</hi> Harriet, now no more Byron!—She courteſied low, and with ſo modeſt a grace, that every ſoul bleſſed her; and pronounced her the lovelieſt of women, and him the moſt graceful and polite of men.</p>

He invited Dr. Curtis to the Wedding-dinner, and led his Bride into the Veſtry; where already were her grandmother, her aunt, Lady W. her Lord, mine, and Lord L. She was followed by her Virgin train; they by their partners. She threw herſelf, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe beheld her grandmother, at her feet. Bleſs, bleſs madam, your happy, happy Child.</p>
               <p>God for ever bleſs the Darling of my heart!</p>
               <p>Sir Charles bent his knee to the venerable Lady, with ſuch a <hi>condeſcending</hi> dignity, if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs myſelf; Receive and bleſs, alſo, your Son, my Harriet's reverend parent, and mine.</p>
               <p>The dear Lady was affected. She ſlid off her ſeat on her knees, and with up-lifted hands and eyes, tears trickling on her cheeks; Thou, Almighty, bleſs the dear Son of my wiſhes!</p>
               <p>He raiſed her, with pious tenderneſs, and ſaluted her. Excellent Lady!—He would have ſaid more, but was affected—Every-body was—And having ſeated the old Lady, he turned to Mrs. Selby—Words are poor, ſaid he; my actions, my behaviour, ſhall ſpeak the grateful ſenſe I have of your goodneſs, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting her; of yours, madam, to Mrs. Shirley; and of yours, my deareſt Life, addreſſing himſelf to his lovely Bride, who ſeemed hardly able to ſuſtain her joy, on ſo reſpectful a recognition of relation to perſons ſo dear to her. Let me once more, added he, bleſs the Hand that has bleſſed me!</p>
               <p>She chearfully offered it: I give you, Sir, my Hand, ſaid ſhe, courteſying, and with it a poor Heart—A poor Heart, indeed! But it is a grateful one! It is all your own!</p>
               <p>He bowed upon her Hand: He ſpoke not: He ſeemed as if he could not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Joy, Joy, Joy, was wiſhed the Happy Pair, from every mouth. See, my dear young Ladies,' ſaid the happy and inſtructing Mr. Shirley, addreſſing herſelf to them, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'the Reward of Duty, Virtue, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience!

How unhappy muſt thoſe Parents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be, whoſe Daughters, unlike our Harriet, have diſgraced themſelves, and their families, by a a ſhameful Choice—As my Harriet's <hi>is,</hi> ſuch, looking around her, be <hi>your</hi> Lot, my amiable Daughters!</q>
               </p>

               <p>Emily, when ſhe approached the venerable Lady, ſobbing, ſaid, Bleſs me, me alſo bleſs, my dear grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma Shirley!—Let me be your own Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter.—She embraced and bleſſed the dear girl—Ah, my Love! ſaid ſhe, But <hi>will</hi> you ſupply the place of my Harriet to me? <hi>Will</hi> you be my Harriet? <hi>Will</hi> you live with me, and Mrs. Selby—as Harriet did?—Emily ſtarted.

               <p>This I thought a good hint of Mrs. Shirley. Our Harriet (my dear Caroline) ſhall not be made unhappy by the chit; nor ſhall the dear girl neither, if I can help it, be made ſo by her own foible. We will watch over both, for the good of both, and for the tranquillity of the beſt of men.</p>

               <p>Mr. Selby and my Lord were vaſtly alive. Lord L. was fervent in his joy, and congratulations; but he was wiſer than both put together. Nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew that he was exceſſively pleaſed; but I was afraid the other two would not have conſidered the Veſtry as part of the Church; and would have ſtruck up a tune without muſic.</p>
               <p>How ſincerely joyful, alſo, were Lord and Lady W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

My Lord's eyes burſt into tears more than once: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and dear Nephew, at every word, whether ſpeaking of or to my brother; as if he thought the Relation he ſtood in to him, a greater glory than his Peerage, or aught elſe that he valued himſelf upon, his excellent Lady excepted.</p>
               <p>Upon my Honour, Caroline, I think, as I have often ſaid, that people may be <hi>very</hi> happy, if not <hi>moſt</hi> happy, who ſet out with a moderate ſtock of Love, and ſupply what they want in that, with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I really think, that my Brother and Harriet cannot be happier than are this now worthy Couple; times of life conſidered on both ſides, and my Lord's inferior capacity allowed for. For certainly, men of ſenſe are moſt capable of joyful ſenſations, and have their balances; ſince it is <hi>as</hi> certain, that they are alſo moſt ſuſceptible of painful ones. What, then, is the ſtuff, the nonſenſe, that romantic girls, their ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancing part of life not wholly elapſed, prate about, and din one's ears with, of <hi>firſt</hi> Love, <hi>firſt</hi> Flame, but <hi>firſt</hi> Folly? Do not moſt of ſuch give indication of gunpowder conſtitutions, that want but the match to be applied, to ſet them into a blaze?

Once more, ſaid he, do I thank my deareſt Life for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe has done me: Then reſuming, with his other hand, his Beauchamp's, he preſented each to the other, as Brother and Siſter.</p>
               <p>Beauchamp, in a graceful manner, bowed on her hand: She courtefied to him with an air of dignity and eſteem.</p>
               <p>He then turning to Emily; Acknowlege, my dear, ſaid he, your elder Siſter: My Harriet will love her Emily. Receive, my deareſt Life, your Ward. Yet (to Emily) I acquit not myſelf of the power, any more than of the will, of obliging you at firſt hand.</p>
               <p>O Sir! ſaid the ſobbing girl, you are all goodneſs! But I will make no requeſt to you, but through my deareſt Lady Grandiſon's mediation. If ſhe approve of it firſt, I ſhall not doubt of its fitneſs to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1185400106:338"/>
Was not that pretty, in Emily?—O how Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ's eyes loved her!</p>
               <p>But why, Ladies, ſaid Sir Charles, do you ſequeſter yourſelves from the company? Are we not all of a Family to-day? The four little Flora's, with their baſkets in their hands, were entering the gate, as I came in: Receive them, my Love, with your uſual graciouſneſs. We will join the company, and call them in. My Beauchamp, you are a Brideman; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my Bride to her friends and admirers within.</p>
               <p>He took Emily's hand. She looked <hi>ſo</hi> proud!—Harriet gave hers to Beauchamp. We followed them into the Great Hall: Mr. Selby had archneſs in his look, and ſeemed ready to blame us for withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—Sir Charles was aware of him. My dear Mr. Selby, ſaid he, Will you not allow us to ſee the pretty Flora's—By all means, ſaid Mr. Selby; and hurried out, and introduced them. Sweet pretty girls! We had more leiſure to conſider the elegant ruſticity of their dreſſes and appearance. They had their baſkets in their hands, and a courteſy and a bluſh ready for every one in company. Sir Charles ſeemed to expect that his Bride would take notice of them firſt; but obſerving that ſhe wanted preſence of mind, he ſtept to them, took each by the hand, the youngeſt firſt, called them pretty Loves; I wiſh, ſaid he, I could preſent you with as pretty flowers as you threw away in honour <hi>to this company;</hi> putting into each baſket, wrapped up in paper, five guineas: Then preſented them, two in each hand, to his Bride; who, by that time, was better prepared to receive them with that ſweet eaſe and familiarity which give grace to all ſhe ſays and does.</p>
               <p>The children afterwards deſiring to go to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the polite Beauchamp him elf, accompanied by Lucy, led them to them, and returned, with a requeſt from all the tenants, that they might have the honour, ſome time in the day, to ſee the Bride and Bridegroom
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1185400106:339"/>
among them, were it but for two minutes. What ſays my Love? ſaid Sir Charles. O, Sir! I cannot, cannot—Well, then, I will attend them, to make your excuſe, as well as I can. She bowed her thanks.</p>
               <p>The time before dinner was devoted to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Sir Charles was nobody's; no, not very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly his Bride's: He put every one upon ſpeaking in turn. For about half an hour he ſat between the joyful Mrs. Shirley and Mrs. Selby; but even then, in talking to them, talked to the whole company: Yet, in his air and manner to both, ſhewed ſo much reſpect, as needed not the aid of a particular addreſs to them in words.</p>
               <p>This was obſerved to me by good Lord L. For Harriet (uneaſy, every eye continually upon her, thoughtful, baſhful) withdrawing, a little before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a caſt of her eye to me, I followed her to her dreſſing-room. There, with ſo much expreſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of meaning, tho' not of language; ſo much tenderneſs of love; ſo much pious gratitude; ſo much true virgin ſenſibility; did ſhe open her heart to me; that I ſhall ever revolve what paſſed in that converſation, as the true criterion of Virgin Delicacy unmingled with Affectation. Nor was I diſpleaſed that, in the height of her grateful Self-congratulation, ſhe more than once acknowleged a ſigh for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Clementina. We juſt began to expreſs our pleaſure and our hopes in the good behaviour of our Emily, when we were called to dinner.</p>
               <p>It was a ſumptuous one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby was very orderly, upon the whole: But he remembred, he ſaid, that when <hi>he</hi> was married (and he called upon his Dame to confirm it) he was obliged to wait on his Bride, and the Company; and he inſiſted upon it, that Sir Charles ſhould.</p>
               <p>No, no, no, every one ſaid; and the Bride looked a little ſerious upon it: But Sir Charles, with an air
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1185400106:340"/>
of gaiety that infinitely became him, took a napkin from the butler; and putting it under his arm, I have only one requeſt to make you, my dear Mr. Selby—When I am more aukward than I ought to be, do you correct me: and I ſhall have both pride and pleaſure in the taſk.</p>
               <p>Adad! ſaid Mr. Selby, looking at him with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—You may <hi>be</hi> any-thing, <hi>do</hi> any-thing; you cannot conceal the Gentleman. Ads-heart, you muſt always be the firſt man in company—Pardon me, my Lords.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles was the modeſteſt ſervitor that ever waited at table, while his napkin was under his arm: But he laid it down, While he addreſſed himſelf to the company, finding ſomething to ſay to each in his pithy, agreeable manner, as he went round the table. He made every one happy. With what delight did the elder Ladies look upon him, when he addreſſed himſelf to each of them! He ſtopt at the Bride's chair, and made her a compliment with an air of tenderneſs. I heard not what it was, ſitting at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but ſhe looked grateful, pleaſed; ſmiled, and bluſhed. He paſſed from her to the Bride-maids, and again complimented each of them. They alſo ſeemed delighted with what he ſaid. Then going to Mr. Selby; Why don't you bid me reſume the napkin, Sir?—No, no; we ſee what you can do: Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is enough for me. You may now ſit down, when you pleaſe. You make the waiters look auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>He took his ſeat, thanked Mr. Selby for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded him of his duty, as he called it, and was all Himſelf, the moſt graceful and obliging of men.</p>
               <p>You know, my dear Lady L. how much I love to praiſe my brother. Neither I, nor the young Ladies, not even thoſe who had humble ſervants preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded any-body but him. My poor Lord!—I am glad, however, that he has a tolerable good ſet of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1185400106:341"/>
teeth—They were always viſible. A good honeſt ſort of man, tho', Lady L. whatever you may think of him.</p>
               <p>After dinner, at Mr. Selby's reminding motion, Sir Charles and the men went to the tenants. They all wiſhed him joy; and, as they would not ſit down, while he ſtood, Sir Charles took a ſeat among them, and all the reſt followed his example.</p>
               <p>One of the honeſt men, it ſeems, remembred the Nuptials of Mr. and Mrs. Byron, and praiſed them as the beſt and happieſt of the human race: Others confirmed <hi>his</hi> character of both: Another knew the late Mr. Shirley, and extolled him as much: Another remembred the birth, another the chriſtening, of the Bride; and others talked of what an excellent creature ſhe was from her infancy. Let me tell you, Sir, ſaid one grey-headed man, you will have much ado to deſerve her; and yet you are ſaid to be as good as you are handſome. The women took up the cauſe: They were ſure, by what they had heard, if any man in the world could deſerve the Bride, it was Sir Charles Grandiſon; and they would ſwear for him by his looks. One of the honeſt men ſaid, they ſhould all have taken it as an <hi>hugeous</hi> favour, were they allowed to wiſh the Bride joy, tho' at ever ſo great a <hi>diſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Charles ſaid, He was ſure the women would excuſe her this day; and then the men would, in complaiſance to them. We will hope, ſaid he, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all round him, before we leave Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, for one happy dinner together.</p>
               <p>They all got up to bow and courteſy, and looked upon each other; and the men, who are moſt of them freeholders, wiſhed to the Lord for a new election, and that he would come among them. They had no great matter of fault to find, they ſaid, with their preſent repreſentatives: but any-body who would oppoſe Sir Charles Grandiſon, would ſtand no chance. The women joined in the declaration, as if
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1185400106:342"/>
they thought highly, as Sir Charles pleaſantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, of their own influence over their huſbands. They all wondered that he was not in Parliament, till they heard how little a while he had been in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>He took leave of the good people (who, by their behaviour and appearance, did as much credit to their landlords as to themſelves) with his uſual affability and politeneſs; repeating his promiſe of a day of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee, as ſome of them called it.</p>
               <p>The Ball, at the requeſt of the whole company, was opened by the Bride and Bridegroom. She was very uneaſy at the general Call. Sir Charles ſaw ſhe was, and would have taken out Miſs Nedham; but it was not permitted. the dear creature, I believe, did her beſt at the time; but I have ſeen her perform better: Yet ſhe did exceedingly well. But ſuch a figure herſelf, and ſuch a partner; How could ſhe do amiſs?</p>
               <p>Emily was taken out by Beauchamp. He did his beſt, I am ſure; and almoſt as much excelled his pretty partner, as his beloved friend did his.</p>
               <p>Emily, ſitting down by me, aſked if ſhe did not perform very ill. Not <hi>very</hi> ill, my dear, ſaid I; but not ſo well as I have ſeen you dance. I don't know, ſaid ſhe, what ails me: My heart is very heavy. madam. What can be the meaning of it? But don't tell Lady Grandiſon ſo.—High-ho!—Lady Grandiſon! What a ſound is that? A charming ſound! But how ſhall I bring my lips to be famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arized to it?</p>
               <p>You are glad ſhe is married, my love, I dare ſay?</p>
               <p>Glad! To be ſure I am! It is an event that I have long, long wiſhed for: But new names, and new ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, one knows not how to frame one's mouth to preſently. It was ſome time before I could call you
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:1185400106:343"/>
Lady G. But don't you pity poor Lady Clementina, a little, madam?</p>
               <p>A great deal, I do. But as ſhe refuſed my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—</p>
               <p>Ah! dear! that's the thing! I wonder ſhe could—when he would have let her have the free exerciſe of her Religion.</p>
               <p>Had you rather your Guardian had had Lady Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina, Emily?</p>
               <p>O no! How can you aſk me ſuch a queſtion, madam? Of all the women in the world, I wiſhed him to have Miſs Byron. But ſhe is too happy for pity, you know, madam!—Bleſs me! What does ſhe look ſo thoughtful for? Why does ſhe ſigh ſo? Surely ſhe can't be ſorry!</p>
               <p>Sorry! No, my Love! But a change of condition for life! New attachments! A new courſe of life! Her name ſunk, and loſt! The property, perſon and will, of another, excellent as the man is; obliged to go to a new houſe; to be ingrafted into a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; to leave her own, who ſo dearly love her; an <hi>irrevocable</hi> deſtiny!—Do you think, Emily, new in her preſent circumſtances; every eye upon her: it is not enough to make a conſiderate mind, as hers is, thoughtful!</p>
               <p>All theſe are mighty hardſhips, madam! putting up her lip—But, Lady G. can you ſuppoſe ſhe thinks them ſo? If ſhe <hi>does</hi>—But ſhe is a dear good Lady!—I ſhall ever love her! She is an ornament of our Sex! See, how lovely ſhe looks! Did your Ladyſhip ever ſee ſo ſweet a creature? I never did.</p>
               <p>Not for Beauty, Dignity, Eaſe, Figure, Modeſty, good Senſe, did I ever.</p>
               <p>She is my <hi>Guardianeſs,</hi> may I ſay? Is there ſuch a word?—I ſhall be as proud of her, as I am of my Guardian. Yet there is no cauſe of ſighing, I think!—See my Guardian! her Huſband? Unfaſhionable
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1185400106:344"/>
as the word is, it is a pretty word. The <hi>Houſe-band,</hi> that ties all together. Is not <hi>that</hi> the meaning?—Look round! How does he ſurpaſs all men!—<hi>His</hi> Eaſe, talk of Eaſe! <hi>His</hi> Dignity, talk of Dignity! As handſome a man, as ſhe is a woman! See how every young Lady eyes him; every young Gentleman endeavours to imitate him. I wiſh <hi>he</hi> would take me out: I would do better.</p>
               <p>This was the ſubſtance of the whiſpering Dialogue that paſſed between Emily and me—Poor girl!</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby danced with Lucy, and got great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. He was reſolved, he ſaid, to have one dance with the Bride. She beſought him not to think of it. Her grandmamma, her aunt, intreated for her. She deſired Sir Charles to interpoſe—If, my deareſt Life, you <hi>could</hi> oblige your uncle—I cannot, cannot think of it, ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>Lady G. ſaid Sir Charles, be ſo good as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Mr. Selby. I ſtood forth, and offered my hand to him. He could not refuſe it. He did not perform ſo well as he did with Lucy. Go, ſaid I, when we had d ne, ſit down by your Dame, and be quiet: You have loſt all your credit. <hi>You</hi> dance with a Bride!—Some people know not how to bear applauſe; nor to leave off when they are well. Lord L. took out Mrs. Selby. She dances very gracefully. My Lord, you know, is above praiſe. The young Lord Rereſby and Miſs Nedham diſtinguiſhed themſelves. <hi>My</hi> odd creature was in his element. He and Miſs Barclay, and another time he and Emily, did very handſomely; and the girl got up her reputation. Lord W. did hobble, and not ungracefully, with old Mrs. Selby; who had not danced, ſhe ſaid, for twenty years before; but on ſo joyful an occaſion, would not refuſe Lord W's challenge: And both were applauded; the time of life of the Lady, the limpingneſs of my Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:1185400106:345"/>
There was a very plentiful ſideboard, of rich wines, ſweetmeats, &amp;c. We all diſclaimed formal ſupper.</p>
               <p>We went afterwards into country dances. Mrs. Shirley retired about Ten. Harriet took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of attending her; and it was a ſeaſonable relief to her. I had an intimation to attend her. I found her juſt dropt on her knees to her grandmamma; who, with her arms about her neck, was folding to her fond heart the darling of it. The ſweet girl was <hi>ſo</hi> apprehenſive! I was called upon to give my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whether ſhe ſhould return to the company, or not: I gave it, that ſhe ſhould; and that ſhe ſhould only retire, for the night, about Eleven. As to the Bride-maids, I ſaid, I would manage, that they ſhould only attend her to her chamber, and leave her there, with her aunt, Lucy, and me. Lord L. undertook to make the gentlemen give up form; which, he ſaid, they would the more eaſily do, as they were ſet into dancing.</p>
               <p>After all, Lady L. we women, dreſſed out in rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and gaudy trappings, and in Virgin-white, on our Wedding-days, ſeem but like milk-white heifers led to ſacrifice. We ought to be indulged, if we are not ſhameleſs things, and very wrong indeed, in our choice of the man we <hi>can</hi> love.</p>
               <p>We returned to company. The Bridegroom was looking out for us. My deareſt Life, ſaid he, Are you returned?—I thought—There he ſtopt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selby broke from his partner, Miſs Barclay, to whiſk into the figure the Bride. Sir Charles joined the deſerted Lady, who ſeemed much better pleaſed with her new partner than with her old one. Lord W. who was ſitting down, took Mrs. Selby, and led her into the dance.</p>
               <p>I drew Miſs Nedham to the ſideboard, and gave her her cue: She gave theirs to the three other Bride-maids.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:1185400106:346"/>
About Eleven, Mrs. Selby, unobſerved, withdrew with the Bride. The Bride-maids, one by one, waited on her to her chamber; ſaluted her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to company.</p>
               <p>The dear creature wanted preſence of mind. She fell into my reflexion above. O my dear Lady G! ſaid ſhe, was I not right when I declared, that I never would marry, were it not to the man I loved above all the men in the world?</p>
               <p>She complimented me twenty times, with being very good. She prayed for me; but her prayers were meant for herſelf. You remember, that ſhe told me, on my apprehenſiveneſs on the like occaſion, that fear made me loving to her. On her bleſſing me, Ah, Harriet, ſaid I, you now find, that apprehenſion will make one <hi>pious,</hi> as well as <hi>loving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Siſter, my Friend, my own, my Caroline's, my Brother's, <hi>dear</hi> Lady Grandiſon! ſaid I, when I left her, near undreſſed, God bleſs you! And God be praiſed, that I can call you by theſe tender names! My Brother is the happieſt of men; You of women. May we never love each other leſs than we do now. Look forward to the ſerene happineſs of your future lot. If you are the Joy of our Brother, you muſt be our Joy; and the Jewel of our Family.</p>
               <p>She anſwered me only by a fervent embrace, her eyes lifted up, ſurcharged, as I may ſay, with tears of joy, as in thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>I then ruſhed down-ſtairs, and into the company.</p>
               <p>My brother inſtantly addreſſed me—My Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, whiſpered he, with impatience, returns not this night.</p>
               <p>You will ſee Mrs. Selby, I preſume, by-and-by, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I.</p>
               <p>He took his ſeat by old Mrs. Selby, and fell into talk with her, to avoid joining in the dances. His eye was continually turned to the door. Mrs. Selby,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:1185400106:347"/>
at laſt, came in. Her eyes ſhewed the tender leave ſhe had taken of her Harriet.</p>
               <p>My brother approached her. She went out: He followed her. In a quarter of an hour ſhe returned.</p>
               <p>We ſaw my brother no more that night.</p>
               <p>We continued our dancings till between Three and Four.</p>
               <p>I have often obſerved, that we women, whether weakly or robuſt, are hardly ever tired with dancing. It was ſo with us. The men, poor ſouls! looked ſilly, and ſleepy, by two; all but my ape: He has a good many <hi>Femalities,</hi> as uncle Selby calls them. But he was brought up to be idle and uſeleſs, as women generally are.

                  <p>EMILY, Lucy, and I, went to pay our morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-congratulations as ſoon as we aroſe, which was not very early, to my brother, being told that he was in the Cedar parlour, writing. He received us like himſelf. I am writing, ſaid he, a few very ſhort Letters. They are to demand the felicitations, one, of our beloved Caroline; one of our aunt Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon; one of the Earl of G. and one of our dear Dr. Bartlett. There is another; you may read it, Charlotte.</p>
                  <p>That alſo was a ſhort one; to ſignify, according to promiſe, as I found, to Signor Jeronymo della Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta, the actual celebration of his Nuptials. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it—<q rend="inline">'Like my brother,'</q> was all I ſaid. It concluded with a caution, given in the moſt ardent

terms, againſt precipitating the admirable Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.</p>
                  <p>We went up to the Bride. She was dreſſing. Her aunt was with her, and her two couſin Holles's, who went not home the preceding night.</p>
                  <p>The moment we entered, ſhe ran to us; and, claſping her arms about my neck, hid her bluſhing face in my boſom—My deareſt, deareſt Lady G. mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured ſhe—Am I indeed your Siſter, your Siſter Grandiſon? And will you love me as well as ever?</p>
                  <p>My deareſt, lovely Siſter! My own Siſter Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon! My Brother's Wife! Moſt ſincerely do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, Joy, Joy, Joy, to my Harriet!</p>
                  <p>O Lady G! How you raiſe me! Your goodneſs is a ſeaſonable goodneſs to me! I never, never, but by yours and your ſiſter's example, ſhall be worthy of your brother!</p>
                  <p>Then diſengaging herſelf from my arms; Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Lucy, ſaid ſhe, was a happy, happy Day! I have but one, one regret—There is a Lady in the world that deſerves the beſt of men better than your Harriet—And, lifting up her hands and eyes, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and protect her!—She ſhall be the ſubject of my prayers, as often as I pray for myſelf, and for him who is dearer to me than myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Then embracing Emily; Wiſh me Joy, my Love! In <hi>my</hi> Joy ſhall you find <hi>your own!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Emily wept, and even ſobbed—You muſt, you muſt, treat me leſs kindly, madam. I cannot, cannot bear your good—your goodneſs. On my knees I acknowlege my other Guardian. God bleſs my dear, dear Lady Grandiſon!</p>
                  <p>At that moment, as they were folded in each other's arms, entered my brother—He claſped his round his ſweet Bride; pardon this intruſion, ſaid he—Excellent creature, continue to love my Emily!—Continue, my dear Emily, to deſerve the ſiſterly love of my Harriet!</p>

Then turning to me, ſaluting me, My Charlotte loves my Harriet; ſo does our Caroline. She fondly loves you both. God continue your love to each other!

                  <p>He ſaluted Mrs. Selby—My own Aunt Selby! What obligations am I under to you, and to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Mrs. Shirley, for giving to an Angel an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's education, and conferring on <hi>me</hi> the bleſſing!</p>
                  <p>Congratulate me, my dear Couſin Holles's, ſaluting each. May you both be as happy, whenever you alter your ſingle ſtate, as I will endeavour to make your lovely Couſin!</p>
                  <p>He withdrew, bowing to us, and with ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfulneſs to the happy Harriet, as delighted us all.</p>
                  <p>Lucy went down with him, to pay her morning compliments to the two Grandmamma's.</p>
                  <p>Siſter, ſaid Kitty Holles, after he was gone—we never, never, can think of marrying, after we have ſeen Sir Charles Grandiſon, and his behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Lucy came up with Nancy. They embraced their couſin. Your grandmamma and my grandmamma, my deareſt couſin, are impatient to ſee you, in <hi>your</hi> grandmamma's chamber; and the gentlemen are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for their breakfaſts in the great parlour. We hurried down. The Bride threw herſelf at her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma's feet, for her bleſſing. It was given in ſuch a tender and pious manner, that we were all affected by it. The beſt of Sons, of Men, ſaid ſhe, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, has but juſt left me. What a bleſſing to all around him, is a good man! Sir Charles Grandiſon is every-thing. But, my dear Loves, to the younger Ladies, Let a good man, let life, let manners, be the principal motive of your choice: In <hi>goodneſs</hi> will you have every ſanction; and your Fathers, Mothers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:1185400106:350"/>
Friends, every joy! My deareſt Love, my Harriet, taking her hand, there was a time that I thought no man on earth could deſerve you: Now it is my prayer, and will be, that you may deſerve this man. But let us join the gentlemen. Fear not, my Harriet—Sir Charles's character will preſerve with every one its dignity, and give a ſanction to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity that has united you to him. My deareſt Love! be proud, and look aſſured: <hi>You</hi> may, or who can? Yeſterday's tranſaction is your Glory; glory in it, my Harriet!</p>
                  <p>We attended the two elder Ladies down. Harriet, as baſhful people ever do, increaſed her own difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by ſtaying behind with her Lucy. We were all ſeated at the breakfaſt-tables, and ſtaid for them: Mr. Selby grew impatient; every one having declared themſelves ready for breakfaſt. At laſt, down came the bluſhing Bride, with her Lucy. Sir Charles ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Selby's countenance turning peeviſhly arch; juſt as he had begun <q rend="inline">'Let me tell you, Niece,'</q> and was coming out with ſomething, he aroſe, and taking his Bride's hand, led her to her ſeat. Huſh, my dear Mr. Selby, ſaid he; Nobody muſt call to account my Wiſe, and I preſent.—How, Sir! How, Sir! Already have I loſt my Niece?</p>
                  <p>Not ſo, Mr. Selby. All her duties will have ſtrength given them by the happy event of yeſterday: But you muſt not let a new-married man ſee how much eaſier it is to find fault than to be faultleſs.</p>
                  <p>Your ſervant, Sir! replied Mr. Selby—You'll one day pay for your complaiſance, or my Niece is not a woman. But I was ready primed. You have robbed me of a jeſt; and that, let me tell you, would have been more to me than my breakfaſt.</p>
                  <p>After breakfaſt, Lucy gave us a leſſon on the harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord. Sir Charles accompanied her finger, at the deſire of the company.</p>
                  <p>Lord and Lady W. excuſed themſelves to breakfaſt,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:1185400106:351"/>
but came to dinner. We entertained one another with reports of what paſſed yeſterday; what people ſaid; how the tenants feaſt was managed; how the populace behaved at the houſes which were kept open. The Churchwardens Liſt was produced of the Poor recommended by them: It amounted to upwards of 140, divided into two claſſes; one of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged poor, the other of poor houſekeepers and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring people who were aſhamed to apply; but to whom the Churchwardens knew bounty would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. There were above thirty of theſe, to whom Sir Charles gave very handſomely, but we knew not what. The Churchwardens, who are known to be good men, went away bleſſing him, with hearts run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over at their lips, as if they themſelves were to find their account in his goodneſs.</p>

                  <p>WE have had a ſmart debate this morning, on the natural independency of our Sex, and the uſurpation of the other. Particulars by-and-by.</p>
                  <p>My brother is an irreſiſtable man. To-morrow he has carried it to make his appearance at Church, againſt all their firſt intentions, and that by their own conſents. He had conſidered every-thing: They had not. Mr. Beauchamp has Letters which require him to go up to town: Lord and Lady W. are deſirous to get thither; my Lord having ſome gouty warnings: I am obliged to go up; having hated to ſet about any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preparatory to your caſe, Caroline! [If the wretch were to come in my way juſt now, I ſhould throw my ſtandiſh at him, I believe.] The Earl and Lady Gertrude are in town; and I am afraid of another reprimand. The Earl never jeſts but he means the ſame as if he were ſerious. I ſhall take Emily with me, when I go. Mrs. Reeves wants to be with her little boy. Yet all theſe people are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to credit the appearance.—I had like to have forgot your good man—He longs to ſee his Caroline;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:1185400106:352"/>
and hopes to engage my brother to ſtand in perſon as his urchin's ſponſor. So you ſee that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to conſent to make the appearance to-morrow, or the Bride will loſe the flower of her company.</p>
                  <p>On Monday it ſtands determined, that Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, Mr. Beauchamp, Emily, Lord L. Lord and Lady W. myſelf, and Lord G. will ſet out for London.</p>
                  <p>God continue the happineſs of this charming Pair! Their behaviour to each other is juſt what I would wiſh it to be; tender, affectionate, without fulſome fondneſs, He cannot be more reſpectful to the dear creature now, than he was before marriage: But from his preſent behaviour, I dare anſwer for him, that he will not be leſs ſo: And yet he is ſo lively, that he has all the <hi>young man</hi> in his behaviour, whenever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions call for relaxation; even when ſubjects require ſeriouſneſs, as they do ſometimes, in converſations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Mr. Deane, and him; his ſeriouſneſs, as Mrs. Shirley herſelf finely obſerved in his abſence, is attended with ſuch vivacity, and intermingled with ſuch entertaining illuſtrations, all naturally ariſing from and falling into the ſubject, that he is ſure of every one's attention and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The features of his manly face, and the turn of his fine eye, obſerved ſhe, on another occaſion, are <hi>caſt</hi> for pity, and not for cenſure. And let me add a ſpeech of his, when he was called upon to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a perſon, on a ſlight repreſentation of facts. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The whole matter is not before us, ſaid he: We know not what motives he may have to plead by way of extenuation, tho' he may not be able en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to excuſe himſelf. But, as it appears to me, I would not have done ſo.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what, my dear, am I about? Are they not my brother's praiſes that I am expatiating upon? Was I ever to be truſted with that ſubject? Is there no man, I have been aſked, that is like your brother?—He, I have anſwered, is moſt likely to reſemble him, who
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1185400106:353"/>
has an unbounded charity, and univerſal benevolence, to men of all profeſſions; and who imitating the Divinity, regards the heart, rather than the head, and much more than either rank or fortune, tho' it were princely; and yet is not a leveller, but thinks that rank or degree intitles a man who is not utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of both, to reſpect.</p>
                  <p>I will write one more Letter, and then give way to other affairs. I never thought I ſhould have been ſuch a ſcribbler. But the correſpondence between my Brother and Dr. Bartlett, into which we were all ſo eager to peep; that of this dear creature with her Lucy, which ſo much entertained us, and which led us, in her abſence, to wiſh to continue the ſeries of it; the ſtory of Clementina ſo intereſting; all our ſuſpenſes ſo affecting, and the ſtate of this our lovely friend's heart ſo peculiar; and the taſk removed from you to me, of promoting and contributing to the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: All theſe, together, led me on. But now one Letter more ſhall conclude my taſk.</p>
                  <p>Lord L. has juſt now mentioned to my brother his wiſhes that he would ſtand Godfather to the little Lord. My brother caught his hand, and beſought his pardon for not offering <hi>himſelf.</hi> You do me, my dear Lord, ſaid he, both honour and pleaſure. Where was my thought? But this dear creature, turning to his Bride, will be ſo good as to remind me of all my imperfections. I am in a way to mend; for the duties inſeparable from my delightful new engagement will ſtrengthen all my other duties.</p>
                  <p>I have taken upon me, Sir, ſaid ſhe, to requeſt the favour of my Lord and Lady L's acceptance of me for a Godmother.</p>
                  <p>To which I have objections, ſaid I. I have a prior claim. Aunt Eleanor has put in hers, Lady W. hers, and this before Miſs Byron was <hi>Lady Grandiſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your circumſtance, my dear Lady G. according to a general obſervation of our Sex, is prohibitory.</p>

                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:1185400106:354"/>
Will you, my brother, appealed I, allow of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſervances, prognoſtics, omens, dreams?</p>
                  <p>O no! My Harriet has been telling me how much ſhe ſuffered lately from a dream, which ſhe permitted to give ſtrength and terror to her apprehenſions from Mr. Greville. Guard, my dear Ladies, againſt theſe imbecillities of tender minds. In theſe inſtances, if in no other, will you give a ſuperiority to our Sex, which, in the debate of this morning, my Charlotte would not allow of.</p>
                  <p>I will begin my next Letter with an account of this debate; and if I cannot compriſe it in the compaſs I intend to bring it into, my one more Letter may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſtretch into two.</p>

               <p>THE debate I mentioned, began on Friday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at breakfaſt-time; brought on by ſome of uncle Selby's good-natured particularities; for he will always have ſomething to ſay againſt women. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke my brother's neutrality, and declared I would enter the liſts with Mr. Selby, and allow all the other men preſent to be of his ſide. I had a flow of ſpirits. Man's uſurpation, and woman's natural independency, was the topic. I carried on my argument very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly: Now-and-then a ſly hint, popt out by my brother, half-diſconcerted me; but I called him to order, and he was ſilent: Yet once he had like to have put me out—Wrapping his arms about himſelf, with inimitable humour—O my Charlotte, ſaid he, how I love my country; ENGLAND is the <hi>only</hi> ſpot in the world, in which this argument <hi>can</hi> be properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated!—Very ſly—Was it not?</p>
               <p>I made nothing of Mr. Selby. I called him the tyrant of the family. And as little of Mr. Deane,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:1185400106:355"/>
Lord L. and ſtill leſs of my own Lord, who was as eager in the debate as if it concerned him more than any-body to reſiſt me; and this before my brother; who by his eyes, more than once, ſeemed to challenge me, becauſe of the ſorry creature's earneſtneſs. All thoſe, however, were men of ſtraw with me; and I thought myſelf very near making Mr. Selby aſk par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Dame for his thirty years uſurpation. In ſhort, I had half-eſtabliſhed our Sex's ſuperiority on the ruin of that of the ſorry fellows, when the debate was cloſed, and referred to Mrs. Shirley, as mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratrix; my brother ſtill excluded any ſhare in it.—She indeed obliged me to lower my topſails a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I think, ſaid the venerable Lady, women are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally too much conſidered as a ſpecies apart. To be ſure, in the duties and affairs of life, where they have different or oppoſite ſhares allotted them by Providence, they ought not to go out of their own ſphere, or invade the mens province, any more than the men theirs. Nay, I am ſo much of this opinion, that tho' I think the confidence which ſome men place in their wives, in committing all their affairs to their care, very flattering to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion both of their integrity and capacity; yet I ſhould not chooſe (and that not out of lazineſs to avoid the trouble) to interfere with the management without doors, which I think more properly the man's province, unleſs in ſome particular caſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'But in common intercourſe and converſation, why are we to be perpetually conſidering the <hi>Sex</hi> of the perſon we are talking to? Why muſt women always be addreſſed in an appropriated language; and not treated on the common footing of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures? And why muſt they, from a falſe notion of modeſty, be afraid of ſhewing themſelves to <hi>be ſuch,</hi>and affect a childiſh ignorance?</q> 
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I do not mean, that I would have women enter into learned diſputes, for which they are rarely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1185400106:356"/>
But I think there is a degree of knowlege very compatible with their duties; therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming them, and neceſſary to make them fit companions for men of ſenſe: A character in which they will always be found more uſeful than that of a plaything, the amuſement of an idle hour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'No perſon of ſenſe, man or woman, will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to launch out on a ſubject with which they are not well acquainted. The <hi>leſſer</hi> degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege will give place to the <hi>greater.</hi> This will ſecure ſubordination enough. For the advantages of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which men muſt neceſſarily have over wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if they have made the proper uſe of them, will have ſet them ſo forward on the race, that we can never overtake them. But then don't let them deſpiſe us for this, as if their ſuperiority were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely founded on a natural difference of capacity! Deſpiſe us <hi>as</hi> women, and value themſelves merely <hi>as</hi> men: For it is not the hat or cap which covers the head, that decides of the merit of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'In the general courſe of the things of this world, women have not opportunities of ſounding the depths of ſcience, or of acquainting themſelves perfectly with polite literature: But this want of opportunity is not entirely confined to <hi>them.</hi> There are profeſſions among the men no more favourable to theſe ſtudies, than the common avocations of women. For example; merchants, whoſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is (and perhaps <hi>more</hi> uſefully, as to public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) chained down to their accounts. Officers, both of land and ſea, are ſeldom much better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, tho' they may perhaps, paſs through a few more forms: And as for knowlege of the world, women of a certain rank have an equal title to it with ſome of them. A learned man, as he is called, who ſhould deſpiſe a ſenſible one of theſe profeſſions, and diſdain to converſe with him, would paſs for a pedant; and why not for deſpiſing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1185400106:357"/>
or undervaluing a woman of ſenſe, who may be put on the ſame footing? Men, in common converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have laid it down for a rule of good breeding, not to talk before women of things they don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; by which means, an opportunity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is loſt; a very good one too; one that has been approved by the ableſt perſons who have written on the education of children, becauſe it is a means of learning inſenſibly, without the appearance of a taſk. Common ſubjects afford only common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and are ſoon exhauſted: Why, then, ſhould converſation be confined to ſuch narrow limits, and be liable to continual repetition; when, if people would ſtart leſs beaten ſubjects, many doubts and difficulties concerning them might be cleared up, and they would acquire a more ſettled opinion of things (which is what the generality much want, from an indolence that hinders them from examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) at the ſame time that they would be better entertained, than with talking of the weather, and ſuch kind of inſipidities.'</q>

               <p>Lady W. applauding Mrs. Shirley's ſentiments, Apropos, ſaid ſhe; let me read you the ſpeech (taking it out of her Pocket-book) of an Eaſt-India officer, to a pedant, who had been diſplaying his talents, and running over with terms of art, and ſcraps of Latin, mingled with a profuſion of hard words, that hardly any of the company underſtood; and which, at the ſame time that it diverted all preſent, cured the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſcholar of his affectation for ever after.

               </p>
               <p>A very good rebuke of affectation, ſaid Sir Charles (and your Ladyſhip hints it was an efficacious one). It ſerves to ſhew, that men, in their different attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be <hi>equally</hi> uſeful; in other words, that the knowlege of polite literature leads not to <hi>every</hi> part of uſeful ſcience. I remember, that my Harriet diſtinguiſhes very properly, in ſome of her Letters to her Lucy, between <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Science;</hi> and that poor Mr. Walden (that I think was his name) was pretty much diſconcerted, as a pedant may ſometimes be, when (and he bowed to his Harriet) he has a <hi>natural genius</hi> to contend with. She bluſhed, and bowed as ſhe ſat—And I remember, Sir, ſaid ſhe, you promiſed to give me your animadverſions on the Letters I conſented you ſhould ſee: Will you be pleaſed to correct me, now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Correct</hi> you, my deareſt Life!—What a word is that? I remember, that, in the converſation in which you were obliged, againſt your will, to bear ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part, you demonſtrated, that genius, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deep learning, made a much more ſhining figure in converſation, than learning without genius: But, upon the whole, I was a little apprehenſive, that true learning might ſuffer, if languages were too ſlightly treated. Mr. Walden made one good obſervation, or rather remembred it, for it was long ago made, and will be always of weight, that the knowlege of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1185400106:359"/>
any more than the advantage of birth, was never thought lightly of by thoſe who had pretenſions to either. The knowlege of the Latin language, in particular, let me ſay, is of ſingular uſe in the maſtery of every ſcience.</p>
               <p>There are who aver, that men of parts have no occaſion for learning: But, ſurely, our Shakeſpeare himſelf, one of the greateſt genius's of any country or age (who, however, is an adept in the ſuperior learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the knowlege of nature) would not have been a ſufferer, had he had that greater ſhare of human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is denied him by ſome critics.</p>
               <p>But, Sir Charles, ſaid Mr. Deane, don't you think that Shakeſpeare, who lived before the great Milton, has an eaſier, pleaſanter, and more intelligible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing, than Milton? If ſo, may it not be owing to Milton's greater learning, that Shakeſpeare has the advantage of that immortal poet in perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity?</p>
               <p>Is the fact certain, my dear Mr. Deane, that Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wants perſpicuity? I have been bold enough ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to think, that he makes a greater diſplay of his reading, than was quite neceſſary to his unbounded ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But the age in which Shakeſpeare flouriſhed, might be called, The age of Engliſh Learning, as well as of Engliſh Bravery. The Queen and her court, the very Ladies of it, were more learned than any court of our Engliſh Sovereigns was before, or hath been ſince. What a prodigy of learning, in the ſhort reign of Edward the VIth, was the Lady Jane Grey!—Greek, as well as Latin, was familiar to her: So it was to Queen Elizabeth. And can it be ſuppoſed, that the natural genius's of thoſe Ladies were more confined, or limited, for their knowlege of Latin and Greek? Milton, tho' a little nearer us, lived in harſher and more tumultuous times.</p>
               <p>O, Sir! ſaid Harriet, then I find I was a very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent creature in the converſation to which you refer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:1185400106:360"/>
Not ſo, my deareſt Love!—Mr. Walden, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſays, that learning in that aſſembly was not brought before a fair tribunal. He ſhould have known, that it had not a competent advocate in him.</p>
               <p>But, Sir Charles, ſaid Mr. Beachamp, I cannot but obſerve, that too much ſtreſs is laid upon Learning, as it is called, by thoſe who have pretenſions to it. You will not always find, that a ſcholar is a more happy man than an unlearned one. He has not <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> more prudence, more wiſdom, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his affairs.</p>
               <p>What, my dear Beauchamp, is this ſaying, but that there is great difference between theory and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? This obſervation comes very generouſly, and, with regard to the Ladies, very gallantly, from you, who are a learned man: But as you are alſo a very prudent man, let me aſk you, Do you think you have the leſs prudence for your learning? If <hi>not,</hi> Is not learning a valuable <hi>addition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But pray, Sir Charles, ſaid Mrs. Selby, let me aſk your opinion: Do you think, that if women had the ſame opportunities, the ſame education, as men, they would not equal them, in their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>Women, my dear Mrs. Selby, are women ſooner than men are men. They have not, therefore, <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> the learning-time that men have, if they had equal genius's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'If</hi> they had equal genius's,' brother. Very well. My dear Siſter Harriet, you ſee you have given your hand to one of the Lords of the creation!—Vaſſal! bow to your Sovereign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Ch.</hi> My deareſt Love, take not the advice without the example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lady G.</hi> Your ſervant, Sir. Well, but let me aſk you, Do you think that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of the one Sex? A natural ſuperiority in thoſe of the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:1185400106:361"/>
                  <hi>Sir Ch.</hi> Who will anſwer this queſtion for me?</p>
               <p>Not I, ſaid Lord L. Not I, ſaid Mr. Deane. Not I, ſaid Mr. Beauchamp.</p>
               <p>Then I have fairly taken you in—You would, if you could, anſwer it in the Ladies favour: This is the ſame as a confeſſion. I may therefore the more boldly pronounce, that, generally ſpeaking, I have no doubt but there is.</p>
               <p>Help me, dear Ladies, ſaid I, to fight this battle out. You ſay, Sr, you have no doubt that there is a natural inferiority in the faculties of us, poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; a natural ſuperiority in you, imperial men.</p>
               <p>Generally ſpeaking, Charlotte. Not individually <hi>you</hi> Ladies, and <hi>us</hi> men: I believe all we who are preſent, ſhall be ready to ſubſcribe to your ſuperiority, Ladies.</p>
               <p>I believe, brother, you fib: But let that paſs.</p>
               <p>Thank you, madam. It is for <hi>my</hi> advantage that it ſhould; and perhaps for <hi>yours,</hi> ſmiling—There is a difference, pardon me, Ladies, we are ſpeaking <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> in the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> in the <hi>temperament,</hi> of the two Sexes, that gives to the one advantages which it denies to the other: But we may not too cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this ſubject; tho' the reſult, I am apt to believe, would put the matter out of diſpute. Let us be more at large: Why has nature made a difference in the beauty, proportion, and ſymmetry, in the <hi>perſons</hi> of the two Sexes? Why gave it delicacy, ſoftneſs, grace, to that of the woman—as in the Ladies befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me; ſtrength, firmneſs, to men; a capacity to bear labour and fatigue; and courage, to protect the other? Why gave it a diſtinction, both in qualities and plumage, to the different ſexes of the feathered race? Why in the courage of the male and female animals?—The ſurly bull, the meek, the beneficent, cow, for one inſtance?</p>
               <p>We looked upon one another.</p>
               <p>There are exceptions to general rules, proceeded he.

Mrs. Shirley ſurpaſſes all the men I ever knew, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—Mrs. Selby and Lady G.—</p>
               <p>What of us, brother! What of us—to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your argument?</p>
               <p>Heroic Charlotte!—You are both very happily mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried—The men the women, the women the men, you can mutually aſſiſt and improve each other. But ſtill—</p>
               <p>Your ſervant, brother, interrupted I.—Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Sir Charles, ſaid Mrs. Selby—And <hi>I</hi> ſay, Your ſervant too, ſaid Mr. Selby.</p>
               <p>Who ſees not that my ſiſter Charlotte is ready to diſclaim the competition in fact, tho' not in words? Can there be characters more odious than thoſe of a maſculine woman, and an effeminate man? What are the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of the two Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? And whence this odiouſneſs? There are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>men,</hi> whoſe minds, if I may be allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſeem to be caſt in a Female mould; whence the fops, foplings, and pretty fellows, who buz about your Sex at public places; <hi>women,</hi> whoſe minds ſeem to be caſt in a maſculine one; whence your Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velts, my dear, and moſt of the women who, at ſuch places, give the men ſtare for ſtare, ſwing their arms, look jolly; and thoſe married women who are ſo kind as to take the reins out of their huſbands hands, in order to ſave the honeſt men trouble.</p>
               <p>Your ſervant, Sir—Your ſervant, Sir—And ſome of them looked as if they had ſaid, You cannot mean me, I hope; and thoſe who ſpoke not, bowed and ſmiled thanks for his compliment to one fourth of the Sex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My</hi> Lord inſultingly rubbed his hands for joy; Mr. Selby crowed; the other men ſlily ſmiled, tho' they were afraid of giving a more open approbation.</p>
               <p>O my Siſter! ſaid I, taking Harriet's hand, we women are mere Nothings—We are nothing at all!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:1185400106:363"/>
How, my Charlotte! Make you no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being Every-thing and Nothing?</p>
               <p>Were it not, my dear Ladies, proceeded he, for male protectors, to what inſults, to what outrages, would not your Sex be ſubject? Pardon me, my deareſt Love, if I ſtrengthen my argument by your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, bowing to his Harriet. Is not the dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our good Mrs. Shirley's own Daughter? All the feminine graces are here. She is, in my notion, what all women ſhould be—But wants ſhe not a protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Even a dream, a reſverie—</p>
               <p>O Sir, ſpare me, ſpare me! ſweetly bluſhing, ſaid the lovely Harriet. I own I ſhould have made a very ſilly, a very puſilanimous man! It is not long ſince, you know, Lady G. that I brought this very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of—</p>
               <p>Huſh, Harriet! You will give up the Female cauſe.</p>
               <p>That is not fair, Charlotte, rejoined my brother; you ſhould not intercept the convictions of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous mind—But I <hi>will</hi> ſpare my Harriet, if ſhe will endeavour, for her own ſake, to let nothing diſturb her for the future but <hi>realities,</hi> and not any of <hi>theſe</hi> long, if they are inevitable ones.</p>
               <p>But pray, Sir, ſaid I, proceed in your argument, if you have any more to ſay.</p>
               <p>O Charlotte! I have enough to ſay, to ſilence all your oppoſition, were I to give this ſubject its due weight. But we are only, for pleaſantry-ſake, ſkim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over the ſurface of the argument. Weaker powers are given generally for weaker purpoſes, in the oeconomy of Providence. I, for my part, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, diſapprove not of our venerable Mrs. Shirley's obſervation; That we are apt to conſider the Sex <hi>too much</hi> as a ſpecies apart: Yet it is my opinion that both God and Nature have deſigned a very app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1185400106:364"/>
beauties of their perſons. Were it not ſo, their offices would be confounded, and the women would not perhaps ſo readily ſubmit to thoſe domeſtic ones in which it is their province to ſhine, and the men would be allotted the diſtaff, or the needle; and you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Ladies, would be the firſt to deſpiſe ſuch. I, for my part, would only contend, that we men ſhould have power and right given us to protect and ſerve your Sex; that we ſhould purchaſe and build for them; travel and toil for them; run through, at the call of Providence, or of our King and Country, dangers and difficulties; and, at laſt, lay all our tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, all our acquirements, at your feet; enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the conſcience of duty done, and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance.</p>
               <p>We were all of us again his humble ſervants. It was in vain to argue the tyranny of ſome huſbands, when he could turn upon us the follies of ſome wives; and that wives and daughters were never more faulty, more undomeſtic, than at preſent; and when we were before a judge, that, tho' he could not be abſolutely unpolite, would not flatter us, nor ſpare our foibles.</p>
               <p>However, if ſtuck a little with Harriet, that ſhe had given Cauſe to Sir Charles, in the diſpute which ſhe formerly bore a part in, relating to learning and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, to think her more lively than ſhe ought to be, and had ſpoken too lightly of languages. She ſweetly bluſhing, like a young wife ſolicitous for the good opinion of the Beloved of her heart, revived that cauſe.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke very highly in her praiſe, upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; owned, that the Letters he had been favoured with the ſight of, had given him deeper impreſſions in her favour, than even her Beauty: Hoped for farther communications; applauded her for her principles, and her inoffenſive vivacity—That ſweet, that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent vivacity, and noble frankneſs of heart, ſaid he,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:1185400106:365"/>
taking her hand, which I hope you will never think of reſtraining.</p>
               <p>As to the converſation you ſpeak of, proceeded he, I repeat, that I <hi>was</hi> apprehenſive, when I read it, that languages were ſpoken of in it ſlightly; and yet, perhaps, I am miſtaken. You, my Beauchamp, I think, if my deareſt Life will oblige us both by the communication, and <hi>chooſes</hi> to do ſo (for that muſt be the condition on which all her goodneſs to us muſt be expected) ſhall be judge between us: You know, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I, what ſtories of unexhauſted knowledge lie in the works of thoſe great Antients, which ſuffered in the hands of poor Mr. Walden: You know what the paſt and preſent ages have owed, and what all future will owe, to <hi>Homer, Ariſtotle, Virgil, Cicero:</hi> You can take in the neceſſity there is of reſtraining inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and preſerving old rules and inſtitutions, and of employing the youth of our Sex, who would otherwiſe be much worſe employed (as we ſee in thoſe who neglect their ſtudies) in the attainment of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that can convey to them ſuch lights in every ſcience: Tho' it were to be wiſhed, that morals ſhould take up more of the learner's attention than they generally do. You know, that the trueſt parts of learning are to be found in the Roman and Greek writers; and you know, that tranſlation (were every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy our notice tranſlated) cannot convey thoſe beauties which ſcholars only can reliſh; and which learned foreigners, if a man travels, will expect ſhould not have eſcaped his obſervation. As to the Ladies, Mrs. Shirley, has admirably obſerved, that there is a degree of knowledge very compatible with their duties (Condeſcending excellence! bowing to Mrs. Shirley) and highly becoming them; ſuch as will make them rejoice, and, I will add, improve a man of ſenſe, ſweeten his manners, and render him a much more ſociable, a much more amiable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:1185400106:366"/>
and, of conſequence, greatly more happy in himſelf, than otherwiſe he would be from books and ſolitude.</p>
               <p>Well but, brother, you ſaid juſt now, that we were only, for pleaſantry-ſake, ſkimming over the ſurface of the argument; and that you had enough to ſay to ſilence all my oppoſition, were you to give the ſubject its due weight. I do aſſure you, that, to ſilence all my oppoſition, you muſt have a vaſt deal more to ſay, than you have ſaid hitherto; and yet you have thrown in ſome hints which ſtick with me, tho' you have concluded with ſome magnificent intimations of ſuperiority over us—Power and right to protect, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, toil for us, and lay your trophies at our feet, and-ſo-forth—Surely, ſurely, this is diminiſhing us, and exalting yourſelves, by laying us under high ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to your generoſity. Pray, Sir, let us have, if you pleaſe, one or two intimation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thoſe weightier arguments, that could, as you fancy, ſilence your Charlotte's oppoſition. I ſay, that we women, were our education the ſame—You know what I would be at—Your <hi>weightier</hi> arguments, if you pleaſe—or a ſpecimen only <hi>on paſſant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſing, my Charlotte, that all human ſouls are, in themſelves, equal; yet the very deſign of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent machines in which they are incloſed, is to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induce a temporary difference on their original equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; a difference adapted to the different purpoſes for which they are deſigned by Providence in the preſent tranſitory ſtate. When thoſe purpoſes are at an end, this difference will be at an end too. When Sex ceaſes, inequality of Souls will ceaſe; and women will certainly be on a foot with men, as to intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, in Heaven. There, indeed, will you no longer have <hi>Lords</hi> over you: neither will you have <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:</hi> Which, in <hi>your</hi> preſent eſtimate of things, will perhaps balance the account. In the mean time, if you can ſee any occaſions that may call for ſtronger
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1185400106:367"/>
underſtandings in male life, than in your own; you, at the ſame time, fee an argument to acquieſce in a perſuaſion of a preſent inequality between the two Sexe. You know, I have allowed exceptions. Will you, Charlotte, compliment yourſelf with being one?</p>
               <p>Now, brother, I feel, methinks, that you are a little hard upon Charlotte: But, Ladies, you ſee how the matter ſtands.—You are all ſilent.—But, Sir, you graciouſly allow, that there <hi>is</hi> a degree of knowledge which is very compatible with the DUTIES of us women, and highly <hi>becoming</hi> us: will you have the goodneſs to point out to us what this compatible learning is, that we may not miſtake—and ſo become excentric, as I may ſay, burſt out orb, and do more miſchief than ever we could do good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Could</hi> I point out the boundaries, Charlotte, it might not to <hi>ſome</hi> ſpirits be ſo proper: The limit might be treated as the one prohibited tree in the garden. But let me ſay, That genius, whether in man or woman, will puſh itſelf into light. If it has a laudable tendency, let it, as a ray of the Divinity, be encouraged, as well in the one Sex as in the other: I would not, by any means, have it limited: A little knowledge leads to vanity and conceit. I would only, methinks, have a Parent, a Governor, a Preceptor, bend his ſtrength to reſtrain its foibles; but not throw ſo much cold water upon the ſacred flame as ſhould quench it; ſince, if he did, ſtupidity, at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, might take place of the emanation, and the perſon might be miſerable for life.</p>
               <p>Well, then, we muſt <hi>compromiſe,</hi> I think, ſaid I: But, on recollection, I thought I had injoined you, Sir Charles, to the obſervance of neutrality. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, whiſpered I, we are only, after all, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as far as I can find, in this temporary ſtate, like tame doves, to go about houſe, and-ſe-forth, as Biddy ſays, in the play.</p>

               <p>MY dear Lady G. inſiſts upon my writing to your Ladyſhip an account of the appearance which the lovelieſt Couple in England made this day at Church.</p>
               <p>We all thought nothing could have added to the charms of our Harriet's perſon; but yet her dreſs and jewels did. I ſighed, from pride for the honour of Female Beauty, to <hi>think</hi> they did. Can my dear Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, thought I, exquiſitely lovely as ſhe is in any dreſs, be ornamented by richer ſilks than common, by coſtly laces, by jewels? Can dreſs add grace to that admirable proportion, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe fine features, to which no painter yet has ever done juſtice, tho' every family related to her has a picture of her, drawn by a different hand of eminence?</p>
               <p>We admired the Bridegroom as much as we did her, when, (before we could have thought he had been half ready) he joined Mrs. Shirley, my Aunt Selby, and me, in the great Parlour, completely dreſſed. But what we moſt admired in him was, that native dignity and eaſe, and that inattentiveneſs to his own figure and appearance, which demonſtrate the truly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine gentleman, accuſtomed, as he is, to be always elegant.</p>
               <p>When his Lady preſented herſelf to him, and to us,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:1185400106:369"/>
in all her glory, how did the dear creature dazle us! We involuntarily aroſe, as if to pay our homage to her. Sir Charles approached her with rather an air of greater freedom than uſual, as if he conſidered not the dreſs, as having added to the value he has for her: Yet, Lovelieſt of women, he called her; and taking her hand, preſented her to her grandmamma: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and again bleſs, my Angel, ſaid he, beſt of Parents!—How lovely! But what is even all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing lovelineſs to the graces of her mind? They riſe upon me every hour. She hardly opens her lips, but I find reaſon to bleſs God, and bleſs you both, my dear Ladies: For God and you have given her goodneſs.—My deareſt Life, allow me to ſay, that this ſweet perſon, which will be your firſt perfection in every ſtranger's eye, is but a ſecond in mine.</p>
               <p>Inſtruct me, Sir, ſaid ſhe, baſhfully, bowing her face upon his hand, as he held hers, to <hi>deſerve</hi> your Love, by improving the mind you have the goodneſs to prefer; and no creature was ever on earth ſo happy as I ſhall be.</p>
               <p>My dear Daughter, ſaid her delighted grandmother, you ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can hardly bare your goodneſs, Sir. You muſt blame her for ſomething, to keep down her pride.</p>
               <p>My Harriet, replied he, cannot be proud of what the ſilkworm can do for her, or of the jeweller's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: But now you call upon me, madam, I will tax her with a real fault. I open all my heart to her, as ſubjects occaſionally offer: I want her to have a will, and to let me know it. The frankeſt of all Female hearts will not treat me with that ſweet familiarity which baniſhes diſtance. You ſee, my deareſt Love, that I chide you before your parental friends, and your Lucy.</p>
               <p>It is your own fault, Sir: Indeed it is. You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me in all my wiſhes. Awe will mingle with the Love of perſons who are under perpetual obligation.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:1185400106:370"/>
My dear two mamma's, you muſt not blame <hi>me;</hi> you muſt blame Sir Charles: He takes away, by his goodneſs, even the <hi>power</hi> of making ſuitable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legements, and then complains I do not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>My uncle Selby came in. He ſtood looking upon my couſin, for a few moments, in ſilence; then broke out, Sir Charles Grandiſon, you may indeed boaſt, that you have for a Wife the <hi>Flower of the Britiſh world,</hi> as you once called her: And, let me tell you, Niece, you have for a Husband the nobleſt and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanteſt of men. Happy, happy Pair! ſay I. My dear Mr. Deane, ſaid he, who juſt then entered, if you will keep me in countenance, I will venture to ſalute that charming creature.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles preſented his Bride to them both. With a bent knee ſhe received their ſalutes. At that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came in the three Lords, who followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Lord W. called her Angel—Sir Charles looked delighted with the praiſes of his Bride.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the company being come, we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to church.</p>
               <p>We were early; but the Church was crouded. How were the charming Couple admired on their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, and as they walked to their pew! Never did my Couſin <hi>herſelf</hi> look ſo lovely! How charmingly looked the Bridegroom! But he forgot not that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deportment, full of reverence for the place, and the Divine Offices, which ſeemed to make him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the time to that ſplendor and beauty which took every eye <hi>out of</hi> our own pew. His example was enough to give a proper behaviour, had it been needful, to every one <hi>in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould have told your Ladyſhip, that Mr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville had ſent, ever-night, a ſullenly-complaiſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to my aunt, in writing, importing, that as he heard the Bride would make her appearance on the morrow, the Bride-men and maids, if it broke not into our Ceremonial, would accept of his pew, which
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1185400106:371"/>
is over-againſt ours, for the <hi>look</hi> of the thing, he ſaid; tho' he could not promiſe but he ſhould all the day curſe the occaſion. By this we found, he was not gone to Lady Frampton's, as he had deſigned. His of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer was thankfully accepted.</p>
               <p>There was a great concourſe of the genteeleſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there. Every-body, men and women, looked delighted on the occaſion. The humility of the Bride was tried, by the reſpects paid her between the offices, by all who had ever been in her company. They ſhould have reined in their own pride; for it was to <hi>that,</hi> as much as to reſpect to her, I doubt not, that their notice was owing. She looked conſcious, baſhful; <hi>ſly,</hi> I told her afterwards. She hates the word: But, as I ſaid, ſhe ſhould not have given the idea, that made no other word ſo proper to expreſs it, and which muſt be more obſervable in <hi>her</hi> generally open free countenance, than in that of any other. She more than once ſaw devoirs paid her by a <hi>leer,</hi> when her ſweet face was ſo diſpoſed, that, had ſhe <hi>not</hi> returned the compliment, it might have paſſed that ſhe had not ſeen them. But what an Inſenſible muſt have been my couſin, had ſhe not been proud of being Lady Grandiſon! She is not quite an Angel, yet: She has a few <hi>Femalities,</hi> as my uncle whimſically calls our little foibles. So, perhaps, ſhe <hi>ſhould.</hi> But nobody ſaw the leaſt defect in your brother. His dreſs moſt charmingly became him; and when he looked upon his Bride, his eyes were fixed on her eyes, with ſuch a ſweet benignity and complaiſance, as if he ſaw her mind through them, and could not ſpare a glance to her ornaments: Yet by his own dreſs he ſhewed, that he was not Stoical non-conformiſt to the faſhion of the world. But the politeneſs and reſpect with which he treated her, did them both credit, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit (as Lady G. obſerved) to the whole Sex, Such unaffected tenderneſs in his reſpect; and known to be ſo brave, ſo good a man!—O my dear Lady L. what

an admirable man is your brother! What a happy creature is my Harriet!</p>
               <p>When Divine Service was over, I was afraid our Proceſſion, as I may call it, would have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the compliments of ſome of the gentry of our acquaintance, whoſe opened pew-doors ſhewed their readineſs to addreſs them: But all paſſed in ſilent reſpects from Gentlemen and Ladie. My couſin, when ſhe came home, rejoiced that one of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rading times was over: But when, my deareſt Love, ſaid Sir Charles, will the time be paſt, that all who ſee you will admire you?</p>
               <p>The Church in the afternoon was ſtill more crouded than before. How were Sir Charles and my uncle bleſſed by the poor, and people of low degree, for their well-diſpenſed bounty to them!</p>
               <p>My couſin has delighted Mrs. Shirly, by telling her, that Sir Charles had ſaid there would be a Rite wanting, till he and ſhe had communicated, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the Church, at the Altar, on this particular occaſion.</p>
               <p>Juſt now is every-thing ſettled that Sir Charles wiſhed to be ſettled. Lady G. will acquaint you with particulars, I doubt not.</p>
               <p>Permit me to commend myſelf to your Ladyſhip's favours, as one of the</p>

                     <hi>P. S.</hi> Lady G. has half broke my heart.</p>
                  <p>On peruſal of what I have written, ſhe ſays, I have not done my beſt: I have not given half particulars enough.—In ſhort, ſhe finds a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of faults with me—Even calls me names, <hi>Sorry girl, lazy,</hi> and I can't tell what.</p>
                  <p>But do you, madam, acquit me, and I ſhall be eaſy.</p>

I told her, that I thought I had been very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.</p>
                  <p>What! to a lying-in-woman, ſhe ſays, who has no variety before her! All one dull chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene, hourly acted over again—The ſubject <hi>ſo</hi> rich!</p>
                  <p>I anſwered, It ſhould then have had the richeſt pen!—Why did ſhe not write <hi>herſelf?</hi> If it was <hi>not</hi> for lazineſs-ſake, it was for ſelf-ſake, that ſhe did not. As I knew Lady L. would have been a gainer by the change of pen, I had much rather have been in the company for which ſhe quitted the task, than grubbing pens in my cloſet; and all to get nothing but diſcommendation.</p>
                  <p>I have ſhewn her this my Poſtcript. She raves: But I am hardened. She will ſoon have an opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſupply all my defects, in perſon.</p>
