            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wrote a ſerious one himſelf; but as Mr. King was to ſpeak it, Mr. Garrick, with great propriety, thought a piece of humour would be beſt ſuited to the talents of that excellent actor, and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form ſo entirely different from the firſt, that it cannot, with the leaſt juſtice, be attributed to any other author.</note>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1108501400:9"/>inſulted by the offer of a rejected heart; — Lady Betty in that caſe will ſave her the pain of a ſuppoſed diſreſpect, and me the mortification of a new repulſe.

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſo I do, Sir, a man of the niceſt honour.</p>

                  <p>And yet, Sir, you aſk me to violate the ſanctity of my word — and tell me indirectly that it is my intereſt to be a raſcal —</p>

                  <p>Why, this is mending matters with a witneſs! — And ſo you think becauſe I am not legally bound, I am under no neceſſity of keeping my word! — Sir Harry, laws were never made for men of honour; — they want no bond but the

                  <p>Inſult you Colonel! — is the offer of my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance an inſult? — is my readineſs to make what ſettlements you think proper —</p>

                  <p>Sir Harry, I ſhould conſider the offer of a kingdom an inſult, if it was to be purchaſed by the violation of my word: — Beſides, though my daughter ſhall never go a beggar to the arms of her huſband, I wou'd rather ſee her happy than rich; and if ſhe has enough to provide handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a young family, and ſomething to ſpare for the exigencies of a worthy friend, I ſhall think her as affluent as if ſhe was miſtreſs of Mexico.</p>

                  <p>LORD, Lord, my dear you're enough to drive one out of one's wits. — I tell you, again and again, he's as much yours as ever; and was I in your ſituation, he ſhou'd be my huſband to-morrow morning.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Emmy you miſtake the matter ſtrangely. — Lord Winworth is no common man, nor wou'd he have continued his ſilence ſo long upon his favourite ſubject, if he had the leaſt inclination to renew his addreſſes. — His pride has juſtly taken the alarm at my inſenſibility, and he will not, I am ſatisfied, run the hazard of another refuſal.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then, in the name of wonder, if he was ſo dear to you, cou'd you prodigally trifle with your own happineſs, and repeatedly refuſe him?</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
                  <p>I have repeatedly told you becauſe I was a fool, Emmy. — Till he withdrew his addreſſes I knew not how much I eſteemed him; my unhappineſs in my firſt marriage, you know, made me reſolve againſt another. — And you are alſo ſenſible I have frequently argued that a woman of real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy ſhou'd never admit a ſecond impreſſion on her heart.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and I always thought you argued very fooliſhly. — I am ſure I ought to know, for I have been twice married; — and though I lov'd my firſt huſband very ſincerely, there was not a woman in England who cou'd have made the ſecond a better wife. — Nay, for that matter, if another was to offer himſelf to-morrow, I am not altogether certain that I ſhould refuſe liſtening —</p>

                  <p>You are a ſtrange creature.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>And are'nt you a much ſtranger, in declining to follow your own inclinations, when you cou'd have conſulted them ſo highly, to the credit of your good ſenſe, and the ſatisfaction of your whole family. — But it is'nt yet too late; and if you will be adviſed by me every thing ſhall end as happily as you can wiſh.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Why this, then: — My Lord you know has requeſted that you wou'd indulge him with half an hour's private converſation ſome time this morning.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>This is a liberty he has'nt taken theſe three months — and he muſt deſign ſomething by it; — now as he can deſign nothing but to renew his addreſſes, I wou'd adviſe you to take
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1108501400:25"/>him at the very firſt word, for fear your delicacy, if it has time to conſider, ſhou'd again ſhew you the ſtrange impropriety of ſecond marriages.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe this ſhould not be his buſineſs with me?</p>

                  <p>Why then we'll go another way to work: — I, as a ſanguine friend of my Lord's, can give him a diſtant hint of matters, exacting at the ſame time a promiſe of the moſt inviolable ſecrecy; and aſſuring him you wou'd never forgive me, if you had the leaſt idea of my having acquainted him with ſo important a —</p>

                  <p>Dear Cecil, I am more to be pitied than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in this tranſaction. — when I firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make myſelf agreeable to Miſs Rivers, I imagined her family would readily countenance my addreſſes, and when I ſucceeded in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, I had not time to declare myſelf in form, before her father entred into this engagement with Sidney. — The moment I heard it mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I wrote to him, offering him a <hi>carte blanche,</hi> and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt. — I have therefore been forc'd into the meaſure you diſapprove ſo much— but I hope my conduct, in the character of the ſon-in-law, will amply atone for any error in my behaviour as a friend.</p>

                  <p>I offended with you, my dear! — far from it; I commend your reſolution extremely, ſince my Lord is not a man to your taſte. — Offended with you! why ſhould I take the liberty to be offended with you? — A preſumption of that nature —</p>

                  <p>Indeed, my dear, you talk very ſtrangely; — ſo far from being ſorry that you have refus'd my Lord — I am pleas'd, — infinitely pleas'd, — that is, ſince he was not agreeable to you. — Be ſatisfied your acceptance of him would have given me no pleaſure in the world, — I aſſure you it wou'd'nt, — on the contrary, as matters are ſituated, I wou'd'nt for the world have you give him the ſmalleſt encouragement.</p>

                  <p>THUS far, my dear Emmy, there is a gleam of hope. — She determined, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determined, againſt my Lord: — And even ſuſpected ſo little of my partiality for him, that ſhe appeared under the greateſt anxiety leſt I ſhould be offended with her refuſing him: — And yet, ſhall I own my folly to you?</p>

                  <p>Why then, greatly as I dreaded her appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the propoſal, — I was ſecretly hurt at her inſenſibility to the perſonal attractions of his Lordſhip.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
                  <p>Your are right. — And though I was happy to find her reſolution ſo agreeable to my wiſhes, my pride was not a little piqu'd to find it poſſible for her to refuſe a man upon whom I had ſo ardently plac'd my own affection. — The ſurprize which I felt on this account threw a warmth into my expreſſions, and made the generous girl appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that I was offended with her.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, this is a ſtrange world we live in. — That a woman without a ſhilling ſhou'd refuſe an Earl with a fine perſon, and a great eſtate is the moſt ſurprizing affair I ever heard of. — Perhaps, Lady Betty, my Lord may take it in his head to go round the family: — If he ſhould, my turn is next, and I aſſure you, he ſhall meet with a very different reception.</p>

                  <p>Why no! — Not very cruel. — I might give myſelf a few airs at firſt. — I might bluſh a little, and look down. — Wonder what he cou'd find in me to attract his attention: — Then pulling up my head, with a toſs of diſdain, — deſire him, if ever he ſpoke to me on that ſubject again, —</p>

                  <p>How then, Theodora, have I merited a treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this nature?

                  <p>Here, in a melancholy but reſolute voice, he expatiated on the infamy of my intended ſlight, and mentioned my want of affection for him in terms that pierc'd my very ſoul: — Having done this, he took an abrupt leave, and, ſcorning to detain me by force, forſook me to the courſe of my own inclinations.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Rivers, independent of her very affluent fortune, Colonel, has beauty and merit which would make her alliance a very great honour to the firſt family in the kingdom — But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my admiration of her beauty, and my reverence for her merit, I find it utterly impoſſible to proſit either by her goodneſs, or your generoſity.</p>

                  <p>A marriage with Miſs Rivers, Sir, was once the object of my higheſt ambition, and, had I been honoured with her hand, I ſhould have ſtudied to ſhew my ſenſibility of a bleſſing ſo invaluble; — but, at that time, I did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1108501400:79"/>my happineſs to be incompatible with her's. — I am now convinced that is ſo, and it becomes me much better to give up my own hopes, than to offer the ſmalleſt violence to her inclinations.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
                  <p>Death and hell, Sir! — what do you mean by this behaviour? — Shall I prefer your alliance to any man's in England? — Shall my daughter even expreſs a readineſs to marry you? — and ſhall you, after this, inſolently tell me you don't chooſe to accept her? —</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Colonel, you totally miſconceive my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, — and, I am ſure, upon reflexion, you will rather approve than condemn it — A man of common humanity, Sir, in a treaty of marriage, ſhould conſult the lady's wiſhes as well as his own, and, if he can't make her happy, he will ſcorn to make her miſerable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
                  <p>Scorn to make her miſerable! — why the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's mad, I believe — Does'nt the girl abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent to have you? — Would you have her drag you to the altar by force? — Would you have her fall at your feet, and beg of you, with tears, to pity one of the fineſt women, with one of the beſt fortunes, in England?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Your vehemence, Sir, prevents you from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this matter in a proper light. — Miſs Rivers is ſufficiently unhappy in loſing the man of her heart, but her diſtreſs muſt be greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, if, in the moment ſhe is moſt keenly ſenſible of this loſs, ſhe is compelled to marry an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. — Beſides, Colonel, I muſt have my ſeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1108501400:80"/>too. — There is ſomething ſhocking in a union with a woman whoſe affections we know to be alienated; and 'tis difficult to ſay which is moſt entitled to contempt, he that ſtoops to accept of a pre-engaged mind, or he that puts up with a proſtituted perſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
                  <p>Mighty well, Sir, — mighty well; but let me tell you, Mr. Sidney, — that under this ſpecious appearance of generoſity I can eaſily ſee your your motive for this refuſal of my daughter, — let me tell you I can eaſily ſee your motive, Sir, — and, let me tell you, that the perſon who is in poſſeſſion of your affections ſhall no longer find an aſylum in this houſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Colonel, if I had not been always accuſtomed to reſpect you, — and if I did not even conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this inſult as a kind of compliment, I don't know how I ſhould put up with it: as to your inſinuation, you muſt be more explicit before I can underſtand you.</p>

If Miſs Marchmont had not been in the caſe my daughter had not received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. — Sir Harry was right; and had not I been ridiculouſly beſotted with your hypocritical plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility I might have ſeen it ſooner, but your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin ſhall know of your behaviour, and then, Sir, you ſhall anſwer me as a man.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Marchmont, Colonel, is greatly above this illiberal reflexion; as for myſelf, I ſhall be always ready to juſtify an action which I know to

                  <p>Well, my Lord and Lady Betty, ſince we have agreed thus far, you muſt know that Mr. Sidney's behaviour has produced more good conſequences than you can imagine. — In the firſt place it has enabled Colonel Rivers, without a breach of his word, —</p>

                  <p>Well, well, my dear ſiſter,—no wondering about it, — at a more convenient time you ſhall know particulars; for the preſent let me tell you, that now I am cool, and that matters have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1108501400:90"/>explain'd to me, I am not only ſatisfied but charm'd with Mr. Sidney's behaviour, though it has prevented the firſt wiſh of my heart; and I hope that his Lordſhip and you, by conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his marriage with Miſs Marchmont, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately remove every impediment in the way of your own happineſs.</p>

                  <p>That I may not be cenſur'd any longer, I here declare my hand your Lordſhip's whenever you think proper to demand it; for I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd the greateſt proof which a woman can give of her own worth, is to entertain an affection for a man of honour and underſtanding.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>And as for me, Lady Betty, it is ſo much my inclination to deſerve the partiality with which Miſs Rivers has honour'd me, as well as to repay the goodneſs of her family, that I ſhall have little merit in my gratitude to either; I have been wild, I have been inconſiderate, but I hope I never was deſpicable; and I flatter myſelf I ſhan't be wanting in acknowledgment only to thoſe, who have laid me under the greateſt of all obligations.</p>

                  <p>Hold, my Lord — I gueſs what you are about, but you ſhan't monopolize generoſity I aſſure you: — I have a right to ſhew my friendſhip as well as your Lordſhip; ſo, after your kinſman's marriage, whatever you have a mind to do for him ſhall be equalled, on my part, for Miſs Marchmont; guinea for guinea, as far as you will, and let's ſee who tires firſt in going through with it.</p>

                  <p>Why what the devil is there in all this to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at? People of fortune often throw away thouſands at the hazard table to make themſelves miſerable, and nobody ever accuſes them of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.</p>
