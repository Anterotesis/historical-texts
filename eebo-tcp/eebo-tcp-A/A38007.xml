            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I was lately venturing a
little Book into the World, I
fully designed to make choice
of no other Person than Your Lordship
for my Patron: But I soon found my
self unable to pursue my Resolves, and
I let fall my Design on this single thought,
that I being a Stranger to your Lordship,
my Application would be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f the like
nature with the former) I here lay my
self and that at your Lordships Feet. It
is Presumption to offer such a mean Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to a Person of your Worth; and a
greater Presumption it is to expose these
Papers to so Severe a Critick, so Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Celebrated a Writer, so Classick
an Author as your Lordship. But I take
<pb facs="tcp:105317:3"/>
Courage by considering that your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
is as eminent as your Judgment,
and that I may have the Happiness to
share in it as well as others. Besides, I
have hereby an Opportunity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
my Sense and Esteem of your
Known Worth, which is the Universal
Theme of the World. Why should not I
joyn with the rest of Mankind in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
and declaring that by your
Excellent Discourses and Writings you
have enlightned the Christian World,
and that by your Unreprovable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
you have most effectually commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it the Practice of Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
Likewise, I take here the welcome
occasion of congratulating your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Accession to the <hi>Episcopal Dignity</hi>
in our Church, which your Merits alone
have exalted you to.</p>
            <p>That your Lordship may Rule in this
High Station with inflamed Zeal for Gods
Glory and the Churches Welfare, and
with a perpetual Blessing from the Chief
Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, is the
Hearty Prayer of,</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>LET me not incur the Imputation of
Arrogance, if I tell the Reader, that
when I presented my former <hi>Critical Essay</hi>
to the View and Censure of a Great Man,
(who for his Profound Knowledge and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of <hi>Divinity</hi> embelished with an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
Eloquence,</hi> hath most justly
been esteemed above four Lusters of Years
the Oracle of the <hi>Schools,</hi> the Glory of the
<hi>Chair,</hi> the Life and Soul of the <hi>University,</hi>
and the Astonishment of the whole Learned
World,) He, after he had vouchsafed to
express his Approbation of it in such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Terms which it becomes me not to
impart, was pleased to encourage me to a
<hi>Second Attempt</hi> of the like nature. Which
I being animated by so Great (but so Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did)
a Iudge, have now finished, and here
offer to the Publick, and submit to the
Censure of the Learned.</p>
            <p>I will not present the Reader with the
Particulars of my Undertaking (as I did
in the Entrance to my former Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,)
<pb facs="tcp:105317:4"/>
but I shall only acquaint him with
this in general, that I have for the most
part observed this Course in these Papers,
<hi>viz.</hi> I have first propounded the Opinions
embraced by the Learned: And I have
fairly represented them, letting all Men
see what may be said for them. Secondly,
I have shewed how far they are Defective,
and for what Reasons I recede from them;
for I never leave any received Opinion
without some just Cause. Thirdly, I offer
some more Probable Account of my own,
and I make it my work to <hi>establish</hi> my
Hypothesis as well as I can. In all these
three I have been very Sincere and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial:
And I have not studied to Amuse,
but to Satisfie the Reader. Whilst I have
endeavoured to refute an Opinion, I have
taken care not to reproach the Owner: And
whilst I have propounded my own, I have
not excluded the Sentiments of more Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Enquirers.</p>
            <p>I must needs confess that I accustom my
self to a Freedom of Thoughts, and I like
it in others as well as I practise it my self:
Wherefore as I have taken the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on the Assertions of others, so any Man
is welcome to examine mine with the same
Freedom. I know some Men are wont even
in these <hi>Critical Subjects</hi> to write very
<pb facs="tcp:105317:4"/>
               <hi>Imperiously,</hi> as if (according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Acception of the<note n="*" place="margin">Shebe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, Penna Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum, Jud. 5. 14. Sceptrum, Gen. 49. 10</note> Hebrew word) their
<hi>Pens</hi> were <hi>Scepters,</hi> and they must needs
<hi>Domineer</hi> when they write. But I have
laboured to avoid this Excess, by not
affecting to be Categorical and Positive in
every Notion I propound: I do not in those
matters which relate merely to <hi>Criticism,</hi>
determine any thing Peremptorily, but I
only desire to be heard as well as others, and
crave leave I may offer my Conjectures;
and then I sit down, and submit my self to
the more mature Iudgments of the Learned.</p>
            <p>This I must needs say, I have all along
endeavoured to avoid Obscurity, and to
express my self in such easie and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Terms, that I am sure I shall not deserve
the Character and Censure which St. <hi>Jerom</hi>
bestowed on some Expositors, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 139 ad Cypr.</note> That <hi>it
was more difficult to understand their
Expositions, than the Texts which they
undertook to explain.</hi> I have been careful
to deliver my thoughts and meaning very
plainly, that, whatever other entertainment
they may meet with, they may at least be
rightly understood, and that I may not be
mistaken and misrepresented in what I say.</p>
            <p>I have only this to add, that whereas I
once intended to publish a <hi>Third Part</hi> of
these <hi>Critical Remarks</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105317:5"/>
on places of Holy Scripture (of which I
have a considerable number by me,) I have
altered my purpose, and do intend to insert
them into some other Treatises and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
where I shall have occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those Texts, and examine the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. The greatest part of them I
reserve to be made use of in a <hi>Discourse of
the Authority, Stile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Holy
Scriptures,</hi> which I shall hereafter expose
to the view of the World, and therein offer
my Interpretation of those places which I
think have been mistaken by Expositors.</p>

               <p>I Begin with this Famous Prophesie
concerning the Time of our Blessed
Saviour's coming into the World:
And my Design is, briefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the general Glosses of the Learned
upon this Verse, with short Reflection's
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105317:7"/>
on some of them; but more especially
to choose out such an Interpretation of
the word <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the celebrated Title
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as I conceive to be most
genuine and proper; which I will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
largely insist upon by shewing the
great Agreeableness and Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; and consequently the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of it to all other Interpretations.
This noble Prediction is no other than
the remarkable words of the Patriarch
<hi>Iacob</hi> Blessing his Children; and among
the rest his Son <hi>Iudah</hi> a little before his
Death. He intimates that the Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture,
and with it the Ruling Power
was taken from <hi>Reuben,</hi> when he saith
of him, <hi>He shall not excel,</hi> v. 4. And
from <hi>Reuben</hi> this Dominion is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to <hi>Iudah;</hi> for it is said, <hi>His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Children</hi> (of whom <hi>Reuben</hi> was the
chief of them) <hi>shall bow down before him,</hi>
v. 8. i. e. The Kingdom and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall commence here, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
among the Jews many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
even until a certain Period ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, <hi>viz.</hi> The Arrival of
the <hi>Messias,</hi> who is here called <hi>Shiloh.</hi>
Till that time the Jewish Government
and Polity shall be kept up, <hi>The Scepter
shall not depart:</hi> But upon the coming of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105317:7"/>
the <hi>Messias,</hi> who is Christ, their Ruling
Power shall cease, their State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
shall be abolished, and in a
little time after there shall be no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
left of their Kingdom and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Let us take this Prophesie asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Comment on the several words,
and then set them together again, and
shew you how signal a Proof they are
of Christ's being come.</p>
               <p>First, The Hebrew word which we
translate the <hi>Scepter,</hi> hath different sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications,
and accordingly is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
rendred a<note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 27. 32. Ps. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Staff,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a<note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 31. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Stroke, Plague</hi> or <hi>Punishment,</hi>
and at other times a<note n="*" place="margin">Iudges 5. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Quill or Pen to
write with.</hi> I meet with no Exposito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
that think any of these to be the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the word in this place. But
there are two other Acceptions which
bid fair for it: The word sometimes
signifies a <hi>Tribe,</hi> and that in this Chapter
<hi>v.</hi> 28. and the reason why the same
word signifies a <hi>Rod</hi> and a <hi>Tribe,</hi> may
be because the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by Rods or Wands, <hi>Num.</hi> 17.
2, 3. Accordingly <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi>
render this place thus, <hi>The Tribe shall
not depart from</hi> Judah: And they make
the Sense of the whole Text to be this,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105317:8"/>
                  <hi>Iudah</hi> shall not cease to be a Tribe till
the coming of Christ, but then it shall.
And so indeed it did; for when Christ
came, and was rejected by the Jews,
the Romans by Gods just Judgment
scattered them abroad, and the Tribe
of <hi>Iudah</hi> could not be distinguished
from the other Tribes. This Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
confirms the Truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
and sufficiently baffles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the Jews. But there is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
another more eminent Acception
of the word, for you will find that it
often signifies a <hi>Scepter.</hi> And that the
same word which before signified a <hi>Rod,</hi>
should also denote a <hi>Scepter,</hi> is not to be
wondred at, because a <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Staff</hi> was
the Ancient Ensign of <hi>Royalty</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
Amos</hi> 1. 5. This was born by
Kings, as a Badge of their Power and
Authority. By the <hi>Scepter</hi> then is meant
here Kingly Power and Authority, or
the <hi>Supreme Government</hi> of what Name
or Form soever. This signification of
the word in this place, is owned and
approved of by the <hi>Iewish Doctors</hi> and
<hi>Rabbins</hi> themselves, and the three <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums</hi>
agree in it, and it is acknowledged
and allowed of by the Ancient Greek
Versions of the Seventy, who render
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105317:8"/>
it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Prince or Governor. This
Prince or Governor, this Government
or Scepter, <hi>shall not depart</hi> (which are
the next words) <hi>i. e.</hi> There shall be a
continual Succession of Kings and Rulers,
the Civil Power and Polity shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
remain, these shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
shall not wholly be destroyed;
they may for a time be clouded and
eclipsed, they may be interrupted for
a while, but there shall not be a Final
and Total Cessation of them. The <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
shall not <hi>quite depart,</hi> it shall<note n="*" place="margin">Non aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur. Vulg. Lat.</note> not
be <hi>taken away</hi> from <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is meant by <hi>Iudah</hi> here?
First, It is not to be taken in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
Sense for the Patriarch <hi>Iudah,</hi>
but for the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> As the
Priesthood was consigned to <hi>Levi,</hi> i. e.
not his Person, but his Tribe and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
so <hi>Iudah</hi> had the Scepter, the
Government conferred on him, not his
Person (for he had no Rule) but his
Tribe, as distinct from the other Tribes.
The meaning then is, that there shall be
some of that Tribe who shall Reign till
Christ cometh, and no longer: For as
the Kingdom and Government shall
begin in this Tribe (as it did in <hi>David</hi>)
and be continued in it, so it shall end
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105317:9"/>
with it. When that Tribe affords no
more Kings, then Kingship shall cease
among the Jews; though Foreigners
may be set up, yet they shall have no
more Kings of their own; which shall
be a certain Indication of the Coming
of the <hi>Messias. Secondly, Iudah</hi> must be
taken comprehensively for the Twelve
Tribes, for the State, Government and
Polity of the whole Nation called <hi>Iews,</hi>
from the Patriarch <hi>Iudah.</hi> Some shrink
this Prophesie into a narrow compass;
but I think it ought to be taken largely,
and to be applied to <hi>Iudah,</hi> not only as
it signifies a particular Tribe of that
name, but as it takes in all the Jewish
People, the whole Body of the Jews.
For these Prophetical Blessings which
<hi>Iacob</hi> here uttereth, are of a large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and <hi>this</hi> especially relating to a
higher matter than any of the rest, is
not to be confined and restrained to a
<hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Tribe;</hi> but it is most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to believe, that it reacheth to the
whole Nation and Polity of the Jews,
who are here called <hi>Iudah,</hi> as they are

with <hi>Shebet,</hi> the <hi>Law-giver</hi> is of the same
Importance with the <hi>Scepter</hi> or Kingly
Power; for this and making Laws went
together, the Regal and Judicial or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
Authority did reside in the
Jewish Kings. And this Prince or Law-giver
is said to be <hi>from between</hi> Judah'<hi>s
feet;</hi> which some learned Men have
thought is an Allusion to the Custom of
Courts, where the Scribe or Lawyer
used to sit at the Feet of the Judge or
Governor, and there take his Opinion.
But this is a Mistake, and ariseth from
the want of considering the difference
between those two Expressions <hi>at the
feet</hi> and <hi>from between the feet.</hi> These
have no Affinity with one another: As
to the latter then, <hi>from between his feet,
i. e.</hi> the Feet of <hi>Iudah;</hi> it is as much
as, <hi>of the Seed or Race of</hi> Judah (as you
will find those words signifie in <hi>Deut.</hi>
28. 57.) and <hi>brought up by him</hi> (as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are said to be brought up upon
their Parents <hi>Knees,</hi> Gen. 50. 23.) This
is the plain and unforced meaning of
this Hebrew Phrase or Expression; when
it is said then, that <hi>a Law-giver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his feet,</hi> shall not depart from him;
the meaning is, that there shall always
be some who shall be <hi>born of the Posterity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105317:10"/>
and Race of</hi> Judah, and <hi>brought up and
educated by them</hi> that shall sway the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and give Laws in <hi>Israel.</hi> This shall
last till <hi>Shiloh come,</hi> which is the next
and main thing to be explain'd. There
are various Interpretations of this word
given by Expositors, but they all agree
in this, that it refers to the <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. Some think that the Seventy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters

Critick hath lately attempted to
give us the reason why <hi>Shello</hi> comes to
be read <hi>Shiloh,</hi> because (saith he) before
Points were used in the Hebrew Text,
the Letter <hi>Iod</hi> served instead of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105317:10"/>
Vowels <hi>I</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> but after the finding
out of the Points, the Transcribers of
the Bible still kept in the letter <hi>Iod</hi> in
the Text, which hath made the Sense of
this place difficult, saith he. But this
account (as ingenious as it is, and like
its Author) falls to the ground, and is
of no value at all, if the Hebrew Points
were co-existent with the Letters, which
will appear to be the most probable
opinion to those who impartially weigh
the Arguments brought for it, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that of the Truth and Certainty
of the Scriptures of the Old Testament
which depend upon it. And as for the
Version of the Seventy, which seems to
favour those who think <hi>Shelo</hi> to be the
true Original word; I wonder that
wise Men will rely upon this Greek
Translation, which it is evident is in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
places false and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orrupted,
that is, it was either so at first, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Mistakes which the Seventy
Interpreters committed, or else it was
depraved afterwards, whether willfully
(to disguise the Truth) or through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence,
or by the fault of the Copies
they then had, I will not stand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
This corrupting of Scripture, and
particularly the altering of this Text in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105317:11"/>
the Greek, was long ago objected to
<hi>Trypho</hi> against his Brethren the Jews by
<hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> But that the Seventy
Elders read the Hebrew amiss in this
place, and that this was the cause of
their mistake, is very likely, it being
(as I have suggested, and as all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Men will acknowledge) their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practice, and therefore not to be
wondred at here.</p>
               <p>And yet I am not so positive here,
as I find some Writers are, for there is
a way of salving this Greek Translation,
without charging them with mistaking
the Hebrew; for I conceive the Seventy
might read it <hi>Shiloh,</hi> as we have it now;
but they took it to be as much as <hi>asher
lo, ille cujus</hi> or <hi>cui, He for whom the
Scepter,</hi> mentioned just before, <hi>was laid
up,</hi> or <hi>to whom it belonged,</hi> and thence
they rendred it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Jewish Interpreters mistake
the Hebrew words in other places (as
it is certain they do) yet there is no
<hi>necessity</hi> of asserting that they do so
here. Perhaps they did read it right,
though they mistook the true meaning
of the word (of which I shall give you
an account afterwards) and instead of
understanding it to be the Name of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105317:11"/>
                  <hi>Messias,</hi> thought the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be the same
with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be a Pronoun,
and so they concluded that <hi>Shilo</hi> was of
the same signification with <hi>Shelo.</hi> But
this is a sorry Interpretation of the word,
and the very <hi>Iews</hi> themselves (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="*" place="margin">R. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> one single Rabby) are ashamed of
it; for it unnecessarily confounds and
jumbles two words together, and at the
same time mangles one of them, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
a <hi>Van</hi> in the place of a <hi>He,</hi> and
strikes out a <hi>Iod,</hi> and after all this leaves
the sense of the Prophesie lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
uncertain and arbitrary, for
these words <hi>[he to whom]</hi> assert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
nothing at all.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Vulgar Latin Version</hi> furnisheth
us with another Interpretation of this
word, rendring it <hi>qui mittendus est;</hi> for
it seems these Translators read it not
<hi>Shiloh</hi> but <hi>Shiloah</hi> or <hi>Shilluach,</hi> i. e. <hi>missus,</hi>
which here is as much as <hi>mittendus,</hi>
the <hi>Praeterit</hi> being put for the <hi>Future,</hi>
after the manner of the Prophetick
Writers. Some think that this is one
of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s Names in <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 6. and
that this Text which we are now treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, was, among several others, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Jews, they changing
<hi>Shiloah</hi> into <hi>Shiloh:</hi> But there is not the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105317:12"/>
least shew of reason to assert either of
these, for in that place in <hi>Isaiah, Shiloah</hi>
barely signifies a Fountain or Spring of
that name, which rose at the foot of
Mount <hi>Sion:</hi> And it is a mistake that
the Jews corrupted this Text by turning
<hi>Shiloah</hi> into <hi>Shiloh,</hi> for it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to do it, the word <hi>Shiloh</hi> (as you
shall hear anon) being as expressive, yea
much more, of the <hi>Messi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> than that
other could be. Without all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
the Text is entire and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
and as for these Surmises, they

Persuasion, yet there is good reason to

there is no such Hebrew word as <hi>Shil</hi> in

               <p>Again, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and other Rabbies

and this (viz. <hi>Peaceableness</hi>) is the very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and proper Nature of that Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which he founded and established in

amongst Christians (and who sees

our <hi>Shiloh,</hi> our <hi>Peaceable Messias;</hi> he hath
purchased the means conducing to it, and
we may be in possession of it if we will.
Farther, to evince the Truth and Efficacy
of this <hi>Name,</hi> let us reflect on the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time of our Saviour's visiting the World,
which was a Time of <hi>Universal Peace.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105317:18"/>
I grant this is a common Observation, and
generally known; but here in our present
Subject it is very considerable, and more
than ordinarily to be taken notice of and
applied, because it will let us into the true
Notion of this great and comprehensive
Name <hi>Shiloh.</hi> The noise of Wars and
Battles was ceased, all was calm and hush'd,
a Catholick Peace possessed the World at
Christ's appearing in it; for he was born in
the Reign of a <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Peaceable Prince,</hi>
who after five Civil Wars, and after infinite
Slaughter and Bloodshed accompanying them
all, reigned peaceably many Years. At this
time it was, that the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and several
Nations which before had continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
the Roman Empire with their Arms,
came and humbly besought its Friendship,
and tamely restored those Banners and other
Ensigns of War which they had formerly
taken from the <hi>Romans</hi> in Battle, and laid
them down at <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Feet. When thus
this Emperor had vanquish'd the World,
and settled the Nations, and all Kingdoms
were brought under his Dominion, when
he as well as the whole Earth was at <hi>Peace</hi>
(of which the shutting of the Gates of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
Temple, as it were shutting up Peace
there, was a visible Token, and whereof
there was very rarely an Example, as<note n="‖" place="margin">In vit. Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
observes, till this time) then, and not
till then, our Saviour chose to bless the
World with his presence, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that he was indeed the <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105317:19"/>
                  <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> (as the<note n="‖" place="margin">Isa, 9. 6.</note> Evangelical Prophet

which is yet a farther Accession
to the Glory of this Name. Therefore it
immediately follows after the mentioning
of <hi>Shiloh</hi> in this Prophesie, <hi>Unto him shall

it: <hi>All the Kings of the Earth shall be subject

<hi>Triumph,</hi> for this was an usual Practice
among several Nations. The Evangelist
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> relating this passage, tells us, That
<hi>they took Branches of Palm-trees, and went

the Custom on such an Occasion, to make
use especially of the Boughs of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

to be a Symbol of Victory, of which<note n="†" place="margin">L. 3. c. 6.</note>

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> pretended to give
the reasons, <hi>viz.</hi> Because this is a firm and
durable Tree, and had Leaves always green
(whence you read of<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 92. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>flourishing like the
Palm-tree</hi>) and from a Vulgar Error that
prevail'd about this Tree, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the
more weights are laid on it, the higher it
riseth. Whence <hi>Palma</hi> among the Latins
signifies <hi>Victory</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi> of it: And
'tis certain that the Branches of this Tree
were used in Triumphs both among the
Greeks and Romans, and were the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of Conquerors. Accordingly the <hi>Iews</hi>

                  <hi>Iesus,</hi> took Branches of Palm-trees, and

Yea, 'tis no wonder that the <hi>Iews</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

I say, that these <hi>Iews,</hi> when they saw

And the <hi>Talmud</hi> informs us, that
these very <hi>Boughs</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> of Trees

by them. Here then 'tis worth our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that at our Saviour's Triumphal C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they received him with this particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
and Applause, and that they bore
their <hi>Hosanna</hi>'s in their Hands, and brought
them to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him by this Gratulation to be their

Acclamation exactly agrees to him
who is <hi>the Iesus, the Saviour, the Deliverer,</hi>
and who is the <hi>Shiloh, the Prosperous, the

been by a particular Direction of Heaven,
that our Blessed Lord, at his entrance into

<hi>Hosanna</hi>'s from the People; for <hi>Saving</hi>

shall adore him as our <hi>Compleat Shiloh,</hi> our
<hi>Saviour,</hi> our <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> our <hi>Prosperous
Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have been large in interpreting and
explaining this <hi>Antient Name</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
and you see what an Illustrious and Glorious
Title it is. I have this yet farther to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that in some of the most notable and
eminent Prophesies in the Old Testament
concerning Christ, <hi>these three things</hi> which
are comprehended in the Name <hi>Shiloh,</hi> are
particularly and distinctly mentioned and are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105317:21"/>
all found together. Thus in <hi>Psalm</hi> 72. which
is a clear Prediction concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi>
(as the Hebrew Scholiast upon it, and some
of the old Rabbins acknowledge, and as the
Application of some passages in this <hi>Psalm</hi>
to Christ, in the Writings of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
plainly sheweth.) This Name <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh</hi>
is as it were commented upon. For you
find him here first represented as a <hi>Saviour,
He shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ave the Children of the needy,</hi> v. 4.
<hi>He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the
poor also, and him that hath no helper. He
shall spare the Poor and Needy, and shall save
the Souls of the Needy,</hi> v. 12, 13. Nothing
could be more expressive than this of the
<hi>Salvation</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> for poor,
distressed, helpless Sinners. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is
described as a <hi>Peace-maker, The Mountains</hi>
(those places which used to be haunted with
Robbers and wild Beasts) <hi>shall bring Peace to
the People,</hi> v. 3. This Blessing shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on those places where it was wholly
a Stranger before, and therefore shall be the
more welcome. And in <hi>v.</hi> 7. you read of
<hi>abundance of Peace in his days;</hi> and the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it is answerable to its Plenty, for it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall last <hi>till there be no Moon,</hi> (as the Hebrew
hath it) till the Heavens and Earth, and the
whole Fabrick of the World be dissolved.
In the third place, to compleat his Character,
it is added, that he shall be <hi>Prosperous</hi> and
<hi>Happy, He shall break in pieces the Oppressor,</hi>
v. 4. He shall be a great Victor, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over all his Enemies, especially over
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105317:22"/>
Satan the Great and Unsufferable <hi>Oppressor</hi>
of Mankind. This is also signified in that
Metaphorical Language, <hi>v. 6. He shall come
down like rain upon the mowen Grass, as
showers that water the Earth:</hi> i. e. in plainer
terms, The Subjects of his Kingdom shall
grow and increase, thrive and flourish:
Therefore it follows immediately, <hi>In his
days shall the Righteous flourish,</hi> v. 7. And
then in several Verses together you have the
<hi>Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of his Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered,
<hi>He shall have Dominion from Sea to
Sea: They that dwell in the Wilderness shall
bow before him, and his Enemies shall lick the
Dust. All Kings shall fall down before him:
All Nations shall serve him. And he shall live,</hi>
i. e. (according to the<note n="‖" place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 16. 1 Kings 1. 31.</note> Eastern stile) <hi>he
shall prosper; and Men shall be blessed in him:
All Nations shall call him blessed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise in that other noted and famous
Prediction concerning Christ, in the 53
Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> all these three significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the word <hi>Shiloh</hi> meet together.
The Prophet recounting the admirable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
and Advantages of our Saviours Passion
(for that it is spoken of Him is evident
from <hi>Matt. 8. 17.</hi> and <hi>Acts 8. 32, 35.)</hi> tells
us, That <hi>he hath born our Griefs and carried
our Sorrows,</hi> v. 4. i. e. He underwent the
Punishment which we should have suffered
which is farther expressed in the next Verse,
<hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions, he was
bruised for our Iniquities.</hi> Whereas we should
have been wounded and bruised, punished
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105317:22"/>
and tormented for our Sins, He was pleased,
out of infinite Kindness, to take the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of our Sins upon himself, and to bear
them on the Cross, and thereby to free us
not only from the Guilt of Sin, but from all
the Miseries which were consequent upon it.
What is this but to be a <hi>Saviour?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is added, <hi>With his stripes we are healed,</hi>
v. 5. By the Sufferings of Christ<note n="‖" place="margin">Sanati su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Vulg. Lat.</note> we are
made whole, and saved. Thus he was a
<hi>Saviour.</hi> But the same Inspired Prophet
acquaints us in the same Verse, that he was
a <hi>Peace-maker, the Chastisement of our Peace
was upon him,</hi> i. e. by his Meritorious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
our Peace with God was purchased,
our Reconciliation with the incensed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of Heaven was procured. Yea, it is
not unworthy of our notice, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word which we render <hi>Peace,</hi> is in
the plural Number, to intimate to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that
<hi>whatever</hi> Pleas and Accusations are against
us, they are all (though never so <hi>many)</hi>
silenced by Christ our Advocate, our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
our Reconciler, our Peace-maker.
Farther, the <hi>Peaceable</hi> Nature of Christ is
set forth in those words, <hi>As a Sheep before
her Shearers is dumb, so he opened not his
mouth,</hi> v. 7. He bore all Hardships, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
Injuries, yea and the Cross it self,
with a humble Silence and Submission.<note n="‖" place="margin">Isa. 42. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>He
did not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his Voice to
be heard in the Street.</hi> This is the Character
of the Mild, the Gentle, the <hi>Peaceable Iesus.</hi>
In the next place, he is represented as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105317:24"/>
When thou shalt make his Soul an
Offering for sin, he shall see his Seed, he shall
prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand,</hi> v. 10. That is, his
whole Design and Undertaking for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Redemption of Mankind (for this
is <hi>the Pleasure of the Lord)</hi> shall be Successful:
There shall be a Happy Effect and Issue of
all that he hath done and suffered, he shall
<hi>see</hi> and rejoyce in <hi>his Seed,</hi> that numerous
Race of Holy Converts, of Believers and
Regenerate Persons who are added to the
Church. <hi>He shall see of the Travel of his Soul,
and shall be satisfied,</hi> v. 11. He shall delight
himself in the Blessed Effect of his Labours,
he shall acquiesce in the Fruit of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Salvation of his Chosen.
<hi>Therefore will I divide him a Portion with the

who after the Victory is over, share in
the Rich Spoil: So that this expresseth the
Compleat Victory and Triumph of Christ
over all his Enemies. Thus he is every ways
the <hi>True Shiloh;</hi> for <hi>Salvation, Peace</hi> and
<hi>Prosperity</hi> (which are all contained in that
Appellation) belong to him.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather, that this <hi>One
Title</hi> comprehends in it All the Glorious
Names that are given to Christ, either in
the Old or New Testament, together with
all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and all the Admirable

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> his Passion. These all
center in this One Name, which the Holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105317:24"/>
Ghost hath made choice of on purpose, as
the most Comprehensive Word to express
the Glorious Nature and Properties of the
<hi>Messias.</hi> Yea, I doubt not but the Holy
Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> had this Name revealed unto
him from Heaven, and being immediately
inspired by the Holy Ghost, he divulged it
to the World. You see then that I had
great reason to prefer this Derivation of the
word <hi>Shiloh (viz.</hi> from <hi>Shalah)</hi> before any
others, and to commend it as the True and
Native Signification. And because the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Latitude of this word have not been
observed by Expositors, there was a necessity
of my insisting and enlarging upon it, that I
might thereby display the full Import of the
word designed here by the Holy Spirit, and
that it might plainly appear, that this Name
which God hath given his Son, is <hi>a Name
above every Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all that I have said, concerning
this so remarkable E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ymology and Denota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Singularity and Fitness of this Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I have offered. However, it is
sufficient for my general Purpose in this

                  </gap>. For I find
that most Authors have stretched this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
too far, and have thereby made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
justly liable to the Objections of the
<hi>Iews.</hi> And indeed they can never main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Prediction against them upon the
grounds on which they proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the <hi>Scepter</hi> is to be taken in these words
precisely for <hi>the Kingly Power,</hi> and that <hi>the
departing</hi> of this Scepter from <hi>Iudah</hi> is meant
of <hi>any departing,</hi> though it were but for a
little time. This cannot be the meaning of
the words, for then <hi>the Scepter</hi> may be said
to have <hi>departed</hi> from <hi>Iudah,</hi> when the
Jewish Nation was carried Captive into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
when the Dignity of the Kingly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was taken away by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
about five hundred years before Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And after it, under the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105317:26"/>
after the Ruin of that Empire, under <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
Successors there was <hi>a kind of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Scepter. But it was not <hi>properly
a Departing;</hi> it was rather an <hi>Interruption,</hi>
and a <hi>Cessation for a time,</hi> but that is not the
thing spoken of in this Prophesie. The Text
is not meant of a Departing for a Time, of
an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> or partial Failing, but of a
full and total Departure; which happened
not in the foresaid Instances. Nay, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all that while the Administration of
the Jewish Commonwealth remained in those
who were of the Line of <hi>Iudah, viz.</hi> the
Seventy Elders, who had the Power in their
hands: These (as the <hi>Iews</hi> tell us) failed not
to be of the Race of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> But
the <hi>Asmonaei,</hi> who were the last Set of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the
Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but of <hi>Levi,</hi> they being
Priests. Wherefore we must freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Government was not
tied to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and consequently
we must not restrain this Prophesie as some
do, as if the <hi>Scepter</hi> should not in the least
be removed from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> before
Christ came. For 'tis certain that the Scepter
did not continue in this Tribe all the while,
and therefore in my opinion <hi>Helvicus</hi> might
have saved all his pains in endeavouring to
demonstrate that there was a Continuation
of the Scepter in <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Tribe: Which
thing indeed he hath with great Learning
and Skill in History, attempted to make good,
and he hath said as much towards the proof
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105317:26"/>
of it as any Man upon Earth could have
done; but still all of it falls short of what he
undertook, because the matter it self would
not bear it, and he went upon a wrong Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the word <hi>Iudah</hi> in this
Prophesie is to be restrained to the Particular
Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Whereas it is to be taken
in a larger Sense, (as is most frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<hi>i. e.</hi> for the <hi>Iewish Race or People.</hi> The
<hi>Scepter,</hi> the Supreme Power and Authority,
continued in the Race and Line of the Jewish
People, till the Coming of Christ. And even
in those times when the <hi>Scepter,</hi> or Royal
Dignity, failed for a Season; yet the <hi>Law-giver</hi>
(if we will take it in the strictest Sense)
never failed at all; for the <hi>Iews</hi> had their own
Laws and Customs. And neither the <hi>Scepter</hi>
nor <hi>Law departed wholly</hi> from the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in any of those Times before mentioned:
It departed not in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the last King of
the House of <hi>David,</hi> nor in <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> nor in
the Failure of the <hi>Maccabean Family:</hi> I say,
<hi>it departed not wholly,</hi> though 'tis granted, that
<hi>for a time,</hi> and <hi>in some part,</hi> it was taken away.
Yea, when <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> broke his Oath and
Covenant, and rebelled against the King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> the Scepter departed from <hi>Iudah</hi> for
a time, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> observes on that Event,
<hi>so that</hi> Judah <hi>hath no strong rod to be a Scepter
to rule,</hi> ch. 19. <hi>l.</hi> v. But when <hi>Shiloh</hi> the
<hi>Messias</hi> came, it remained no longer, it was
wholly cut off and ceased, so as not to be any
more. Now was the Determinate Time
come; for that is implied in these words
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105317:27"/>
[<hi>till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come</hi>] which signifie a Set Period
of time.</p>
               <p>It remains then, that I shew you that <hi>This</hi>
was the Time of <hi>our Saviour's Coming,</hi> and
that it was the Precise Time. The <hi>Scepter,
i. e.</hi> the Jewish Government was not totally
abolished till <hi>Christ</hi> our Blessed Lord <hi>came;</hi>
but at that very time when he <hi>came,</hi> i. e. when
he was born, the Jewish Polity was utterly
destroy'd and null'd, so as never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
again. Yet this we are to note, that
the <hi>departing of the Scepter</hi> was <hi>by degrees;</hi> it
<hi>began</hi> some time before our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Birth,
and was in a short time <hi>compleated.</hi> I say,
before <hi>Christ's</hi> coming in the Flesh the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting</hi>
of the Jewish Government had its <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:</hi>
For it is evident from unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Writers, that <hi>Antipater,</hi> an <hi>Idumaean,</hi>
was set over the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and
<hi>Antigonus</hi> (who was the last of the Jewish
Kings, and of Jewish Race) was deposed.
<hi>Now</hi> it might be said that <hi>the Scepter departed
from</hi> Judah, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>a Person,</hi> not by Birth
a Jew, but a mere Alien, was forced upon
them, and usurped the Jewish Government.
Till this time their Governours were always
<hi>Iews,</hi> but now ever afterwards all the rest
were <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This was the first
step of <hi>the Total Departure of the Scepter,</hi> but
it more signally and eminently departed quite
from that Nation, when <hi>Herod,</hi> the Son of
this <hi>Antipater,</hi> was set over them: For he,
upon the Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> hastened to <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and
<hi>Hircanus,</hi> the right Heirs of the Crown, he
kill'd all of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and of the
Family of the <hi>Asmonaei,</hi> whom he fear'd
might contend with him for the Kingdom,
and he reigned at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as King of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
but without the <hi>Iews</hi> consent. He was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time a great Scourge and Plague to
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who would by no means acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a Stranger for their King. But he, to
oblige and win them, embraced their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and rebuilt their Temple; which had
this Effect upon them, that at last they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
resigned the Right of the Kingdom
to him, and owned him for their King, and
swore Fealty to him. This was in the two
and thirtieth Year of his Reign; in which
Year likewise <hi>Christ</hi> was born. So that the
Prophesie was exactly fulfilled; when the
Jewish Kingdom had changed its True Owner,
and the Scepter was actually departed from
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and that with the Consent of the
<hi>Iews</hi> (which never was before) then <hi>Christ</hi>
came. This was in the Two and fortieth
Year of <hi>Augustus,</hi> when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was the
Prefect of <hi>Syria, Luke 2. 2.</hi> And that it may
appear that <hi>the Scepter</hi> was <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
it is signally recorded that <hi>Augustus
taxed Iudea, 1, 3, 4,</hi> Verses of that Chapter.
<hi>Herod</hi> paid Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> the whole Land
was subject to the Empire, and the <hi>Iews</hi> had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105317:28"/>
no Dominion of their own. Thus, till this
<hi>Herod the Great's</hi> time, the <hi>Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
continued in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
the <hi>Royal Scepter</hi> did not <hi>depart</hi> till this Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
reigned over them, for he was the first
Jewish King of strange Blood and Descent.</p>
               <p>It is unreasonable to attend to what<note n="‖" place="margin">Scaliger, Casaubon.</note> some
alledge, that he was not an <hi>Alien,</hi> but one of
the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation, and a <hi>Iew</hi> by Birth.
Which mistake they have run into because
they read that <hi>Herod</hi> was a <hi>Iew,</hi> and was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised;
which was only to please the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and to settle himself in the Kingdom;
but this proves not that he was <hi>a Iew by Birth.</hi>
The contrary appears from the best<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Ierom, Eusebius, Epiphanius, <hi>and other Fathers.</hi>
                  </note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords:
Yea, <hi>Iosephus the Iew</hi> tells us expresly,
that he was by his Father an <hi>Idumean,</hi> and by
his Mother an <hi>Arabian. Africanus</hi> and others
derive his Pedegre otherwise, but all make
him a <hi>Foreigner</hi> and <hi>Stranger:</hi> And they all
agree, that the <hi>Iews</hi> owned him for their
King, and that he was the first Stranger
whom they admitted to sway the Scepter
over them, and consequently that in Him
this Divine Oracle began to be fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>the Scepter should depart from</hi> Judah. And
when our Saviour conversed here on Earth,
this Prophesie was still accomplished more
and more: For we find that the <hi>Iewish San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi>
had lost their Judicial Power of Life
and Death, and in all things truckled to the
Roman Governours that were set over them.
And at last, at the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
their whole Power was quite Extinct, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105317:28"/>
the <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> totally and finally
<hi>departed</hi> from them. Then the Government
of every sort, the Priesthood and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy,
the Making of Laws, and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
them, the State and Religion, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
and the Church, were destroyed
together, and so this Sacred Prediction was
<hi>compleatly</hi> fulfilled. You see then that there
were <hi>Degrees</hi> of it, and therefore 'tis Vain
and Idle to interpret this Prophesie of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time. A punctual Designation of a
certain Minute Season is unreasonable, for
the Government and Authority of the <hi>Iews</hi>
decayed <hi>gradually,</hi> till there was at length a
final departing of them.</p>
               <p>This then is the Grand thing represented
in this Prophesie, that at or about <hi>Christ's</hi>
Coming, the Scepter departed from the
Nation of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Which is as much
as we desire, to prove the Real Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of this Antient Prediction, and from
thence the Truth of Christianity. For thus
we argue, the Jewish Scepter was to depart
when Christ came: It is manifest and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
that that Scepter is departed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ is come. The Overthrow of the
Jewish Polity, Magistracy and Government,
is a certain Sign, Proof and Demonstration,
that our <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> and that this
<hi>Christ</hi> is come. It is true, there was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
an Interruption of the Scepter, but the
<hi>Iews</hi> returned to their Land and Rule again:
But now for above Sixteen hundred Years,
there hath been no shew at all of a Scepter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105317:29"/>
and Kingdom; which is an undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Scepter is quite departed.
Therefore the <hi>Talmud</hi> often saith, that this
Prediction refers to the Particular Case of
the <hi>Iews;</hi> so that when Magistracy ceased in
<hi>Ierusal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> and the Kingdom and Jurisdiction
were cast off, they ought presently to expect
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And those are Remarkable
words of <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> on <hi>Hos. 3. 4, The
Children of</hi> Israel <hi>shall abide many days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a King, and without a Prince, and without
a Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. <q>These (saith he) are the
times of Exile in which we are at this day,
we have neither a King, nor a Prince of
the Stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> but we are under the
Power of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and under the Power
of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </q>
Which is as much as to confess, that this
Prophesie which I have been commenting
upon, is accomplished, That <hi>the Scepter is
departed from</hi> Judah, and that the <hi>Messias,</hi>
who is the Blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> the True <hi>Shiloh,</hi>
(the <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> the <hi>Prosperer)</hi>

Light, answerable to the Subterranean Lamps,
or it is such a Splendor made by Art, as <hi>Noah</hi>
prepared for the Ark, <hi>Gen. 6. 16.</hi> for by what
we translate <hi>a Window,</hi> there is meant, say
they, some Greater thing: And what is that
but this <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Splendor, the True <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> of the World? But leaving
these Fanciful <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim-makers,</hi>
I proceed to acquaint you with the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the more Sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:105317:30"/>I. Some of these hold that <hi>the Name of God</hi>
was written, and put into the Breast-plate,
and that this was the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">In locum.</note> 
                  <hi>R. Selomoh Iarchi</hi> saith expresly, that it was
the Name <hi>Iehovah</hi> inserted into the Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the High Priest's Pectoral. This is also
avouched by <hi>Eugubinus, Vatablus,</hi> and <hi>P. Fagius,</hi>
the last whereof hath these words,<note n="‖" place="margin">In locum.</note> 
                  <hi>The
Writing which contained the Name of God
with four Letters, was called the</hi> Urim <hi>and</hi>
Thummim. And <hi>Avenarius</hi> is partly of this
Opinion; for though he holds that the <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> are the Twelve Precious
Stones shining in the Breast-plate, yet he joyns
to them the <hi>Shem Hamphorash,</hi> as the Jewish
Doctors stile the Name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> But for my
part I cannot conceive how these Persons
came to take up this Opinion, there being no
Foundation at all for this Particular <hi>Word</hi> or
<hi>Name.</hi> They might as well have assigned any
other Name of God, yea any other Word
whatsoever that was reputed Sacred and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable.
Wherefore others take another
course, and understand by the <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> something of a far different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> some Curious Piece of Work, either
framed by the Hand of some Skillful Artist,
or immediately wrought by God himself, and
given by him to <hi>Moses</hi> when he was on the
Mount. Accordingly,</p>
               <p>II. Some are of opinion, that the <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> were the <hi>Precious Stones</hi> in the
High Priest's Breast-plate, those Twelve
Stones on which the Names of the Tribes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105317:31"/>
were engraven. This is the received Doctrin
of the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> and the Generality of the
Jewish Doctors, to whom our Learned <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
and several other Christian Writers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here.
And they labour to prove this Assertion
from <hi>Exod. 39. 8, &amp;c.</hi> where the making of
the <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> with all its Ornaments, is set
down, and yet the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> are
not expresly mentioned there: Whence they
conclude, that these <hi>Stones</hi> are the <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim,</hi> and that <hi>Moses</hi> mentioning those,
did as good as mention these. These, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
say they, are nothing else but those
Stones. But this is confuted from this <hi>Exod. 28.</hi>
where <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Garments and Habiliments are
most distinctly set down: Here you read of
the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> with <hi>Twelve Precious Stones,</hi>
v. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then in <hi>v. 30.</hi> the <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> are mentioned by themselves,
<hi>Thou shalt put,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore <hi>These</hi> are things
really different from the <hi>Stones</hi> which were
distinctly named before, and particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
from <hi>v. 15.</hi> to 22. This I think is
very plain and convincing; and as for the
place before produced, the answer is, that
the mentioning of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> is
omitted there, where the Design was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to insist upon those Habiliments which
were Rich and Costly, and required great Art
and Preparation, but the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
are not of that nature, but a plain easie thing,
as I shall shew afterwards. The Talmudical
Doctors go on, and tell us, that by the Stones
<hi>shining more than ordinarily</hi> Answer was given
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105317:31"/>
to what was asked by the Holy Priest. Which
also is asserted by some Late Writers, who
confidently tell us, that the Stones in the
Breast-plate were called <hi>Urim,</hi> because they
sent forth a <hi>light</hi> in great abundance, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that a Pair of these Gemms shone forth
with extraordinary Brightness, when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of God was Acceptable and Welcome;
but when it was not, they look'd very Dim
and Dull. But some say (and with as much
reason as the former) that the Answer was
given, not by the Unusual Lustre of the
Stones, but by the <hi>Letters of the Names</hi> Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in them, which raised themselves higher,
and stood more out, and so made up certain
Words out of the Alphabet, contain'd in the
Names of the Twelve Tribes. When any one
came to enquire at this O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acle, the High Priest
look'd on the Letters which were Ingraven on
the Stones of his Breast-plate, and there read
what God's Pleasure was. But this is a mere
Conjecture: Besides, we are certain that <hi>Long
Answers</hi> (and such there were sometimes)
could not be given in this way.<note n="‖" place="margin">Antiq. Iud. l. 3. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Iosephus</hi>
affirms, that the Stones in the High Priest's
Breast-plate, fore signified what was to be by
the <hi>Change of their Colour.</hi> Others have other
Fancies, as <hi>Suidas</hi> quotes an Author, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred
that the Stones turned Red if there was
any Answer of War, and that they turn'd Black
if Death was denounced, and other Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Answers were signified by other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
All which is mere Surmise and Conceit:
Wherefore 'tis needless to insist upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of it.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:105317:32"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:105317:33"/>III. Others hold that the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
were <hi>Two Precious Stones</hi> given by God
to <hi>Moses,</hi> distinct from the Twelve Gemms or
Stones before mentioned. I find that <hi>Procopius</hi>
of old inclined to this Opinion, and among the
Moderns <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> asserts it. But because
they merely assert it, and assign no reason or
ground of it (as indeed it is impossible they
should) I will take no farther notice of it,
but pass to the next Opinion.</p>
               <p>IV. Others will have the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
to be a sort of <hi>Small Images</hi> belonging to
the Breast-plate. But there is a Disagreement
among those that are of this Opinion, for some
hold that the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> are one and
the same thing, others that they are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things.</p>
               <p>Those that hold the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
were the <hi>Same thing,</hi> tell us, That they were
<hi>two Little Images</hi> finely wrought, which the
High Priest wore within the Fouldings of his
Pectoral, and by these God gave Answer
when there was occasion. This is the Opinion
of <hi>Christopherus à Castr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> who adds also, That
they are the same with the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which
were Statues, Figures, or Images used in Divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The <hi>Talisman</hi> were of the like nature. So
<note n="*" place="margin">De Dis Syr. Syntag. 1.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> thinks, and addeth, That the <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
among the Idolaters, answered to the
<hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> among the Jews. The
Learned Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> agrees with him, and
saith likewise, That the <hi>Teraphim</hi> were Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
made of Wax in shape of a Man, and that
they were framed under a certain Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105317:33"/>
and thence had power to foretel future
things. But in another place he saith, They
were the Heads of First-born Males cut off,
and Magically ordered, and then being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted,
they spoke.</p>
               <p>There are others, who assert that the <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> were things of <hi>Different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
To such I would propound that passage
in <hi>Numb. 27. 21.</hi> Eleazar <hi>the Priest shall ask
Counsel for him</hi> (i. e. <hi>Ioshua) after the Iudgment
of Urim before the Lord.</hi> Here is no mention of
<hi>Thummim,</hi> but <hi>Urim</hi> alone is put for both, or
rather it is implied, that they are the same. So
we read in <hi>1 Sam. 28. 6.</hi> That <hi>when</hi> Saul <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of the Lord, he answered him not, neither
by Dreams, nor by Urim, nor by Prophets:</hi>
Whence it seems to be evident, that <hi>Urim</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the <hi>Thummim,</hi> and consequently the
difference which some Persons make between
them is taken away; they are the same Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
though not the same Words. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
seems to be of another Opinion, and makes
them two Distinct Oracles: By <hi>Urim</hi> (saith
he) the Jews were ascertained of the Council
and Will of God, by <hi>Thummim</hi> of his Favour
and Good Acceptance. The Learned Dr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
likewise hath in a whole Treatise attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prove, that the <hi>Urim</hi> is a quite different
thing from the <hi>Thummim,</hi> and that it was to
another end and purpose. As to his Notion
concerning the <hi>Urim,</hi> it is the same in the
main, with that of <hi>Christopherus à Castro,</hi> but he
with Great Wit and Extraordinary Learning
hath embellished and improved it. The <hi>Urim,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105317:34"/>
saith he, was one or two, or more Little
Images, or Hollow Instruments which the
High Priest had in the Foldings of his Breast-plate.
They were the same with <hi>Teraphim,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mentioned in the Old Testament. And
<hi>Teraphim,</hi> by an usual change of <hi>S</hi> into <hi>T</hi> is for
<hi>Seraphim,</hi> which Hebrew word signifies <hi>Uren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
So that <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> agree in the
Name, for <hi>Urim</hi> properly signifies <hi>Ignes.</hi> Now
<hi>Seraphim</hi> is a word in the Old Testament to
signifie <hi>Angels, Isa. 6. 6.</hi> it was the first and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest
Name for those Glorious Messengers of
Heaven. And they often appearing in the first
Ages of the World, and God holding Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
with Mankind by them, it was
grown into a Custom to make Little Images
and Representations of them in Wax; and at
last the Images were called by their Names;
as the Images of Angels in the Holy of Holies
were called <hi>Cherubim,</hi> so the Images of Angels
which the High Priest had in his <hi>Rationale</hi>
were called <hi>Seraphim</hi> or <hi>Teraphim,</hi> and <hi>Urim.</hi>
This Oracle was from the High Priest's
Breast, as the Oracle in the Temple was from
the Ark, and from between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi>
which were of the same Nature. In short, the
<hi>Urim</hi> were of Pagan Extraction, they being
the same with the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which are taken
in Scripture in a good and a bad Sense, for
they might be used lawfully or unlawfully,
Devils and Impure Spirits might give answer
by these as well as Good Spirits. The <hi>Teraphim</hi>
then, which were a piece of Gentile Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at first, were by Gods leave tolerated
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105317:34"/>
among the Jews, because of the Hardness of
their Hearts, and to comply with their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Temper. Accordingly God ordered those
to be placed within the doubling of the High
Priest's Breast-plate, and thence he gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
by them. This is the Learned Doctor's
Notion of the <hi>Urim,</hi> and he quotes <hi>Philo</hi> the
Jew and <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> as the Patrons of it.</p>
               <p>But I presume to offer one thing against this
Excellent Person's Opinion, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
against the Foundation of it, which is
this, that the word <hi>Teraphim</hi> is of a middle Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
in Scripture and is taken sometimes
in a good, and other times in a bad Sense;
sometimes for <hi>Cherubims</hi> and other Lawful
Representations, and at other times for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Images and Idols. This I conceive is a
mistake, for I find that the word <hi>Teraphim</hi> is
always to be understood in the latter Sense.
Thus <hi>Laban</hi> had these <hi>Teraphim,</hi> Gen. 31. 19.
which the generality of Learned Expositors
interpret concerning <hi>Magical and Telesmatical
Images,</hi> by which it was usual among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to foresee and foretell future Events.
Therefore <hi>Rachel</hi> took them from her Father,
that he might not, by consulting them, know
which way she travelled: Or, it may be she
retain'd something of his Superstition, and
took these <hi>Tutelar Gods</hi> with her to direct her
in her Journey. So we read that <hi>Micah</hi> had
got him <hi>a House of Gods</hi> and a <hi>Teraphim,</hi> Judg.
17. 5. but whether these were Lawful Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and becoming True Worshippers, you
may gather from the next Verse, <hi>In those days
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105317:35"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105317:36"/>
there was no King in</hi> Israel, <hi>but every Man did
that which was right in his own eye.</hi> And even
when the <hi>Israelites</hi> had a King, and a more
composed Government, this corrupt Practice
was not soon worn off, for <hi>Michal, David</hi>'s
Wife, kept this piece of Idolatry in her House,
to consult with upon occasion, <hi>1 Sam. 19. 13.</hi>
But when a Reformation was set on foot in
good earnest, these Idolatrous Images immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
vanish'd: Thus we read that when King
<hi>Iosiah</hi> reformed <hi>Israel, he put away from among
them the workers with familiar Spirits, and the
Wizards, and the Images</hi> (or <hi>Teraphim,</hi> as 'tis in
the Original) <hi>and the Idols, and all the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that were spied in the land.</hi> I think it
will not be questioned whether <hi>Teraphim</hi> are
to be taken here in a bad Sense. And that these
were noted Instruments of Idolatry is clear
from <hi>Ezek. 21. 21.</hi> where we read that the
King of <hi>Babylon</hi> being about to use <hi>Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
consulted with the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which
shews plainly what they were. But it may be
objected that the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as in the forenamed place, <hi>Iudg. 17. 5.</hi>
where 'tis said <hi>Micah made an Ephod and a
Teraphim:</hi> And in <hi>Hos. 3. 4.</hi> it is prophesied
that the Israelites <hi>should be without an Ephod
and a Teraphim,</hi> whence some infer that the
former being a thing Lawful, the latter is so
too; the <hi>Ephod</hi> belonged to the True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
therefore the <hi>Teraphim</hi> did. I answer
first, it may be <hi>both</hi> of these were Unlawful
and Idolatrous, for it was the Custom of False
Worshippers to imitate the True ones in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105317:36"/>
some things: And because God appointed his
Priests an <hi>Ephod,</hi> they likewise aped that Holy
Garment, and had a certain Vestment not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to it, which they used in their Idolatrous
Services. This went along with their <hi>Teraphim</hi>
which was a Device of their own, and had no
reference (that we know of) to any thing
made use of by Gods People. If we consult
<hi>Iudges 8. 27,</hi> we shall see a proof of this:
<hi>Ephod</hi> is not here meant of a Holy Garment,
but of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Idolatrous Vestment, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the High Priest's <hi>Ephod.</hi> So in <hi>Iudg.
18. 14.</hi> an <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as things of the same Quality and Kind,
<hi>i. e.</hi> as Idolatrous, yea and thrice more they are
mentioned together, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>v. 17, 18, 20.</hi> In all
which places you may observe, that either
<hi>molten</hi> or <hi>graven Images</hi> are joyned with them,
to convince us yet farther of what nature
they are.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly, Suppose that by <hi>Ephod</hi> in the
latter place, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Hosea,</hi> be meant a Lawful
Garment, even the same which the High
Priest wore by Gods Appointment, yet it
doth not follow from this that the <hi>other thing</hi>
mentioned with it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Teraphim</hi> was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
For in these words of <hi>Hosea</hi> this double
thing is foretold, namely, That the time will
come when God will take away from the
Jews, not only the <hi>True Worship</hi> but the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
one,</hi> which used to be so delightful to
them. The Prophet tells them, That they shall
not only be <hi>without an Ephod,</hi> i. e. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Priesthood and Service, but they shall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105317:37"/>
be <hi>without an Image, i. e.</hi> a Standing Image or
Statue (as the word signifies) such as the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Calf, or the Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
and that they shall be <hi>without Teraphim,</hi> i. e.
Images for Divination: They shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
the Prophane and Idolatrous way of
Worshipping, which was so dear to them. And
this is the very case of that People at this day,
they neither worship the True God after the
Mosaick Appointment (for they are out of a
Capacity of doing it in their present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances)
nor do they serve Idols and fall
down to Images. They have no <hi>Ephod,</hi> and
they have no <hi>Teraphim,</hi> they are without the
Mosaick Worship, and also without the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
and Superstitious Rites to which they
were heretofore accustomed, and in which
they took so great delight. This seems to be
the plain and obvious Sense of the Words,
and any Man may see how directly it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
the Learned Doctor's Opinion.</p>
               <p>I might add, that it is improbable God
would make use of the <hi>Teraphim</hi> (which are
the same with the <hi>Urim</hi> according to this
Worthy Person) as a <hi>Divine Oracle,</hi> seeing
they are originally Superstitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
things, and no other than the common
Instruments of Divination among the Pagans.
I know this Learned Author salves the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
of this, by adding that this was
done wholly in Compliance with the peevish
and hard-hearted Jews, who were to be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
and pleased at that time. But I crave
leave to dissent from this Learned Man here,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105317:37"/>
because I question whether it was worthy of
God to indulge the <hi>Israelites</hi> in these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Superstitions. I refer the Reader to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of another sort in a very<note n="‖" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on Hos. 3. 4.</note> Learned
Writer, who hath largely confuted this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of the <hi>Teraphim</hi> being the same with
the <hi>Urim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pass now to this Reverend Author's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Thummim,</hi> which he holds to be a
thing really different from the <hi>Urim.</hi> He hath
this particular and singular Apprehension of
it, that as <hi>Urim</hi> was fetch'd from <hi>Serapis</hi> an
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Image, so <hi>Thummim</hi> is of the like
Original, for it was an Image made of Precious
Stones, which the High Priests of <hi>Egypt</hi> wore
about their Necks, having <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> written on
it, and therefore it was called <hi>Truth,</hi> as <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Siculus, Aelian,</hi> and others relate. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the Jewish <hi>Thummim</hi> is stiled <hi>Truth</hi> by
the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Against which most ingenious
and plausible Conjecture, which the Author
of it hath adorned with infinite Reading and
Criticism, I make bold to offer a few things,
begging first his pardon for daring to shake so
admirably contrived a Notion. And truly I
am apt to think my self already absolved by
a Person of that famed Ingenuity and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
who as he hath thought fit to depart from
other Writers on this Subject, and hath wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
established a Sentiment of his own, so
he will forgive the Freedom of this <hi>Critical
Essay</hi> which ventures to dissent from that so
Celebrated Hypothesis of his. Briefly then,
whereas he parallels the <hi>Thummim</hi> with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105317:38"/>
                  <hi>Egyptian Ornament,</hi> because, like that, it hung
down by a <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> I humbly conceive
that Text which is alledged in favour of it, is
no positive Proof, <hi>viz. Exod. 28. 22, &amp;c.</hi> for
though it appears thence that the <hi>Breast-plate</hi>
of the Jewish High Priest was fastened to the
Shoulder-pieces of the <hi>Ephod</hi> by Chains and
Rings of Gold, yet there is not a word of the
<hi>Thummim</hi> being fastned to or hanging by any
thing; but 'tis only said in that Chapter that
Moses <hi>shall put in the Breast-plate the Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim.</hi>
And this likewise I offer from these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words, if the <hi>Thummim</hi> was <hi>put in the
Breast-plate,</hi> and lapt up within it, how could
it be a Pendent Image, and how could it be
seen hanging without? Then besides, if this
Image or Jewel called <hi>Thummim</hi> hung dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the High Priest's Breast, it could not
but cover (in part at least) the <hi>Rich Gemms</hi>
in the <hi>Rationale,</hi> and hinder them and their
Curious Engravings from being seen. I only
modestly query whether this be allowable.
And this too is to be thought of, that if the
<hi>Thummim</hi> hung down by a <hi>Chain,</hi> there is the
same reason to assert that the <hi>Urim</hi> did so
too, for the Text speaks of both alike, and so
the Images which were supposed to be shut
up in the warm Folding of the <hi>Pectoral</hi> must
be taken out, and exposed to the Air, and both
they and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Image must hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
on the High Priest's Breast.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If this Excellent Writer will give
me leave to utter my thoughts freely, This
is another reason why I dissent from him, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105317:38"/>
because his Assertion concerning the <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
(as well as the <hi>Urim)</hi> supposes that God
himself imitated the Idolatrous Nations; for
the most Sacred <hi>Thummim,</hi> according to him,
was borrow'd from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
from their Priests; which to me seems
to be not only unworthy of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
but of his High Priest, and of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
instituted by him. Therefore the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Grotius</hi> declares that it is most likely
that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in this (as in other things)
imitated the <hi>Iews.</hi> And the Learned <hi>Isaac
Vossius</hi> acknowledgeth that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> took
this Ornament and the Name of it from the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> as they did many other things. And
he adds that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> consulted this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stone of the High Priest as an <hi>Oracle,</hi>
wherein also they emulated the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
But the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Jews, nay
that God himself, and in a Matter so Solemn
and Sacred, followed the Example of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
<hi>Egyptians</hi> seems to me very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
We read in the Infallible History, that
<hi>the Israelites borrowed of the Egyptians Iewels of
Silver and Gold, and Rayment;</hi> but that the
High Priest of <hi>Israel</hi> borrowed his <hi>Pontifical</hi>
and particularly his <hi>Oracular Habit</hi> from
them I find no where attested: But I read
that God strictly forbad the Jews to use the
Rites of the Pagan Nations, and to follow
their Customs, <hi>After the doings of the Land of</hi>
Egypt, <hi>wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: And
after the doings of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I bring you, ye shall not do, neither shall ye
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105317:39"/>
walk in their Ordinances,</hi> Lev. 18. 3. And it
is the Confession of one of the most Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Rabbies, even that <hi>Moses</hi> of whom
the Jews say, that from <hi>Moses</hi> the Great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
to this <hi>Moses</hi> there never was such
another of that Name: (I say) 'tis his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Acknowledgment, That <hi>the Iewish
Rites prescribed that People by God were not in
imitation of the Pagan Rites, but were in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
opposition to them.</hi> Thus the Famous
<hi>Rambam,</hi> who was celebrated for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Skill in the Jewish Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.
This is all that I have at present to
offer in way of Exception to the Learned
Doctor's Opinion. But though I cannot
yield to be his Proselyte in this Point, yet
I deny not that Others of great Sagacity and
Judgment may see farther into and acquiesce
in so Noble a Discovery: And as for my
own part, I acknowledge most frankly that
I pay a great Veneration to this Excellent
Person, who hath with so great an Amasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning and Variety of Reading,
framed so Delicate a Notion. I admire the
Incomparable Artificer, though I cannot
<hi>altogether</hi> subscribe to his Work.</p>
               <p>You see what have been the Different
Opinions of Writers concerning the <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim:</hi> I will now after all propound
that which I conceive is more eligible than
any of those already named. The High
Priest, the Chief Minister of the Jewish
Church, had eight distinct Garments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was adorned, whence he was called
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105317:39"/>
                  <hi>the Priest</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of many Garments,</hi> to distinguish
him from the other Priests. But of all these
Vestments the <hi>Ephod</hi> was the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and was worn over all the rest:
This had a hole or opening in the fore-part
of it, where was fastned <hi>a piece of Cloth</hi> of
the same work with the Ephod, very richly
embroidered and mixed with Gold. This
Cloth being doubled was Four-square; it
was a Span in length, and of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension
in breadth, <hi>Exod. 28. 15, &amp;c.</hi> This
<hi>Quadrangular Piece</hi> is called the High Priests
<hi>Pectoral</hi> or <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> and it was set with
four Rows of <hi>Precious Stones,</hi> three in a Row,
<hi>i. e.</hi> twelve Stones in all; and on each of
these Stones was engraved one of the <hi>Names
of the Sons of</hi> Israel, from whom the Twelve
Tribes took their Denominations. And this
Square Breast-plate, this Rich Stomacher of
the High Priest was Famous not only for
these Precious Stones and the Ingravings on
them, but also for the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
which were placed here also. Now (to
come to the matter) these were no such Fine
and Rare things as some talk of: Nay, let
me add, they were <hi>no Things</hi> at all, but only
<hi>Words.</hi> I take them to be no other than these
two bare words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> written
or engraven upon the Breast plate. After
all the various Sentiments, Disputes, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Conjectures about this so Famous
and so much Controverted Oracle, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this to be the short, plain and easie
account of it. It was only these two Hebrew
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105317:40"/>
Dissyllables URIM and THUMMIM
(of great Significancy and Importance, as
you shall hear afterwards) placed upon the
High Priests Pectoral. This was all. And
that this Account of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
is as Probable and Reasonable as it is Plain,
I will make appear from these following
Particulars.</p>
               <p>1. There was no room for a pair of
Images or more in the Breast-plate, for it
was but a Span in length and breadth, so
that you cannot conveniently lodge these
little Flying Seraphims in so narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
you will indanger their Wings, or
hurt some of their Tender Members by
trussing them up in so Contracted a Room.
Besides, we must remember, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the foresaid Opinion the <hi>Urim</hi> were
Images of Wax: Now, it was not safe
to lodge these little Waxen Tools in that
Close Folding next the warm and zealous
Breast of the Priest; for by this means
there might be danger of dissolving these
Little Cherubims. But this is prevented
by our Assertion that the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
were not <hi>Things</hi> but <hi>Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Terms whereby it is expressed
in Scripture will bear this Interpretation
very well; for concerning the <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> it is said, <hi>Thou shalt put them in
the Breast-plate;</hi> or according to the Version
of the Seventy,<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt put them upon
it.</hi> And when <hi>Moses</hi> had cloathed <hi>Aaron</hi>
with the Ephod and Breast-plate, it is said
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105317:40"/>
                  <hi>he</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>put upon the Rationale</hi> or <hi>Breast-plate
the Urim and Thummim,</hi> Lev. 8. 8. Now this
without the least Straining may signifie to
us the <hi>Writing</hi> of these words <hi>Urim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> upon the Breast-plate. It is a
general Term, and so may include that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way and manner of <hi>Putting</hi> those
words upon the Pectoral, <hi>viz</hi> by <hi>Writing</hi>
or <hi>Ingraving</hi> them. Nay, if we go to the
<hi>Original,</hi> we shall find that that is as fair
for us, for <hi>Thou shalt give in the Breast-plate,</hi>
&amp;c. (which is the Exact Version according
to the Hebrew) may as well be understood
of <hi>Writing</hi> as any other way. Nay, you
may observe that the word <hi>giving</hi> is used
with reference to <hi>Writing,</hi> in <hi>Esther 3. 14.
The Copy of the Writing for a Commandment
to be given</hi> is as much this,<note n="‖" place="margin">Summa Epistola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c fuit. Vulg. Lat.</note> 
                  <hi>The Summ of
the Writing was, that there should be written
such a Command or Decree. Given</hi> is of the
same import here with <hi>written,</hi> or <hi>engrossed.</hi>
Another place I will produce, to confirm
this Notion which I offer, <hi>viz. Ier. 31. 33.
I will put</hi> (or according to the Hebrew) <hi>I
will give my Law in their inward parts, and
write it in their Heart:</hi> Where you see
<hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Katab</hi> are the same: <hi>I will give</hi>
or <hi>put,</hi> and <hi>I will write,</hi> are Synonimous
Terms; and so in the Greek of the Seventy,
and the<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 8. 10. 10. 16.</note> New Testament (where this place
of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> is quoted) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> answers to
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus you see that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Idiom of the Holy Language
<hi>putting</hi> or <hi>giving</hi> is understood and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105317:41"/>
of <hi>Writing.</hi> To farther this Notion,
I could add, that <hi>Giving</hi> hath the same
Acception in other Tongues, as in the
Greek (besides what hath been said already)
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is equivalent to <hi>Scribere</hi> according to
that of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to
prefer a Bill or Writing against one. And
in the <hi>Latin</hi> 'tis well known that <hi>dare literas</hi>
is meant of <hi>writing Epistles or Letters:</hi> And
in our own Language <hi>dated</hi> or <hi>given</hi> is the
same with <hi>written.</hi> However, 'tis certain
that the Hebrew word <hi>Nathan</hi> is of a very
large Extent in Scripture, and is no less
applicable to <hi>Writing</hi> than to many other
things. Thus in the Text, <hi>Thou shalt give
in the Breast-plate the Urim and Thummim,</hi>
may well be rendred, <hi>Thou shalt write them
in the Breast-plate,</hi> this being one way of
<hi>giving;</hi> for in <hi>Writing</hi> there is something
<hi>put</hi> or <hi>given</hi> into the Writing-Table, Paper,
or Book, or whatever else the Writing
is in.</p>
               <p>3. We read that <hi>This</hi> very thing was
done in the Pontifical Habiliments: <hi>Certain
Words</hi> were <hi>Written</hi> or <hi>Put upon</hi> some part
of the Holy Garments, <hi>Exod. 28. 36, Thou
shalt make a plate of pure Gold, and grave upon
it</hi> HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
Observe here, These words HOLINESS
TO THE LORD were writ on a
Plate, and put on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Forehead. Why
then might not these words URIM
and THUMMIM be written on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and put in the Breast-plate of <hi>Aaron?</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:105317:41"/>
One Writing is a Pattern of the other;
the words URIM and THUMMIM
in the Breast-plate answered to Those
HOLINESS TO THE LORD in
the Head-plate or Mitre. And though they
are not said to be <hi>Graven,</hi> yet it is said they
were <hi>Put upon,</hi> which is a large term, and
comprehends the other.</p>
               <p>4. We have a Parallel place in <hi>Zach.
14. 20, In that day shall there be upon the
Bells of the Horses</hi> HOLINESS UNTO
THE LORD. The Prophet here speaks
of the Glorious days of the Gospel, when
<hi>True Holiness</hi> (which was shadowed forth
by the Mosaick Purifications and Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings)
shall take place in the Church, when
Men shall universally turn to God, and
dedicate themselves wholly to Him and
his Service. True Sanctity shall then be
the Ornament and Lustre of their Lives:
Yea, their very secular and inferior Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
shall be devoted and made Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to Holiness. In that day shall
there be upon the <hi>Bells</hi> or the <hi>Bridles</hi> (so
the Hebrew word signifies likewise) <hi>of the
very Horse, Holiness unto the Lord:</hi> Instead
of their Curious Harness and Trappings,
there shall as it were be written or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon them these words, <hi>Holiness
unto the Lord,</hi> the very words which were
commanded to be written in the Front of
the High Priest's Mitre. This shall be their
Ornament and Bravery. I do not think
(nor doth any Man else, I suppose) that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105317:42"/>
these words shall be <hi>really written</hi> on the
Horses Bells or Bridles, but I alledge this
place for this, that 'tis spoken and expressed
<hi>as if</hi> such words <hi>were written,</hi> because they
were so in effect. The manner of expressing
the thing is that which I observe here as
pertinent to our purpose. Mark! It is not
said <hi>there shall be written</hi> or <hi>ingraven,</hi> but
<hi>there shall be</hi> upon the Bells of the Horses:
And it is not said there shall be <hi>these words,</hi>
but plainly and simply <hi>there shall be</hi> Holiness
to the Lord. So here it is not said, thou
shalt <hi>write,</hi> but thou shalt <hi>put;</hi> and it is not
said, thou shalt put <hi>these words,</hi> but thou shalt
put the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> Yet as in the
former place <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Ingraving</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
so it is here: These Individual
Words <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> are to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
or Ingraven on the High Priests Breast-plate
as the words <hi>Kodesh Laihovah (i. e.</hi>
Holiness to the Lord) were to be seen in
effect written or ingraven on the Trappings
of the Horses.</p>
               <p>5. There is another place of Scripture to
illustrate this, and to let us see that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the words <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were
to be <hi>Written,</hi> though it is not said so in
express terms. <hi>The King of</hi> Babylon <hi>stood
at the parting of the way to use Divination,
he consulted with</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Teraphim. Hebr.</note> 
                  <hi>Images; at his right hand
was the Divination for</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Ezek. 21.
21, 22.</hi> The Preposition <hi>[for]</hi> is not in the
Hebrew Text, but only <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> for here
is described the Pagan way of Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ination,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105317:42"/>
and particularly how the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>
undertook by his Heathen Art to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
the Slaughter and Destruction of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
namely, as <hi>Haman</hi> cast Lots in his
Divining way, to know what days were
fittest and best for the Slaughter of the <hi>Iews.
He commanded Pur (i. e.</hi> the Lot) <hi>to be cast
from day to day,</hi> Esther 3. 7. This sort of
<hi>Divining Lottery</hi> is used here by the King
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who had a <hi>Scheme</hi> before him
(as was the Custom in these cases) of what
he intended to enquire about, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<hi>in his right hand was the Divination
Ierusalem</hi> (so it is in the Hebrew) <hi>i. e. Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
was the Word which was <hi>written</hi> on
that part of the Lots. The meaning then is,
that the Magical Divination or Lottery went
clearly against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that City was to be
destroy'd. This is the short way of Scripture
Expression, <hi>At his right hand was the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
Jerusalem, which more largely should
have been expressed thus, <hi>At his right hand
was the Divination which respected</hi> Jerusalem,
<hi>and to distinguish it from the rest, the word</hi>
[Jerusalem] <hi>was written upon it.</hi> So here, the
like Abbreviating stile is used, <hi>Thou shalt put
the Urim and Thummim in the Breast-plate,
i. e.</hi> Thou shalt distinctly <hi>write down</hi> these
two words <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and then
place them conveniently in that part of the
Ephod.</p>
               <p>6. Let this be considered, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Pen-man of the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> is
very Exact and Particular about all the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105317:43"/>
and Ornaments of the High Priest,
in the <hi>28th</hi> Chapter. How Punctual is he
about the two Great <hi>Onyx stones</hi> on the
Shoulders of the Ephod, from the ninth to
the thirteenth Verse? And the setting of the
<hi>twelve Precious Stones</hi> in the Breast-plate is
precisely described from the seventeenth to
the thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieth Verse. But when he comes to
speak of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> he uses no
Description at all, but only mentions the
<hi>Bare Names Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> whence
any Observing Man may perceive that these
were some Easie and Plain thing, which
needed no Explaining and Inlarging. If it
were not so, we should have the <hi>manner of
the putting of the Urim and Thummim into the
Rationale,</hi> particularly set down, as you see
other things in that Chapter are punctually
described. He that hath any Ingenuity must
needs acknowledge that this makes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
for my Assertion.</p>
               <p>Let me add this, That you read not of any
<hi>Directions</hi> for <hi>preparing</hi> the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi>
which is another Argument that they
were mere Names or Words, that they were
something <hi>Written</hi> only. If they had been
to be made with Art, <hi>viz.</hi> by Ingraving or
Carving, or some other way (as Authors
have supposed) we should have had the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
and the Manner of it set down, at least
in the general, as we read of the Manner of
preparing several things belonging to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and the Mosaick Worship. But we
read of no such thing relating to the <hi>Urim</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:105317:43"/>
and <hi>Thummim:</hi> There is no more said than
barely this, <hi>Thou shalt put them in the Breast-plate.</hi>
What reason then is there to fancy
any other thing than the mere <hi>Writing</hi> of
them?</p>
               <p>8. I offer this to be considered, That <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
hath not a word of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>
though he hath a whole Chapter <hi>(viz.</hi> The
Eighth in his Third Book of Antiquities) of
the Priests and High Priests Garments. His
business was in this place to describe the
Pontifical and Sacerdotal Ornaments, and
therefore if this had been any <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
thing,</hi> he would not have passed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by in silence, especially throughout a whole
Chapter, which is one of the longest he hath
in the Book. Nay afterwards, when in the
next Chapter he falls upon mentioning a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Miracle of the Stones on the High
Priest's Breast; he saith not a Syllable of
this Matter, but only relates how Answer
was given (as he thought) by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
shining of those Stones. Nay further,
this Author had a fair Opportunity again to
mention the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> if they had
been any Notable thing, for in his sixth Book
of the <hi>Iewish War,</hi> chap. 6. he particularly and
distinctly enumerates all the Garments of the
High Priest, and more especially the Rich
Gemms in his Breast-plate; but he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> yea he
doth not so much as name them. Whence 'tis
to be presumed that these were rather <hi>Words</hi>
than <hi>Things,</hi> i. e. That they were these two
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105317:44"/>
words written, and nothing else. If the <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> had been some Great and
Wondrous thing, or if they had been like
any of those things which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us before, this Excellent Man as a
<hi>Faithful Historian</hi> would not have omitted
it, and as he was a <hi>Iew</hi> would not have
passed it by for the Glory of the Nation,
and much more as a <hi>Priest</hi> he would not have
done it for the Honour of his Order.</p>
               <p>9. From the Learned Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Notion
of <hi>Thummim</hi> I may confirm my own, though
a contrary one. He maintains that the Jewish
<hi>Thummim</hi> was borrowed from the Egyptian
High Priest who had a rich Saphire hanging
by a Golden Chain at his Breast, and because
the word <hi>Truth</hi> was Ingraven on it, therefore
the Image it self was called <hi>Truth.</hi> This gives
a fair hint of what I assert, that the <hi>Thummim</hi>
(as well as the <hi>Urim)</hi> was something <hi>written,</hi>
especially if we invert what that Worthy
Person saith, and with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and others
hold, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> borrowed this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
from the <hi>Iews.</hi> Hence we may learn
the true Nature and Quality of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their
imitating the <hi>Iews</hi> in this matter acquaints
us that the <hi>Thummim</hi> was only a <hi>written</hi> or
<hi>ingraved word:</hi> This usage of the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
High Priest, <hi>viz.</hi> of wearing a Jewel at his
Breast, in which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was written, shews
plainly that the Jewish High Priest (from
whom this usage was taken) wore in the
same place something <hi>written</hi> or <hi>ingraven.</hi>
And this was the Hebrew word <hi>Thummim</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:105317:44"/>
(together with the other word <hi>Urim)</hi> which
was thought to signifie <hi>Truth,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
the Seventy Interpreters render it
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus we may partly gather what
the Nature of the <hi>Thummim</hi> among the
<hi>Iews</hi> was, from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> imitation of it.
Their having the word <hi>Truth</hi> written and
made use of by their Chief Minister of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
lets us know that it was but a Copy
of the Hebrew Original, and that the <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
was no other than that very word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the Breast-plate.</p>
               <p>10. The probability of this Opinion is
confirmed from what was said in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into this Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> That several
of the most Learned and Inquisitive Writers
have professed their <hi>Ignorance</hi> as to the
matter which is before us. This seems to
me to be no contemptible Consideration,
but to be something towards a proof of
what I assert. Besides <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> before
mentioned, there are other Hebrew Doctors
that declare they cannot tell what the <hi>Urim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> are.<note n="‖" place="margin">In locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is of this
mind, and so is <hi>R. Abraham Seba,</hi> and if I
had leisure to search into Writers upon this
Subject, I might produce others among the
Circumcised Doctors. These are followed
by many of the Christian Profession, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Cajetan,</hi> a Man of great Search and
Curiosity, who ingenuously professeth he
knoweth nothing of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim.</hi>

of our own hath these words, <hi>To define what
the</hi> Urim <hi>and</hi> Thummim <hi>were is none of my
business, nor indeed dare I attempt that which
hath puzzled all the Learned Men in the
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rld.</hi> This makes for my Opinion, for 'tis
plain that these Learned Writers were not
able to make any Considerable Matter of the
<hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> If they could, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they would have told us of it; If These
had been any Great Thing, they would not
have been silent, but would have laid it open
before us. But in the mean time they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
that which was Plain and Obvious,
they would not take notice of that which
was a <hi>mere Writing,</hi> and no more, as 'tis
most probable these <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
were. These very Words were written,
and put upon or into the Breast-plate, and
that was all, if I mistake not.</p>
               <p>11. That they were <hi>something written</hi> hath
been a Notion not unacceptable to some Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Men, both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> as
you have already heard: And particularly
they thought the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> was the
Name that was written; but there is no
reason given why that Name should be called
the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> However, thus far
I will make use of it, to let you see it was not
thought <hi>Improbable</hi> and <hi>Unreasonable,</hi> that <hi>some
Writing</hi> was here meant; otherwise they
would not have talk'd of the <hi>Tetragrammaton.</hi>
This is a good <hi>Foundation</hi> for my Hypothesis,
which I conceive I have <hi>built upon</hi> with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Arguments already, and am proceeding
to add more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:105317:45"/>12. That passage of <hi>Cyril</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
is very remarkable, who speaking of

hath these words,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <q>He (i. e.

whether they were Stones, or
whether he commanded that

he saith,<note n="‖" place="margin">

                  <q>Whether they were
Stones, or whether those
Words were <hi>written down</hi> as
it were in a Golden Table, I
will not be too Curious in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after.</q> You see the Learned Father
was inclinable to believe that the <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> were only those <hi>two words written</hi>
in some small Table, and so deposited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Breast plate. And the words of this
Pious Writer are the more Considerable,
because he is wont to be very Sagacious in
finding out of Mysteries in the Holy Bible,
and if he had thought the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi>
had been any Mystical and Wonderful
thing, he would certainly have inlarged upon
it; whereas you see he is not averse to the
Assertion I am maintaining, that These Bare
Words were committed to Writing, and
lodged in the Square-piece of the Ephod
(when there was occasion to consult them as
an Oracle; otherwise they were not put
into it) and that is all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:105317:46"/>13. This Opinion was hinted of old by
<note n="‖" place="margin">Quaest. 117 in Exod.</note> St. <hi>Augustine;</hi> it was obscurely glanced at
by<note n="*" place="margin">In Isai.</note>

                  <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew;</hi> and
I find that others of late, as <hi>Salianus, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,

though they are loth to speak out. But <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

à Lapide</hi> seems to be the most positive,
though he saith very little in defence of the
Opinion. He in a manner stands alone in
this Cause, and that without Supporters:
Wherefore I have in this Discourse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to hold him up, of the Success of
which, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>Lastly, This Opinion may justly merit our
Reception upon this account, That hereby
are avoided all the Inconveniencies, Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
Incongruities, Inconsistencies, which
accompany some of the Opinions which I
have named, and which are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Now, if it be said that the <hi>Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
and <hi>Talmudists</hi> are the best Judges in
this Controversie, and that they maintain
quite another thing, the Answer is ready, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>some</hi> of them maintain nothing at all in
this matter (as you have heard) but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
their Ignorance concerning it: And as
for the rest, we have no reason to look upon
them as Able Judges in this Affair, for any
one that hath conversed with the Rabbies,
knows full well that they are the most Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Creatures in Nature. Though as to
some peculiar things they may be profitably
consulted, yet in most they are very Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105317:46"/>
and betray Men to gross Errors and
Falsehoods. <hi>Maimonides</hi> was the only Man
among the Jewish Rabbins that began to
leave off trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng and playing the Fool, saith a
<note n="‖" place="margin">Selden de Dis Syr. Syntag. 2.</note> Great Admirer of Jewish Learning, and
<note n="*" place="margin">Scaliger &amp; Causabon</note> others had said it before him. It is certain
that the Generality of this Tribe are the
most Fabulous, Conceited and Superstitious
Writers under Heaven. Their way is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and feign, and to impose upon the
World: And besides, they monstrously
affect Obscurities, and doat on Mysteries,
and indeed care not for any thing that is
Plain: So that their Opinion is not to be
relied upon.</p>
               <p>If any shall blast the former Assertion as
<hi>Novel,</hi> it must be remembred that <hi>Antiquity</hi>
is not always a Badge of Truth. Besides,
you may perceive by what I have said, that
some of the <hi>Antients,</hi> both Christians and
Jews, were in a fair way to receive this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
but the commonly received Notion
did so biass them, that they became averse to
the espousing of This which is more Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Accountable. Interpreters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
on this place have been always
busie to discover some Great and Wonderful
things in these words, they (as was sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
before) look'd for some Strange and
Mysterious Matter here, and that made them
pass by this Plain and Ordinary thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
That these bare words <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
were written and deposited in the Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
which is a true account of the thing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105317:47"/>
though there were no Antiquity to vouch
it.</p>
               <p>Now, if you ask <hi>how</hi> these words <hi>Vrim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> were witten, whether upon
two Precious Stones distinct from the
Twelve, or on a little Table of thin Gold,
or some other matter, and whether they were
placed in the middle or sides of the <hi>Rationale,</hi>
I declare I have nothing to say to these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I pretend not to decide them. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that there was room enough for them
in that place. And if you ask how the <hi>Answers</hi>
were made by these written Words, how
Affirmative or Negative Responses were
given by them, I am not Solicitous to resolve
you. The Learned Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> hath not told
you how the <hi>Little Images</hi> gave Answer, or
how the <hi>Greater Pendant-Image</hi> did its work:
As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Responses he leaves
it Uncertain. And I may be excused if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
not to acquaint you, How by these
<hi>Written Words</hi> God gave Answer to those
who asked Counsel of him. We are sure He
did give Answer by them, and let that suffice.</p>
               <p>But I have not done yet; I am now to shew
you what These Hebrew Words <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim</hi> signifie; and here we shall find
something worthy of our Remark. The
<hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> and the <hi>Samaritan</hi> retain
These Original Words; so do <hi>Iunius</hi> and
<hi>Tremellius,</hi> the <hi>French Bible,</hi> and our Last
<hi>English Translation.</hi> The <hi>Syriac Verson</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

<hi>Clearness</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> Coverdale <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Perfectness.</hi> The Syriac Version and these
two last give us the <hi>Trust Meaning</hi> of the
words <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> but the <hi>Most
Exact</hi> rendring of all is that of <hi>Pagnine, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi>
and <hi>Perfections,</hi> for the Hebrew
words are in the Plural Number. First, The
proper Signification of<note n="‖" place="margin">from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> illuxit.</note> 
                  <hi>Vrim</hi> is <hi>Lights</hi> or
<hi>Illuminations.</hi> Now <hi>Light</hi> is in the Sacred
Scripture put for Knowledge, and therefore
God is called <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> because
Reason and Understanding, and the Product
of these Knowledge (as well as other <hi>good
and Perfect Gifts) come down from Him.</hi> The
Soul is illuminated with Divine Knowledge,
the Will of God is taught and manifested by
this, and so this is reconcilable both with the
Septuagint and Vulgar Version, <hi>[Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Doctrin]</hi> for this <hi>Light manifesteth</hi>
and <hi>teacheth.</hi> Secondly, The most proper and
genuine rendring of <hi>Thummim</hi> (being in the
Plural also) is <hi>Perfections</hi> or <hi>Integrities;</hi> for
both these meet in one, and are denoted by
that Original Word, as the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies both <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Vpright.</hi>
This is the True account of the Hebrew
words <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us see what these relate to: It is
certain that there is a Spiritual Meaning in
most of the Mosaical Appointments and
Rites. Is there not Reason then to think that
<hi>These Words</hi> which were commanded to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105317:48"/>
put into the High Priests Breast-plate, that
these <hi>Sacred Characters</hi> which were written
at first with Gods own hand (it is probable)
as the Moral Law was, represent unto us
something that is Spiritual and Mystical?
First then, These relate to the <hi>High Priest
and the Holy Function of the Ministry.</hi> Those
who are appointed to this Office are <hi>the
Lights of the World:</hi> And they must be (as it
was said of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist) <hi>Burning and
Shining<note n="†" place="margin">

                        </gap> vel <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> uro, luceo.</note> Lights.</hi> They must with Zeal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and Instruct the People, they must <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten,</hi>
and at the same time <hi>Warm</hi> Mens
Minds. And the <hi>Thummim</hi> must be the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Companion of <hi>Vrim, i. e.</hi> They must
be Men of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Vprightness, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which are also called <hi>Truth,</hi>
and so the Translation of the Seventy is very
Agreeable, who render <hi>Thummim Truth.</hi> The
short is, That those who are employ'd in the
Sacred Ministry, must <hi>speak as the Oracles of
God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 11. They must deliver Gods
Word Plainly, Impartially, Faithfully, Truly,
and they must add Integrity of Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which make them in some measure <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
Secondly, These words relate to <hi>the Law
of God,</hi> which is so often called a <hi>Light. Thy
word</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>is a Lamp to my feet,
and a Light unto my path,</hi> Psal. 119. 105. <hi>The
Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light,</hi>
saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 6. 23. Therefore it is said,
<hi>The Commandment of the Lord enlightens the
Eyes,</hi> Psal. 19. 8. And in <hi>Psal. 119. 130. It giveth
Light.</hi> The same Inspired Person tells us, That
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105317:48"/>
                  <hi>the Law of the Lord is Perfect,</hi> Psal. 19. 7. And
it is This Divine Law which the Psalmist
calls <hi>the Truth,</hi> Psal. 119. 142. So that you see
the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> may relate to This.
Yea, as they refer to this <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Will of God,</hi>
the <hi>Revelation</hi> of it may be signified by <hi>Light,</hi>
and the <hi>Effecting</hi> and <hi>Accomplishing of it</hi> may
be signified by <hi>Perfection.</hi> Thirdly, They have
respect to a Higher Matter, they represent
and set forth <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our High Priest. <hi>He
is the True Light which lighteth every Man
that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1. 9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he calls himself <hi>The Light of the World,</hi>
John 8. 12. When this arose the Shadows fled
away, Darkness and Night vanished, and all
became Clear and Bright. This <hi>Sacred Oracle,</hi>
which was represented by That in <hi>Aaron</hi>'s
Pectoral, did not speak Ambiguously, but
Plainly and Distinctly, we are by it taught
what we must believe, and what we must do.
He is <hi>Truth it self</hi> as well as <hi>Light;</hi> he is of
such <hi>Faithfulness</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> that he will not
deceive us. In this Infallible Oracle <hi>Doctrin</hi>
and <hi>Truth, Light</hi> and <hi>Integrity, Illumination</hi> and
<hi>Perfection</hi> meet together. The Jewish <hi>Vrim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> were lost at the Captivity of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and wanting at the Peoples Return,
<hi>Ezra 2. 63.</hi> neither do we find that God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by them any more. But <hi>Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Word,</hi> is a Never<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>failing Oracle, and shall
indure for ever. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fullness
of the Godhead bodily: And we also are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
in him who is the head,</hi> Col. 2. 9, 10.

Whence we may conclude, That
the <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Ingraving</hi> of these was all
that <hi>Moses</hi> here meant, and consequently that
those Writers have mistaken the Text, who
have imagined that some <hi>Precious Stones</hi> or

the High Priest Pectoral, and that they are

               <p>THis Remarkable Vow of <hi>Iephthah,</hi>
and the Manner of the performing
of it, have frequently employed the
Thoughts and Pens of the Learned, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their different Apprehensions of
the Words, have decided this Controversie
in a different manner. Some confidently
assert, that <hi>Iephthah</hi> did not Sacrifice his
Daughter, but others on the contrary main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that he did. And besides this, there is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105317:50"/>
another Question on supposal that he did
Sacrifice her, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it was well done
of him or no? These are the Particulars
which will fall under our Enquiry at present,
but especially I shall entertain the Reader
with the latter of them, and there endeavour
to shew what was the Rise of this Inhumane
and Extravagant Action, and what Reason
may be given why this Generous Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
this Noble Warrior was so eager of
shedding the Blood even of his own Daughter,
yea when it was so absolutely contrary to the
Law which this Great Man could scarcely
be ignorant of. Here I hope to give some
light to this Controverted Cause, by assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the True Spring of that Strange Action,</hi> and
by discovering what was the <hi>Over-ruling
Design of Providence</hi> in it, which hath not
been enquired into by others (that I have
met with) on this Subject.</p>
               <p>But first, Let us hear what those say who
embrace the <hi>Negative,</hi> viz. That <hi>Iephthah</hi>
did not Sacrifice his Daughter. To make
this good, they hold that there are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
parts of the Vow: 1. <hi>Whatsoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth of the doors of my House to meet me,
shall surely be the Lords. 2. I will offer it up
for a Burnt-offering.</hi> And they put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
thus, <hi>Whatsoever cometh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be the Lords, or I will offer it up,</hi> &amp;c. They
read <hi>Or</hi> instead of <hi>And,</hi> for the <hi>Copulative
Vau</hi> (they say) is sometimes <hi>Disjunctive</hi> in
Scripture, and so it is here in this Vow, the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Particle which is here translated
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105317:50"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> should be rendred <hi>or;</hi> for <hi>Iephtha</hi>'s words
are to be taken <hi>Disjunctively,</hi> and his Vow
was no other than this, Whatever I first
meet with coming out of my House, shall
<hi>either</hi> be dedicated to the Lord, <hi>or</hi> I will
Sacrifice it for a Burnt-offering. It was a
<hi>Conditional Vow,</hi> i. e. If it were a thing fit
to be Sacrificed he would Sacrifice it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
not, he would Dedicate and Consecrate
it to God, or something in the lieu of it.
If a Dog or an Ass had been first met by
him, he was not ingaged to Sacrifice them.
Neither if he met with a Man or a Woman,
was he bound to offer them in Sacrifice;
but only he was to act according as the
Creature was which he met with. Now
<hi>Iephthah,</hi> they say, performed the first part
of his Vow, and that was sufficient. He offered
and Consecrated his Daughter to the Lord,
he devoted her to a Virgin-State all her Life,
which appears from the Connection of those
words, <hi>He did according to his Vow; and she
knew not a Man,</hi> v. 39. One is Exegetical of
the other; which sheweth that <hi>Iephthah</hi> kept
his Vow in separating his Daughter to a
single Life for ever. She was not Properly,
but Metaphorically Offered and Slain, <hi>i. e.</hi> she
was to keep her Virginity perpetually. This
Civil Death passed upon her.
Which is confirmed by what
you read in <hi>v. 40. The Daughters
of</hi> Israel <hi>went yearly to</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105317:51"/>
Whence they gather that <hi>Iephthah</hi> did not
Sacrifice his Daughter, but only made her a
kind of a Nun; in some solitary place he
secluded her from all Society, excepting
that the Daughters of <hi>Israel</hi> were permitted
to go and spend three or four days in a Year
in Lamenting and Condoling her perpetual
Virginity, and in Talking and Conferring
with her, and in Comforting her concerning
her Solitary Condition, and her being kept
from Marriage. Thus her Life was spared,
she fell not a Sacrifice, but was Consecrated
to God and his Service, she was devoted to
a single Life, and was to remain a Recluse
all her days. This was the opinion of <hi>R.
Kimchi</hi> and some other Jewish Expositors;
and they are followed not only by some of
the<note n="‖" place="margin">Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin, Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Pontificians</hi> (who perhaps might think

of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others, and with more reason,
are for the <hi>Affirmative, viz.</hi> That <hi>Iephthah</hi>
really sacrificed his Daughter. For what is,
or can be more plain, than that in <hi>v. 39.
He did with her according to his Vow which
he had vowed?</hi> What was this Vow?
There is all the Difficulty. And yet, if you
enquire narrowly into it, you will find that
the Difficulty vanisheth; for the Vow is
very plain and intelligible, <hi>Whatsoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth of the doors of my House to meet me,
shall surely be the Lords, and I will offer it up
for a Burnt-offering.</hi> He saith <hi>whatsoever,</hi>
which shews that it was no <hi>Conditional Vow,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105317:51"/>
(as those of the other side pretend) but an
Absolute one. He unadvisedly made a
Vow to Sacrifice <hi>whatsoever</hi> he met in his
return from the Battle, if he proved a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
When the Vow is thus <hi>Large</hi> and
<hi>General,</hi> it is ridiculous to think or say the
contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a <hi>Conditional Vow,</hi>
and it is as irrational to distinguish between
a <hi>Copulative</hi> and a <hi>Disjunctive Vau</hi> in this
place; though 'tis granted that in some other
Texts it is allowable, because the very Sense
and Meaning of the words direct us, yea
constrain us to it; but here is no occasion
for it in the least. Wherefore this nice
distinguishing between one <hi>Vau</hi> and the other,
and between <hi>Offering to the Lord</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing,</hi>
is altogether groundless, and you may
see it cashiered by what is expresly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the following Narrative in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
for 'tis positively said, that <hi>Iephthah</hi>
upon his return home and meeting his
Daughter<note n="*" place="margin">V. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Rent his Cloaths.</hi> What was
the reason of this? If his Vow had been
Conditional or Disjunctive, (as some would
have it) there was no ground at all for this
his Behaviour; there was no occasion of
Sorrow and Distraction if the Sacrificing
his Daughter were not included in his
Vow, if it were in his choice to offer her
to the Lord <hi>(i. e.</hi> to dedicate her to him)
or to Sacrifice her on the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar; yea if he
were at liberty by vertue of his Vow to
kill a Beast instead of his own Child. If
the case was thus, he had no reason to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105317:52"/>
and <hi>rend his Cloaths,</hi> to vex and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
himself, which we find him doing here.
But it is plain by this Action of his, that
things were otherwise with him, and that
he had some Dreadful and Fatal Tidings to
impart to his Daughter which were real
matrer of Lamentation, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of his Vow which so nearly concerned
her Life, were the cause of his Trouble
and Sorrow. This appears from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<note n="*" place="margin">V. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Alas, my Daughter</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou

the direful News to her, <hi>I have
opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot
go back.</hi> It happeneth indeed to be a very
Sad and Deplorable Vow which I made,
but I am ingaged to keep it, and I am fully
resolved that I will. Whereupon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive

                  <hi>My

who mercifully covered thy Head in

before she left the World.<note n="*" place="margin">V. 37.</note>

months, that I may go up and down upon the
Mountains, and bewail my Virginity, I and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105317:52"/>
my Fellows.</hi> As much as if she had said,
Seeing thou, O my Father, hast determined
that I shall be offered up unto the Lord for
a Burnt-offering according to the Tenor of
the Vow which thou madest in the day of
the Distress, I beg but this one thing of
thee, that thou wouldest vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
me for a little time, I desire only that
I may be permitted to retire with a few of
my Female Acquaintance into some Solitary
place, that I and they may joyn together in
Mourning, and lament this unhappy Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mine, <hi>viz.</hi> That I must not live to
be acquainted with the Joys of a Conjugal
State, nor be a Joyful Mother of Children,
(as I have sometimes wished, because Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
is accounted a Curse) but that I must
Expire a Virgin, and die Ingloriously, and
leave no Off-spring behind me. <hi>Iephthah,</hi>
as soon as she made known this her request
to him, most willingly granted it, and wished
with all his heart he could have granted her
more.<note n="*" place="margin">V. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>He said, Go, and he sent her away
for two Months: And she went with her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and bewailed her Virginity on the
Mountains.</hi> And then the History imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after this tells us, That<note n="*" place="margin">V. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>at the end
of two Months she returned to her Father,
who did with her according to his Vow which
he had vowed:</hi> That is, he of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ered her up
unto the Lord for a Burnt-offering, for that
was his Vow.</p>
               <p>One would think now that there should
be no Dispute whether <hi>Iephthah</hi> Sacrificed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105317:53"/>
his Daughter; for what reason can Men
have to oppose the express words of the
Text? These are so plain that it cannot but
create some wonder, why Expositors should
vary in the Interpretation of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. Or,
suppose there be some Ambiguous Words
in the Relation, which seem to disagree
with what is here said; yet for that very
reason, because they are Doubtful and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,
we are not to make use of them
to confront a Plain Text. It is true, it is
added in the last mentioned Verse, <hi>She knew
no Man:</hi> And indeed how could she when
she was taken out of the Land of the Living?
Observe the Connection, <hi>He did with his
Daughter according to his Vow, and she knew
no Man:</hi> That is, She was so Unhappy as
to leave the World in her Youth before she
had the Knowledge of a Man. Hereupon
it immediately follows, (which verifies and
confirms this Interpretation) <hi>It was a custom
in</hi> Israel, <hi>that the Daughters of</hi> Israel <hi>went
yearly to lament the Daughter of</hi> Jephthah <hi>four
days in a year.</hi> This doth not imply that she
was Alive, and that they went duly to give
her a Visit in the Mountains. No, These
words plainly relate the Behaviour of her
Surviving Companions; they brought it into
a Custom and Constant Practice among the
Daughters of <hi>Israel,</hi> to go yearly and lament
her Memory in that very place where she
chose to bewail her Condition before her
Death. Or, if they went to <hi>talk and confer</hi>
(as it may be rendred according to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105317:53"/>
Acception of the Hebrew word) the Sense
is the same, for the meaning is not that they
talked with Her, but with one another;
they discoursed among themselves of that
Deplorable Matter, of that Unfortunate
Occurrence. I joyn both the Senses of the
word together thus, At that Anniversary
Meeting they <hi>talked</hi> of and <hi>lamented,</hi> they
<hi>lamented</hi> and <hi>talked of</hi> the Sad Fate of that
Royal Virgin, who was snatched away in
her Prime, and denied the Blessing of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and of bearing Children. This was the
Compliment of Condoleance which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
upon her Death. This is the plain
History without wresting it; and nothing
is more clear from the whole than this, that
<hi>Iephthah</hi> slew his Daughter, and offered her
for a Burnt-offering, and that it was the
True and Real Import of his Vow that he
would do so. He vowed that he would
Sacrifice to the Lord whatsoever he met
coming out of his House: He met his
Daughter, and accordingly <hi>he did with her
according to his Vow, i. e.</hi> he Sacrificed her.
The Famous<note n="‖" place="margin">Ioseph. Ant. Iud. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 9.</note> Jewish Historian gives his

Rabbi,</hi> who had been once of another

performing of his Vow, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the plain and literal meaning of it,
<hi>viz.</hi> The real and actual Sacrificing of his
Daughter.</p>
               <p>The next Question is, Whether <hi>Iephthah</hi>
did well or ill in so doing: Or, which
amounts to the same, Whether it was lawful
to Sacrifice his Daughter? Some think (and
what will not they think?) that it was a Good
and Lawful Deed, and to this purpose they
alledge <hi>Lev. 27. 28, 29. Notwithstanding,
no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto
the Lord, of all that he hath, both of man and
beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be
sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most
holy to the Lord. None devoted, which shall
be devoted of men, shall be redeemed: but shall
surely be put to death. Iephthah</hi>'s Vow, say
they, was of this sort, and he could not
possibly Redeem his Daughter, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to Sacrifice her. That known
Critick<note n="*" place="margin">Diatrib. de Voto Iepht.</note> 
                  <hi>Lewis Cappel</hi> runs altogether upon
this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was lawful by the Law of
<hi>Cherem</hi> to Sacrifice this Innocent Maid: But
this Learned Man was never so overseen and
mistaken as in this Cause, for 'tis certain that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105317:54"/>
                  <hi>Cherem,</hi> which is the word here used, always
signifies either <hi>Persons</hi> devoted to Slaughter,
destined to Death for their <hi>Execrable Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi>
(as the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and those other
People and Nations which the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
commanded to put to death) or it signifies
<hi>Things</hi> destined to utter Destruction, as
<hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ai,</hi> &amp;c. with all the Substance
that was found in them, excepting some
particular things which God ordered to be
spared. And these <hi>Things</hi> were thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
for the sake of the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom
they appertained, who were extreamly
<hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Abominable</hi> in the Eyes of God.
This is the true Notion of <hi>Cherem</hi> (of which
I shall give you a farther account in a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Discourse.) And as for the Law of
<hi>Cherem,</hi> which is set down in that forecited
place in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> it speaks only of that Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
Vow of Destining Persons or Cities
to utter Destruction (as in <hi>Numb. 21. 32.
Deut. 13. 15. 25. 19. Iosh. 6. 17, 18. 1 Sam.
15. 3.)</hi> for their horrid Crimes, and because
indeed there was the particular command
of God for it. Now let any Man judge
whether this hath any reference to <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s
Innocent and Harmless Daughter. The Law
saith, no Person or thing devoted of Men
<hi>(i. e.</hi> by Men) shall be redeemed, but shall
surely be put to Death, or be destroyed.
But then let it be remembred that no Men
can devote any <hi>Persons</hi> to Death, unless
they deserve it for their Excessive Impiety;
nor can they devote any <hi>Thing</hi> to Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105317:55"/>
unless it be on the account of such
Persons. This therefore doth no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
our present Business. <hi>Iephthah</hi> could
not lawfully Vow the Death of any one
who deserved not to be put to death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Daughter was no <hi>Cherem,</hi> no <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi>
no <hi>Devoted Wretch.</hi> This Law of
<hi>Cherem</hi> or <hi>Anathema</hi> gave the Jews no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to turn Assassines and Cut-throats,
and to take away the Lives of their own
Children: Of which<note n="*" place="margin">De Iure Nat. &amp; Gent. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 11.</note> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and other
Learned Men were so convinced, that upon
this very account they assert (and think they
prove) that <hi>Iephthah</hi> did not offer up his
Devoted Daughter in Sacrifice. But, by their
leave, all that they prove hence is this, that
<hi>he should not</hi> have done it. Besides, this sort
of Vows called <hi>Cherems,</hi> was to be made by
particular Warrant from God, who is Lord
and Disposer of Life and Death, and can

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>struction whom
and what he pleaseth: But we read of no
Warrant that <hi>Iephthah</hi> had to Vow the
Death of his Daughter, much less to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to Execution; therefore it was direct
Murder to put her to Death. And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
as to <hi>Sacrificing</hi> her, that was a most
Inhumane, Horrid and Barbarous Act, and
expresly forbid of God, and hated by him.
<hi>Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God, thou
shalt not burn thy Sons and thy Daughters in
the fire,</hi> as the Heathens used to do to their
Gods: <hi>For every abomination to the Lord
which he hateth, have they done,</hi> Deut. 12. 31.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105317:55"/>
For <hi>Iephthah</hi> then to Vow the <hi>Sacrificing</hi> of
his Daughter, was so far from being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law, and Acceptable to God,
that it was an <hi>Abomination</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>Yea, some of the very <hi>Pagans</hi> themselves
thought such-an Act as this to be Unlawful:
Thus<note n="*" place="margin">In vit. Pelopidae.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> being
commanded in a Dream to Sacrifice his
Daughter, refused to do it; and that when
<hi>Pelopidas</hi> in a Vision was bid to Sacrifice
a Virgin, he look'd on it as a Severe and
Impious Command. <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> it is true,
Sacrificed his own Daughter, but even a
Prophane and Atheistical Poet could blame
him for it, crying out against his<note n="*" place="margin">Tantum religio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit suade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re malorum <hi>Lucret. l.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Religion,</hi> as the ill Motive which
prompted him to so vile a Practice. Yea
it is probable that <hi>This</hi> is the very Instance
which I am now treating of: <hi>Iphigenia</hi> was
<hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Daughter, for the Greeks mistook
<hi>Iphigenia</hi> for <hi>Iephthigenia,</hi> which plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>the Daughter of</hi> Jephthah: And <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
was mistaken for <hi>Iephthah,</hi> for he
being a known Man in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars,
which were in <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s time (as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Chronology have agreed) it was
easie for the Poets to take one Warlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or Great Captain for another, and to
represent the History of <hi>Iephthah</hi> under the
Name of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> (as I shall shew at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time, it was the common use of the
Poets, to disguise Passages of Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
with Fables and Prophane Names,)
particularly as for this <hi>Sacrificing of his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105317:56"/>
Daughter,</hi> it being so Remarkable but yet
so Infamous an Act, it is certain that it was
spread abroad and known among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and could not but be abhorred by all
Persons of Sobriety and Reason: So far is
it from being allowed by a Particular Law
of God, as some pretend.</p>
               <p>Again, There are <hi>Others,</hi> who that they
may effectually prove the Lawfulness of this
Fact, tell us, it was done by the particular
Instinct of the Holy Spirit, that <hi>Iephthah</hi>
was immediately stirred up by God to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
this singular Enterprize, which in
others would have been unlawful.<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. ad Iulian.</note> St. <hi>Ierom</hi>
of old seem'd to be of this mind and <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> afterwards was enclined to think the
same, but he presently corrected himself.
And truly no less could be expected from
him, for it is a very near approach to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
to say that so Wicked a Perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was by favourable Instinct from God
himself, especially when he hath so <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
forbidden it, as you heard in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
particular. Indeed from what I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
there, this Bold Opinion is sufficiently
confuted, for if Sacrificing his Daughter was
downright Murther, and was a Breach of
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, and of the Law of Nature,
then it is intolerable Folly and Presumption
to plead for the Lawfulness of it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if there had been here a Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse,
or a Particular Command from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
(as in the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who
was bid to do what he did, and that for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105317:56"/>
Trial only) he would not have <hi>rent his
Cloaths</hi> and been troubled, but he would have
likewise check'd his Daughters Sorrow (as
well as his own) by declaring that his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to Sacrifice her was from a particular
Dictate which he received from Heaven:
Thus we have reason to reject the Opinion
of those Men who hold that <hi>Iephthah</hi> sinned
not in Sacrificing his Daughter, for neither
of the Arguments which they alledge have
any Truth and Reality in them; there was
no Express Law of God, nor any Divine
Instinct in the case. Wherefore we may
safely and confidently aver with the Great
<hi>Iewish Antiquary</hi> before cited, That<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq. Iud. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>the
Sacrifice which</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ephthah <hi>offered was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
nor acceptable to God,</hi> but that on the
contrary it was Unlawful and Sinful. And
so most of the Antient Fathers of the Church,
who have spoken of this, do assert.</p>
               <p>But here we may be thought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a great streight in maintaining
this Post; for if all Humane Slaughter was
forbid by God, and is against Nature, and
is utterly Unlawful and Vicious, how came
<hi>Iephthah</hi> to commit this Fact? What made
him act so Strangely? What could be the
Motive to so Horrid an Enterprize? If it
was so Gross an Enormity, how can we
think this Great Man, this Judge with his
High Priest and Priests about him, yea and
the whole Sanhedrim to advise him, could
be guilty of such a Vile and Notorious
Crime as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:105317:57"/>Here then I am to give an Account why
and whence it was that <hi>Iephthah</hi> acted thus
Extravagantly and (as it may seem) profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gately;
and I hope it will not be offensive,
if I take liberty to dissent from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Writers in this matter: For though
I agree with those who hold that <hi>Iephthah</hi>
sacrificed his Daughter, and that he did very
ill in it, yet I differ from them in the
<hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Occasion</hi> of it; which is the
thing I will now insist upon, and for which
I chiefly designed this Discourse.</p>
               <p>They attribute it to <hi>the Corruption of that
Age,</hi> telling us that very Strange and Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
things were done in those days, as
the Book of <hi>Iudges</hi> expresly relates. And
moreover they add that <hi>Iephthah</hi> herein
followed the Examples that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, for Humane Sacrifices were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
offered by the Heathens that dwelt
in <hi>Palestine, Deut. 12. 31. Their Sons and
their Daughters they burned in the fire to their
Gods,</hi> and particularly we read that the
<hi>Ammonites</hi> offered their Children to <hi>Moloch</hi>
in the Flames. Nay it cannot be denied
that this Horrid and Bloody Idolatry was
practised by some of the <hi>Israelites</hi> a little
before <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s time, <hi>Iudges</hi> 1. 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>Psalm</hi> 106. 37. Much less can it
be denied, that afterwards there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Examples of this Effusion of Humane
Blood, and Sacrificing of Men and Women,
of which I shall speak in another place.
But though Example is strong, and hath a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105317:57"/>
very great Empire over our Minds, yet I
cannot be induced to believe that <hi>this</hi> was
the Ground of <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Sacrificing his
Daughter. This Good and Vertuous Man
(for he is signally represented to future Ages
as such by St. <hi>Paul)</hi> would not be led to this
Flagitious Action by the Example of some
Wild Insidels, or a few Besotted <hi>Israelites,</hi>
who were forsaken of God, and became
professed Votaries to the Infernal Daemons,
and having given Themselves, proceeded to
offer their Children (who were parts of
them) to these Hellish Ghosts. I cannot
think therefore that this was the reason of
<hi>Iephthah</hi>'s committing this worst kind of
Homicide: This was not, this could not be
Motive strong enough to prevail upon this
Worthy Man, this Noble Hero; he would
easily have baffled such a Scandalous and
Horrid Temptation as this. As bad as those
times were, as degenerate as <hi>Israel</hi> was in
those days, it is not credible that such a
Person, and in such Circumstances (which
could not but make him willing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
from his Vow, if it were possible)
would tamely follow the Example of the
most Accursed Idolaters, of the worst and
vilest Miscreants in the World, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
Massacre his only Child. This must
not, this cannot enter into our thoughts, unless
at the same time we banish thence all sober
Reason.</p>
               <p>But they likewise impute it to the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of that Age.</hi> The Priests, say they,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105317:58"/>
were Strangers to their own Law, and
knew it not. Hence it was that they thought
that by the Law in <hi>Lev. 27. 28. Iephthah</hi>'s
Daughter was a <hi>devoted Person,</hi> and so <hi>could
not be redeemed,</hi> but must be put to Death.
I do not wholly exclude the Ignorance of
that Age, which was an attendant (if not a
Cause in part) of their General Corruption:
But it is highly improbable that none of the
Sacred Function should understand this Case
that was before them, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
it, <hi>The Sanhedrim was now sitting,
and there was the Priesthood attending on the
Ark at</hi> Shiloh, <hi>and yet is</hi> Israel <hi>now so little
acquainted with the Law, that neither the
Sanhedrim nor the Priests can resolve</hi> Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah
<hi>that his Vow might have been redeemed.</hi>
I cannot perswade my self that they could
All of them err so grosly, and that in so
plain a Matter, wherein they were directed
not only by the Positive Law of God, but
by that of Nature and Reason. But I rather
think that there was more of Neglience
than Ignorance in the present Miscarriage:
The Priests of that degenerate Age were
grown Careless and Unconcerned: They
were not Solicitous to instruct this Prince
aright, and to conduct his Conscience by
right and steady Measures in this present
Case of the Vow which he had made.
They could not (as I conceive) be ignorant
of the Unlawfulness of this Vow, and of
the Greater Unlawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lness of putting his
Daughter to Death: But herein they were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105317:58"/>
most shamefully defective, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to inform this Doubting and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
Man, and to convince him of the
Unreasonableness of his too forward Zeal.</p>
               <p>Which brings me to that which I intend
more largely to insist upon, <hi>viz.</hi> The True
Source and Original of this Extravagant
and Bloody Act of our Renowned <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah.</hi>
It was, as I apprehend, his too <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Zeal</hi> that pushed him on to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Undertaking. To make good this
Assertion, I must tell you that I have this
Idea of-him, That he was a <hi>Man of a very
Religious and Pious Disposition;</hi> which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
it self at his first publick appearing
for his Country-men; for I observe that he
then applied himself to ask Council of God,
<hi>Iudges 10. 17. 11. 11.</hi> When he undertook
to fight their Battles, this was the first thing
he did. He opened the Campagne well, for
he began with God. Likewise I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that he shewed himself very Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in his Treaty with and offers of Peace
to the <hi>Ammonites</hi> before he proceeded to
any Acts of Hostility, <hi>Chap. 11. 12,</hi> &amp;c.
He was pleased to give them some account
of his marching against them, though he
needed not have done it: He laboured to
convince them that it was a Just and Lawful
War which he was undertaking, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he sacredly appeals to <hi>the Lord</hi>
as <hi>Iudge</hi> in this Quarrel, <hi>v. 27.</hi> When he
had thus quitted himself like a <hi>Religious and
Iust Man,</hi> it is expresly said, <hi>The Spirit of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105317:59"/>
the Lord came upon him,</hi> v. 29. That is, he
was extraordinarily stir'd up by God, and
animated to engage the Enemy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to Obedience and Submission.
A Person of so Holy and Pious Inclinations
was assisted and blessed by God in a signal
and eminent manner. But behold yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Argument and Demonstration of his
Godly Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Solemn Vow</hi> that he
made; for this proceeded purely from a
Good and Religious Heart, from an ardent
Desire and Intention of giving Honour to
God upon his obtaining a Victory. All
these Instances are Proofs of what I asserted,
That this <hi>Mighty Man of War</hi> (as he is
<note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 11. 1.</note> called) was <hi>a Man of as great Religion
and Goodness.</hi> Which is farther confirmed
by the Testimony of the Infallible<note n="‖" place="margin">Heb. 11. 32</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
who reckons this <hi>Iephthah</hi> among the
Holy Patriarchs, Prophets and Eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, whose <hi>Faith</hi> had made them
known and Famous in the World.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid my Foundation (which
is grounded on the History of <hi>Iephthah</hi>
both in the Old and New Testament) I am
to raise my Superstructure, which is this,
This Conscientious and Good Man having
with a Pious Intention made a <hi>Vow,</hi> but
having been Rash and Indiscreet in the
Wording and Framing of it, was unhappily
drawn into a Snare, and his own Religious
Temper and Active Zeal hastned him into
it: And <hi>this</hi> I take to be the true Spring
and Motive of his strange Acting, <hi>i. e.</hi> Of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105317:59"/>
his bereaving his Daughter of her Life.
He being a Person of a very Sensible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
of a Soft and Tender Spirit, thought
verily that he ought to perform his <hi>Vow,</hi>
and accordingly did so. In this he shewed
a very Singular Zeal, but not according to
knowledge: So that we have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he sinned out of <hi>Blind Zeal</hi> to
perform his Promise and Vow which he had
solemnly made to God. This was a great
Fault, an heinous Error, but it was one on
the right hand, and therefore the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.
This invites me to mention his
Name and Memory with Honour, and to
remember that he was one of those who
are <hi>righteous overmuch</hi> (as the Wise Man
speaks:) He was too Zealous in pursuit of
his Vow, although it was a Rash and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
one as to the manner of it, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Innocent Daughter became a
Victim, <hi>viz.</hi> for the sake of his <hi>Vow.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his case was to be pitied and lamented,
for his Fault was the product of his Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning,
and of his Great Care to keep a
Good Conscience. He saw it was usual
with Good Men to<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 28. 20. Num. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>make Vows,</hi> and in a
mistaken Imitation of them he turned a
Solemn Votary, and in the sight and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all Persons that were about him, as
well as before the All seeing God, promised
the Sacrificing of his Daughter, for it was
so in effect, she being included in <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
cometh forth of the doors of his House to
meet him.</hi> The Sense of this most Solemn
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105317:60"/>
Act of Religion (for such a <hi>Vow</hi> is, which
is a Promissory Oath made unto God) was
so vigorous on his mind, that he could not
possibly divert the thoughts of it, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
himself that he could any ways be
excused from acting according to what he
had vowed. This is to be imputed to <hi>the
Reverence of an Oath,</hi> which hath ever been
very Great and Awful.</p>
               <p>We see in that Noted Instance of the
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> what was thought concerning this
kind of Obligation, though it was by Craft
and Imposture: <hi>We have sworn unto them by
the Lord God of</hi> Israel: <hi>Now therefore we
may not touch them,</hi> Joshua 9. 19. It is not
improbable that <hi>Iephthah</hi> bore this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in his mind, and indiscreetly made
use of it on this occasion which I am now
speaking of: He thence confirmed himself
in the Apprehensions he had of that Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Tye he was under by reason of his
<hi>Vow.</hi> He thought it was so far from being
a Sin to keep his Promise made to God,
that he reckoned it his indispensable Duty:
And this false Perswasion hurried him on
to this vile Act. So in other Examples in
the Sacred History, we see what a Regard
and Reverence Men had of an <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Vow,</hi>
yea though it was in it self unlawful: Thus
<hi>Saul</hi> having rashly but solemnly vowed in
the day of Battle, that the Person should
die who tasted any Food before the Pursuit
was quite over; his own Son <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
who had so signalized his Valour at that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105317:60"/>
time, by vanquishing Threescore thousand
<hi>Philistines,</hi> had like to have been a Sacrifice
(as <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Daughter here) after the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
because <hi>Saul</hi> was so Religious and
Austere (for so he would be thought to be)
in observing his Oath, notwithstanding he
was so plainly excused from the Obligation
of it, as to his Son <hi>Ionathan,</hi> by reason of
his known Circumstances, which were his
Ignorance of his Fathers Oath, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
which he then lay under of taking
some small Portion of Food to support him
when he was so Faint and Hungry. The
like Erroneous and Superstitious Conceit
of an Oath, the <hi>Iews,</hi> but especially the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> had in our Saviour's time, who
therefore sharply reproves them, <hi>Mark 7. 11.</hi>
They imagined that their <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>Corban</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
their Obligation to other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
as Honouring their Parents, and the
like. So we read that <hi>Herod,</hi> by a lavish
Oath, promised <hi>Herodias</hi> to grant her what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she would ask, and therefore forsooth
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 14. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for his Oaths sake</hi> he must needs kill St.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> This, though it was a mere Pretence
in <hi>Herod,</hi> shews that a <hi>Vow</hi> or <hi>Oath</hi> hath
always been held Sacred; else he could
not have made use of this Pretence, <hi>viz.</hi>
That he was bound by his Oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be loosed from it. This
hath in all Ages been held a most Sacred
Tye; especially <hi>Vows,</hi> which are <hi>Oaths
more immediately made to God,</hi> have been
esteemed such. Whence we find that the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105317:61"/>
Best and Holiest Men have always been
very observant of the Religious Obligation
of a <hi>Vow,</hi> and have been exceeding careful
to <hi>pay God their Vows which their Lips have
uttered.</hi> It is no wonder then that <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah,</hi>
a Person so Religiously disposed was
very careful, yea even to an Excess, to do
the same. He had read in the Law,<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 23. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>When
thou shalt vow a Vow unto the Lord thy God,
thou shalt not slack to pay it:</hi> And he was
sensible that the willful Neglect of this is
a Crime of a very heinous Nature, and
that God is a severe Exactor of <hi>Vows,</hi>
and is wont to avenge the Breach of them,
by inflicting the greatest Judgments and
Plagues imaginable. He knew that the
Violation of <hi>Vows</hi> was no other than a
Mocking of God, a Dissembling with
Heaven, and an Act of Injustice and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness
towards our Maker.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is likely he thus argued
with himself, though I know that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of my <hi>Vow</hi> will be accompanied
with Murther: Yet I consider likewise,
that the not performing it will be attended
with down-right Perjury. Seeing then
there is a Necessity of Sinning one way
or other, I resolve to choose the former,
for though that be an Injury to my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet the latter is a plain Affront to
God. My Child is dear to me, but my
God, my Father, is much more dear:
Therefore 'tis be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

unto the Lord, and I cannot go back,</hi> I must
not reverse, I dare not revoke the Sacred
Promise which I have made to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
but my firm and unshaken purpose
is to perform it. Thus the mistaken Sense
of the Indissoluble Obligation which his
<hi>Vow</hi> had laid upon him, ran him upon this
fatal Rock. <hi>Iephthah</hi> could not but know,
if he had seriously considered, that no <hi>Vow</hi>
is Obligatory where the matter of it is
unlawful; that what we <hi>Vow</hi> must be
Honest, and in our Power, whereas this
of killing his Daughter was neither; That
the Force of that Obligation which goes
along with a <hi>Vow</hi> or <hi>Oath,</hi> is from the
Lawfulness of that thing which is vowed
or Sworn; and therefore that he could
not oblige himself to lay violent Hands
on his Dear Relative, but that he having
vowed it, and it being Unlawful in it self,
he was obliged not to perform the <hi>Vow;</hi>
besides that the Law of Natural Reason
and Equity was a prior Obligation upon
him. He should have considered that an
Unlawful thing cannot possibly be made
Lawful by the Interposition of a <hi>Vow;</hi> yea
That it is a Double Sin to act unlawfully
by vertue of a <hi>Vow,</hi> for there is not only
the Sinful <hi>Vow,</hi> but the Sinful Act that
follows it. But so blind and partial is good
Mens Zeal sometimes, that they are not in
a Capacity to attend to, at least not to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105317:62"/>
regulate themselves by the most Rational
Principles that are offered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>em. This
was the Lot of our Unhappy Prince and
Warrior, he had conquered the <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
but could not vanquish his own Erroneous
Conceptions, his Mistaken Zeal, his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
Conscience. He knew that the
Law forbad Humane Sacrifices, but he
was so deluded as to believe that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of a Vow</hi> superseded that Prohibition.
Wherefore he goes on perversely in the
Prosecution of his Rash Oath, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Poor Reprieved Virgin to be
brought to the Altar, and there be offered
up a Burnt-offering to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Yea, I am enclined to believe he Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
her with his own Hand; for it is
not probable that the Priests would comply
with him in so Extravagant and Inhumane
a Demand as this, of Sacrificing his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And besides, he that was so Precise to
keep his <hi>Vow</hi> according to the very Exact
Wording of it, would not think himself
excused from acting this part himself, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had expresly vowed the doing of it
in his own Person, if you rigorously inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Words: <hi>I will offer it up,</hi> saith
he, <hi>for a Burnt-Sacrifice.</hi> By which Words
this Curious Man might really think he
was obliged to be the Sacrificer <hi>himself.</hi>
Which could not but be a great Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his Fault, because he was a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and so acted Unnaturally; becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
she was his <hi>Daughter,</hi> nay, because he had
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105317:62"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">V. 34.</note> no other Child but her, which made it
yet more Unnatural and Cruel, because he
was a <hi>Layman,</hi> and so plainly usurped on
the Office of the Priest. But mention
none of these things to me, saith he, say
not I am her Father, and she my Child,
say not I am no Priest, and that I invade
the Sacred Function: I have opened my
mouth unto the Lord, I have Sacredly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to <hi>offer up for a Burnt-offering what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
cometh forth of the doors of my House
to meet me,</hi> and lo! this my Daughter met
me, and therefore must be offered up by
<hi>my</hi> hand. Who knows not that the Regal
and Priestly Power have resided in the
same Person? As I am a Ruler and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
I have Authority to use the
Sword: And why may I not make use of
it to slay a Sacrifice as well as to cut off
Offenders, especially when I have sacredly
promised to do the former? My <hi>Vow</hi> makes
me a Priest: I need no other Ordination
than this: This alone Capacitates me,
nay Necessitates me to discharge this part
of the Sacerdotal Office. Thus our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
Bigot is Punctual in pursuing his
<hi>Solemn Vow,</hi> this he urgeth and insisteth
upon, and the thoughts of it are so Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
in his Breast, that he will not be
beaten off from it. Though he had<note n="‖" place="margin">V. 38. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>two
months</hi> time to consider of this Case, yet
he remained inflexible, and would by no
means be prevailed with to call back his
Rash <hi>Vow,</hi> but he broke through all to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105317:63"/>
keep it. The Cause of it was no other
than what I have often suggested, namely,
too Nice and Curious a Conscience: This
thrust him on to act against the undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Laws of his Religion. Lest he
should violate his Sacred Promise to God,
he puts off the Nature and Pity of a Man.
To make good his single <hi>Vow,</hi> he disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
all the other Obligations of Reason
and Religion. Such, such is the impetuous
Force of a <hi>Misguided Mind,</hi> of a <hi>Disordered
Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus discovered the True Spring
and Motive of <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Sacrificing his
Daughter, I will offer something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the Design of Providence,</hi> which
ruled in this, as in all other Events and
Actions, seem they never so Strange;
and I will suggest what I think is the
Proper Use that is to be made of this
Extraordinary and Surprizing Occurrence.
Though this Great Judge and Prince of
<hi>Israel</hi> behaved himself thus unworthily,
and no ways suitably to his Character,
yet God was pleased to suffer this for
Ends not unworthy of his Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Holiness. For by this Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Example he thought fit to admonish
us concerning our making of <hi>Vows,</hi> that if
at any time we enter upon this Solemn
Act of Religion, we be careful to do it
with great Circumspection and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
God permitted <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Daughter
to be Sacrificed, saith an Antient Pious
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105317:63"/>
Father,<note n="*" place="margin">

future, not to make Vows to
God indefinitely,</hi> as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Iephthah</hi>'s <hi>Vow</hi> ran.
These Large, Unlimited and
General <hi>Vows</hi> are dangerous,
and prove a Snare unto us:
Wherefore in this respect we ought to
use great Caution and Prudence. With
this agrees that of <hi>Theodoret, God</hi> (saith he)
<hi>to remind others to be careful of their Vows,
and to teach them to make them Discreetly,
hindred not</hi> Jephthah <hi>from putting his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to death.</hi> By this Notable Instance in
Sacred Story, he would condemn all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy
and Temerity in Vowing and
Swearing, and in making Solemn Promises
before him: And he would warn the
future Ages of the World to perform
these Acts of Religion with previous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
and serious Premeditation. For
here he sheweth us what is the Punishment
of Rash Oaths, and Undue and Unlawful
<hi>Vows,</hi> that we may learn to avoid them.
Here we see that the Fault of <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s
Rash Vowing was punished in the Untimely
Death of his Daughter.</p>
               <p>And as we are by this Example taught
to avoid all Rash and Unlawful Oaths and
Vows, so, when we have made them, not
to keep them. There is a great deal of
<hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Blind Zeal in the World, too
Nice a Conscience in some things, and too
Rash and Bold in others. Nothing is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105317:64"/>
more Sacred than an <hi>Oath,</hi> and yet there
may be a Superstitious and Undue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of it. This appears plainly in Mens
fondly pretending the indispensible Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of some Oaths, whilst at the same
time they have no regard to others which
are certainly Obligatory to them. They
speak the same Language that <hi>Iephthah</hi>
did, telling us that they <hi>have opened their
mouths unto the Lord, and they cannot go
back,</hi> i. e. They plead the Force of their
Solemn Engagements and Tyes, and refuse
to unbind themselves (though it be in
their Power) and thereby plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into Mischief, and endanger not
only their own, but (with our Resolute,
yet Nice <hi>Iephthah)</hi> other Persons Lives
and Fortunes. This <hi>Rash Iuror</hi> speaks to
us all to take warning by his Fatal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and to be at great Pains to
enlighten our Minds, but especially to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Divine Light and Aid: He calls
to us not to Debauch our Consciences by
entertaining False Notions and Conceptions
of a <hi>Vow.</hi> He remains an Example on
Record of an Imprudent and Unlawful
Votary, and likewise of the Dismal Effects
of his being so. He not only reminds us
that we ought to be extreamly careful not
to make any <hi>Rash Vows</hi> or <hi>Unlawful Oaths,</hi>
but that we ought not to think our selves
tyed by them when we have made them.
He is a constant Monitor to teach Men
that their Unlawful Oaths and Promises
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105317:64"/>
oblige them only to break them, and that
this is acceptable to God, and just and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it self.</p>
               <p>Lastly, This Notable Instance informs
us that Real Vertue and Goodness do not
always exempt Men from doing some very
ill things. Sometimes we shall see Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Persons undertake and pursue with
great Warmness what their Misinformed
Consciences have put them upon, though
it contradicts the Laws of God and Men.
What <hi>Iephthah</hi> did was out of Simplicity
and an Honest Mind, and therefore it was
not inconsistent with <hi>Faith,</hi> which we find
him praised for in the Catalogue of the
Antient and Famous Worthies by the
Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi>
And truly there are other Great Offenders
besides our <hi>Iephthah</hi> mentioned in that
Panegyrick. So it is, the Sacred History
acquaints us by enumerating sundry Instances
that Persons beloved of God, and of the
greatest Integrity, have been guilty of the
most heinous Miscarriages. Especially it
may be observed of those that are very
Active and Warm in their Religion, that
they sometimes are subject to some Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Bigotry, which unhappily leads
or rather drives them to something worse.
Particularly we see this in the Example
before us, and let us mind the Design of
Heaven in it. This Renowned Warrior
and Judge was suffered by the most Wise
Disposer of all Events to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105317:65"/>
Folly, that we may be convinced of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
of Humane Strength, that we
may see that the Best Men egregiously offend
in some things, that they are a Compound
of Spirit and Flesh, half Angel and half
Brute, and that it may appear to the World
that there is no Perfect and Consummate
Vertue in this Life. This is the Conception
I have of <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s Case; but every one is
left to his Liberty to frame what other
Notions of it he pleaseth.</p>

concerning the Time of his <hi>Passion</hi>

treating on these Words is to offer what
I conceive is most Observable in them,
to assign what is most proper and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
towards the leading us into the
true Meaning of this Noble Prediction,
to remove the Difficulties and Obscurities
that lie either in the Text or Context,
to correct the Mistakes of some Writers
upon both, to render the Words Clear,
Plain and Intelligible (as to which most
Expositors have been Deficient,) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with a Particular Computation,
or Chronological Calculation of the Years
contained in the <hi>Seventy Weeks,</hi> and in
the whole Attempt to let you see that this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105317:66"/>
Prophesie was spoken of our Lord and
Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the True <hi>Messias,</hi> that
it is really fulfilled, and that this fulfilling
of it is a Demonstration of Christ's being
come, and consequently of the Truth and
Certainty of the Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter you read that the Holy
Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> foreseeing<note n="*" place="margin">V. 1, 2.</note> in the first
Year of <hi>Darius,</hi> that the Seventy Years
Captivity was now coming to an end,
<note n="‖" place="margin">V. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>prayed</hi> for the Restauration of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
And whilst he was directing his Prayers
to Heaven,<note n="*" place="margin">V. 20, 21.</note> the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> (the same
Divine Messenger, as you may observe,
who appeared afterwards to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and told her that the Time of the
<hi>Messias</hi>'s Coming was accomplished) came
and informed him concerning that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Matter, and told him, That as the
<hi>Israelites</hi> had been Captives <hi>Seventy Years,</hi>
and were now to be delivered, so within
<hi>Seventy Weeks of Years</hi> the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ssias</hi> should
come, and be a Deliverer and Saviour.
This I conceive is the reason of this Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
way of speaking, and describing the
Time: It alludes to the Captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
which was to last Seventy Years.
That was the determinate Space of the
Captivity, after which they were to be
delivered, and to return back to their own
Land. So in like manner the time of the
Administration of things until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
from the Captivity of Sin and
Satan's Tyranny in the World, is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105317:66"/>
in a Number that answers to that,
<hi>viz. Seventy Weeks of Years,</hi> instead of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Years. Seventy Weeks are determined
upon thy People, and upon thy Holy City, to
finish the Transgression, and to make an end of
sins, and to make Reconciliation for Iniquity,
and to bring in everlasting Righteousness, and
to seal up the vision and Prophesie, and to anoint
the most Holy.</hi> It hath been intimated already
that by Seventy Weeks here are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not Seventy Weeks of days, but of
Years; each day for a Year; which Seventy
being multiplied by Seven (every Week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Seven days) make 490. Now that it
is usual in Scripture to signifie <hi>Years</hi> by <hi>Days,</hi>
I need not be very laborious in proving. Life
is measured by Days; Years are meant when
Days are expressed, as in <hi>Gen. 5. 5. All the
days that</hi> Adam <hi>lived were nine hundred and
thirty Years:</hi> And so of <hi>Seth,</hi> v. 8. and <hi>Enos,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enary
of Years, or the space of Seven Years, is most
evident from <hi>Lev. 25. 8. Thou shalt number
Seven Sabbaths</hi> (or Weeks) <hi>of years unto thee,</hi>
i. e. Forty nine Years. So in <hi>Gen. 29. 27. a Week</hi>
is interpreted <hi>Seven years</hi> in the same Verse.
But we need not be very S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is said, <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon

we have made all very plain.</p>
               <p>It follows <hi>v. 25, 26, 27. Know therefore and

the</hi> Messiah, <hi>the Prince shall be Seventy weeks:
And threescore and two weeks the street shall be

And after the threescore and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o weeks shall</hi>
Messiah <hi>be cut off, but not for himself: And the
People of the Prince that shall come shall destroy
the City and the Sanctuary, and the end thereof
shall be with a Flood: And unto the end of the
War Desolations are determined. And he shall
confirm the Covenant with many for one week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in the midst of the week he shall cause the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
and the Oblation to cease, and for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading
of Abominations he shall make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
even until the Consummation, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
shall be poured on the desolate.</hi> Here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I Paraphrase on these words, I am to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to you that the Angel divides the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
weeks</hi> into three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Seven weeks,
and sixty two weeks, and one week; which
he doth to give a more Distinct Account of
what was to happen in that Period of time.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105317:68"/>
The <hi>Seven weeks</hi> of Years <hi>(i. e. 49</hi> Years)
were fulfilled when the Building of the City
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was compleated: The <hi>Sixty two
weeks</hi> of Years were fulfilled in the space of
time between the finishing of the City and
Christ's Manifestation at his Baptism: In the
<hi>one Week,</hi> viz. The last Week of the Seventy
Christ was put to Death. Thus the Time is
reckoned by Parts, as it is usual among the
Hebrews to express a Number by <hi>parts</hi> which
might be done altogether <hi>in whole: Twenty
Shekels, five and twenty Shekels, and fifteen She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels
shall be your Maneh</hi> (or <hi>Mina)</hi> Ezek. 45. 12.
So here in the <hi>Weeks of</hi> Daniel, the Seventy
Weeks or former Summ of 490 Years, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into <hi>Seven weeks</hi> (i. e. 49 Years) and
into <hi>Sixty two Weeks (i. e. 434</hi> Years) and
into <hi>one week</hi> (i. e. Seven Years) in all Seventy
Weeks or 490 Years. Having premised this,
I will briefly descant on the words, <hi>From the

Dying for it, <hi>shall be seven weeks (i. e.</hi> Forty nine
Years, in which time the Jews rebuilded their
City and Temple peaceably: For to this
must those words in this Verse be referred;
<hi>The street shall be built again, and the wall, even
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105317:68"/>
in troublesome times) and threescore and two
weeks</hi> (which make in all 69 Weeks, or
483 Years.) <hi>And after the threescore and two
Weeks</hi> (which immediately succeeded the
Seven Weeks; that is, after 69 Weeks, <hi>viz.</hi>
in the Seventieth Week, being 484 after the
Restoring of the Temple) <hi>shall the</hi> Messiah <hi>be
cut off,</hi> (he shall suffer Death upon the Cross)
<hi>but not for himself</hi> (which Clause plainly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
that this is spoken of Christ, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and died not on his own account, but
for us, that he might deliver us from Death
and Damnation.) <hi>And the People of the Prince
that shall come shall destroy the City,</hi> &amp;c. Which
is a brief Description of the miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Jews, when <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> the
Roman Prince came with his terrible Army
and besieged <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and took it, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed it: Which was the Fruit of
their putting to Death the Lord of Life. <hi>And
he shall confirm the Covenant</hi> (the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
spoken of by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah) with
many,</hi> even with all true <hi>Israelites</hi> who believe
in him. And this he shall do <hi>for one Week,</hi> or
<hi>in one Week,</hi> viz. in the remaining Week,
which is the Seventieth in Number. Then in
a more signal manner the Gospel-Covenant
shall be ratified and confirmed. <hi>And in the
midst of the week he shall cause the Sacrifice and
Oblation to cease,</hi> i. e. In the last Week, and in
the fourth Year of that Week (which may
be called the <hi>middle</hi> of it) all Sacrifices and
Oblations shall be abolished and nulled by
Christ his once Offering up Himself on the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105317:69"/>
Cross, for in the midst of this last Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

himself. And in the next words, <hi>For the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading
of Abominations he shall make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>quence of the Jews
putting Christ to Death, <hi>viz.</hi> The Besieging
and Sacking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the Roman
Armies which were Abominable and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable,
and are called by our Saviour (with
Allusion to this place without doubt) <hi>the
Abomination of Desolation,</hi> Matt. 24. 15.</p>
               <p>This is a brief and plain Exposition of the
Text and Context. And from the several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
here mentioned, any unprejudiced
Man may see that Christ, and none else is
meant here. It is impossible with any shew of
reason to apply the words to any other,
though some Jewish Writers have attempted
it, but in a very sorry and ridiculous manner,
as you may briefly see in<note n="*" place="margin">Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. Prop. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Huetius.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this Prophesie directly points at
<hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Coming</hi> and <hi>Manifestation,</hi> and
lets us know that there shall be <hi>Four hundred
and ninety Years</hi> between the going forth of
the Commandment to rebuild <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
his full Manifestation in the World.</p>
               <p>But now Great Disputes arise about the
True and Exact <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Ending</hi> of
these 490 Years, which for the Satisfaction
of the <hi>Curious,</hi> I will undertake to give some
account of. The Greatest Dispute is about
the <hi>Beginning;</hi> for there were several Orders
and Commands about building <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:105317:69"/>
hence it is Difficult to tell from which of
them we must date our Account. We know
that the <hi>Seventy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> begin from <hi>the going
forth of the Commandment</hi> (or Word) <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
or build</hi> Jerusalem. But the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>
concerning that matter was both
Divine and Humane, from God and from the
Persian Kings. Which of these is meant here?
As for <hi>the Word of God</hi> touching the building
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> That was at several and very
different times. You have the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
about it from the Mouth of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> ch.
44. 26. and 45. 13. and of <hi>Baruch</hi> the second and
fourth Chapters, and of <hi>Ieremiah 25. 12.</hi> and
29. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From this latter Promise espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<note n="*" place="margin">Lyranus, Vatablus, Galatinus, and many of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</note> some have dated the <hi>Seventy Weeks,</hi>
but therein are much mistaken, for they go
back too far. <hi>Baruch</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> prophesied
six hundred, and <hi>Isaiah</hi> above seven hundred
Years before Christ; so that it cannot be
that the <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> should begin from
<hi>their</hi> Prophesies, because these were long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Time can be fixed. Therefore it is
impossible these Divine Predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
should be meant here. Others look to
that Divine Word from the Mouth of the
Angel to <hi>Daniel, At the beginning of thy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
the Commandment came forth,</hi> Dan.
9. 23. These Supplications were made in the
<note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 9. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> first Year of <hi>Darius</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon:</hi>
Therefore the Commandment went forth in
the first Year of this <hi>Darius,</hi> which was just
about the end of the Captivity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> began at the end of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105317:70"/>
the Seventy Years Captivity, when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
brought that Message to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Reign. Hence <hi>Calvin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tly
averreth, That those Seventy Years
and the Seventy Weeks are joyned together.
If we interpret the <hi>going forth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>
concerning <hi>a Divine Word,</hi> this is a
very probable Opinion; but if you compare
Verse 23 and 25. you will find that they speak
of two Different things. <hi>The Commandment
that came forth,</hi> in the former place, is not the
same with <hi>the going forth of the Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent
to restore and to build</hi> Jerusalem, in the latter
place. The first only signifies that a Word
or Message from God came to the Angel, and
that He was to discover it to <hi>Daniel,</hi> as it
follows in that Verse, <hi>I am come to shew thee,</hi>
I am come to tell thee that Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
which I have from God. But the
second speaks of something which was to be
afterwards, in pursuance of the foregoing
Message. There should be within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of a few Years a Formal Command or
Decree for the re-edifying of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
from that time (and that only) <hi>the Seventy
Weeks</hi> were to take their Rise. It is probable
then that <hi>the Word of Man,</hi> i. e. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or Edict of some Prince is here to be
understood by <hi>the going forth of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Now there were several Edicts of
Princes which went forth for the restoring of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that at different Times. There
are no less than four Edicts mentioned by
<hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> we will enquire to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105317:70"/>
which of these the <hi>Inchoation of the Seventy
Weeks</hi> belongs.</p>
               <p>The first Edict we read of, is that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
the first Emperour of the second Monarchy,

it was the latter. For there is a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
among Historians, about the placing
of these Persian Kings, their Names being so
often confounded by those that write of them.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105317:71"/>
But the former of these Opinions bids fairest
for the Truth. Yea indeed it will be found
upon a strict Search, that <hi>Darius</hi> called <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
was not Emperor of <hi>Persia</hi> till a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time after, for there were 140 Years
from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to this <hi>Darius,</hi> whereas the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was built in less than a third part of that
time: Whence we may conclude, that this
<hi>Darius</hi> spoken of by <hi>Ezra,</hi> was not, nay could
not be <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> The third Edict or
Decree was of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in the seventh
Year of his Reign. This is the Subject of the
whole seventh Chapter of <hi>Ezra;</hi> therefore
some are of the Opinion that the Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks commenceth from
this time. There is some Dispute whether
this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> or
<hi>Longimanus,</hi> but it goes generally among the

               </p>
               <p>Now of these four Opinions concerning
the Beginning of the Seventy Weeks or 490
Years, this last seems to be the most probable,
yea 'tis more than probable, for this is the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105317:71"/>
thing which I offer here to be noted, that the
Rise of the Seventy Weeks is to be taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
from that Royal Decree, and no other,
wherein 'twas ordered that the City <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
should be built. This one thing being
attended to, will lead us to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the true and only Epoche of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s
Weeks. Indeed the main reason why the
Expositors, who have undertaken to give an
account of these Prophetick Weeks have
been mistaken, is because they overlook'd
this. They saw they were to take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from <hi>the going forth of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but they were not solicitous to observe
<hi>which</hi> of the Commandments or Decrees it
was. They did not take notice that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Weeks were to begin from <hi>the going
forth of the Commandment to restore and build</hi>
Jerusalem. As for the other Decrees, <hi>viz.</hi>
In the Reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> and in the
seventh Year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> they
were for <hi>rebuilding the Temple</hi> only, not the
<hi>City,</hi> and therefore cannot be meant here.
Consult the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and you will find
that the first Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was only for the
Jews to go back, and to build <hi>the House of the
Lord.</hi> And afterwards <hi>Darius</hi> renewed the
Grant for building the Temple only, and no
more. And it is said expresly, That <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>
in his seventh Year gave leave to the
Jews to take care of <hi>whatsoever was needful
for the House of their God,</hi> Ezra 7. 20. There
is not a word in these three Commissions,
concerning the building of <hi>the City, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105317:72"/>
Street</hi> and <hi>the Wall:</hi> Therfore I infer that
the last Commission is meant here, which was
expresly for <hi>rebuilding the City, and the Walls,
and Gates.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to whom
the Commission was given, raised the Walls,
and set up Gates, and so finished the Building
of the City, which was in the twentieth Year
of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> This hath not been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of by several Learned Men, and hath
caused them to mistake the True <hi>Aera</hi> of this
Prophesie. But certainly this is a very useful
and necessary Key for the opening of the
Text. You see plainly that the Prohesie
begins from that time when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was
sent to effect this, and not before; for there
was not before this Time any License or
Power given to the Jews to restore and build
the City. <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and he only, was the
Prince that did this; he gave order in the
Twentieth Year of his Reign, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
and Re-edifying of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
setting up the very Walls of it, which was
the last thing to be done: Therefore in the
Twentieth Year of this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was the
<hi>Beginning</hi> of the Seventy Weeks of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
I think this matter is very evident in it self.
And besides, as to the forementioned Edicts,
the first of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Cyrus</hi> cannot
be the beginning of the Seventy Weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are above 560 Years from <hi>Cyrus</hi>
to Christ's Death; for <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Edict was
about the Sixtieth O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ympiad, and Christ's
Death was about 202 Olympiad. And the
three other Epoches are also too much back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105317:72"/>
to be thought to be the times when
the Seventy Weeks began.</p>
               <p>There are<note n="*" place="margin">Isaac Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, De la Haye.</note> some that hold they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
from the Compleating and Finishing
of the Building of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was in
the Three and twentieth Year of the Reign
of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> when <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
made a Feast of Dedication of the New
City, <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sacrifice of Dedication and of Finishing the
Temple, 2 <hi>Macc. 2. 9.</hi> That this was in the
Three and twentieth Year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> may
be gathered also from <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 11. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
At that time all was compleated,
the Work was at an end; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Authors of this Opinion understand
<hi>the going forth of the Commandment</hi> in a Sense

Oriental Languages) and so the meaning is,
that from the <hi>Actual and Real Compleating</hi> of
the Building of the City unto the <hi>Messias</hi>
shall be Seventy Weeks; therefore from that
time the Weeks begin. But this is but a
Critical Noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, and hath no considerable
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105317:73"/>
weight in it, especially if you remember that
this Phrase <hi>[the going forth of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment]</hi>
was used once or twice before in this
Chapter. I ask then the Authors of this
Opinion, whether it is to be understood so
then as well as now: If they say not, then
they must give a reason why it should be
understood so here, and not before; which
I believe they are not able to give an account
of, neither did they think of this when they
espoused the former Notion. But if it be
understood here as before, then there is this
palpable Absurdity to be granted, that the
thing was <hi>finished</hi> in the Twentieth Year of
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign, and yet that it was not
<hi>finished</hi> till the Twenty third Year of his
Reign, whereas there can be but <hi>one finishing.</hi>
To which I add, That it is evident from
other places of Scripture, that <hi>Motza dabar</hi>
is no other than the Promulgation of the
Command or Decree, for so this <hi>going
forth</hi> signifies in <hi>Dan. 2. 13.</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> 1. 19.
When the Edict is <hi>published</hi> and <hi>made known,</hi>
then 'tis said <hi>to go forth.</hi> Wherefore the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Opinion is a mere straining and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of the Hebrew Phrase. So much
for the Beginning of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Seventy
Weeks: It is most clear and evident that
they began from the Decree of <hi>Artaxerxes
Longimanus</hi> in the Twentieth Year of his
Reign. For this must be rembred, That
the Edict here spoken of, is meant of <hi>the
rebuilding of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the Streets and the
Walls,</hi> but mentions not <hi>the rebuilding of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105317:73"/>
the Temple.</hi> I grant that the City was begun
to be built before this Edict came forth,
as may be gathered from <hi>Ezra 4. 12.</hi> but
there was no Royal Command and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for this; only the Jews were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to build some part of the City, that
they might have a Habitation and Shelter
to be in whilst they were erecting the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But afterwards <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came with
Authority from <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Order and Express Command to build
what was wanting in <hi>Ierusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to erect the
Walls, and effectually to finish the whole
Work. There was no Edict for doing this,
but this Particular one in the Twentieth Year
of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign.</p>

                  <hi>most</hi> terminate the Seventy
Weeks in his Death; for then those things
were fulfilled which the Prophesie men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>viz. Finishing the Transgression, making
Reconciliation for Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. These were
the proper Fruits of the Passion and Death
of Christ, and therefore it is most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to believe that the Seventy Weeks
or Four hundred and ninety Years expired
with our Saviour on the Cross. But though
this in the Latitude of speaking be very true,
yet if we would be Exact, we must say
that the Four hundred and ninety Years
ended not just at Christ's Death, but Three
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105317:74"/>
Years and a half or thereabouts after it.
This I will make evident to you thus, The
Angel expresly saith, That <hi>after the Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and two Weeks,</hi> joyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to the <hi>Seven</hi>
mentioned immediately before (which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
make Threescore and nine Weeks)
<hi>shall Messiah be cut off:</hi> Whence it is plain,
that Christ's Death falls within the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Week, for if it be after the Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and nine Weeks, it must necessarily
be in the Seventieth Week, when there
are no more reckoned beyond that, as is
the present case. This Seventieth or last
Week, may be divided into three parts;
and we have ground for this Division in
the Prophesie it self, which mentions <hi>the
midst of the Week.</hi> If there be a <hi>Middle,</hi>
there is also a <hi>Beginning</hi> and an <hi>End.</hi> In
the <hi>beginning</hi> of this Prophetick Week
(which you know consists of Seven Years)
the Messias <hi>confirmed the Covenant, i. e.</hi> The
New Testament by his Holy Doctrine,
Life, Laws and Miracles, and now his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preached the Covenant of the Gospel.
The Week began with his Baptism, Three
Years and a half before his Passion, in the
fifteenth Year of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> at which time
Sixty nine Weeks, or Four hundred and
eighty three Years were accomplished, and
the <hi>Seventieth Week</hi> succeeded. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or Former part of this Week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of above Three Years, and it is
distinguished into four Passovers. The
first Passover of Christ's Publick Ministry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105317:74"/>
is mentioned in <hi>Iohn 2. 13.</hi> from whence
begins the first Year of the Seventieth
and last <hi>Hebdomade</hi> of <hi>Daniel:</hi> The second
Passover you find in <hi>Iohn 5. 1.</hi> compared
with <hi>Iohn 4. 35.</hi> Here begins the second
Year of the Seventieth Week. The third
Passover, whence the third Year of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s
last Week takes its Rise, is in <hi>Iohn
6. 4.</hi> The fourth Passover, when <hi>Christ
our Passover</hi> was slain, about three Years
and a half after his Baptism, produced the
fourth Year of the last of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks.
This is that which is called the <hi>Midst</hi> of
the Week (as you have heard,) <hi>in the
midst of the week he shall cause the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Oblations to cease.</hi> This was verified
when the <hi>Messias</hi> by his <hi>Death</hi> abolished the
Old Law and Covenant, when the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
ceased by this High Priests making
an Oblation of himself on the Altar of
the Cross. Though <hi>the Middle</hi> in the
Stile of Scripture be not always properly
and exactly taken, yet here in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
it is to be understood in the Strict
and most Proper Sense, for Christ Suffered
and Died in the fourth Year of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Week, which is the very <hi>Middle</hi>
of Seven, yea in the Middle of that fourth
Year, which is yet more Exact and Precise.
Now if Christ was put to Death in the
Middle of the last Week (as the Angel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told)
then the Seventy Weeks cannot be
terminated in <hi>Christ's Death,</hi> because there
were but Sixty nine Weeks and a half
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105317:75"/>
compleated at that time. And if there
was half a Week behind (for the Middle
part of the Week was but short, Christ's
Death taking up but little time) then the
<hi>Latter part</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of the Week must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in it Three Years and a half, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and consequently the <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi>
or Four hundred and ninety Years ended
not just at our Saviour's Death, but about
Three Years and a half after it; which
was the thing to be proved. This is the
most Exact Account that I can offer to
you.</p>

this is joyned with the Seventy Weeks,

at this time. But this is no necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
because here is only mentioned
what shall follow upon the expiring of the
Seventy Weeks, the direful Recompense
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105317:75"/>
of the Jews cutting off the <hi>Messias</hi> is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.
This horrible Devastation shall happen
not long after the 490 Years are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;
but you cannot conclude thence
that these Years were just fulfilled at the
Devastation and Ruin of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the
second Year of <hi>Vespasian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains now that I give you the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and Distinct <hi>Computation</hi> of these 490
Years; which yet it is something difficult
to do, by reason of the Uncertainty in
Chronology, as must be confessed by all
Persons that have consulted variety of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
(and those that have not done so are
no Competent Judges here) but the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
among these Writers is not so
great, as wholly to discourage us. I have
laid their Calculations together, and have
duly compared them, and upon an impartial
ballancing of the whole difference among
Chronologers in computing these Years, I
settle the Accompt thus, The Twentieth
Year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign was in the Year
of the Worlds Creation 3497, at the end of
the 81 Olympiad; and the time of Christ's
Passion was in the Year of the World 3983,
at the beginning of the 203 Olympiad, and
consequently the fourth Year after Christ's
Passion was A. M. 3987, and the beginning
of 204 Olympiad. This Calculation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
fixed, and will be agreed to by
all Parties that are moderate. Now, if you
reckon the Years that were between these
two Periods, <hi>viz.</hi> between 3497 and 3987,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105317:76"/>
you will satisfie your selves that they were
just 490 Years, and no more, which is the
very Number that the Seventy Weeks
amount to; and consequently from the
Twentieth Year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to the time
of our Saviour's Passion were no more,
nor no less than 490 Years. This might be
particularly made good from the Distinct
<hi>Aera</hi>'s between these Great Periods, and
which are of note among Chronologers;
but I think it is superfluous to undertake
this, seeing in <hi>Helvicus</hi> and other Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Tables they are very plain.</p>
               <p>But I will go another way to work for
the satisfaction of the Reader, I will trace
these 490 Years through the several Reigns
of the Kings that were in those times, and
thence I will demonstrate, that from the
Twentieth Year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign (at
which time the Decree came forth for the
Rebuilding of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as hath been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved) to our Saviour's Passion
were 490 Years, or according to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
Sacred Arithmetick <hi>Seventy Weeks.</hi> Take
it thus, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> reigned Twenty Years
after his sending <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to build the
City and Walls: Then succeeded <hi>Xerxes</hi>
and <hi>Sogdianus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> two Brethren, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
his Sons, but it seems they were of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at all, and are therefore omitted by
some Historians; but others own them,
and say they reigned a very short time:
We may allow them (as Writers generally
do) a Year. After these <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105317:76"/>
sat on the Throne Twenty three Years,
then <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> reigned fifty Years.
Some say more, but I imbrace their Opinion
who say he reigned but fifty, because I have
before exceeded some Mens Accompt when
I set down Twenty three Years for <hi>Darius
Nothus,</hi> whereas some assign him but Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.
Then reigned <hi>Darius Ochus</hi> Twenty
six Years, <hi>Arses</hi> or <hi>Arsanes</hi> Four, and <hi>Darius
Codomannus</hi> Six: So that the whole time of
the Reign of these <hi>Persian</hi> Kings was 130
Years from the time of the Decree to rebuild
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Upon the Death of <hi>Darius</hi> (the
last Persian Monarch) <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great
succeeded in the Monarchy, and reigned six
Years: After whose Death reigned the
<hi>Ptolomees</hi> or <hi>Lagidae</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> (for I will
trace the remaining Years by this Line, and
not by that of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
these being more intricate) in this
order, <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagi</hi> Forty Years, <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus
Philadelphus</hi> Thirty four, <hi>Ptolomaeus
Euergetes</hi> Twenty five, <hi>Ptolomaeus Philapator</hi>
Sixteen, <hi>Ptolomaeus Epiphanes</hi> Twenty four,
<hi>Ptolomaeus Philometor</hi> Thirty five, <hi>Ptolomaeus
Eurgetes</hi> Twenty nine, <hi>Ptolomaeus Physcon</hi>
Seventeen, another <hi>Ptolomee</hi> Ten, another
called <hi>Soter</hi> Eight, <hi>Ptolom. Dionysius</hi> Thirty,
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> Twenty two, at which time the
Greek Monarchy ended, after it had held
out 296 Years. After her Death <hi>Augustus</hi>
(who was properly the first Emperor of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and began the Roman Monarchy)
reigned 43 Years, whom succeeded <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105317:77"/>
in whose Eighteenth Year our Blessed Lord
suffered; which two Numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> Eighteen
and Forty three put together make Sixty one
Years. Now then, reckon all these Summs,
<hi>viz.</hi> 130 Years of the Persian Kings Reigns,
296 Years of the Successors of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
61 Years of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and you
will find that they amount to 487 Years,
which wants Three Years of the Compleat
Summ, <hi>viz.</hi> 490 Years or <hi>Seventy Weeks.</hi>
Wherefore to supply this, we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that Christ suffered (as the Prophesie
expresly saith) in the <hi>midst</hi> of the last Week,
and so by adding Three Years we shall make
the 490 Years compleat.</p>
               <p>I cannot say this Calculation of the Years
of the Kings is <hi>Exact,</hi> nor can any Man say
that any <hi>other</hi> is; for there is no little Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
in the History relating to those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
and the right Order and Succession,
the true Number and Names of them,
and the time of their Reign. Wherefore
the Accompt must be taken and fixed with
some Latitude, and we must be content
with this, because we can attain to no
other. But from what I have offered,
we are as to the main certain of the
Truth of this Prophesie, and we cannot
doubt of the Evidence of the Accompt in
general. It is most plain that the Seventy
Weeks are to be reckoned from the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Year of the Reign of King <hi>Artaxerxes
Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gimanus,</hi> in which Year (and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the Royal Decree came forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105317:77"/>
and build the City, and to finish the
Temple which <hi>Zerobabel</hi> had begun; and
it is as plain that these Seventy Weeks had
their Expiration about the time of our
Saviour's Passion and Death: Or if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
and precisely make the Computation,
we must say that his Death fell in the
middle of the last Week.</p>
               <p>After all this, I must freely declare that
we need not be Dogmatical and Punctual
in the Interpreting this Prophesie. Though
I offer that Calculation before specified, as
<hi>the most Probable;</hi> yet this is certain, that
if you take the Beginning of the Seventy
Weeks according to some of those other
Opinions, and fix them to their respective
Endings, you will find that they do not fall
much amiss; they do not considerably come
short of Seventy Weeks of Years, nor are
they much redundant. Which truly is as
much as we can rationally expect in the
Present Case, considering that the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
of that time is Difficult and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and Historians hugely differ in the
Account of the Years of those Monarchs.

be definite and determined, if they be fixed
for such particular Transactions, then it must
undeniably follow, that the whole Number
is definite and fixed also. But yet it must
be acknowledged that it is very Difficult to
determine the <hi>Exact Beginning</hi> and <hi>Punctual
Ending</hi> of these Prophetick Weeks. I have
(after the Attempts of many others) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
that way which seems to me most
probable, and I submit it to the Censure
and Judgment of the Reader. Some take
the beginning of the Calculation from one
thing, and others from another, but the
general Reason of them all is the same, for
at that Time they think <hi>the word went forth</hi>
for the Restauration of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But I
having fixed the <hi>going forth of the word,
i. e.</hi> The Royal Commandment or Decree,
I having by unquestionable Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
this, I hope there is no farther
occasion of disputing about the True <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
or <hi>Epoche</hi> of the Seventy Weeks.
And having gained this Point, we have
secured the next also, for the <hi>End</hi> of these
Weeks depends upon their <hi>Beginning,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105317:78"/>
must be regulated and determined by it;
when we know one, we are not to seek for
the other.</p>
               <p>However, though some place the <hi>End</hi> of
this Computation at one time, and some at
another, yet they all agree in the Main, that
is, they all confess that the Seventy Weeks
are placed in some Period between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from <hi>Babylon</hi> and the last Overthrow
of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> And consequently they agree
in this, that these <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> are long
since past and gone.</p>
               <p>And that our Saviour is meant by <hi>Messiah</hi>
in this Prophesie, no Man can have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt in the least; for who can these
Descriptions and Characters which you meet
with here agree to but to Christ? The
<hi>Messiah</hi> was to be <hi>cut off for the sins of others,</hi>
which can be understood only of <hi>Christ
Iesus,</hi> who was <hi>the Lamb of God that</hi> came
to <hi>take away the sins of the World.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>the making of Reconciliation for Iniquity</hi>
is the alone Office of Christ, our <hi>Messias:</hi>
And therefore the Old Jews used to say the
<hi>Messias</hi> should be <hi>Ish caphar</hi> a Man of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
a Man that should make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Satisfaction for Sin. To Christ
alone belong the bringing in and <hi>confirming
the Covenant,</hi> the New Law and Religion
of the Gospel. And <hi>the causing the Sacrifices
to cease,</hi> i. e. The Abolishing of all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Rites and Ceremonies can be meant
of none but Him. Particularly as to the
last of these, it is plain that Christ was to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105317:79"/>
come whilst the <hi>Iewish Temple</hi> stood, and
whilst <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered, for he could
not make them to <hi>cease</hi> unless they were in
being. Now then <hi>the Sacrifices being ceased,</hi>
it follows that the <hi>Messias is come.</hi> This is
an unanswerable Conclusion, and this is the
grand thing I urge, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> That from this
Prophesie of the <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
evident that the time of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s
Coming is past. Yea, whensoever you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
these Seventy Weeks, it is plain that
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> expired. That is enough to Baffle
and Confute the Jews: That is enough to
prove that the Prophesie is fulfilled, which
is the Principal thing I designed.</p>

of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s Sin and Guilt,
when I consider what he was,
and what he did, I am apt to think that his
Punishment was answerable to his Horrid
Fact. Of all the Great and Notorious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
mentioned in the Bible or in any other
History from the beginning of the World
to this time there is none like him, and
therefore I am enclined to believe that as
his Crime was unparallelled, so the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of it was of a resembling Nature.
<hi>Iudas</hi> the worst and vilest of Traytors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his own Executioner, but not in a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105317:80"/>
way that was Usual and Ordinary, but such
as was as Remarkable as his Damnable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.
The Consideration of this hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me to enquire into <hi>the Manner of his
Death,</hi> and to find out of what Particular
Kind it was; whereby I hope to Reconcile
these two places of Scripture, which have not
a little exercised the Brains of Interpreters,
because they seem to be Different, if not
Contrary Relations of the Fatal Exit of this
Cursed Traytor and Apostate. From St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
we are ascertained that <hi>he went and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself:</hi> By St. <hi>Luke</hi> we are no less assured
that <hi>he falling head-long, burst asunder in the
midst, and all his Bowels gushed out.</hi> Both these
passages I will examine, and compare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that by this means we may the better
understand what Kind, or rather Kinds of
Death justly happened to this Execrable
Wretch, and also that hereby the Inconsistency
of the Relations concerning the Death of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> may not be alledged (among other
things) by Atheistical Men to disparage the
Holy Scripture, and the Authority of it.</p>

                  </note> Strangled and
Suffocated. I subscribe then to those Learned
Criticks thus far, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is meant of

is here meant, and tha: <hi>Iudas</hi> died of this

something else, as you shall hear presently.

follows <hi>Heinsius</hi> in his Interpretation, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105317:81"/>
by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is meant Grief of Mind, adds this
of his own, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had a sudden dangerous
Fall, and therewith burst him self. I grant that
this <hi>Suffocation</hi> was a Preparatory Death, this
made way for the Halter and all that follow'd
it: But that which I assert here is, That this
<hi>Suffocation</hi> here spoken of, was not to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
that he immediately died of it; for it is
Idle to think that this Suffocating Grief alone
was the cause of his Death, when we read of
his <hi>falling down head-long,</hi> and of <hi>all his
Bowels gushing out.</hi> These are never known
to be Concomitants of that Distemper;
no History gives us any Instance of this
Nature. And therefore it is fond and
groundless to imagine that this Suffocating
Passion was his Fatal End, that this was it
which dispatched him.</p>
               <p>What then did? You will say. I answer,
<hi>his hanging himself, i. e.</hi> His Strangling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a Halter or some such thing, and
his <hi>falling head-long</hi> from the place where
he hung, and thereby <hi>bursting asunder.</hi> Some
indee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tell us, That that which dispatched
him was his fall from a <hi>Precipice;</hi> for being
Melancholick and Vexed, he took the Course
which such Persons are commonly wont to
do, <hi>i. e.</hi> He threw himself down from a
Rock, or some such place, and so ended his
Life; and upon this fall his Bowels gushed
out. The Criticks who run this way (the
chief whereof are <hi>Pricaeus, Vossius</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Hammond)</hi> indeavour to prove our of several
Writers, that Persons overwhelmed with
Grief and Despair chose this way of Dying,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105317:82"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Casting themselves down from some
Precipice. This is freely granted, and
moreover no Man, I believe, will question
that upon this precipitating themselves their
Bowels were broken. This is no Wonder,
but it would be one indeed, if their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were not broken and shattered with
such a Descent. Well, but then what shall
we do with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? How could
<hi>Iudas</hi> go and hang himself, and also throw
himself down from a Rock, or craggy Hill,
or some place of this kind? I suppose no
Man will say he did this before he hanged
himself: And I scarcely think any Man
will say he did it after; neither was it
possible for him to do it at the very time
when he cast himself down: Therefore I
conclude that he did it not at all. But the
abovesaid Criticks evade this by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in another Sense wholly;
one of them interprets it of Melancholy
Suffocation only, as you have heard; and
the other tells us that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as much
as <hi>mori cupere</hi> or <hi>mori velle,</hi> to be w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ry of
Life, and from a consciousness of Guilt to
be restless till we are rid of it. But this
Great and Worthy Writer assigns a Sense
of this word which was never heard of
before, and he doth not so much as attempt
to shew, that this word is taken so in any
Author. A great Oversight certainly! To
say the Truth, these Professed and Resolved
Criticks have all of them at one time or
other this-Fate, they deliver things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground; being warm in the Notion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105317:82"/>
they have taken up, and having a great
Opinion of their own Authority, they
think 'tis enough to vouch the matter; or
being in Prosecution of father Notions
depending on it, they wholly forget to
establish what they have asserted.</p>
               <p>As for the Rise of this Mistake in these
Learned Men, I conceive it was from this,
That they found in Authors (whom they
plentifully quote to this purpose) that it
was usual with <hi>Discontented</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick</hi>
Persons, to put an end to their
Days by throwing themselves down from
<hi>Precipices,</hi> and they taking <hi>Iudas</hi> to be
such a one in the highest degree, conclude
that he dispatched himself after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and that this is the meaning of his
<hi>falling head-long</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
Especially when they read <hi>that all his Bowels
gushed out,</hi> they think there is good reason
to affirm, That this was caused by his fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from some high place. But all this is
mere Conjecture, and hath no ground to
support it, for if <hi>Iudas</hi> had procured his
Death by throwing himself down from a
<hi>Precipice,</hi> as Melancholists have been wont
to do, then surely instead of <hi>bursting asunder,</hi>
and <hi>his Bowels gushing out,</hi> we should rather
hear of broken Bones and Limbs, which
are the most usual Consequences and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Effects of such a <hi>Precipitation</hi> (for these
Commentators speak only of such.) So
<note n="‖" place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sophocles</hi> expresseth <hi>Lichas</hi>'s throwing
himself from a Rock into the Sea, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105317:83"/>
so <hi>Precipitation</hi> is generally described in
Authors. Wherefore seeing we read of
something else, which is not commonly
mentioned as the Effect of a Great Fall,
we may be induced to infer that some
other thing is intended and meant. Besides,
there is nothing here mentioned, nay there
is nothing implied or hinted concerning
<hi>Iudas</hi>'s dispatching himself from a <hi>Precipice,</hi>
unless it be in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But it is
well observed by <hi>Heinsius</hi> (for we must
make use of one Critick to confute another)
that <hi>Praeceps</hi> is not the genuine or primary
Import of this word, but that it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be interpreted <hi>Pronus.</hi> However,
this is sufficient to invalidate the aforesaid
Opinion, that we cannot infer from the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a volutnary Precipitation,</hi> which
is the thing that Author contends for. But
on the contrary, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> being joyned here

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, shews that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not
throw himself down, but that he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Passive as to this thing, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that this place of St. <hi>Luke</hi> is not to
be understood of a willfull flinging himself
down from the brow of a Hill, or the top
of a Rock, as the old Melancholick Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoes
used to do.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is of an
ambiguous use, and may be rendred not
only <hi>praeceps</hi> but <hi>pronus</hi> (and 'tis likely this
Latin word came from that Greek one)
and so we may take it here; for I am for
interpreting words in their greatest Latitude,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105317:83"/>
because by this means we shall find out the
full Sense of the Scripture. Though <hi>Iudas</hi>
did not cast himself from a Precipice, yet
<hi>he was precipitated,</hi> and <hi>he was in a prone po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture:</hi>
Both these, but the latter especially,
seem to be signified here by <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>being in a prone posture leaning forward,
bending downward</hi> (that is the primary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation
of the word) he fell to the Earth,
and this declining Posture that he was in
contributed to it. This word then gives us
some light into the manner of his Death;
it fairly intimates to us, that (after he had
immersed himself in most profound Grief
and Anguish of Mind, whereby he choaked
and stifled his Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Strangling himself. For this <hi>prone Situation,</hi>
this bending of his Head and Face, and this
pressing down of his whole Body were
caused by this way of dispatching himself.
This gives us sufficient ground to believe
that this perplexed and despairing Wretch
ended his Life with a Halter, for this was
the very Posture which his Hanging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
put him into. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For the Proof of this we need only alledge

                  </gap> bears <hi>another</hi> Sense likewise, as I
have said before, but that doth not exclude
this, but is very consistent with it, which
is the thing that I desire may be observed
here. It seems good therefore to the Holy
Ghost, in this place to make use of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
word, which may be taken either
or both ways. Our Translation is very well,
<hi>he hanged himself;</hi> but the word in the
Greek is of a larger meaning, and signifies
<hi>Strangling</hi> or <hi>Choaking,</hi> which may be either
by a Mans being Stifled and Choaked with
Grief, or by his Hanging himself, in the
more strict way of speaking. Let it not
then be wondred at, that I take the word in
both Senses in this place: I am induced to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105317:84"/>
do so by the different signification of the
word which the Evangelist useth; and
therefore I advise that it be translated thus,
<hi>He strangled himself,</hi> for this takes in both
Senses of the Greek word. For in this, as
in several other things, the Holy Scripture
differs from other Writers, it hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a <hi>double Sense</hi> couched in it, yea a <hi>double
literal Sense;</hi> such is the Pregnancy of the
Sacred Stile above all others. Therefore
seeing this Inspired Writer hath here used
such a word, I see no reason why I may
not interpret it in the double meaning which
it carrieth: And accordingly I understand
by it, that this Vile Despairing Traytor first
<hi>choaked his Vitals with Grief,</hi> and then to
ease himself of that intolerable Pressure,
wholly <hi>stifled them by hanging himself.</hi> This
latter Sense is that which I am now treating

               <p>But how shall we reconcile this with
<hi>his falling headlong,</hi> and <hi>bursting asunder in

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105317:85"/>
are these consistent with his Fatal Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
If he fastned himself to a Beam, or
a Tree (or whatever else it was I am not
solicitous) how came he to fall thence,
and upon that Fall to break in pieces?
The answer is easie, it was the Will of
Heaven that the <hi>Punishment</hi> of this Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Varlet should be <hi>Remarkable,</hi> and
that we might see in the Strangeness of
his Death the Extraordinary Judgment of
God upon him. He thought to deprive
himself of his weary Life by Hanging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
But it happened, and that by Divine
Disposal, that the Fatal String wherewith
he did this, was not strong enough to hold
him any considerable time, and thereupon
his cursed Body fell to the Ground. This
is a plain and easie Resolution, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this it is impossible (whatever some
have enterprized) to reconcile St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the first who saith <hi>Iudas
hanged himself,</hi> the latter who tells us that
<hi>falling head-long he burst asunder,</hi> &amp;c. Nor
is this without good Authority; <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
acquaints us that it was received as a
true Narrative from <hi>Papias</hi> and others that
lived near the Apostles times that <hi>Iudas</hi>
hanged himself, and that the String or
Cord with which he did that Execution
broke asunder, and so he dropped down,
and was run over by a Cart or Wagon
that came by at that time, which crush'd
his Guts out of their place. And you'll
find <hi>Theophylact</hi> also asserting his <hi>Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>

for he is of opinion that the

                  </gap>ed Man fell to the
Ground. I cannot be positive here, only
this I suggest, that either the Fatal Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Execution, or that on which it
was fastned might slip, or break, or some
other ways be loosned; and then he falling
upon a Stone, or a sharp piece of Timber
(as we may suppose) unless we will admit
of the other Conjecture before named, it is
not to be admired that his swollen Belly
did burst, and that his Entrails came forth.
Here is nothing difficult or improbable,
nothing harsh or strained. We may easily
assent to what I here offer, without the
least Violence to our Faculties. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
is reasonable in it self, and it hath
the Suffrage and Approbation of those
Writers who have treated of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Manner of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s Death. Nor
must we think it strange that some Writers
of the Church are silent as to this, for they
did not concern themselves in the giving a
<hi>particular Relation</hi> of this Fact, and the
<hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Events</hi> of it. And what
though <hi>Papias</hi> and others lard the Story
of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s hanging himself with several
Fictions, as that of <hi>the Cart,</hi> and his <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick

and disregard, but the plain Truth we
must retain, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ended his Life
by that Fall which was occasioned by the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105317:86"/>
breaking of the String or Noose with
which he had thought to dispatch himself.

with a Design and Purpose of putting a

Mortal to him. In the next place he betook
himself to a Halter, as an infallible Remedy
of his Grief and Anguish; but the Load and

his remaining Breath was quite beaten out of

               <p>This is the Compleat Interpretation of
the words which I offer, wherein I not only
take in the full Sense of both Texts (which
I see most Expositors are Defective in) but
I put an end to most of the Disputes that
have been raised about the Interpreting of
these words. For it hath been warmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
whether <hi>Iudas</hi>'s Death was by
<hi>Grief,</hi> or <hi>Suspension,</hi> or by a <hi>Precipice:</hi> Some
have held the first, some the second only, and
others defend the last as most accountable.
But I maintaining that his Death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by all these three, (for in the way that
I have explained them, they are all three very
consistent) I do hereby silence the particular
Quarrels and Pretences of Criticks against
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105317:87"/>
one another on these places of Scripture. The
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> useth,
having a double meaning, hath rendred the
Manner of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s Death uncertain among
these Authors, but I have made use of the
Ambiguity of that word to another end, <hi>viz.</hi>
To suggest to me that the double Sense of
the word is to be attended to here, <hi>i. e.</hi> We
are hereby informed that this Wretched
Caitiff was first <hi>suffocated</hi> with Fits of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
Sorrow, and soon after attempted to
end his days with a <hi>Halter:</hi> But as he hung
and pressed himself down, this crack'd or
otherwise was unfastned, and so he came
tumbling from his heighth. Then, to this
<hi>Suffocation, Suspension</hi> and <hi>Precipitation</hi> (for it
may be called so, though it was not that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation</hi>
which some, as you have heard,
fancied he expired of) was added a <hi>Rupture</hi>
and <hi>Effusion of his Bowels</hi> (the last Act of this
Tragedy) for by being thrown down he so
wounded and tore his Body, that these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails
soon found a passage by which they
came forth. This is the Exposition which I
give of the words, and you see it is consistent
with it self (which cannot be said of some of
the Interpretations which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
and it is fully adjusted to the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
and Criticism of the words; it is also
comprehensive of the full meaning of
the Relation which we have of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s
Death, and is effectual to the silencing
of those Quarrels that are among Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.
But chiefly it may merit the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105317:88"/>
Preference to all other Interpretations:
Because,</p>
               <p>1. Hereby, and not by any other way
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> (or St. <hi>Peter</hi> rather,
for 'tis he that gives that Relation in the <hi>Acts</hi>
concerning <hi>Iudas</hi>) are thoroughly reconciled.
For the first saith <hi>he hanged himself,</hi> i. e. by
an inward Grief and an outward Application
he strangled himself: The second saith <hi>he
fell head-long, and burst asunder,</hi> i. e. His
swollen Corps by its mighty Pressure and
Gravity got loose from the place where it
was tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed up, and by its violent fall broke
asunder. Here is nothing contradictory in
both these Passages, for in the one is set down
what <hi>Iudas</hi> willfully attempted and did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the procuring of his Death: The other
acquaints us what was the direful Sequel of
it: The former relates the beginning of this
Fatal Tragedy, the latter the end and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe
of it. Thus both these Inspired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
agree: But if you understand the words
either wholly of <hi>Precipitation</hi> properly so
called, or of <hi>Melancholick Suffocation,</hi> you set
these Writers at Variance, and you will never
be able to bring them to an Agreement: Yea,
you make them say that which was never so
much as thought of. For as for <hi>Iudas</hi>'s flinging
himself from a Precipice, there is not a single
Syllable in the Relation given by these Holy
Men that looks that way, or gives the least
Hint of it. Besides, <hi>hanging himself</hi> is expresly
mentioned in one of the Texts, and we are
sure that this is inconsistent with casting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105317:88"/>
down from a Precipice. And as for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Suffocation,</hi> it was never heard that
this alone produced a Total Rupture of the
Body, and an Exclusion of all the Bowels:
These must undoubtedly be the Effect of
another Cause. That<note n="*" place="margin">Tho. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Iudas</hi>'s Death are reconciled, which could
not possibly be done in that way which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
generally have taken.</p>
               <p>2. This Exposition which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

Recorded either in Sacred or Prophane Story,
there is none equal to this <hi>Iudas,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was fitting that the Recompense of
his black and foul Demerit should be as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105317:89"/>
Matchless as that it self: And this we see
accomplish'd in the <hi>Wonderful Manner of his
Death.</hi> Or rather, it was not a Single Death,
but a Complicated one, which is the thing that
makes it so Strange and Observable. The first
thing he attempted, was to abandon himself to
excessive Melancholy. When he reflected on
his Fact, he was overwhelmed with Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Despair. It is impossible to relate, or to
imagine the Horrours of his Soul, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of his Conscience, which he underwent
on this occasion. This only we can say, That
this Load was so Great and Pressing, that it
even <hi>choak'd</hi> and <hi>smother'd</hi> his Vitals, it <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled</hi>
and <hi>stifled</hi> his Spirits, and almost bereav'd
him of Life. To compleat this fully, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
yet farther, and willfully <hi>hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
that he might be freed from his present
Misery, although this did but let him into
greater. The Memory of this <hi>more effectual
Strangling of himself</hi> (the everlasting Badge,
and Infamous Memorial of his Guilt) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
still in his Name<note n="*" place="margin">From Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carab Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulatio. Lud. de Dieu in Matt. 10. 4. Dr. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, Hor. Hebraic. in eund. loc.</note>

direful Fact.</p>
               <p>It is farther remarkable in this Singular
Instance of Gods Vengeance, that this Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's

it, his last Punishment: This Miserable Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
fell head-long, before he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is very remarkable, for 'tis emphatically

who had entred Bodily into him, and had
inhabited there three days, now broke
forth: And upon this violent Eruption of

                  </gap>, which he
takes in a <hi>Passive</hi> Signification wholly, and
tells us that <hi>Iudas</hi> was snatch'd up by the
Devil into the Air, and there strangled by
him, (whereas 'tis expresly said <hi>he went,</hi>
which is an <hi>Active</hi> word, and shews that
what immediately follows, was a proper act
of his own; whence I have reason to gather,
that <hi>he strangled and hanged himself,</hi> that he
was a Felon of himself, that he willfully
procured his own Death) yet I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the other Act of the Tragedy was
immediately by the Devil's Procurement.
This Infernal Daemon struck him down to
the Earth and Hell together, whither his
Body was enclining. And truly he might justly
have his last and fatal end from the Devil's
own Hand, who was immediately stirred up
by this Diabolick Spirit to commit that
cursed Fact.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Circumstances of this Miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

and designed by God to be <hi>Peculiar</hi>
and <hi>Remarkable.</hi> Here were several Deaths
met together in this One Horrid Example,
that we may be invited to observe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Hand of Providence
in it, and that we may take notice how God
hath inflicted a Judgment worthy of such a
Miscreant, that this <hi>Unusual and Unheard of
Manner of his Death,</hi> may appear to be the
just Desert of his unparallelled Villany, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his Betraying of Innocent Blood, even that
of the Lord of Life and Glory. One way of
Death was not thought sufficient for him, and
therefore his cursed Life was torn from him
by many, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Macerating Grief,</hi> by <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hanging</hi> and <hi>Strangling himself,</hi> by a
<hi>sudden Precipitation,</hi> by a <hi>Disruption of his

Entrails.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what is suggested by a<note n="*" place="margin">Gronov. Exercit. Academ.</note> late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he was not buried but cast into the
place destined for the Carkasses of Beasts
and all manner of Filth and Dung, and that
the throwing his Dead Body into this <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum,</hi>
where he was burst asunder, is meant
by his <hi>falling head long,</hi> I cannot apprehend
any ground for this Conjecture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot insert it as a Remarkable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of his Death, and as part of that
Severe Judgment which befell him here. I
have gone as far as the words of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
have authorized me, in explaining of
which, I have fully set forth the Tragical
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105317:91"/>
End of this Hypocritical Actor in Religion,
this Mock-Disciple, this Apostle in Masque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
this Execrable Deserter and Vile Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer
of his Master.</p>
               <p>But I have not yet done, for I am to add,
that as the Just Judgment of God upon him
here, was Signal and Remarkable, so the
same Divine Vengeance pursued him to
another World, and made his Fate there
as Singular and Observable. This is that
which I conceive is the true meaning of
those words in Verse 25. of the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Acts, That he might go to his

                  </gap>le of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Others understand this place of <hi>Hell,</hi>
that being (say they) <hi>Iudas</hi> his <hi>own place:</hi>
But, so far as I apprehend, this Acception
of the word for <hi>Hell</hi> in a general Notion
is not the meaning of the Text, because
Hell was not so <hi>Iudas</hi>'s <hi>own place,</hi> as that
it was <hi>proper to him alone,</hi> and none else,
for Hell is the Common place for all the
Damned. But though I am ready to
grant that <hi>Hell</hi> is meant here, yet I take
leave to understand it in a more Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
way than it is usually taken: For
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105317:91"/>
place, the place</hi> in Hell <hi>proper to him, and
no other.</hi> This I am perswaded is the true
and full Import of the words. <hi>Iudas went
to his own place,</hi> i. e. That Individual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Place in the Regions of Hell, which
was particularly allotted for him, and
him alone. All Impenitent Sinners have
their Portion in that Infernal Lake, but
this Cursed Traytor and Apostate was

and peculiar place</hi> in that Universal
Receptacle of the Damned. To establish
this Opinion, and to confirm the Sense of
the words on which I ground it, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it may be considered, that as 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
acknowledged by Divines, that
there are Degrees of Happiness in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so 'tis also granted, that there are
Degrees of Torment in Hell. This is
the general Ground and Foundation of
my interpreting these words in this Sense.

given you the Reasons of my Exposition
of these words in that way which I have
propounded. I do not find that Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
interpret them in this Sense, but
yet I think that from what I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
it is evident that this is the true
and genuine Acception of that Expression.
All the Criminals recorded in the Old
and New Testament, are but Puny Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
if compared with <hi>Iudas,</hi> especially
if we consider that he was placed in so
high a Rank, and was so highly favoured
by his Lord, that he was one of the
Sacred College of Apostles, and Blessed
with Extraordinary and Miraculous Gifts,
and admitted to the Holy Sacrament of the
Eucharist with the rest of his Brethren. It
will not seem Strange and Wonderful, that

who acted so contrary to his Profession
and Privileges, and betrayed his Master
with a Faithless Kiss, was rewarded with

any thing that is set apart, dedicated to a
Deity, devoted to the Honour of God, or of
the Gods, for this word is used by Prophane
as well as Sacred Writers. As this is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the word in the best Classical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
(which none will deny that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with them) so this is the use of it in
St. <hi>Luke 21. 5. Some spake of the Temple, how
it was adorned with goodly Stones and Gifts,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e.</hi> with Presents and Oblations
brought to that Holy Building, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
toward the Beautifying and Enriching
of it, not without some Relation certainly of
Devotion and Reverence to the Lord of that
House. And all Gifts and Presents whatsoever
that are consecrated to God, are called by
this name, and accordingly the usual rendring
of <gap reason="foreign">

is <hi>reponere, sursum ponere, attollere, suspendere,</hi>
and thence is very appositely applied to these
Sacred Gifts, which being<note n="*" place="margin">Inde apud Platon. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

giving that name <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to those Gifts
which were thus Consecrated, is an Allusion
to the <hi>Hebrew name</hi> which that kind of Holy
Presents hath in the Old Testament, and
which was given to it by God himself, as in
many things it might be proved, that the Pro
phane <hi>Grecians</hi> borrowed from the <hi>Sacred

Book.</hi> This sort of Gifts was stiled <hi>Terumah,</hi>
from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

translate an<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 15. 19. 18. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Heave-offering,</hi> because it was
heaved or lifted up before the Lord. And
with this is joyned <hi>Tenuphah,</hi> another Holy
Oblation which owes its Original to the Verb
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signifies <hi>to shake and move to and
fro,</hi> as well as <hi>to elevate,</hi> and thence that sort
of Present is called a<note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 7. 30. 8. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Wave-offering,</hi> it being
the particular usage it seems at the tendring
of it, not only to <hi>lift it up</hi> (which was the
main thing) but to wave it. Now, to this <hi>lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up</hi> (whence <hi>Terumah</hi> more signally had its
name, and was properly an <hi>Oblation lifted up</hi>)
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> among the Greeks exactly answers,
and according to the forementioned Theme
whence 'tis derived, may be rightly rendred
<hi>donum elevatum</hi> or <hi>suspensum.</hi> In the Pagan
Devotions <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were such Presents as
were bestowed on the Gods, and <hi>set up</hi> on
some high and eminent place, as generally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Walls and Pillars of their Temples.
This is well observed by a<note n="†" place="margin">Salmas. in Solinum.</note> Learned Critick
who tells us that <hi>Not all those Gifts which were
dedicated to the Gods were called by the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but those only which could be hung
up, or set upon some high and conspicuous place.</hi>
And this is the true and simple Acception of
this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is different from
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with an <hi>Epsilon,</hi> although you'll find
that several Writers observe not this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But 'tis certain that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is of a
quite contrary signification to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this
latter denoting a <hi>Holy,</hi> the former an <hi>Unholy</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:105317:95"/>
thing or Person; this signifying some thing
or Person <hi>Consecrated</hi> to God, that on the
contrary some thing or Person <hi>Gursed</hi> of God
and Man, and destined to be destroyed, yea
sometimes it signifies the very Cursing it self,
as you shall hear afterwards.</p>
               <p>But here it is objected that the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
use the word in a <hi>good sense,</hi> to signifie that
which is <hi>Holy to God,</hi> and <hi>dedicated to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
as in <hi>Lev. 27. 28.</hi> where the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted</hi>
thing is said to be <hi>Holy unto the Lord.</hi>
So in <hi>Ios. 6. 19.</hi> we read that <hi>all the Silver and
Gold, and Vessels of Brass and Iron</hi> that the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
should find in <hi>Iericho,</hi> when they took
it, were to be <hi>consecrated,</hi> or as 'tis in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal)
to be <hi>Holiness unto the Lord,</hi> which very
things have the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> given them
in <hi>v. 18.</hi> whence some infer that the word
with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as well as with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is taken in a
good sense, and signifies a Sacred Gift offered
to God. But this is a palpable Mistake, for if
you consult the place in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> you will
find that it speaks of the <hi>Cherem</hi> properly so
called, the thing or Person that was devoted
to utter Destruction, and therefore <hi>could not
be redeemed,</hi> as you read there. How then could
this be a Gift to God, how could it be an
Offering consecrated to God, and separated
to Sacred Uses when it was utt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rly destroy'd?
But yet it may be said to be <hi>Holy to God</hi> in
this sense, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Destruction of it,
which was appointed and commanded by
God himself, was for his Glory and Honour.
The cursing of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the devoting
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105317:95"/>
them to Ruin, yea and the actual Destroying
of them redounded to the Honour of God,
whilst thereby he shewed himself the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and Absolute Disposer of the World,
and at the same time gave undeniable proof
of his irreconcilable Hatred of all Idolatry
and Idolaters. Thus the Persons and things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to Destruction were <hi>Holy to the Lord.</hi>
This is the true and genuine meaning of this
place, and no Man that looks into it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
it well, can interpret it otherwise. And
hence perhaps it is, that in a remote Sense the
Verb <hi>Charam</hi> (and consequently the Noun
<hi>Cherem</hi>) may be taken, as in <hi>Mic. 4. 13.</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>Consecrating</hi> or <hi>Holy Dedication.</hi> Not that
the word hath any such genuine signification,
for it is not <hi>Charam</hi> but <hi>Kadash</hi> that is the
word constantly used to denote <hi>Sanctifying</hi> or
<hi>Consecrating, i. e.</hi> setting a thing or Person apart
to a Pious use, to Gods peculiar Honour and
Service. I say <hi>Kadash</hi> is the proper word for
this every where in the Old Testament; yet
because even <hi>Cursing</hi> of things or Persons is
<hi>to Gods Glory,</hi> and so may be said to be <hi>Holy to
the Lord,</hi> hence <hi>Charam</hi> and <hi>Cherem,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Anathema</hi> come to have that Sense
sometimes, but in a very improper and forced
manner.</p>
               <p>The other Text in <hi>Ioshua</hi> speaks not of
things that were to be <hi>destroyed,</hi> but to be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,</hi>
and therefore it is added there, <hi>they
shall come into the Treasury of the Lord,</hi> and
consequently they are said to be <hi>Holiness unto
the Lord.</hi> But this is Foreign to the present
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105317:96"/>
Business, for we are speaking now of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
and Proper Meaning of the world, not of
any Improper and Secondary one. I grant that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is improperly and as it were at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
applied to the things which are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to God, and are reserved for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Use and Service: But thence to infer
that this is the First, Genuine, and Native Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the word is Unreasonable and
Illogical. The things spoken of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
place, <hi>viz.</hi> The City <hi>Iericho,</hi> and all
that was in it, are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s
Translation, not because they were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for the use of the Temple, or because
they were consecrated to the Lord: No, this
is <hi>another</hi> Consideration of the things, and is
nothing at all to the true import of the word,
for this <hi>consecrating to the Lord,</hi> refers to some
particular individual things only, and not to
the rest spoken of in that place. For observe
what is there said, <hi>v. 17. The City shall be</hi> (Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema)
<hi>accursed, even it, and all that are therein,</hi>
all things as well as Persons, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> takes in
both, and the Seventy Interpreters particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
restrain it to <hi>things,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now,
that by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>being accursed to the Lord,</hi>
is meant here that they shall <hi>be destroyed to
the Glory of God,</hi> is evident from the words
immediately ensuing, <hi>Only</hi> Rahab <hi>the Harlot
shall live, she, and all that are with her in the
House.</hi> These particularly are excepted from
the general <hi>Anathema</hi> or Curse which was to
end in <hi>Destruction:</hi> Therefore it is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true, that all other Persons and things were
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105317:96"/>
cursed by God, and destined to Destruction.
The whole City, and every Person and thing
in it, were thus an <hi>Anathema,</hi> yet so as God
was pleased to spare the Silver and Gold, the
Brass and Iron for the Service of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.
But still these are included in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Accursed things,</hi> and
so are called in <hi>v.</hi> 18. because they did belong
to that <hi>accursed</hi> City <hi>Iericho,</hi> and should have
been involved in the <hi>actual Curse and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
if God had not in a peculiar manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
them, and thought good to reserve
them for Holy and Religious Uses, and
thereby to cut off as it were the Curse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
upon them. But if we consider the
things in themselves, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they appertain'd
to that City, which was devoted by God to
Perdition, they are <gap reason="foreign">

that the general Sense is the same in

us what is the true import of the word, <hi>viz.
A being set apart and destined by a Solemn Curse
to Destruction,</hi> and consequently that the word
is not to be taken in a good Sense, but the
contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> for something Execrable and
Detestable, and (as the consequent of this) that
it is far different from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>If it be asked what was the reason, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
rather of the forementioned Mistake
about these words, whence was it that the
forenamed Authors, and several others whom
I might have produced, confound these two,
I answer I conceive this is the ground of it,
namely because Offerings and Gifts are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
consecrated to God with <hi>the addition
of a Curse:</hi> As <hi>Darius</hi>'s Decree for Building
and Dedicating the Temple ends with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration,
<hi>Ezra 6. 12.</hi> Thence perhaps <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>
hath been used to signifie a Gift dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to a Temple, and an Accursed thing, or
such a one as hath a Curse laid on it, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Curse to him that shall meddle with it to
alienate it. Thence <hi>Anathemata</hi> were said to be
those Gifts that were consecrated to God, and
which 'twas not lawful to convert to another
use, because the Consecration was under pain
of a <hi>Curse</hi> to those that alter'd the Property of
them. And it is indeed generally said by the
<hi>Iewish Doctors,</hi> that one sort of their <hi>Cherems</hi>
were so set apart from common use, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105317:98"/>
there was implied, and sometimes expressed a
<hi>Cursing</hi> of them who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould attemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
them. I conjecture it is on this account
<hi>(viz.</hi> because of this <hi>Execration</hi> annex'd to the
<hi>Donation)</hi> that these words have had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous
use, and have been thought by some
to signifie things consecrated to Holy uses, and
also those that are destined to Destruction.
Hence, as I suppose, <hi>Anathema,</hi> with a little
Variation in the Writing, and sometimes
without it, is of an ambiguous meaning, and
hath been taken by some in a good and a bad
Sense, namely for the Gifts and Offerings
which Religious Votaries present to the
Deity, and appropriate to Sacred Uses, and
likewise for such things and Persons as are
wholly aliena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed from God, and are devoted
to Destruction by him. But the former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is secondar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and improper, and the
Rise of that Promiscuousness of the words
which we have obferved, is only from that
Curse which is sometimes annexed to the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is
perverted; as we see there are many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the like na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure. For there are some
good words (as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.) which
afterward are used in a bad Sense, and on the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rary some words of ill meaning (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the words before us, they are distorted from
their proper Sense and Primitive use, and one
is made to signifie the same with the other,
whereas they really differ in themselves, and
are of a contrary Signification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:105317:98"/>Having thus cleared the way to what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
by shewing the <hi>Difference</hi> between
these two words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I come
now to speak particularly of this latter, and to
offer a more distinct account of the genuine
meaning of it. We must know then that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath its original from the same
Greek word that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had, yet with this
difference, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies
here <hi>separare, removere, auferre,</hi> as also <hi>renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiare,
rejicere</hi> (for these are the known signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Greek word in good<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s Lexicon, which in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces outdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all others.</note> Classick
Authors.) And consequently as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifies that which is <hi>kept or laid up in
some eminent place,</hi> so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly denotes
that which is <hi>separated, removed, taken away and
rejected:</hi> Briefly, as the former signifies the
Preserving of a thing, so this latter imports
the utter Destroying and Consuming of it.
But not to rely wholly upon the Etymology
(which I know generally is but an uncertain
proof,) I will make this good from other
Considerations, and offer the reasons why I
fix this Interpretation on the word. First, Let
it be remembred that our Apostle often
alludes and refers to the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and
makes use of several Words, Phrases and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which he finds there. Those that are
conversant in the Stile of this Hebraizing
Writer will not shew any Averseness to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this, and therefore I need not insist
upon it. Now, it is probable that he doth the
like here, <hi>i. e.</hi> That he refers to that noted word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> so often mentioned in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which hath this very Signification, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105317:99"/>
is applied in the same manner that this word
is: So that any discerning Person may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that this <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> answers
exactly to the <hi>Hebrew Cherem,</hi> and that the
Apostle hath respect to it in this place. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
This is made more probable from the
Famous Version of the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi>
who constantly render the word <hi>Cherem</hi> by
this word which the Apostle here useth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and from them without doubt this
word was taken by this Sacred Writer, who
in above a hundred places (as might easily be
shew'd) hath borrow'd words from those
<hi>Greek Interpreters,</hi> and applied them in the
same Sense and Meaning that they do. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is reasonable to think that he doth the
like here. Thirdly and lastly, This may be call'd
an <hi>Ecclesiastick word,</hi> because it is most used
by the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Church-Writers,</hi> and from
their rendring and explaining of the word, we
may infer that it runs parallel with <hi>Cherem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we are concerned to look into
the true import of this word <hi>Cherem,</hi> because
upon this depends the right understanding of
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. First, we shall find that the
more general significations of the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
whence this Noun cometh, is <hi>separavit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicavit,</hi>
and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equently <hi>Cherem</hi> is a
<note n="*" place="margin">Cherem, privatio vel separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio plenaria. Avenar. lib. Radic.</note> 
                  <hi>Separation,</hi> or the <hi>Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
whereby Persons are separated and cut
off from Holy Communion. This is the usual
meaning of the word in <hi>Iewish Writers,</hi> they
understand by it an Ecclesiastical Punishment,
or a Solemn Interdiction or Proscription
whereby Contumacious Offenders are forbid
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105317:99"/>
the use of Holy things, and debar'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church, and the Benefits of it.
But in the next place, the more particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the word is <hi>Separating with a Curse.</hi>
For <hi>devovere, execrari</hi> is the usual signification
of the Verb <hi>Charam</hi> in Scripture, as in 1 <hi>Kings
20. 42. Isa. 34. 5.</hi> and other places; whence <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi>
is not only a <hi>Cursed thing</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> but
<hi>the Cursing of them.</hi> This is that which is
threatned by God to the Jews, if they reject
the <hi>Messias,</hi> and is the Conclusion of the Old
Testament, <hi>That he will come and smite them
with a Curse,</hi> Mal. 4. 6. <hi>Cherem</hi> is the word, and
thence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is frequently used to denote a
<hi>Curse,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as
in <hi>Acts 23. 12.</hi> signifie <hi>to Curse,</hi> or to Swear with
the Addition of a <hi>Curse.</hi> It is a Separating and
Devoting of things or Persons by a Solemn
<hi>Execration;</hi> it is a Vowing, Wishing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
their <hi>Destruction</hi> and <hi>Perdition.</hi>
Therefore thirdly, <hi>Charam</hi> among the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
is <hi>desolavit, destruxit;</hi> and <hi>Cherem</hi> is <hi>desolatio, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio,
perditio omnimoda.</hi> As to the Verb, 'tis
acknowledged by all, that there are great
Numbers of Texts, wherein it signifies <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
utterly,</hi> as in <hi>Ex. 22. 20. Deut. 2. 34.</hi> where
the word can have no other Sense than this,
and therefore is rendred by the <hi>Seventy</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So in <hi>Isa. 11. 15.</hi>
it cannot possibly signifie any thing else (as is
plain from the words themselves, and from
the Context) and therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>devastare,
desolare</hi> is the Version of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>

                  <hi>v. 43.</hi> that the <hi>Israelites</hi> should <hi>fall by the Sword.</hi>
Thus they were <hi>destroyed,</hi> as you expresly read
in <hi>Deut. 1. 44.</hi> where this same passage is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
again. And from such a Fatal Event as
this (but upon the contrary Party, the <hi>Israelites</hi>
afterwards overthrowing the <hi>Canaanites)</hi> the
place where the Execution was done was
called <hi>Hormah,</hi> and not before. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 3.
They utterly destroyed them (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the
word used by the <hi>Septuagint) and their Cities,
and called the name of the place Chormah,</hi> or (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Greek Translation) <hi>Anathema:</hi>
So it is as much as <hi>Cherem,</hi> you see. But in the
other Text before mentioned <hi>Hormah</hi> is no
Proper Name, but an Appellative; which is
farther evident from this, that there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
before it, whereas there are no <hi>Prefixes</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Names. I am enclined to think that <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon,
Rev. 16. 16.</hi> (a word that hath much
exercised the Critical Wits) is of the same
Derivation, <hi>Charmah</hi> denoting <hi>Destruction,</hi> and
<hi>Gad</hi> or <hi>Geddon</hi> an <hi>Army,</hi> and so it signifies the
Destruction and Fatal Overthrow of that
<hi>Army of Antichrist</hi> which was to Rendezvouze
in that place: It takes its name from the Event
which you read in <hi>v. 19.</hi> This I conceive is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the other Derivations that are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
assigned of the word <hi>Harmageddon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will also observe to you, that this word
<hi>Cherem</hi> in a Metaphorical way signifies a <hi>Net,</hi>
in which Fishes are taken to be <hi>killed</hi> and
<hi>eaten,</hi> i. e. <hi>destroyed, Ezek. 32. 3. Mic. 7. 2. Hab. 1.
15.</hi> All which I alledge, to shew you that <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
if you respect the word from whence it is

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105317:101"/>
with it, denotes <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>destroying.</hi>
This is the <hi>proper</hi> signification of it (for as to
the Catechrestick Acception of it, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with it here,) yea, this is its<note n="*" place="margin">Brixia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>First</hi>
and <hi>Original</hi> signification. By <hi>Cherem</hi> we are
principally to understand <hi>Utter Destruction</hi> and
<hi>Perdition,</hi> Final Extirpation and Excision, and
withall the Wishing, Vowing and Denouncing
of these. Thus <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is borrowed from <hi>Cherem</hi> in the Old,
and answers exactly to it. I know some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have taken notice of the Reference of
the one to the other, but I thought fit to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd
a full and distinct account of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Agreement that is between them,
and this I have done by laying open the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the words, and the particular use of
them. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">

of it, <hi>Let him be a Person separated, cursed,

               </p>
               <p>So that by this I have conducted you to the
true and compleat meaning of the Apostle's
words: Here is a <hi>Triple Iudgment</hi> denounc'd
against those that <hi>love not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
those who are so far from loving him, that
they disown and deny him. For 'tis certain
here is a <hi>Meiosis,</hi> less is expressed than is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
by <hi>not loving</hi> is meant <hi>hating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Let him that
is guilty of this horrid Sin be <hi>Anathema,</hi> saith
the Apostle, that is,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Let him be separated.</hi> In which these two
things are included; First, That he <hi>be separated
from Christ's Church,</hi> that he be excluded from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105317:102"/>
being a Member of that Body. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
to <hi>Cherem,</hi> is rightly understood, as
that was, of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of Communion with the Church, and
a cutting a Person off from the Benefits
which accrue from it. Thus our Apostle in
Holy Zeal for the Jews his Country-men and
Kinsmen, professes he could be content to be
for their sakes<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>an Anathema from Christ,</hi> i. e.
to be separated from Christ's Church, and the
Communion of Saints: He could even wish
himself excommu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Faithful, if this might any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the good of his Brethren. So here, the
least Punishment that can be inflicted on him
who <hi>loves not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> is that he
be depriv'd of the Fellowship of the Church, of
which he professed himself to be a Member. As
he renounceth Christ, so it is but just he should
be cast off by the Church, and debar'd of all
Society with it. So St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> understands

And as he deserves to be <hi>separated from the

therefore <hi>Let him be Anathema,</hi> i. e. <hi>Let
him be separated from Christ,</hi> let him have no
part in <hi>Iesus.</hi> So indeed the Apostle's words
before mentioned m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y be farther meant, <hi>I

were p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssible (for it is but a Supposition, and
a strain of passionate Love and Indearment,)
if it might any ways promote my Brethrens
Welfare, I could willingly be excluded from
all Benefit by our Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esus Christ. I could
methinks endure any loss, part with Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and my own Bliss for their sakes. But
what the Apostle here utters only in a high
strain of Affection to express his Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for his Kindred (for you must look upon
it as no o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her,) he most truly and directly
wisheth and denounceth against all those that
willfully and obstinately renounce Christ, that
fall from the Faith they once professed, and
abjure the Holy Jesus. Let such a one never
in this World enjoy his Favour, or share in
any Advantage by his Blessed Undertakings
for Mankind.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Let him be a Person Accursed of God and
Men,</hi> for that (as I have shewed) is contained
in the Notion of <hi>Cherem,</hi> and consequently of
<hi>Anathema;</hi> and thence among the Writers of
the Church, to <hi>Anathematize</hi> is to <hi>Curse,</hi> or <hi>to
denounce Accursed. If any Man love not,</hi> i. e. <hi>hate
the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> it is a most equal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of that his Hatred, that he himself be
detested and abhorred, and that he be <hi>Cursed</hi>
upon Earth. If he <hi>calls Christ Anathema</hi> (1 Cor.
12. 3) <hi>i. e.</hi> looks upon him and speaks of him as
an Abominable Execrable Person, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
himself ought to be an <hi>Anathema,</hi> an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
a Malediction. As he is justly banish'd
from the Communion of the Church (which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105317:103"/>
we spoke of before,) so moreover he is to be
<hi>delivered to Satan,</hi> which in the Apostles times
accompanied Excommunication, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5.
1 Tim. 1. 20.</hi> This is a farther Punishment of the
Apostate here spoken of. He is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a <hi>Devoted Person,</hi> he is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
over to the Evil Spirit as a most De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
and Cursed Wretch, forsaken of God,
and destined to <hi>Destruction.</hi> Which is the</p>
               <p>Third thing contained in this word. <hi>Let
him be Anathema,</hi> i. e. <hi>let him be destroyed;</hi> for
that also is comprehended in the Notion of
<hi>Cherem,</hi> yea is the primary import of it, as we
have fully proved. Now, this <hi>Destruction</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it both the Temporal and Eternal
Punishment which are entailed on these
cursed Miscreants, the Haters of Christ. First,
it is probable the Apostle means here those
Temporal Inflictions, as Sicknesses, Diseases
and Torments of Body which attended Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
and Delivering to Satan in
those days, and which are called <hi>the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Flesh,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5. which also may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Apostle's Wish before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
<hi>That himself were an Anathema from
Christ,</hi> i. e. That (besides what hath been said
before) he might feel all those Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
which usually were inflicted on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
when they were delivered to Satan. I

takes to be the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Text which
is before us; it refers to the Primitive Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Anathematizing or Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was followed with most dismal
Effects, particularly with remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on their outward Man, which are call'd
by <hi>Ignatius</hi>

which the Devil inflicted. Let these Execrable
Sinners, who renounce their Lord and Saviour
be plagued with all those bodily Maladies;
being thrown out of the Communion of the
Church, and debar'd of Spiritual Benefits, let
them suffer all the Temporal Evils and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of this Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A future Eternal Punishment in
another World is here implied; which makes
this Denunciation of the Apostle to be most
Astonishing and Dreadful. <hi>If any Man love not
the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and persists in this vile
Temper and Practice, let a Curse pursue him
into the next World to his Everlasting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Confusion. This is the highest Sense
of this <hi>Anathema,</hi> this <hi>Cherem,</hi> this is a devoting
to Death and utter and final Destruction. So
then in brief the meaning of the words in
their full Latitude is this, <hi>If any Man love not
the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> so as not to confess him,
but to renounce and deny him, especially in
time of Persecution (as some at that time, the
<hi>Gnosticks</hi> saith our <hi>Annotator,</hi> affirmed it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to do) if any Man hate and vilifie the Lord
Jesus Christ, and disown and reject that Faith
which he once embraced, let his Reward be to
be separated and cut off from Christ Jesus the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105317:104"/>
Head, and from his Body the Church, let him
be Accursed in Body and Soul, and be given
up to the Prince of Darkness, and suffer all
Evils in this World and in the next, let him
be destined to Eternal Misery, and perish
Everlastingly without remedy.</p>
               <p>Thus Spiritual, Temporal and Eternal Evils,
but more especially these last, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in this Apostolical Execration; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this <hi>Anathema</hi> the Apostle adds <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran-atha,</hi>
which is thought by some to answer
to the <hi>Third kind of Excommunication</hi> among
the Jews, the Severest and Dreadfullest of all,
which they stiled <hi>Shammatha,</hi> a final S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And some that embrace this Opinion
tell us that <hi>Maran atha</hi> is a <hi>Talmudick</hi> word,
and frequent in the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

                     </gap>h Antiquity at all. Nay, the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they are not there.
However, this is certain that if we look into
both those words <hi>[Shammatha</hi> and <hi>Maran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atha]</hi>
we shall find that they are of the same
signification, for <hi>Sham</hi> or <hi>Shem</hi> is <hi>nomen,</hi> which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105317:104"/>
in ordinary Speech among the Jews signifies
<hi>God,</hi> and <hi>atha</hi> is <hi>venit,</hi> and so the compound
word is to be resolved into this, <hi>God cometh;</hi>
which is the same with <hi>Maran-atha,</hi> for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
in the Syriack and other Eastern Tongues
signifies <hi>Dominus</hi> (and thence, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
the <hi>Syrian Maronites</hi> have their name,
because they call Christ <hi>Marani,</hi> i. e. our Lord)
and <hi>atha,</hi> as was said before, is rendred <hi>venit,
he cometh;</hi> and so both <hi>Shammata</hi> and <hi>Maran-atha</hi>
exactly answer to that direful Menace of
<hi>Enoch,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Jud. v. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord cometh,</hi> which was a <hi>Prophesie</hi>
as well as an <hi>Execration,</hi> that was very Famous
in the Church of the Jews, and from this (it
is very probable) those Forms of Execration
were taken. <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
thousands of his Saints, to execute Iudgment upon
all,</hi> especially on such wicked and profligate
Sinners that deny the Lord who bought them,
and shamefully renounce the Christian Faith
and Profession. These are they that <hi>love not
the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then all that I will remark is this, that
this <hi>Dreadful Execration</hi> which the Apostle
here useth, hath peculiar reference to <hi>Gods
Final Iudging the World,</hi> and his executing
Eternal Vengeance on the Wicked. For
though we may grant with the Learned <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
that the Apostle here primarily speaks to
the <hi>Unbelieving Iews,</hi> and accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
himself in the very Language which
they used at that time, <hi>viz. Syriack,</hi> (whereas
in Hebrew it should have been <hi>Adonenu ba,</hi>
not <hi>Maran-atha,</hi> which,<note n="*" place="margin">Hor. Hebr.</note> saith he, evidently
sheweth that this Speech refers more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105317:105"/>
to the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi>) and though we may
grant that the words have some reference to
<hi>our Lords coming to destroy Ierusalem</hi> and the
Jewish Polity, yet (as this Worthy Doctor
afterwards acknowledgeth) they may have a
larger Sense, as many other passages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have, and be understood more signally and
eminently of the <hi>Last Doom</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> which
shall be pronounced not only against the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Jews, but all those that love not the
Lord Jesus Christ of what Nation soever.
This shall be at the <hi>General Iudgment of the
World,</hi> which (we know) is by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
called the <hi>Lords coming</hi> in the Sacred
Stile of the New Testament: And we read
that in that day <hi>Go ye Cursed</hi> is the particular
Language used towards those miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
To this therefore I am of opinion that
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Execration</hi> in the Text doth more
particularly and especially refer. The short is,
<hi>those that love not the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> those
who willfully hate and oppose him and his
Laws, are <hi>Accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>are devoted to Destruction;</hi> and likewise when
<hi>our Lord shall come</hi> to judge the World, they
shall be <hi>Cursed</hi> more openly and solemnly;
when they shall stand before that Impartial
Judge of the World, they shall receive from
his infallible Mouth a <hi>Final Malediction,</hi> an
<hi>Irreversible Execration,</hi> which shall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

in that great and learned Platonist, <hi>Iustin

acquaints us, that by reading a Sentence
in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Works he was excited to leave Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,
and to embrace Christianity. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
another Greek Father, in that known
Treatise of his wherein he addresses himself
to the Grecians, makes it evident to them
that the Evangelical Truth is consonant to
and may be confirmed by the Gentile Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
in some parts of it. St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> a Latin
Father, altho once in a Dream he thought he
was beaten for reading <hi>Tully</hi> and such like
Authors, yet in his Epistle to <hi>Magnus</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

sets down in order the Fathers who
made use of the Writings of the Gentiles in
confuting their Errors: and in his <hi>84th</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
he gives an account why he himself in
his Writings made use of secular Learning.
And as I related before, how <hi>Iustin</hi> was
guided to Christianity by a Sentence in his

                  </hi> assures us of his Skill in that sort of
Learning. And who now will believe that he
wholly neglected the <hi>Philosophers?</hi> none surely
who considers that he was signally called to be
the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that he chiefly
repaired to those Countries where there was
the greatest number of these, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
most of all applied himself to the <hi>Iews</hi>) our
Apostle being the fittest Person to preach to
them who were Professors of Reason, and
Lovers of Arts and Ingenuity: Among these
he would by no means inveigh against <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
as it was <hi>pure and innocent;</hi> but finding it
to be miserably corrupted and perverted, and
to have espoused many fond and absurd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and to have abetted many undue
Practices, there was Reason he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
against it. And indeed this Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been of a long date, insomuch that
in the days of the <hi>Asmonaeans</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> in locum.</note> it was decreed,
That that Parent should be pronounced ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
who taught his Son the Philosophy of
the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Now if the Jews thought it
would corrupt and debauch their Children,
it is no wonder that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saw it would be
injurious to the Christian Proselytes, and
undermine the Principles of the Gospel.
Yea, it is very probable, that at this time
when the Apostle writ to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> the
Christians began to mix their Christian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
with the Subtilties of Philosophy, and
so to corrupt the Mysteries of Christianity
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105317:108"/>
with those Sophistries, and by that means to
bring in Heresies. Thereupon the Apostle
remonstrates against this Abuse of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
as a thing of very dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
such as would pervert the Minds of
Christians, and prove hazardous even to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self. Wherefore he warns his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Converts of <hi>Coloss</hi> against this corrupt way
of Philosophizing. <hi>Beware</hi> (saith he) <hi>lest any
Man spoil you through Philosophy and vain Deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe the Apostle's manner of expressing
himself, <hi>Lest any Man spoil you.</hi> The Greek
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a <hi>Military Term,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is used in the Imperial Laws, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
concerning <hi>Reprisals.</hi> More generally it
signifies <hi>Praedam abigere,</hi> to carry off the Prey
or Booty, either at Land or Sea. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
then doth very emphatically express his
meaning, when he saith, <hi>Beware lest any one
spoil you,</hi> i. e. <hi>take from you by Force, prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, make a Prize of you, rob you</hi> of your
Christianity through Philosophy and vain
Deceit, <hi>i. e.</hi> through the vain deceit of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
or the Philosophy which is both vain
and deceitful. This is a common Figure, not
only used by our Apostle, but by other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate

                  </gap>iters. The Apostle proceeds in
the latter part of the Text, to tell us the <hi>Rise</hi>
of the Grecian Philosophy, which was so
vain and deceitful. It is <hi>after the Tradition of
Men, i. e.</hi> it is the result of Humane Wit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is the meer Institution of Man, and
hath nothing Divine and Heavenly <hi>(i. e.</hi> of
supernatural Revelation) in it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

this Clause cannot be understood (as it is
by most Expositors) of the <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Ceremonies,</hi> which we know were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God himself. The Apostle adds, that
it is <hi>after the Rudiments of the World,</hi> i. e. it is
a meer do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Men of the World: It is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to the Opinions of the chief part of
Mankind, who are pleas'd with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
as well as the Religion of their Country.
It is true, <hi>the Rudiments of the World,</hi> in <hi>2 Cor.
2. 20.</hi> and in <hi>Gal. 4. 3.</hi> are <hi>the Ceremonial Law,</hi>
which was as the <hi>first Rudiments</hi> or <hi>Alphabet</hi> in
which the World was <hi>instructed</hi> at first, and
<hi>train'd up,</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> a Religion, which was to
make way for a more perfect One. Or the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Rites and Ceremonies are call'd the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
or <hi>Rudiments of the World,</hi> saith<note n="*" place="margin">In Galat. 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi>
because the chief of those Ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi>
Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, First-Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were common to all the World. But though
<hi>the Rudiments of the World</hi> are to be understood
in those fore-named places of the <hi>Iewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
yet it doth not follow thence that those
Expressions are to be understood so here; for
the same words may be diversly taken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different Matter they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to. It is probable that <hi>the Rudiments of
the World,</hi> mention'd in the 20 and 22 Verses
of this Chapter wherein this Text is, are
meant of the upstart Doctrines of some He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Christians. <hi>If ye be dead with Christ
from the Rudiments of the World, (i. e.</hi> if you
have no regard to Errors and false Opinions,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105317:109"/>
which worldly Men hold in opposition to
Christ's true Doctrine) <hi>Why do ye dogmatize</hi>
(so it is in the Greek) <hi>after the Commandments
and Doctrines of Men?</hi> The <hi>Mosaical Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
seem not to be intended here, (as our
Translators import) for the things which the
Apostle speaks of are<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctrines of Men.</hi>
This cannot be applied to the Ordinances and
Rites appointed by God from Heaven, as the
Judaical Ceremonies were. Therefore the
<hi>Rudiments of the World</hi> here, are the Inventions
of worldly-minded Hereticks, who were at
that time crept into the Church; and the
Apostle smartly demands of the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
Why some among them did so stifly and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
adhere to the Opinions of those
Seducers, who <hi>bid them touch not, taste not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not? i. e.</hi> superstitiously forbad them to
eat certain Meats, and perswaded them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Marriage as a thing unlawful.</p>
               <p>And as Heretical Opinions are referr'd to
in this place, so something else may be meant
by these words in another, and particularly in
the Text, where it is plain, that <hi>the Rudiments
or Elements of the World,</hi> refer to the <hi>Philosophy</hi>
just before mentioned, the Apostle seeming
to allude to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the four
<hi>Elements</hi> of the World, those simple Bodies
of which all mundane Things consist, and
which are generally the Subject of <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
And thus the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,
the Composition of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105317:110"/>
World, and the Operation of the Elements.
It is likely then that the Apostle hath an Eye
here to the <hi>Mundane Philosophy,</hi> or to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
who doted on the <hi>several Elements</hi>
(as <hi>Thales</hi> on Water, another on Fire, and
the rest on the other Elements) as the first
Principles of all things. Thus you see how
reasonable it is to apply <hi>the Rudiments of the
World</hi> to the <hi>Philosophy</hi> here spoken of, and not
to the <hi>Mosaical Ceremonies,</hi> as Expositors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
have done. So that Ancient and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Father <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> declares
that <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>the Rudiments of the World,</hi>
are in this place the same. But he gives this

of the World, viz.</hi> because it <hi>teacheth the First
Elements,</hi> and is but a <hi>preparatory Discipline</hi> to
Truth. These first Rudiments and Elements
are <hi>weak and beggarly,</hi> as the<note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 4. 9.</note> Apostle saith of
the Jewish Institutions; they are <hi>weak,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot throughly purge the Soul of

                  <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>beggarly,</hi> because they cannot
enrich the Soul with any of those Graces which
are requisite to Eternal Happiness. In this
respect they are <hi>not after Christ,</hi> (as 'tis said
here) <hi>i. e.</hi> they are not like the Excellent
Doctrine of Christ which was from Heaven,
and is ever accompanied with extraordinary
Efficacy.</p>
               <p>The Apostle goes on in the Verses after
the Text to give the Reason of his Caution
against Philosophy.<note n="*" place="margin">V. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>For in Him (i. e.</hi> in

the Godhead bodily.</hi> As if he had said, Let no

an absolute and compleat Doctrine, namely,
that of our Lord Jesus, who hath the Fulness

in him, may signify the perfect Glory

in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> when the Word became Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
when God was made Man. <hi>Bodily</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes

both concur to make up one Person. The

                  <hi>Gnetzem,</hi> which is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word for <hi>Body,</hi> signifies oftentimes no
more than <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> and imports the
<hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of the thing spoken of.
And accordingly he saith, that the <hi>Body of Sin,</hi>
and the <hi>Body of Death,</hi> mention'd in the New
Testament, are no more than <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi>
the <hi>real Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of them is denoted, and nothing
else. Thus here also the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
answers to the Hebrew one, and is a kind of
<hi>Expletive,</hi> for nothing but the <hi>real Being</hi> of

and <hi>Solid</hi> Fulness of Christ. The greatest

               <p>And so it follows,<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are compleat in him,</hi>
saith the Apostle, you have all Things by
Christ; there is nothing wanting and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> it is an exact
Model of Moral and Divine Wisdom. But
the <hi>Philosophy</hi> which is now in vogue in the
World, is another kind of thing; it is weak
and imperfect, short and deficient; and as it
is at this time abused and corrupted, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of solidity and substance in it. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had often caution'd against the <hi>Legal and
Iewish Institution,</hi> and bid the Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that none spoil them by that.</p>
               <p>Now he comes to direct his Caveat against
the Impostors of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> He had without
doubt repeated and inculcated that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Except your Righteousness exceed the
Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> (the
most exact Observers of the Mosaick Law)
<hi>ye can in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
Now he thinks fit to urge this upon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
That unless they go beyond the Bounds of
the most improved Wisdom among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
they are never like to arrive at that place
of Happiness. Neither the Ceremonious
Precepts of the <hi>Iews,</hi> nor the Dogma's of
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> were able to conduct them thither.
All the Men of Tradition could not effect it,
the numerous Rabbies, and the Families of
<hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammeai</hi> were defective, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:105317:111"/>
all their peculiar Dictates and Will-worships.
And here and elsewhere, the Sons
of Reason, the great Searchers into the Law
of Nature, are charged by the Apostle with
the same Deficiency. Their <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which
they brag so much of, and value themselves
so much upon, if it be rightly scanned, is but
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Philosophy and vain Deceit,
are but Terms convertible. As Christianity
outdoth the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> so it outstrips that
of Nature and Morality, especially as it is
depraved and corrupted by the Grecian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
and others, as it is made up of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies
and seeming shews of Arguing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
void of solid Reason.</p>
               <p>Against these the Christians of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were
warned, <hi>Let no Man deceive you</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)
<hi>with vain words,</hi> Chap. 5. v. 6. These

                  </gap>, exactly answer to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and they both strike at the fallacious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Mode of Philosophizing in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
days, who was the first that planted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> (the Metropolis of all <hi>Asia</hi>)
but it seems, in his absence from that place,
some attempted to pervert his Converts, by
pressing upon them the Jewish Rites; and
others endeavoured to debauch them by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
either that of <hi>Heraclit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ephesian,</hi> or of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> who had many Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
there. This coming to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ear,
who was then in Bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> he presently
dispatched away his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
wherein he undertaketh to shew them, that
the Gospel far exceeds both Judaism and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:105317:112"/>
and that Christ's Doctrine is more
Sublime and Heavenly, more Powerful and
Efficacious than eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er of them. In most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and exalted Language he extolls the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Doctrine, and convinces them, that
all Learning and Wisdom are mean and vile
in comparison of it. And this Epistle to the
<hi>Colossians</hi> was written, it is likely, at the same
time with that to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> even whilst
the things he wrote to them were fresh in his
Memory: for you will find that it is of the
same strain and tenour with that, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Phrase and Expression are the same, as I
might shew you in several Particulars besides
that in these words. The Argument and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is the same in both, <hi>viz.</hi> to oppose the
Gospel-Wisdom not only to the Jewish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,
but to the Accomplishments of
the Gentile Knowledg so celebrated at that
time in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> Of this latter it is
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the Text, and in that

Ch. 18. v. (and it is well known that <hi>Corinth</hi>

gull himself with it. But (as it followeth)
<hi>if any Man seem to be wise in this World, (<gap reason="foreign">

i. e.</hi> according to the Wisdom
of this World; if he thinks himself to be a
great Philosopher) <hi>let him become a Fool</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
those deceitful Principles, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Gospel, which is accounted Folly)
<hi>that he may be Wise,</hi> (really so, <hi>i. e.</hi> wise to
Salvation); <hi>for the Wisdom of this World (i. e.</hi>
Humane Reason and Philosophy abstracted
from Revelation) <hi>is Foolishness with God,</hi> i. e.
it is reckon'd by God, what it is really in it
self, a weak and shallow Thing, blind and
imperfect, and unable to conduct a Man to
Bliss and Happiness. Mark here how the
Pretenders to Wisdom are shamefully baffled,
and their perverse Judgment is here justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated.
As the Gospel is no other than Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness
in the Accounts of the Men of the
World, so their Wisdom is esteemed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Folly by God. And this it must
needs be likewise in the esteem of all truly
wise Men, who, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> making a
right Judgment of Things, discern that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Deceit</hi> are entail'd upon it.</p>
               <p>And these are the two Heads that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
my Discourses on these words: 1. The
common Philosophy of the Greeks and others
then in request in the Apostles days, was <hi>Vain
and Empty.</hi> 2. It was <hi>Fallacious and Deceitful.</hi>
It was <hi>Vain,</hi> because it profited nothing to
Piety, and making them better. It was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,</hi>
because it hazarded their Souls, and
robbed them of Happiness. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105317:113"/>
at that time in force had these bad Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
It was in all things short and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
in many erroneous and vitious. It was
not only defective, but corrupted; whereas
the sacred and inspired Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
was compleat and sound, fraught with
infallible Truth, and the exactest Rules of

               <p>I betake my self to the <hi>first Part</hi> of the
Task propounded, <hi>i. e.</hi> to shew you that the
Philosophy of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks,
was <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Empty.</hi> Which I shall evince,
by letting you see that it was, 1. <hi>Vncertain.</hi>
2. (Which was the Effect of the former)
<hi>Quarrelsome.</hi> And, 3. (which made it yet
vainer) it was <hi>Trifling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Pagan Philosophy was <hi>dark and
Vncertain.</hi> The Title which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> gives
his Comedy, wherein he lasheth the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
may agree to the Philosophy it self.

                  </gap> might be prefixed to it, it was meer
<hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Obscurity.</hi> The Philosophers spoke
as doubtfully and ambiguously as their Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Oracles. The Ephesian Philosopher
was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and it might as well be
fixed on some others of the Philosophick
Tribe, for they are wonderfully <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious.</hi>
It is confess'd, they light upon many
things true and excellent, but they only
guess'd at them; and their Conclusions of
them were fickle and unsteady. A short per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal
of <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> and of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Treatise of
the <hi>Placits of Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> of
their Lives, are sufficient, I think, to satisfy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105317:113"/>
any Man of the Uncertainty, both of their
Physicks and Ethicks. It fares with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
as it did with those Mutineirs at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
some cry one thing, and some another. Varro</hi>
reckons 188 Opinions of the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi>
or the chief Good of Man: and their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of other things labour'd under vast Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.
The World surely had very mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and disorder'd Conceptions of things,
when every thing was a God with them
when (as the Apostle observes of that strange

talk of, is but the
Darkness of Ignorance, and
black Fraud, and endless
Error, and imperfect Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Ignorance.</q> Indeed the first and best
Enquirers into the Knowledg of things were
sensible of this; particularly <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the seven Celebrated Men of
<hi>Greece</hi> went under the Name of <hi>Wise Men,</hi>
assumed to himself only the Name of a <hi>Lover
of Wisdom.</hi> To him the Philosophers owe that
Modest Name, whereby they tell the World
that they are only Well-willers to Wisdom,
not perfect Masters of it. And <hi>Socrates</hi> (who
was voted by the Oracle the wisest Man of his
Age) was yet more self-denying, when he
sincerely professed (for why should we take
it as a Complement?) that all that he knew
was this, that he knew Nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reasons</hi> of this Ignorance and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Philosophy, I take to be these two
especially; 1. Because Humane Reason was
corrupted and vitiated, loaded with Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Prepossessions, darkned with Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and perverted in many by a constant
course of Sinning. Hence it was disabled
from framing right Apprehensions of things,
and from directing Men into a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God, and of Themselves, and of
their Duty. 2. Because they wanted Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Revelation, which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105317:114"/>
to give Men a clear Discovery of the
Nature of God, and a full Representation of
all the Offices of Religion. This was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reason of Philosophick Darkness and
Uncertainty. And on the contrary, that
which renders the <hi>Christian Laws</hi> so <hi>certain and
indubitable</hi> is this, that they are derived from
the immediate Inspiration of the Holy Ghost;
this is the Foundation of that Institution
which we are honoured with. This makes
our Religion unquestionable and infallible, and
such as we can confidently rely upon. For
Divine Testimony commandeth Assent, and
forceth an Acknowledgment, and will not
suffer our Minds to hang in uncertain Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Hesitations: This is the Excellency
of Christianity. Whereas the corrupted Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of the Gentiles discovered its <hi>Vanity</hi>
in its <hi>great Obscurity and Vncertainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Another Instance of the <hi>Emptiness</hi> and
<hi>Vnsatisfactoriness</hi> of the Gentile Wisdom is,
that it was intolerably <hi>quarrelsome</hi> and <hi>vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
And this is the Result of the former;
for it was <hi>Vncertainty</hi> among the Philosophers
which made <hi>so many Sects</hi> among them. The
two capital ones were<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diog. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert.</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aemio.</note>
the <hi>Italick</hi> and <hi>Ionick;</hi>
of the former <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (who after his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
philosophized in <hi>Italy</hi>) is recknoned the
chief, and next to him <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus.</hi>
Of the latter <hi>Thales</hi> was the first Author and
Institutor; and this was divided into several
Sects, as, 1. The <hi>Socratick,</hi> of which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
was the Head. 2. The <hi>Platonick,</hi> which
took its Rise as well as Name from <hi>Plato;</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:105317:115"/>
tho the Retainers to it were also called Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks.
3. The <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> of which
<hi>Aristotle</hi> was the Founder. 4. That of the
<hi>Cynicks,</hi> of whom <hi>Antisthenes</hi> was the Father.
5. That of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which was set up by
<hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus.</hi> And to these we may
add the <hi>Scepticks</hi> (if they may be thought to
deserve the Name of Philosophers who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
and in a manner denied all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy)
who were also called <hi>Aporeticks,</hi> i. e.
Doubters, and <hi>Zeteticks,</hi> or Seekers, of whom
<hi>Pyrrho</hi> was the Head. I am not now to speak
of and relate the Opinions of the <hi>Barbarick
Philosophers,</hi> as the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Persians,</hi>
the <hi>Chasdim,</hi> or <hi>Chaldees</hi> among the <hi>Assyrians,</hi>
the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Druides</hi>
among the old <hi>Galls</hi> and <hi>Celtae,</hi> for (besides
that the account of these is imperfect and
dark) it is certain, that all that was eminent
in their Philosophy was translated into that
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and reduced into some form,
and made more intelligible, for which reason,
I suppose, it is concluded by <hi>Laertius</hi> in his
<hi>Proem</hi> to the Lives of the Philosophers, that
Philosophy had its beginning from the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and not from the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Wherefore I
will wholly speak of the former, only I will
make bold to insert the <hi>Epicureans</hi> (named
so from their Master <hi>Epicurus</hi>) tho their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
most properly belongs to the <hi>Italick:</hi>
but even this may be called part of the <hi>Greek
Philosophy,</hi> because the Founders of it were
<hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:105317:115"/>These were the several Sects of the <hi>Greek
Philosophy,</hi> which as they differed in Names,
so in Opinions. Nay, they fought with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as well as with one another. <hi>Tully</hi> is
observed to be sometimes of one Sect, and
another time of another: He often delights
in the <hi>Academick</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but when he
speaks his own Mind, he defends <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
yet so that he favours the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and he is also a Friend of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
when he pleaseth, witness his Paradoxes.
There was a perpetual squabling among these
Philosophers about their divers Placits and
Opinions; they grew angry and waspish,
they made it their business to brawl and
wrangle, to cavil and scuffle, to start Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and to make everlasting Repartees.
<hi>Socrates,</hi> who was one of the best of them,
was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that acted a part, that
dissembled and prevaricated. He affected all
his Life Ironical Dissimulation. This was his
way of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and his <hi>Philosophy</hi> was tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it, for you may observe that his
disputing was in the way of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations,</hi>
which savoured of a Mind disposed
to <hi>bickering</hi> and <hi>contending.</hi> The <hi>old Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks,</hi>
who imitated <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> their
first Founders, used a Problematick way of
philosophizing, and made a Trade of disputing
<hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and were unsufferably litigious:
so that <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Philosophy seem'd to bear
the Character of his <hi>Xantippe, i. e.</hi> to be cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and brawling. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Cynicks</hi>
(who were the stiffest and most peremptory
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105317:116"/>
sort of Men, yet) were given to snarling and
contradicting. It was observed of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
by a<note n="*" place="margin">

they oftentimes ran from their own
Notions. And he writ a<note n="†" place="margin">

speaks Contradictories. Who knoweth not
that the Writings of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are full of
singular Strains, Wonders, Nice Sayings, and
Riddles? (and <hi>Lucian</hi> very wittily jears them
on this account). It was a sign they affected
to maintain Paradoxes, to weather out Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Cases, and to dissent from the rest of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> (of which Tribe there
was plenty in <hi>Greece</hi>) were the most Disputing
People of all, they were never at a <hi>Non-plus,</hi>
but had always something to say. The great
Stagirite, who was the Founder of them, set
up in the World by refuting the Doctrine of
all that went before him: Like one of the
Race of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> he thought he could not
reign safely except in the first place he slew
all his Brethren Philosophers. And he could
not but look for the same fate himself, and
so it happen'd, for he was dealt with after
the same rate that he treated his Predecessors
and Competitors. And as for the <hi>New Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
they disputed of course, and were for

probable; for which <hi>Lucian</hi> deservedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
the Philosophers in his <hi>Ballance,</hi> where
he brings them in <hi>weighing</hi> Truth and Falshood,
and making them of <hi>equal Poize.</hi> At last out of
the different Disputes and Contentions of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
sprung up the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> those Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
in Philosophy, who held no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at all with the Assemblies of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
but doubted of, or denied whatever
they said. Indeed these <hi>Scepticks</hi> were but a
bolder sort of <hi>Academicks,</hi> or we may say,
these set up first the Doctrine of Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Acatalepsy, and the others improved
it. Their Assertion was that nothing can be
defined and determined concerning any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that to encline to one part or other, or
to affirm or deny any thing, is unphilosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and that all is meer Appearance only.
<hi>Pyrrhonism</hi> was a Calumny to the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Philosophers, a baffling of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Argument. They professed a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Enquiry, and, as they thought fit,
rejected the Arguments of all Men by virtue
of that Liberty. Some of these Pretenders
to Philosophick Modesty and Self-denial
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105317:117"/>
reason'd themselves out of their Senses.
Some Philosophers denied Motion whilst their
Tongues wagg'd. Nay, there was an odd
Fellow <hi>(Anaxagoras</hi> they call'd him) who
professedly gave the Lie to any one who said
Snow was white, for he was pleased to
maintain that it was as black as Soot. Now

there is nothing so absurd but one Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher

Character which <hi>Tertullian</hi> gave of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
is verified, that<note n="†" place="margin">Quidvis struere ac destruere eruditi. <hi>De Anim.</hi> c. 3.</note> they had a Gift
of setting up or pulling down what they
pleased. This was the best of it, seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was asserted by any of them but some
one would stand and oppose it, by this means
Falshood was opposed as well as Truth. But
this was not to be attributed to any good
design in them, but it proceeded wholly from
their <hi>love of dispute and quarelling.</hi> This is that

Apostle bids us <hi>avoid foolish and unlearned
Questions, knowing that they gender Strife; and

them. † The design of the Gospel is
to put a period to Contests and Debates,
which it happily effecteth by taking away the

assigns this to be the end of Christ's ascending

was made up of idle and useless Disquisitions,
of verbal Contests, of unedifying Disputes,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105317:119"/>
They puzled their Auditors, and perplexed
themselves with unnecessary Subtilties and
vain Curiosities: they contented themselves
with dry and sapless Notio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, with jejune
and frigid Speculations.</p>
               <p>But these are unworthy of a <hi>Christian,</hi>
whose Religion forbids all foolish Bickerings
and Degladiations about Mean and Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Matters. This Laborious Idleness, this
Solemn Trifling becomes him not. We are
blessed under the Christian Dispensation with
solid and substantial Truths, we are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with things that are Material and
Weighty, and which are worthy of a Rational
Enquiry. All the Evangelical Discoveries
are useful and profitable, of vast Concern and
Necessity. We are not put off with Trifles,
but are invited to study and converse with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and manly Doctrines, such as are fraught
with Great Sense, with High Matter, with
Discoveries of vast Moment and Importance:
which cannot be said of the <hi>Philosophy</hi> which
the Apostle speaks of, which I have proved
to be Light and Vain, as well as Uncertain
and Quarrelsom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second Part</hi> of the Task I undertake is
to convince you of the <hi>Deceitfulness</hi> of the
Gentile Philosophy; for the Apostle acquaints
us, that it is not only <hi>Vain,</hi> but that there is a
<hi>Deceit</hi> in it also. I will make it appear then
that the Pagan Philosophers deceived and
deluded Men, by instilling into their Minds
Erroneous Principles, and by promoting Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Practices in their Lives. Error and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105317:120"/>
Vice, Unsound Maxims and Evil Manners, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and Immorality were the issue of that
Philosophy which our Apostle here cautions
the <hi>Colossions</hi> against. And, that I may touch
at the Particular Sects which he here intends,
I shall ransack the Principles, 1. Of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi>
and <hi>Platonists,</hi> whom the <hi>Gnosticks</hi>
affected. 2. Of the <hi>Epicureans.</hi> 3. Of the
<hi>Stoicks.</hi> 4. Of these and other Philosophers
together: For after I have enquired into these
distinctly and separately, I will consider them
all jointly.</p>
               <p>First, I begin with the Philosophy of the
<hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> which was at that
time taken up by the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of all were Philosophically disposed,
and gave no small Trouble on that account to
our Apostle and others to convince and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them. And indeed the Learned <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
understands the Text wholly of the
corrupt Doctrine of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nosticks,</hi> who borrowed their Wild
Notions from the Pythagorean Philosophy,
and withal Judaized in imposing the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Mosaick Law, which that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Person thinks is meant by the <hi>Rudiments of
the World.</hi> They made a Medley of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
and <hi>Divinity,</hi> a strange Rhapsody of the
<hi>Iewish Cabala,</hi> and the <hi>Platonical</hi> and <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>
Conceits. They affected to introduce
the Theology of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> into
Christianity. But a Particular Instance of
the <hi>Deceit</hi> of their Philosophy is mentioned
in the <hi>18th</hi> Verse of this Chapter. <hi>Let no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105317:120"/>
Man beguile you of your Reward in a voluntary
Humility,</hi> (or, more exactly according to the
Greek, <hi>pleasing himself</hi> in Humility) <hi>and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Angels.</hi> For it seems these <hi>Gnosticks</hi>
were disposed to worship Angels, and thought
it no little Specimen of their Humility and
Modesty to do so. They would not be so
bold as to offer Prayers to God immediately,
but they begg'd of the Angels to present
them to him. It is certain that <hi>Celsus,</hi> and
other Pagan Philosophers used to defend
their Polytheism this way. And 'tis plain
that it was a spice of <hi>Gentilism,</hi> because the
Heathens had their <hi>Dii Medioxumi,</hi> Spirits
that were Mediators between the Supream
Deity and Men, whose Office was to offer
the Prayers and Oblations of Mortals to the
Gods. To this questionless the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>worshipping of
Angels.</hi> This part of the Gentiles Theology
concerning <hi>Demons</hi> or inferior Deities, whose
Office was to Mediate between the Sovereign
Gods and Mortal Men, is that <hi>Philosophy</hi>
which the Apostle admonisheth the <hi>Colossians</hi>
to take heed of. To this purpose Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
interprets that Prophecy in <hi>1 Tim. 4. 1. The
Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter days
some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to
seducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils.</hi> By
these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
are not meant, (saith<note n="*" place="margin">In his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy of the latter Times.</note> he) such Doctrines
as sprang from the Devil, or from Devilish
Teachers and Impostors, but the <hi>Doctrines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Demons or deceased Spirits.</hi> And he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105317:121"/>
this by a like Speech, in <hi>Acts 13. 12.
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Doctrine of the Lord,</hi> i. e.
the Doctrine about the Lord. So that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Learned Man, here is meant
that Paganish and Idolatrous Doctrine of
worshipping Demons or departed Heroes.
And this part of the Gentile Theology the
Apostle foretells shall creep into the Church,
and be received among Christians, <hi>i. e.</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
and invocating of <hi>Saints</hi> (who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Pagan <hi>Heroes</hi>) shall be practis'd
among some of them, (as it was by the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks):</hi>
And that it is in use among the <hi>Papists</hi>
is evident to all the World, and there are few
of that Church that are very sollicitous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. This worshipping of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
though it was reckoned a piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
was (as the Apostle tells us in the
next words) a singular Instance of <hi>Boldness</hi>
and <hi>Impudence;</hi> for the Man who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
them <hi>intrudes into those things which he hath
not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly Mind.</hi> He
sawcily presumes to determine of Matters not
known; he peremptorily asserts what he
pleaseth of the Orders and Ranks of Angels,
whose Oeconomy is not discovered to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
His <hi>Humility</hi> therefore which he talks
of is but a Pretence: as meager and lank as
he seems to be, he is really swell'd and pufft
up: Whiles he pretends Humility, he hath
nothing of it; or if he hath any such thing,
he is proud even of that. The <hi>Gnostick</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
then is deservedly stiled <hi>Knowledg falsly
so call'd,</hi> it makes a shew of being Humble,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:105317:121"/>
and at the same time dictates the highest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance.
Their Disputes therefore are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>prophane Ianglings,</hi> because they savour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their own insolent Humour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
without any ground of Revelation. For
this is it we are to rely upon in this Matter,
namely, That <hi>there is but one Mediator between
God and Man, even the Man Christ Iesus.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
and Worship are proper to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Christ is the only Intercessor to the
Father, and therefore to apply our Addresses
to Saints or Angels, is an absolute dishonour
to the Merits and Intercession of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
From whence you may take notice how
abominable the Doctrine and Practice of the
<hi>Papists</hi> are. They blaspheme whilst they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Worship, they are grosly Idolatrous
in attributing that to the Creature, which is
due only to the Creator.</p>
               <p>And thus you see how the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> (from
whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> borrowed her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as to this Particular) by Pretences to a
higher and sublimer Knowledg than others
had attained to, corrupted and <hi>spoiled</hi> Mens
Minds, and by their bold and daring Notions
adulterated the Simplicity of the Gospel. Of
which the Apostle was justly Jealous, when
he said, <hi>I fear lest by any means, as the Serpent
beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his subtilty, so their Minds
should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ, 2</hi> Cor. 11. 3. And this is that which,
it is likely, the Apostle speaks of in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> where, by <hi>Fables and
endless Genealogies</hi> he means the idle and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105317:122"/>
Pedegrees of <hi>Angels,</hi> which under the
Name of <hi>Aeones</hi> the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> talk'd so much
of, which they partly borrowed from the
<hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> of which you may
read a particular Account in <hi>Irenaeus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
and <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> They will satisfy you,
that the <hi>Gnostick</hi> Hereticks received these
things from those Philosophers who were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers
of Demons and Angels, and made
them Mediators between God and Man. I
will quote only one Passage out of <hi>Plato</hi> for

according to the Greeks (meaning the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists)
that Souls did exist before their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
The Reason of this is well known,
<hi>Origen, Iustin, Clemens,</hi> and other Fathers,
were Platonick Philosophers before they
were converted to Christianity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis no wonder that they brought some of
their Philosophical Errors into Christianity.
I need not tell you that the Church in its first
Times explain'd and defended its Principles
of Religion by the way of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
besides that I might suggest this (which
is a great Truth) that Platonism of all the
Sects of Philosophy, came nearest to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
Hence the <hi>Platonist</hi> who read the
first Verses of the first Chapter of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
Gospel said that <hi>Barbarian</hi> had stollen from
his Master. Yea, I could add what <hi>Clemens</hi>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his <hi>Stromata</hi> tells us, that they
made the Christian Divinity as like Gentile
Philosophy as they well could, and they
caus'd the Holy Doctrine of Christ to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the received Notions of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and made the Holy Scriptures speak
<hi>Platonism,</hi> that they might by that means gain
Proselytes to the Christian Religion. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to you now upon these things, whether
these good Men were not in danger of being
<hi>spoiled through Philosophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Leaving the <hi>Platonists,</hi> I come
to examine the false and pernicious Principles
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105317:123"/>
of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> with whom we are<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 17. 18.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
our Apostle encountred. Their <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Deceits</hi> were such as these.</p>
               <p>1. They held that <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> were
the Rise of this World, and of all things in
it: That the World was not made or created
by an Understanding Being, but commenc'd
by a strong Juncto of Atoms, which clubb'd
together (though without Counsel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence)
to erect this great and stately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.
These Men had no Notion at all of a
<hi>Creation,</hi> for their old Saw was,
<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Laert. in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curo.</note> Nothing is made of Nothing:
and therefore (according to
their Masters, <hi>Democritus</hi> and
<hi>Epieurus</hi>) they agreed to give
the World its Date from those
capering<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Laert. in Democrito.</note> Atoms, as if that
would solve the Business. But
indeed according to their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
it had no Date at all,
for all this Atomick Bustle was from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As the <hi>Platonists</hi> held the World was
Eternal by Necessity, so the <hi>Epicureans</hi> asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
its Eternity, but said it was by Chance.
The World, according to them, was a strange
By-blow of Nature, begot by meer Fortune.
These were the wild Conceits they took up,
rather than they would be beholden to God
for the production of the World; that is, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they would acknowledg a Wise
Omnipotent Being that was the Author of it,
rather then they would own the Principle of
the World's Beginning, and that by a Power
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105317:124"/>
Divine. As for their Notion, it is so poor
and precarious, that no Man of any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
of Thoughts can give credit to it. So
excellent Order and Composition as we see
in the World and all the Parts of it, could
never arise from a fortuitous Confluence,
from a casual jumble of Matter and Motion
without any Guide, but must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to be the Contrivance of Infinite and
Superlative Wisdom. That thin and subtile
Particles blindly tilting against one another,
(without any Mover to set them on work)
should at last jump into so exact an Order, is
an Assertion unworthy even of a Rational
Pagan, and fit only for such a Christian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
as he of <hi>Malmsbury.</hi> Not to speak of
the monstrous Absurdities which follow upon
asserting the Eternal Existence of Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nay, not to speak of the utter Impossibility
of the thing it self; for what is made cannot
be from Eternity, <hi>i. e.</hi> can't be without a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
for its being made, necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
one that made it to have been before
it; and if he was before it, then it was not
from Eternity, for there is nothing hath the
priority of Eternity. But it is enough that
this Epicurean Doctrine is confronted by the
Christian Philosophy. <hi>Through Faith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that the Worlds were framed by the

And, as the same inspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed Author argues in

As much as to say, there is as great Reason,
nay greater, to be perswaded that this vast
Structure of the Universe was built and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by a Divine Hand, than that we should
believe that the stately Habitations and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
which we see, were made by some
Artists. The World is the Fabrick of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
the Temple of God,
<q>—Mundi magnum &amp; versatile Templum.</q>
So far <hi>Lucretius</hi> went, but we may go farther.
It is a wonderful System contrived by an
All-wise and Omnipotent Being. It is a
TEMPLE made by GOD, and dedicated
to him. As the World had a <hi>Beginning,</hi> so it
had its Beginning of existing from <hi>God. In
the beginning God created the Heaven and the
Earth:</hi> in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> therefore the World
was not from Eternity; <hi>God created,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was not by <hi>Chance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As the <hi>Epicureans</hi> affirmed the World
was by chance, so (consistently enough with
that Principle) they held it was left to shift
for it self. And truly this was no absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
from the former Assertion: for if
the World made it self, it might as well be
thought to look after it self. These Men in
their most sober Determinations would not
suffer God to intermeddle with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World: they complemented
the Godhead out of its Jurisdiction over
Mankind and things here below, by saying
he should not give himself the Trouble of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105317:125"/>
having any Resentments of things on Earth, and
taking care of Human Affairs. <hi>Epicurus</hi> his God
<q>(as<note n="*" place="margin">De Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> describes him) was reserved
and careless, he turned his Back on the
World, and took no notice of it; he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did something else, or was wholly idle.</q>
And therefore he afterwards calls such Gods

that God hath an Inspection into all

from our Apostle, who excellently
asserts the Providence of God, saying, <hi>He is

thereby directly to confront the Doctrine
of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> with whom he encountred
at that time. All that I will add under this
Head is this, that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> exempting
God from all Employment and Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things was sutable enough to their
known Hypothesis of an idle, lazy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
Life. They thought it a happy thing
to be free from Cares and Business, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
themselves in all Pleasure; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they attributed the same Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God which they desired and liked
themselves. And this reminds me of the</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hilosophy,</hi> saith, the Apostle meant
them of the <hi>Epicurean Philosophy,</hi> and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
that part of it which denies Providence,
and deifies Pleasure. These Men's avowed
Principle was, that sensual Delight is<note n="*" place="margin">

source of all Good, and the Soveraign Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mankind. Tho I must needs say, it
is very strange, yea even prodigious, that
there should be such a Sect, that any Men
pretending to Philsophy, or the study and
love of Wisdom, should espouse such a
monstrous Opinion, that Persons of Reason
and Knowledg should make the Body, which
is the worst part of Man, his best and only
part; and that the Animal and Sensual Life,
which is so base and groveling in comparison
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105317:126"/>
of the Rational one, should be thought to
be the chief and leading Principle of Man.
There are not transmitted to us the Names
of many that held this wild Opinion. As

Man, others as great a Glutton and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard.
But from what he farther adds (when
he distinctly sets down his Principles and
Perswasions) it is evident that this Philosopher
placed not Happiness in bodily Pleasure,
<hi>i. e.</hi> not in that only, for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed

from Pleasure. And many other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Notions he hath, which discover him to
have been a Good Man, considering he was but
a Heathen. Which may induce us to think,
that some of those other things, which he
is reported to have held, are not a just Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of his own Opinions, but rather of
what some of his deluded Followers took
up. But if I may guess at the Reason of
his being thus misrepresented, I conceive it
was this, because he was singular and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the rest of the Philosophers, as to
his <hi>School</hi> or place of philosophizing, which
was a <hi>pleasant Garden.</hi> Some might think
that this had some Influence on his Studies
and Opinions, and that he was a light Airy
Man, addicted to <hi>bodily Pleasure,</hi> and that he
placed Man's <hi>Happiness</hi> in it, especially when
it was his real Opinion and Profession, that
<hi>Happiness consisted in Pleasure.</hi> This Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
case methinks was like that of <hi>Nicolas

Acts 17. 19. All is concluded, said they, in
this World, and therefore they made much
of themselves whilst they were here, and
lived as they listed, not looking at all for any
Punishments or Rewards hereafter. But this
is so diametrically opposite to the natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

are not debauched with Prejudice and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
and so fully baffled by the Principles
of the Christian Religion, that it will be but

this and the other dangerous Sentiments of

               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>First</hi> beloved Notion was that of

are tied up by Fate, that the same irrevocable

cramps all Religion, and enervates all the

               <p>1. They held that their <hi>Wise Man</hi> was not
indebted to God for any Vertue or worthy
Accomplishment which he was Master of,
but that he was furnish'd out of his own
Stock. He was beholden to himself only
that he was Good and Vertuous. The <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
Wise Man</hi> was Upright and Just of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and stood not in need of others Helps:
his Happiness was all from what he had by
his own Power and Will. Let us observe a

Their Wise Man is the only Possessor of
Riches, Freedom, Honour, Beauty: he is a
Prince Paramount, and Commands all the
Kings and Monarchs of the Earth: he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
only to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But this Description
of the Poet is Low and Groveling, and a

in Severe Prose tells you concerning himself,
that<note n="*" place="margin">Hoc est quod Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophia mihi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit ut me parem Deo faciat. Epist. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the thing which is promised him by
Philosophy, to be made Equal to God.</hi> Which
though I am very willing to understand in the
Best Sense, as if he meant no more than
this, that he expected to be made Like unto

yet I find that he explaineth himself in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Meaning in an Epistle of

short of his Wise Man; or, which is the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:105317:131"/>
same, he makes his Wise Man much better
than his God. Some indeed have thought
that <hi>Seneca</hi> retracts what he

and impudent Blasphemies. You see there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how reasonable it was that our Apostle
should caution against this Sect of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
lest the Minds of Men should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore
is in direct opposition to it. Those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
and Blasphemous Boastings are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Christian Simplicity and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Gospel, which every-where
beateth down all High and Lofty Thoughts,
and bids us Pray and Intreat, and Humbly
Sue for the Divine Assistance, and be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sensible of our own Weakness and Disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This acquaints us that <hi>every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Gift is from Above,</hi> and that <hi>there is nothing
which we have that was not received thence,</hi> that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:105317:131"/>
we cannot think, nor speak, much less act
any thing that is Good without the Assistance
of the Divine Power; that we are constantly
beholden to God; that we depend upon
him for all things, especially as to Grace and
Goodness. These are wholly derived from
him, and we are ever to acknowledg that he
is the Author and Finisher of them in us.
The Contrary Doctrine to this I have the
<hi>more largely</hi> shewed to be the Sentiment of
the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> because this is the Chiefest and
most Dangerous Indication of their <hi>Pride and
Arrogance.</hi> I will be the more brief in the
other Instances of it.</p>
               <p>2. They held that it was below a Man to do
any Good Act, with any respect to a <hi>Reward</hi>
to be received for the doing of it. These
Soaring Souls would needs maintain that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is to be loved, and Good to be done
<hi>merely</hi> for its own sake: they declared that
the foresight of a Recompence did not influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon them at all in what they Did or
Suffer'd: and that no Good Man ought to
make any thing a Motive to Vertue and
Goodness, but these themselves. <hi>Seneca,
Epictetus, Arianus, Antoninus</hi> and other Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
will furnish you with Passages to this
purpose. But <hi>Christianity</hi> (which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest
Doctrine in the World) is not of this
strain, if we may credit one of the greatest
Professors of it, who freely declares, that <hi>if
in this Life only we have hope,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> we are of all Men
most miserable.</hi> From whence it appears that
there must be an expectation of another Life,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105317:132"/>
there must be the assurance of a Future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
join'd with the Pleasure and Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Goodness of a Holy Life. It is true, it
is Servile to fix the Eye altogether on the
Wages: but it is Disingenuous and Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to take notice of the Reward which
God hath purposely set before us. True
Love is destroyed if God and Holiness be
not imbraced for themselves: But then on the
other hand Christian Hope (which is also an
Emiment Grace) is annulled if the Opinion of
the Stoicks be valid. It is clear therefore that
their Doctrine is False and Erroneous, and is
the Result of their Vain Thoughts of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of a counterfeit Zeal to Vertue,
and a mere shew and ostentation of it. For
if we could examine things truly and fully, it
may be there would be found no such thing
under Heaven as a Vertue wholly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Disinteressed, such as hath no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
no Benefit, no Emolument belonging
to it, or so much as supposed to be consequent
of it. Therefore when these Men tell us
that<note n="*" place="margin">Virtutum Omnium pretium in ipsis est. Sen. Epist 81.</note> no Reward is to be look'd after, when
like the <hi>Love-Pharisees</hi> (call'd so in the<note n="†" place="margin">Sota. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi>)
they pretend to obey the Law merely
and only out of Love of Vertue, without
the least respect to a Future State, we may
reasonably conclude that in this, as in other
things, they affect Chimaera's and Fictions,
and are ready on all Occasions to give proof
of their Self-Conceit and Haughty Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:105317:132"/>3. To give another Instance of these Mens
unsufferable <hi>Pride,</hi> they grew up to such a
pitch of it, that they were inclined to <hi>throw
off Magistracy and Government,</hi> and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves and others from the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Powers they lived under.
Their Wise Man was a King, nay King of
Kings (as you heard before), and thence
they would infer that he was Above all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Subjection to Authority. This
Notion made them so Domineering and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious,
that they broke out into Tumults
and Seditions, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes of them in
his <hi>Annals.</hi> It went against the Philosophick
Grain to be Subjects and Servants. But this
is contrary to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Politicks, <hi>Let every
Soul be subject to the Higher Powers;</hi> and to his
Oeconomicks, <hi>Art thou call'd a Servant? mind
it not, i. e.</hi> do not think that That Condition
renders thee the worse in the sight of God:
serve God and thy Master at once, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wilt shew thy self a Good Christian.
So much of the <hi>Stoicks Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third Thing</hi> they were taken Notice of
for, and which was a piece of Singularity in
these Philosophers, was their <hi>Apathy,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">In Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> 
                  <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius</hi>
acquaints us. And we are told by<note n="†" place="margin">Plin. lib. 7. c. 19.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
that <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick (for you
must know the <hi>Cynicks</hi> were but over-grown
<hi>Stoicks</hi>) was a great Maintainer of it. This
put an unnecessary Restraint and Violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Natural Affections of Mankind, and
would not allow Humane Nature either to
laugh or weep. Their <hi>Wise Man</hi> that they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105317:133"/>
made was but a <hi>Statue,</hi> (and so indeed he was
as good as some of their <hi>Gods):</hi> he was stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and sensless upon occasion: he was not
permitted to resent the Occurrences of the
World, were they never so surprizing and
admirable. He was to be silent upon the
Rack; and when the Stone or Gout tortured
him, he was to force a Smile: and it was a
Mortal Sin (for you must remember all Sins
were alike with these Gentlemen) to wax
pale at the sight or feeling of the Incision-Knife.
He was to Play with Torments, and
to Sport with Pain and Misery. Thus they
believed the Sense of Morality was to devour
all Sense of Humanity. But this was the
Doctrine of <hi>some</hi> only of that Rigid Sect.
The Soberest of them did neither speak nor
think thus: the Apathy or Indolency which
they maintain'd was a very Laudable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
thing. Let <hi>Seneca</hi> speak for them,<note n="*" place="margin">Non edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co saplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ex ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero, &amp;c. Epist. 71.</note> 
                  <hi>I
do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>draw out a Wise Man from
amongst Mankind, and place him out of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men;</hi> for he that is Sensless is no Man.
And this Philosopher's Practice was sutable to
this Principle, for we find him in his Writings
often resenting the Evils which befel the <hi>World,</hi>
Himself, or his Relations. So <hi>Antoninus</hi> Sirnamed
the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> shed Tears upon occasion of a
Friend's Death; and his Father <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi>
(for he was his Son by Adoption) excused
him, saying, <hi>Permit him to be a Man. Arian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

within their Due Limits. The Passions are
not wholly to be Rooted up, but to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
they are not to be Banished, but to
be Curbed and kept under. These <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
are not to be Kill'd, but to be made Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,

that the Passions are of great use in Religion,
and may be subservient to the noblest Ends
and Purposes of it. Therefore our Apostle
might justly enter his Caveat here against
those Hard and Flinty Philosophers, who
talk'd of an utter <hi>Dispassion,</hi> and would make
Men to be Iron and Stones.</p>
               <p>Thus I have acquainted you what were
the Opinions and Practices of the <hi>Epicurean</hi>
and <hi>Stoick</hi> Philosophers with whom St. <hi>Paul</hi>
grappled. Thence you may guess what the
Apostle and they disputed about, and thence
you may gather likewise what the Apostle
means when he warns the Christian <hi>Colossians</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:105317:134"/>
that they <hi>be not spoled through Philosophy and
Vain Deceit.</hi> I will only make this Remark
or Reflection in the Close, that these <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi>
and <hi>Stoicks</hi> among the <hi>Pagans</hi> Answer to
the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> among the <hi>Iews.</hi>
There is a Great Affinity between these two
sorts of Antagonists. The <hi>Epicureans,</hi> like
the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> placed all their Hopes in this
Life, and therefore would be very Merry
and Frolick: The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
were Demure, and great pretenders to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
and Sublime Vertues, though they
came but little short of the others in point of
True Morality. And this indeed might be
observed further, that when Men are not
Masters of True and Solid Vertue, when
they are not really Changed and Mended in
their Minds, they pretend to greater things
than usual, to make Men admire and applaud
them, to be thought Singular Proficients in
Religion: they pretend to do more than
others, when they are Conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they do not so much. This is the
very Guise of our <hi>Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs,</hi> (those Modern
<hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>) they make as if they
were exceeding great Observers of Morality,
and had attain'd to a Higher and more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
way of Christianity than Others, yet
these People, of all the Sects that we know,
are the most Defective in Religion, and have
run the farthest off from the Principles of
Morality and Christianity.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto shewed the <hi>Deceitful Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
which were peculiar and proper to those
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105317:134"/>
particular Sects of Philosopers I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Now in the next place, I will set
before you those gross and mistaken Notions,
which for the most part were common to
them all. I will discover the <hi>Deceitfulness</hi> of
the <hi>Pagan Philosophy,</hi> by instancing in some
Principles and Practices which were not only
maintained by the particular Sects above
named, but also by all the rest of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.
I will reduce them to these two
Heads, 1. Their deceitful Opinions and
Practices relating to some particular <hi>Vices</hi> and
<hi>Vertues.</hi> 2. Their false Sentiments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In pursuance of the first, I shall present you
with their <hi>Pride,</hi> their <hi>Revenge,</hi> their <hi>Self-Murder,</hi>
their <hi>Lewdeness,</hi> and other Mistakes
in their Morals.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Pride</hi> was the Catholick Blemish, the
general Stain of all the Philosophers: Yea,
it seemed even to be congenial to them to be
immoderately proud of their Attainments.
There could not be a more visible Discovery
of this than their desire of Applause and
Acclamations. By their Subtilty and Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
they thought to conciliate a great <hi>Fame</hi>
and <hi>Honour,</hi> than which nothing was dearer
to them, even when they seem'd to shun
them. Excellently to this purpose <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves

                  <hi>Traders for Fame,</hi> and
this was the Commodity they

Another time he saith they
<note n="†" place="margin">Homines Gloriae libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinosi.</note> were <hi>Men that lusted after
Glory,</hi> and made Fame their
Mistress. This was the noted
Badg of the best of them, to hunt after Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with too great an Impatience; and they
would do any base and servile thing to get a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105317:135"/>
Name. We may truly say of them that they
lived upon Applause; and if Fame did not
trumpet them, they could not breath. But to
instance in the arrogant Humour of those
who were thought the modestest and most
Self-denying Philosophers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cynicks,</hi>
their daily business was to decry the Pride of
others. But whilst they did so, and profess'd
to be Masters of the greatest Humility, they
were the boldest and proudest Fellows ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
Tho they were the greatest Censors
of Pride, yet they were certainly most haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and under the very Garb of Humility
there lurked an intolerable Arrogance. They
were rudely clothed, to witness outwardly a
Contempt of the World; but yet if a Man
looked narrowly into them, he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
they were very proud of what they
wore, tho 'twas never so coarse. Their
Beards and their sullen Looks, their affected
Gestures and Grimaces were Ensigns not of
their Gravity, but Singularity. This made
them harden their Bodies against all Injuries
of Weather, this made some of them beg
of Statues, and provoke common Women
to rail with them, which were Instances of
Affectation, not Humility. <hi>Diogenes</hi> in a
frosty Morning stood naked in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,

it happened that <hi>Plato</hi> passed by at that

All which shew that they were tickled with
Applause, and impatiently thirsted after Fame
and Repute. But Christianity allows not of
this, it permits us not to gasp insatiably after
the Acclamations of Men. I do not say it
is simply unlawful and against the Rules of
Christianity to desire or accept of Honour
and Praise; for 'tis certain that he who doth
vertuously, cannot hate the Reward of doing
so. But to look after these chiefly, and in the
first place, and to make them the great End
of our Actions, is altogether blamable and
vitious. To <hi>love the Praise of Men more than the
Praise of God;</hi> to do good Acts not for the Acts
sake, but only for the Applause that follows
them, is immoral as well as unchristian. Our
chief End must be to contribute towards the
Honour and Glory of God in the World, to
be beneficial to Mankind, and to promote
the design of our Master upon Earth. If
whilst we are doing this, Repute and a Good
Name accrue to us, it becomes us not to be
averse to them, but to receive them as the
due Attendant of Vertue; yea as that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it which God himself hath pleased to
annex to it. Moreover, Christianity acquaints
us that it is a sign of a mean and vulgar Spirit
to act only out of a desire to be commended,
and that it is truly noble and generous to
despise the World, and to glory in the Cross,
and to look for the Euge's of Angels, and
the Applause of Heaven: This is a worthy
Ambition. The Advice of our Apostle is,
<hi>Let nothing be done through vain Glory:</hi> and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105317:137"/>
again, <hi>Be not desirous of vain Glory.</hi> Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
leads Men to a true Knowledg of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that is the only Spring of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and of sober and becoming Thoughts.
Whereas it is the nature of all other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
(as the Apostle observes) to puff up
them that are Possessors of it, to swell them
into high Conceits of themselves. And this
was the very case of the philosophizing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
they grew big, and were ready to burst
with this Tumour, or rather this Poison.
Their Carriage was observed to be most
absurdly proud and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had imbibed. Their very Philosophers too

               <p>3. <hi>Self-Murder</hi> (which is a Notorious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
and Injury to Humane Nature) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by the Chiefest Philosophers of them
all. They held that a Man need not ask
Leave before he went out of the World, that
when they saw themselves in Danger, they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:105317:139"/>
might be as cruel to themselves as the Gods
were, yea that it was Religious to dispatch
that Life which the Gods were resolved to
destroy. It was determined by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
that a Man might Kill himself rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Servitude, Reproach, or Long and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Diseases: And this <hi>Cato</hi> defends, if

was a Severe Common-wealth's Man, and

Moralists, were for leaving the World
before their Time. This they call'd <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing

this leave given him by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as well as

               <p>But <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> (and some of

it as a Rash and Foolish Attempt, nay
as a vile and wicked Enterprize. It is an
usurping on God's proper Right and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who only hath Power to dispose of
Man's Life. When God calls for our Lives,
then we are to part with them submissively
and willingly, but not before. In the mean
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:105317:140"/>
time we must entertain Poverty, Sickness,
Disgrace, or whatever Crosses befal us, with
invincible Patience and Resolution. We must
not shamefully relinguish our Stations, and
like imprudent Pilots quit the Guidance of
the Vessel in the midst of a Storm. We
must bear up undauntedly against the briskest
Assaults, and resolve to grapple with all
sorts of Hazards and Extremities. We
must prepare our selves to look new Dangers
in the face, and by the Divine Assistance
make way through the thickest Troops of
Opposition. When we are assaulted with
Sufferings, we must not crouch and sneak,
and fly like Cowards, but we must resolve
to maintain our Post, and weather out our
Miseries with a Courage becoming Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Be the Way we pass through rough or
smooth, difficult or easy, 'tis the Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and God hath not made any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
insupportable; it may soon wear off
of it self, however Time will take it away.
But we must be careful that we do not by
any means put an end to it by doing so to our
Lives. This is a high Offence against God,
against the Community (of which we are a
part) and against our selves, and Humane
Nature it self. This is a manifest token of
base Fear and Cowardice, and Abjection of
Mind; it argues unmanly Precipitancy and
Unadvisedness, a distrust of Providence, a
defect of Faith, and Hope, and Christian
Courage, and even black Despair it self. But
how brave and noble is it, after all our hard
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:105317:140"/>
Service to go off honourably, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of having fought a good Fight, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
our Course, and kept the Faith, and
of having persevered in our Duty to the end,
maugre all Discouragements and Hardships?

for he being grave and composed, disrelished
that Light Humour of the Stage, which was
Vain and Drolling, but at that time most
taking. Yea, <hi>Socrates</hi> was sometimes present
at, and applauded the Tragedies of <hi>Euripides,</hi>
but would not honour with his Presence
<hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s Comedies. Whereupon this
Poet-Laureat of that Age conceived a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against the Philosopher, and seeing
he would not approve of the Comick Way,
he must fall under its Lash, to make the
People Sport. Now <hi>Socrates</hi> is every-where
laugh'd at; now Virulent Tongues say any
thing of him; now they report he used the
Company of Young Men to Vicious and
Lewd Purposes. But that would not suffice;
a Formal Indictment was drawn up against
him. The Poets take to them <hi>Melitus</hi> and
<hi>Anytus,</hi> and other Conspirators, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
out of Extream Hatred to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
they sought his Death; insisted not
much on the former Accusation, as not Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
enough, but accused him for perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<hi>Athens</hi> against prostituting of
Boys if they were free, and
against hiring them to filthy

the <hi>Athenians</hi> afterwards (as well as before)
were generally guilty in this kind, and the
Law of that place allowed it. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

or blind, or any ways deform'd,
may be cast out, and without

would be well if there were a Law to forbid
the bringing up of Children that are any
way maimed and imperfect. Thus two of
the greatest Philosophers that ever were,
taught People to be cruel to the Fruit of
their own Loins, to be brutish and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to their own Flesh (nay, the worst of
Brutes are seldom found to do so). The
Practice of the Pagans was according to
this Doctrine, as several Writers inform us.

if Children were deform'd and unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they should be cast into a deep Cavern

This People (who were the Civilest of all
<hi>Greece</hi>) erected an Office on purpose for this;
they appointed so many Searchers, whose
business it was to examine every Infant as

they are strong and firm, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection

themselves whether there was any Lameness,
Blindness, or any other Deformity. If there
was, they presently ordered them to be thrown
into the <hi>Barathrum</hi> before-mentioned; or
else those Children that were at a very great
distance from that place, were to be carried
and left in Woods, or exposed on Rivers in
Baskets, and so to be left to the Providence

reason of false Principles which they had

it be an Annihilation, or a Change

<note n="†" place="margin">—Siquis modò extinctis sensus inest. Val. Max. l. 4. c. 6.</note> others have thus expressed

is that Passage of <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the Life of
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom that Wise Historian represents as
a Great Hero, and Singular Pattern of Vertue.
We must expect therefore that he will make
him speak like a Brave Prince, furnished with
true and sound Notions of things. He tells
us that this Great Man lying on his Death-bed,
and having certain Presages of his
approaching Departure out of the World,
commanded his Courtiers to come to him,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105317:147"/>
and called his Sons and Friends together,

                  <q>You ought not to think
you know certainly that I
shall be nothing after I cease
to live here. For let me
tell you, the Soul whilst it
is in this Mortal Body, doth
not live, tho it gives Life to the Body; but
when it leaves the Body, then it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lives, then it acts, and is truly knowing
and wise. The Tortures and Punishments
inflicted on Murderers by Souls thrust out
of their Bodies, and the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of Good and Innocent Minds, prove
that Souls still subsist. When Man is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
it is not probable that all things
belonging to him go to their particular
Kind except the Soul only. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that nothing is more like Death than
Sleep: but even in Sleep the Soul disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
its Divinity, and never more than then,
for it hath a prospect of things to come,
the Soul being at that time more free than
ever. If these things be so, reverence my
Soul when I am dead, and do according
to my Commands. But if these things be
not so, but the Soul perisheth with the
Body, yet reverence the Gods who are
Immortal. And a little after, he saith,
Call all the Persians and my Fellow-Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to my Funerals, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
with me<note n="*" place="margin">

Place and State, wherein no Evil can befal
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:105317:148"/>
me, whether it shall be my lot to be with
God, or whether to be reduced to nothing.</q>
A fair Speech indeed! This was the faint
Result of all the Knowledg which his Wise
Tutor could let him have of another State.
He had not determined whether after Death
he should be taken to the Gods, or be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated.
Thus <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as it was corrupted
and depraved, was unsteady and doubtful
about a Future Life and Happiness. Much
less,</p>
               <p>2. Had they any notice of the <hi>Eternal
Duration</hi> of them. Those of them who held
that the Soul was long-lived, had no firm
Apprehension of its being Immortal. But
especially the <hi>Stoicks</hi> failed here; <hi>Zeno,</hi> the
Master of that Sect,<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Diog. Laert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Zenone.</note> expresly asserted that
the Soul remains a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter Death, but at length
is corrupted. The Generality of this Sect
went so far as to say, the Soul survives the
Body a good while. But if you ask, How
long? They tell you 'tis only till the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
of the World. Yet here they were
divided, for there were some among them
who held, that the weaker sort of Souls
<hi>(viz.</hi> of the unlearned) perish with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but the stronger ones <hi>(viz.</hi> of Wise
Men) hold out till the Conflagration. And
with this agrees that Account which<note n="‖" place="margin">Diu mansuros aiunt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos; sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. Tusc. Qu. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi>
gives of them; and <hi>Seneca</hi> relates the very
same of this Sect of Philosophers. But the
certain Knowledg and Assurance of the <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Duration</hi> of Souls, and the <hi>Eternal Reward</hi>
of Vertue, is the Purchase only of Christ's
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:105317:148"/>
Appearing, who <hi>hath brought Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
i. e.</hi> Immortal Life, <hi>to light by the Gospel.</hi>
There was but a faint shadow of it before;
the Discoveries were dark and obscure, but
by the arising of the Sun of Righteousness,
this Darkness is dispelled, and we have gain'd
a clear Manifestation of the Everlasting
Subsistence of our Spirits in another World.
For Christ Jesus, whose Soul was of the same
nature with ours, commended his into God's
Hands, and so did the Holy Martyr St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
in imitation of Him; which assures us
that the Souls of the Righteous are taken
into God's Custody at their departure out of
the Body. This, together with the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Saviour and his <hi>ascending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
gives us an absolute Assurance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of our rising again, and living
immortally in another World.</p>
               <p>3. Their <hi>Philosophy</hi> proved <hi>Deceitful</hi> in not
determining <hi>wherein the True Happiness of Man
consisteth.</hi> The <hi>Different Notions</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Schools of Philosophy about the <hi>Chief
Good,</hi> proclaim aloud that they only guessed
at it, and were not able to tell wherein it
was plac'd. Their Mistakes were never so
numerous and (which is worse) so dangerous
as here. It is of infinite Consequence to
understand what is the Chief Felicity of
Man, what is the perfect State of Bliss, what
is the Principal and Last End of Man, wherein
there remains nothing further to be desired.
Now, He only can acquaint us with our
<hi>True Happiness</hi> who is the Author of it, the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:105317:149"/>
Lord of Bliss and Glory, who purchased Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Life for us, and is Himself the True,
Soveraign, Chief Good, the Ultimate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Wishes and Desires, Studies and
Endeavours, the only Rest and Center of our
Minds. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know,</hi> and in
knowing to enjoy <hi>the only True God, and Iesus
Christ whom he hath sent.</hi> It is the Utmost
Happiness of Man to have, in the discharge
of his proper Duty, the Favour of God, to
know and love him, and to be loved of him.
This is the highest Felicity our Nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, and it is no where fully discovered
but in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Philosophy</hi> was mistaken, and thereby
proved <hi>Deceitful</hi> in not discovering the <hi>True
Certain Way to this Happiness.</hi> And indeed
how could it? It was impossible for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
to know how to regain the Favour
of Heaven whilst they understood not how
they lost it. They could not come to the
full understanding of the true Cause of the
Degenerate Condition of Mankind. Whence
should they know that Man was at first
created pure and holy, spotless and innocent,
able to serve God with an unwearied Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and that he voluntarily abused his
Power and Freedom, and disobeyed the
Command of his Maker, and so by an Act
of his own Will apostatized from God, and
plunged himself into unspeakable Misery?
They could not reach this by their Natural
Light and Moral Reason. The most Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
and Inquisitive Brains, tho they have
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:105317:149"/>
made some guesses about the Corruption of
Mankind, were not able to arrive to a clear
account of this matter. They were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
that Nature was vitiated; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a strange Disorder, a horrible Shatter,
but they were ignorant of the Original
Spring and Source of it. And thus not
knowing the Cause of Human Corruption
and Depravation, it is no wonder that they
light not on the Right Remedy of them. In
the Gospel alone is set forth the Way for the
recovery of lapsed and degenerate Souls;
here is discovered the certain Method of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Pardon of our Sins, and the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God's Favour, and our Everlasting
Welfare. The Contrivance of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by the Blood of Jesus was too
high a Flight for the most improved Reason,
and Light of Nature. And when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to some of the most knowing Pagans,
they were loth to truckle to so low and
mean a Dispensation as the Gospel, which
teacheth us to trust and rely upon another's
Merits. They all agreed in this,<note n="*" place="margin">Unum bonum est, quod beatae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae causa &amp; firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est, sibi fidere. Sen. Epist. 31.</note> that <hi>there
is this one good thing which is the Cause and
Foundation of Happiness,</hi> viz. <hi>a Man's trusting
to himself, and resting upon what he can do by
his own Power.</hi> These lofty Sons of Reason
counted it absurd to be beholden to another's
Undertakings for their Felicity; especially
it sounded as the most ridiculous thing ever
heard of, to hope for Life and Happiness by
the <hi>Death</hi> of another. St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint

of all the voluminous Discourses
of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> is
not to be found there. There is nothing in
them of the exalted Morals of our Great
and Perfect Lawgiver, of the great Mystery
of Godliness manifested by a Redeemer,
and of the Knowledg of Jesus Christ, and
him crucified. Yea, in the account which
the <hi>Philosophers</hi> give of the ordinary Moral
Vertues and Vices, they are very wavering
and uncertain. He that is acquainted with
the Writings of the Chief Moralists among
them, knows that they frequently confute
themselves: their way is to set up their <hi>Wise

They extol, saith he, Vertue to the Skies,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:105317:150"/>
and prefer it before all other things, but do
not sufficiently explain to us the True Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, or lay the ground of it right: nay,
oftentimes that which is called Vertue by
them, ought rather to be stiled Vice. Now,
these ill Foundations cannot but be followed
with as bad Superstructures; and both of
them will promote vitious Practices in Mens
Lives. So that upon this account we might
conclude the <hi>Pagan Philosophers</hi> were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in shewing <hi>the way to Happiness;</hi> for
how could they do this, so long as they were
not able to build Men up in <hi>True Godliness,</hi>
and to make them <hi>really better?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their greatest Blemish was that which
I have already mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> their Ignorance
of the way of Life and Salvation by <hi>Iesus
Christ.</hi> They knew not that <hi>there is no other
Name under Heaven given among Men whereby
they must be saved.</hi> They understood not that
in the great and universal Deluge of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
this is the only Ark we can be safe in.
They were unacquainted with the Mystery of
Faith and Justification, and the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Assistance of the Holy Spirit,
and other such Divine and Saving Truths, the
Discovery of which is peculiar to the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

               <p>First, <hi>Superstition</hi> is a remarkable <hi>Work of
the Devil,</hi> and without doubt is meant here.
This is a Reverencing and Adoring at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as those Religionists at <hi>Athens</hi> did, who
erected an Altar to an <hi>Vnknown God:</hi> It is a
yielding of unreasonable and groundless Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and (to define it more generally)
it is attributing in a religious way, more than
is due to Things or Persons. It is in this large
sense, a vain and groundless <hi>Fear where no
Fear (i. e.</hi> no true cause of Fear) <hi>is.</hi> And
on the other hand, it is a fond and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<hi>Expectation</hi> of those things from
created Beings which they cannot afford us,
and which they were never designed for.
The Evil Spirit took care to employ the
Minds of Pagans about these Matters, that
he might thereby divert them from Objects
of a better Nature, and take off their
Thoughts from True Religion, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Author of it, and that he might hold
them in a constant dependance on himself,
whilst he perswaded them that these Foolish
Fears and Hopes should be of singular use
and advantage to them. Hence of Old they
had their <hi>Lucky</hi> and <hi>Vnlucky Days,</hi> on which
they made superstitious and fond Remarks.
<hi>The Observer of Times</hi> mentioned by <hi>Moses,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:105317:152"/>
Deut. 18. 10.</hi> and join'd with <hi>him that useth
Divination</hi> was, I conceive, of this sort: his
proper Talent was to tell what Days were
Fortunate and what Unfortunate, what
Events should happen on such Seasons, and
what on others, and which of them should
be Successful. And thus <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
the place. The <hi>Persians</hi> of old had
this Notion of the <hi>distinction of Days,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from their <hi>casting Lot from Day to Day,
and from Month to Month, (Esth. 3. 7.</hi>) when
the Design was on foot of Massacring the
Jews. They were sollicitous to enquire what
Lucky Days and Months of the Year would
happen to favour that Bloody Conspiracy.
From those first Ages of the World, this
Superstitious Practice was derived to the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> the former of whom (as
<hi>Hes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od, Pythagoras,</hi> and others acquaint us)
were very Great Observers of Days, criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
dividing them into Good and Bad ones,
and calling one kind of them<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Hesiod. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Mothers,</hi> and
the other <hi>Stepdames.</hi> Hence we have <hi>Hesiod</hi>'s
<hi>Days,</hi> which he stiles so, because he treats
there of the <hi>Difference of Days,</hi> some whereof
are Good, others Bad, and a third sort of a
middle Nature. And the latter (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>)
outdid the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>recians</hi> in this vain Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Days, marking the Lucky ones
(as they took them to be) with White Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
and the Unlucky ones with Black,
to signify the different Nature of them.
They grew at last so observant of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Times, that (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> and others
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:105317:153"/>
relate) they dared not keep Court, or engage
in Battel, or so much as invite their Friends
to Supper, or do any thing else in the course
of their Lives, upon those Times which they
had fondly mark'd out as Unfortunate.</p>
               <p>To this were added many other Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Usages, as <hi>Ariolation, Omens, Auguries,</hi>
and a vast number of other kinds of <hi>South-sayings</hi>
and <hi>Divinations.</hi> A very remarkable
and ancient Instance we have of these in King
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who when he would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
whether he should go against the
<hi>Iews</hi> or the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and be prosperous in
either Expedition, betook himself to the
known and usual practice of Divination,
(for they generally used before the Wars to
divine about the Manner of it: they writ
down the Names of the Countries or Cities
which they designed to invade and make War
against; and according as the Divination di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them, they fell upon such a particular
place):<note n="*" place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ek. 21. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>The King of</hi> Babylon <hi>stood at the
parting of the way, at the head of the two ways
to use Divination: he made his Arrows bright, he
consulted with Images, he look'd in the Liver.</hi>
Where we see that (according to what we
read in Prophane Authors, who speak of the
manner of Divination and Inchantment) he
is careful of that Circumstance so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by that sort of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> to chuse a
<hi>place where two or three ways meet,</hi> and there to
go about their Business, for they thought this
was very advantageous to their Designs.
Having thus made choice of a convenient Post,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:105317:153"/>
he falls to the work of Divining; and that
he may be sure to speed well, he uses three
sorts of Divination, that by one of them at
least (if the other two should fail) he might
arrive to a fore-knowledg of the future Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curence
he was prying into. First, <hi>He made
his Arrows bright:</hi> from whence some would
gather, that the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Kings had a way of
exercising their Magick Skill upon their <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi>
before they went out to Battel, to give
them Edg and Force when they came to fight.
But this is a gross Mistake, because this place
in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> represents only the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> way of
<hi>Divining,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Arrows</hi> are not
mention'd here with any respect to the <hi>Battel,</hi>
but only they are used in order to <hi>Divination:</hi>
Which was thus, according to St. <hi>Ierom</hi> on the
place; They put several Arrows into a Quiver
written with the Names of those things
which they consulted about, and that Arrow
which was taken out first, was the Lot; and
they determined by this which City to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
or Invade. Which comes near the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination
in use among the<note n="*" place="margin">Liv. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Letters</hi> and by <hi>Rods.</hi> But I rather think
that the <hi>Chaldee Version</hi> affords us a better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
which renders that Clause thus,

Arrows up into the Air,</hi> (where they are seen
<hi>bright</hi> and glittering, and therefore are said to
be <hi>made bright,</hi> which the other Account, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> takes no notice of) to see
which way they would fall, and thence to
know which way to lead his Army. This
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:105317:154"/>
I take to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> used by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
before he went out to War: He
stood <hi>in bivio, at the parting of the two Ways,</hi> (as
was the custom of Diviners) intently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
towards which of them the Arrows
fell, that he might know thereby whether the
<hi>Ammonites</hi> or the <hi>Iews</hi> were to be fought with
good Success. This was the very same
mode of Divination which was used by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> this was the very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>the divining by a Rod or Staff,</hi> so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
of old, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a large Word
and Sign; a Rod of Iron or Steel, or Wood,
or any such slender thing like a Wand, or
Staff, or Arrow. The <hi>Iews</hi> (who at one
time or other imitated all the Pagan Follies
in the World) took up this Soothsaying,
<hi>Their Staff declared unto them,</hi> Hos. 4. 12. <hi>i. e.</hi>
they made use of this <hi>Rhabdomancy</hi> which was
so frequent among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and thereby
they prognosticated concerning things to
come. The <hi>Arabians</hi> of old (as <hi>Christophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
à Castro</hi> tells us) consulted their Gods by
<hi>Arrows</hi> or <hi>Staves:</hi> and (if I may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to offer my Conjecture) this practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them and others was borrowed, either
from the Egyptian Magicians <hi>Rods,</hi> Exod. 7.
12. or from the <hi>Rods</hi> mention'd <hi>Numb. 17.</hi>
where the Israelites were commanded to
write the Names of the Princes of their
Tribes. The Gentiles it may be, in a fond
imitation of this Ceremony, (which without
doubt was grown famous, and spread abroad
in the World) made use of <hi>Rods</hi> or <hi>Staves</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:105317:154"/>
in Divination. This I propound in way of
Conjecture and Probability, it being unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
that the Gentiles aped the Israelites in
several things, as I shall have occasion at
another time to make good in abundance of
Instances, and those perhaps not hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He consulted with Images,</hi> or (as
'tis in the Hebrew) with <hi>Teraphim,</hi> so often
spoken of in the Old Testament, which are
no other than <hi>Images for Divination,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
future Events. These were a sort of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Images</hi> (for you must know that <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
(of which I am now speaking) and
<hi>Magick</hi> (of which afterwards) generally
went together) used by the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> especially, called by
these latter <hi>Talisman</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Selden de Dis Syr. 1. Syntag.</note>, made at a certain
time when they knew such Stars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations
were most active. The Diabolick
Spirits entred at such a time into these <hi>Images,</hi>
these <hi>Teraphim,</hi> and possessed them as they
used to take possession of Humane Bodies,
and by them and in them they spoke, and
moved and acted, and did strange Feats, and
gave Answers to those that enquired of them,
so that they may be said to be the Devil's
Oracles. These Images were very early in
the World, if we may credit the<note n="†" place="margin">Zoar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> Jewish
Writers, who tell us that they were used by
the profligate Sinners that lived about the
time of the <hi>Flood,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel-builders.</hi>
But this we are sure of, that
these Magical Instruments were made use of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:105317:155"/>
by the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> and that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
by him in the way of <hi>Divination,</hi> under
which <hi>Notion</hi> I have considered them at present.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He looked into the Liver,</hi> or <hi>the Heart,</hi>
(for the word <hi>Cabed</hi> signifies both) and thence
this sort of <hi>Augur</hi> is stiled <hi>Roeh baccabed</hi> by the
Jewish Masters, an Inspector into those parts
of Animals: whereby we are to understand
that common kind of <hi>Divination</hi> used by all the
<hi>Pagans,</hi> especially the <hi>Romans,</hi> (who perhaps
had it from the <hi>Chaldeans) viz.</hi> the looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Entrails of Beasts that were to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
and from that Critical Inspection,
guessing at what should come to pass.</p>
               <p>These were the three sorts of Divination
which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> applied himself to
upon so great an Emergency; and besides
these, there was an incredible number more
which the Pagan Nations <hi>(i. e.</hi> almost all
the World) addicted themselves to. But
indeed the Divination by the <hi>Fowls of the
Air</hi> was of the greatest account, for it
was believ'd by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,

               <p>I might add that <hi>Sneezing</hi> was accounted a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

               <p>To speak more generally, <hi>viz.</hi> of the

they were look'd upon as Certain and

Whenever they busied themselves

way of Divining, they were so besotted as
to think, that they could thence infallibly
foretel Futurities. To which purpose there
was a particular Office and College of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs,</hi>
who (though their Name be from one

<hi>Greater,</hi> and some <hi>Lesser,</hi> because the one
was created with Greater, and the other with

<hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings admitted <hi>Augurs</hi> into their
Councils, and constantly advised with them.
Yea, among the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> of old,
their Kings and Greatest Princes were skill'd
in Augury, for they thought it was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

Divination,</hi> and therefore in the beginning
prefaceth to them in excuse of what he was
to say, because he was an <hi>Augur</hi> himself.
There he reckons up the several sorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination
used by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> some of which
I have rehearsed here: And from the whole
we may observe, (which is the thing design'd
by me in mustering up these Pagan Follies)
that <hi>Satan</hi> bore a great sway in the Minds of
Men, and deluded them after a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to that purpose making use of <hi>all sorts
of Creatures</hi> (as well as the Serpent of old)
to deceive Mankind. <hi>Satan,</hi> I say, did this,
for I suppose the Conceit of those Persons
who think he had no hand in these things,

In all Places (as hath been sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
already) <hi>Auguries</hi> were
used when-ever any thing of
Consequence was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and done, that thereby
they might know (as they
fancied) whether it should
prove Successful. And as for <hi>the rest of the
Omens and Signs</hi> stiled Lucky and Unlucky;
the use of them was as Catholick, and
(which is worse yet) they were in esteem
even among some Persons of no mean Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Thus<note n="‖" place="margin">In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as serious a

                  <hi>Pliny</hi>
asserts (which is very strange, if we consider

be valid. And we shall find that <hi>Caras, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,
Amphiaraus, Tiresias, Amphiction, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampus,</hi>
and others, were the Great Authors
and Promoters of all sorts of <hi>Omens</hi> among
the Credulous <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we may take notice of this also, that
the most Noble and Generous Spirits, though
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:105317:158"/>
not enlightned with Christianity, slighted
these things, and look'd upon them as Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Thus we read how the Gallant <hi>Hector</hi>

                  <hi>the only best Augury, and that
which was of Divine Authority, was to fight va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
for his Country.</hi> It was a memorable
Speech of <hi>M. Varro,</hi> a most Wise <hi>Roman,</hi>
who, perceiving the Errors and Forgeries of
the <hi>Augurs</hi> Divinations, from their inspection
into the Entrails of Beasts, freely said upon
this Occasion, That <hi>the Gods were both Idle and
Sordid, in lapping up their Counsels in the unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory
Bowels of Brutes, to be raked out thence by
the mad Priests. Eusebius</hi> relates out of <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus,</hi>
an old Greek Historian, that when one
<hi>Mossolanus,</hi> (or as others, <hi>Mysonianus</hi>) a Great
and Notable Captain under <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, and Eminent for his Skill in discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Warlike Bow, advanced with the
Army near the Red Sea; a Soothsayer bid
him stop, and make an Halt: Whereupon
the Captain made bold to ask him, What
was the Matter? and why they were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to March? The Officious <hi>Augur</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
pointed at a <hi>Bird</hi> on the Way, and
told them, It was necessary to consult that
Animal, and to see which way it would fly,
that so they might follow her flight by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that way; or if she flew back, that they
might return too. The Warrier being thus
hindred on his March by the <hi>Augur</hi>'s trifling
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105317:158"/>
stay, to divine about the Success of the War
by that Fowl that sat on the Way, silently
drew his Bow and shot it dead upon the spot;
and when he had done so, he uttered such
words as these, How was it possible that silly
Creature could read us our Fortune, when
(you see) she could not foretel her own?
How could that Animal which foresaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Arrow, foretel us any thing of
our Journey? If she had known Futurities,
she had not come in the way to be kill'd by
<hi>Mysonianus.</hi> And so he marched on, and we do
not read that he was e're the less successful
for this Attempt. In relation to this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Q. Curtius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, condemns that Prince for his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in minding the Superstitious Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Omens of the <hi>Augurs.</hi> The Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Cato</hi> in this Matter is well known;
It was a Wonder to him if one Soothsayer
did not fall a laughing when he saw another,
they being all of them such a Cheating Tribe,
and designing purposely to abuse the People.
<hi>Cicero,</hi> who was an <hi>Augur</hi> himself, and one
of the chief of that Worshipful College,
sometimes seriously con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utes the Follies of
these Divinations, and at other times makes
himself merry with them, and laughs at those
fond Men who direct their Lives by the chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of a Crow, by the Entrails of a Sheep,
by Oracles, by Dreams, by Lots, and by
Fantastick Prodigies: This is the Task of
that Great Wit, in his <hi>Second Book of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Thus among the Wisest Men, the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:105317:159"/>
Folly of Sooth-saying was despised and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and the <hi>Augurs</hi> themselves were
look'd upon no other than Impostors; and
many of the other Pagan Superstitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be disesteemed and laid aside.</p>
               <p>Now, if this was done by those that made
free use of their Reasons and Judgments, it
is no wonder that it was back'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, whose Design
it was to rectify and improve those Faculties.
We cannot but observe therefore, that what
was hitherto said and done, was far short of
what was afterwards effected towards the
Time of our Saviour's Coming into the
World. This <hi>Day-Star from on High,</hi> even
before it actually visited us, and blessed our
Horizon, darted such a Light into the World,
that they were inabled to discern, tho in an
imperfect manner, the gross Fooleries of that
Superstitious Religion which was among
them. And when the Glorious Light of a
Saviour and Redeemer <hi>shined forth unto a
perfect Day,</hi> when the Son of God manifested
himself in the Flesh, then the dark and dismal
Night of <hi>Superstition</hi> wholly vanished in many
parts of the World, and the Follies which they
once embraced, grew odious and abominable.
And it is most certain that the Principles and
Maxims of <hi>Christianity</hi> do eminently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the fond Surmises and frightful Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of <hi>Superstitious</hi> Men. Nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
could do it so effectually as the Gospel:
for now under the Evangelical Oeconomy
and Christian Dispensation, our Adoration
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105317:159"/>
is confined and determined, and <hi>we know whom
we Worship;</hi> and therefore the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
of the Gentiles can have no footing here.
And as for the Dread of Future Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Christianity</hi> hath utterly removed it by
the Right Apprehensions of things which it
blesseth us with, and by teaching us to place
Religion in that which is truly Religion. It
effectually extirpates all Superstition, by sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
the Principles of Enthusiasm and Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,
by suppressing False Fears, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
and Groundless Terrors, by superseding
all Fantastick Devotion, by putting an end
to all Foolish Rites and Idle Ceremonies, all
Superfluous and Needless Observances, which
proceed from a Causless Timorousness in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and from False Representations of
God and his Worship. All this we owe to
the Truth and Doctrine revealed by <hi>Iesus
Christ:</hi> For though considerable Discoveries
were made by some Wise and Serious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among the Heathens, as well as Jews,
yet this was nothing in comparison of what
followed, when the Laws of <hi>Christ</hi> prevailed
in the World. And particularly as for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations</hi>
and <hi>Sooth-sayings,</hi> (wherein a great
part of the Gentile Religion consisted) as
they were reckon'd to be Fanciful and
Groundless things, and not founded on any
True Reason and Bottom, even by some of
the Pagans themselves, (as you have heard) so
they are much more rejected, confuted and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
by <hi>Christianity</hi> which is our <hi>Reasonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and requires nothing of us but what is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:105317:160"/>
just and accountable, and every way corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent
to the Dictates of our Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This acquaints us, that all those <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Omens</hi> are really what some of them
were called by the Pagans themselves, <hi>Bruta
Fulmina,</hi> Insignificant Flashes, meer Mormoes
to fright Children and Fools, things that have
no other Existence than Imagination, actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Devil</hi> the Author of Delusion,
especially of all <hi>Superstitious</hi> Cheats, which
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> came to discover and destroy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is reasonable to understand by
<hi>the Works of the Devil,</hi> the <hi>Pagan Oracles</hi> which
were so famous of old at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and in
other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the <hi>Trophonian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
at <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Lebadia,</hi> (both in <hi>Boeotia);</hi>
and those other more remote ones in <hi>Lybia</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Countries, where were
these Habitations of the <hi>Devils,</hi> those Dens
of <hi>Satan,</hi> who loved to be enquired of and
courted by the ignorant and besotted <hi>Pagans.</hi>
I know there are some who think there was
nothing of the Diabolical Spirit in these Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
but that they were only for Gain. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Rhodiginus</hi> professeth himself to be of this
Opinion; but yet before he ends the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(where he asserts it) he ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
That<note n="*" place="margin">Lect. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. l. 2. c. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>this Business was not altogether
managed without some correspondence with and
help from the Devil.</hi> And there is a<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Tho. P. B</hi>'s Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says.</note> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of late very much concern'd and moved,
because we attribute it to him: <hi>The setting up
of Oracles,</hi> saith he, <hi>was merely for the Interest
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:105317:160"/>
of the Priests, and that was all. They were a
Iuggle to get Money and Repute, especially among
the reat Men and Princes:</hi> Therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
That <hi>they are Superstitious Christians
who think they were from the Devil.</hi> But who
sees not the Vanity of such an Inference as
this, as if the Oracles could not be from the
Devil, and yet for the Priests Interest too?
These are no ways inconsistent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whilst this Gentleman makes one exclude
the other, he uses a Fallacy, but no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I deny not but there was Interest in
the case, yea, double Interest, that of the
<hi>Devil,</hi> as well as the other of the <hi>Priests.</hi> I
grant him that <hi>Oracles</hi> were a <hi>Iuggle,</hi> but a
<hi>devilish</hi> one; and he must acknowledg the
same, if he pleases to remember that there
were <hi>sometimes</hi> such things foretold by them
as could not possibly be foreseen and known
by Humane Skill. But the Knowledg and
Sagacity of the <hi>Evil Angels</hi> might reach them;
because these Invisible and Active Spirits can
fly up and down the World with infinite
swiftness, and inform themselves of all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
whatsoever, and are present at the
most private Consults, and have learn'd, by
long Experience and Observation, to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Designs of Men, and to see the very
Disposition and Tendency of Causes before
they begin to act: Besides that, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
caballing together, and holding Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with one another, so that it is
probable what one of them knows, the
whole Herd of them is acquainted with, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:105317:161"/>
that in a few Moments time. Hence, hence it
is that the <hi>Oracles</hi> spoke such shrewd things
<hi>sometimes,</hi> which it is impossible to give an
account of, unless we assert that this Office
was set up and maintain'd by those Invisible
Demons: for 'tis certain, that the most Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Subtilest Priest of them all could
never have foretold those things. Again,
there is ground to believe that these Ill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were Managers here, because we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd
from those who describe the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Circumstances of the delivery of the
<hi>Oracles,</hi> that there was something more than
<hi>Man</hi> in it. The Place was fill'd with ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Noise and Horrour, loud Shrieks and
Howlings were heard, and sometimes the
Temples were torn with Thunder-claps; the
Earth trembled and quaked, and so did the
Priests: these now appeared with erected
Hair, with distorted Eyes, with foaming
Mouths, and unusual but frightful Voices;
they beat and knock'd their Breasts with an
Inhumane Fury; they raged and raved, and
ran about like possessed Persons, as indeed
they were. The Subterraneous Demons,
whom they consulted and dealt with, put
both the Earth and their Bodies into this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Disorder. This looks like the truest
Cause of them, and therefore we have good
reason to assert, that those Pagan Priests were
acted by those Evil Spirits, who generally
brought them their Intelligence, and help'd
them to give Answers. And this was done
(if I may be permitted to offer my Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105317:161"/>
in imitation of the Celebrated <hi>Oracle</hi>
of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and of the <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations</hi>
and <hi>true Prophetick Spirit</hi> which the
Holy Scripture speaks of: for 'tis certain that
the Infernal Spirits did in many Particulars
emulate the things and practices which were
in use among the People of God the Jews,
and which are recorded in the Sacred W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, I think we may
cross the Learned Gentleman's Assertion, and
with Confidence, as well as Reason aver,
That <hi>they are no Superstitious Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, who
think the Pagan Oracles were from the Devil:</hi>
For we find apparent Marks and Signs of
his acting in them, we see those things done
which we cannot impute to any other Cause,
and therefore here is no reason to cry out of
<hi>Superstition.</hi> But on the other side, we may
suspect there is something worse, and that
those who so briskly oppose the Devil's act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Heathen Oracles, are perswaded
there are no such Beings as Devils. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis certain, that these Persons shew
themselves <hi>ignorant of the Devices</hi> of these
Diabolical Spirits, whose Business it is, by
all Arts and Methods imaginable, to hurt and
mischief Mankind: and this of their <hi>Oracles</hi>
was none of the least effectual to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

the Sense and Remembrance of their
Duty, by nourishing in them False Fears and
Fond Credulity, yea, a Diffidence in God's
Providence, and a Trusting in the Enemy of
Mankind. Hereby likewise (as hath been
intimated) they abused and prophaned the
most Sacred Things of Divine Institution and
Appointment, <hi>viz.</hi> by an impious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
aping of the Holy Oracles, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Visions and Dreams which were
vouchsafed to God's own peculiar and chosen
People. Thus it appears that the Design of
the Pagan Oracles, was not wholly for the
Interest of their Priests, but that the Devil
got much more by them than they. I see
reason therefore to subscribe to <hi>Lactantius</hi>
and other Pious Fathers, who expresly tell
us that they were the Invention of Satan.
And indeed this was not only the belief of
<hi>Christians,</hi> but of <hi>Pagans</hi> themselves.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note>

it was necessary for me to undertake in the
first place under this Head) I proceed now
to prove that our Saviour <hi>destroy'd</hi> those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<hi>Works.</hi> This he effectually did, by
curbing and lessening the Power of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Spirit, by detecting his Cheats and
Forgeries, by silencing his Priests, and by
striking the Devil himself dumb. It is true,
even before Christ's Birth, the Histories of
those Times tell us, that the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Oracles did not presently cease just at

These and other Writers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracles were
ceas'd, and would tell them
then Fortunes no more; that
the Daemons were all pack'd
away; that the Forlorn Spirits had quitted
their Beloved Territories, and with horrid
Groans resigned up their former Mansions.
And this is it which was foretold by one of

the Prophecies concerning Him and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
be fulfilled, in those very Places where
Paganism and Idolatry so mightily prevailed.
But we need not fly to the Poets: It is
evident from other Writers, that upon
Christ's manifesting himself to the World,
yea, sometime before he actually appeared,
the Oracles were generally suppressed and
quashed. I will mention only <hi>Plutarch,</hi> a
Grave Historian and Philosopher, who lived
in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Reign, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

utters many Ridiculous and Absurd Things.
But he is to be excused, because he could
give no other, he being so unhappy as not to
own the Author of Christianity, who was
the Cause of this and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105317:164"/>
Causes; much after the rate of <hi>Tully</hi> in
his <hi>Book of Divination,</hi> who imputes it to the
Earth become Old, so that the Fatidick Virtue
was worn out through length of Time; <hi>As
we see,</hi> saith he, <hi>many Rivers are dried up and
turn'd into another Course for the same Cause.</hi>
Just so <hi>Plutarch</hi> Philosophizeth; The Oracles
(saith he) depended upon the Nature of the
Soil, that is, a particular sort of Ground in
those Parts, sent up a particular sort of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
and Exhalations, which with their
Steam affected the Priests Brains and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and so moved them to prophesy, and
made them capable of giving Answers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Future Events, to those that came
to consult them: But after a long time, this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Quality and Temperament of the Earth
vanished, and could not any longer supply
the Priests with such a sort of Vapours as
would cause Predictions; and so farewel
Oracles. A very goodly Account, you'l
say, especially from one of Great Learning.
This is <hi>Vain Philosophy</hi> indeed; but let us not
upbraid Him, but bless God in behalf of our
selves, that we have attained to greater Light
and Knowledg, and are acquainted with the
True Causes of things, and are assured that
those Oracles were Cheats and Delusions of
the Prince of Darkness; and in plain terms,
that they were <hi>the Works of the Devil,</hi> and
therefore it was no wonder that they were
<hi>destroyed</hi> by Him, who <hi>was manifested for that
very Purpose.</hi> But that which I alledg this
Writer for is this, that you may be satisfied
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105317:164"/>
from him of the Matter of Fact, and be
throughly convinced that things did really
happen according to our Saviour's Design,
and that these Works of the Devil were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
Accordingly therefore this Author
tells us, that in his Time the Oracles general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were cashier'd. Indeed the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle
would now and then tattle a little, but very
sorry Stuff it was, he saith, and it was<note n="*" place="margin">

The Oracular Daemons could not afford, it
seems, to versify as they had done before;
the Vein of Poetry flagg'd. And in <hi>Boeotia,</hi>
a Country which before swarm'd with Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
there was (he saith) but a single One
left. Those that would be farther satisfied
in this Matter, may consult<note n="†" place="margin">Praepar. Evang. lib. 4 &amp; 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who
hath fully treated of this Theme, shewing
not only the Vanity and Falshood of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
but particularly relating how they ceas'd
at Christ's Coming: this being so largely
handled by him, I remit the Reader thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And now I might observe concerning these
<hi>Oracles,</hi> (as I did before of the <hi>Superstitious
Divinations</hi>) that many of the bravest and
wisest Heathens cared not for them, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
slighted and jeer'd them, as<note n="‖" place="margin">Plutarch. de Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doto.</note>

Arrant Cheats, (for the Devil could Cheat

they pleas'd. The People began at last to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:105317:165"/>
see through these Impostures, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
their regard to them was considerably
abated. They arrived to this Notion, (which
<hi>Minutius Felix</hi> insists upon) that the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of these Oracles were not successful, and
the Despisers of them prospered. They found
out at length the Reason why <hi>Apollo</hi> gave
such Dark and Ambiguous Answers, why
they were deliver'd by the Priests muttering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with a low Voice, so as not to be
perfectly heard, namely, because by this
means they could best salve their Cheating,
and the Enquirers should not be able to know
whether they spoke Truth or Falshood. For
these Reasons <hi>Apollo</hi> was Sirnamed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he oftentimes put them off with <hi>Oblique</hi>
and Doubtful Responses: for the Devil in
these Oracles of Old professedly <hi>Equivocated,</hi>
and plaid the <hi>Iesuit</hi> betimes. I could set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you what the brave <hi>Cato</hi> thought of
these Oracles, as he is represented in <hi>Lucan.</hi>
I might transcribe a great part of <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book of Divination,</hi> which discovers the
Vanities of these Responses, and proves
them to be meer Gulls. But you know my
Business at present is to evince, (and I hope
I have done it sufficiently) that these Lying
Oracles were confuted at last by a Greater
than <hi>Cato</hi> or <hi>Tully,</hi> even <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our
Lord. It is a known, but remarkable Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the Daemons complain'd
aloud that their Great God <hi>Pan</hi> was dead:
That was the lamentable Voice which was
heard in the Grecian Sea in <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Reign,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105317:165"/>
when our Saviour was Crucified. Then
<hi>Christ through Death destroyed him who had the
Power of Death, the Devil:</hi> then <hi>the Prince of
this World was judged:</hi> then our Saviour, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spoiled Principalities and Powers on the Cross,
triumphed over them in it.</hi> No wonder then
that the Cursed Daemons howled and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
when they saw their Kingdom was
shaken, and began to fail; when they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
found that He who <hi>cried with a
loud Voice</hi> on the Cross, had drowned the
Noise of their Juggling Oracles. And in a
short time, as Other Writers will inform us,
this Diabolical Trade was clearly put down
in the most considerable Countries of the
World, which we must attribute to the sole
Power and Soveraignty of that Jesus who
came <hi>to destroy the Works of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I understand by these <hi>Works</hi> the
<hi>Diabolical Obsessions of Mens Bodies,</hi> which our
Savi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he ejected the Evil Spirits out of those poor
Wretches who were thus <hi>possessed</hi> by them.
It is evident that at the time when <hi>Christ</hi> was

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105317:166"/>
perhaps not be understood in the <hi>rigour</hi> of it
in every place, (for <hi>Lunaticks</hi> and <hi>Epileptick</hi>
Persons, when they were extraordinarily
distempered, were said by the <hi>Iews</hi> to be
possessed with an <hi>Evil Spirit;</hi> and in this kind
was <hi>Saul</hi> troubled, say the Jewish Doctors);
yet the Relation which those Inspired Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
give of the Formal and Solemn Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Devils by our Saviour, is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Proof to any observing Person, that,
if not all, yet most of those who are call'd
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, were really <hi>Possessed.</hi> For tho

in <hi>Matth. 17. 15.</hi> yet all that can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

others that were possess'd with the Devil, had
Periodical Fits, that they were either <hi>Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
or <hi>Distracted</hi> at certain times; and that,
as it is usual with such Persons, they were
worse when the <hi>Moon</hi> increas'd. Therefore
the <hi>Arabick</hi> Version of the forenamed Place

former was the Author of the latter. Or,
we may say, the Impure Spirits chose to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into those crazy and Diseased Bodies,
when they were most disposed to Illness by
the powerful Influence of the Moon. This
is no Argument that they were not really
possessed with the Devil; but it is a plain
Proof of the contrary, and of something

else, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> doubled his Malice, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tormenting them at a time when
they were least able to bear it. As for the
<hi>Reasons</hi> why such vast Numbers of Men were
thus visited when our Saviour was on Earth,
these may justly be assigned; it was an Age
much given to Magick and Inchantments, and
the calling up of Spirits was a frequent thing
in those Days: Besides, Divine Providence
might so order it at that very juncture of
Time for an Occasion of the more Glorious
Cures. It might happen by the Particular
Disposal of the Almighty, that thereby it
might appear to the World, that Christ had
Power over the Devils, and could, when he
pleased, dislodg those Mischievous Spirits,
and rescue Mankind from their Tortures.
The Reality and Greatness of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over those Infernal Powers, were to be
demonstrated by those Atchievments. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it may rationally be thought that the
Devils would be most busy then when Christ
came into the World, and would be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
to disturb and torment Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they saw their Kingdom was going
down, and Christianity was to be exalted in
the World. Now therefore it was time for
the <hi>Messias</hi> to exert his Miraculous Power;
and behold, as an effect of it, the Devils sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, and at his Command pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
quitted the Bodies which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
possession of. One Person among the
rest was a famous Instance of this sort, out
of whom a <hi>Legion of Devils</hi> was ejected by
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105317:167"/>
Christ's Holy Exorcism: With one Word
he vanquish'd whole Regiments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Darkness; he routed Armies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Daemons. I remit you to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Records, where you have abundant
proof of the casting out of these Hellish Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
not only by our Saviour himself, but by
his Disciples, who (as you read) came to
him with these words in their Mouths,

                  <hi>Origen</hi> rationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,

               <p>And this was a thing not unusual in those
very Days in which this Father lived, as well
as before. We are ascertain'd that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Christians, merely by their Prayers and
Invocations, ejected those Spirits, and made
them confess what they were. That they
had this Power in <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>'s Days, who
flourish'd in the middle of the Second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
appears in his known Dialogue with
<hi>Trypho,</hi> where he expresly saith, <hi>The Devils
tremble at the Name of Christ, and being adjured
by that sacred Name, they become subject to us.</hi>
That they did the same in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Time,
which was some few Years after, is cleer

tell us, that not only their Words and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

                  <hi>The very Devils at this time

I could derive it lower, and also shew
you that these and other Christian Writers
commonly appeal to the Pagans concerning
the Truth of these things, and alledg this
Ejection of Devils as a great and undeniable
Proof of the Authority of the Christian
Religion, as certainly it was. But I add no
more, having said enough for my purpose,
which was, to make it appear, that among
other <hi>Works of the Devil,</hi> Christ <hi>destroyed</hi> This
in particular.</p>
               <p>Fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thly, Is there not reason to think that
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> refers here to what Christ did, when
by his Coming he rooted out <hi>Magick</hi> and
<hi>Sorcery, Dealing with the Devil,</hi> either by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
Witchcraft, or Consulting with those
that did, and the like Works of the Black
Art, which the Cursed Spirit taught the
World? These were the Devil's <hi>Opera</hi> which
he shewed of old, and got so much by,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105317:168"/>
whereby he pleas'd and gratified, and at the
same time bubled the easily deluded People.
Not to attend to the perverse Folly of those
mere <hi>Matter-Men</hi> who disown Spirits, and
consequently deny a <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Devils,</hi>
(for they will rather profess Atheism, than
acknowledg any such Rank of Beings.) Not

take notice in this place of what they are
wont to say in Defence of their Mad Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I shall take it for granted, that <hi>Magical
Operations</hi> (properly so call'd) are <hi>the Works
of the Devil,</hi> and that he was the first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them, designing and endeavouring
thereby to bring Men under his Dominion,
and (so far as he can effect it in the Minds of
Men) to exclude God and his Providence
out of the World. This questionless was
his Design, and was never doubted by the
Ancient Christians, as appears

yet there was a Communication with him,
because the Persons gave themselves into his
Hands by their immoderate Curiosity, by
their affecting to know more than was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

that there were <hi>Enchanters, Witches, Charmers,

<hi>Necromancers:</hi> for these Persons, and their
Practices, would not have been condemned
and pronounced <hi>an Abomination,</hi> (as they are
there) unless there had been really such. This
I think is very plain and unanswerable. And
truly I am apt to believe, that the Holy Ghost
makes use of <hi>so many different Words</hi> here, on
purpose to obviate and refute the vain Cavils
of the Men of our Days, who are Infidels as
to the Point of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and with great
Confidence tell us, that there is no such
thing, and that the Foundation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> a

Here are <hi>six Words</hi> to press and inculcate
<hi>the same thing,</hi> (though if we be Critical,
there may be found some difference, because
one word may be more expressive of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Act of that Cursed Art than another;

after this Life, by sending us to <hi>Moses</hi>

us, that <hi>Simon the Sorcerer, who bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the People of Samaria,</hi> was soon reclaimed
by <hi>Philip</hi>'s preaching the Gospel there, and
that <hi>he believed and was baptized,</hi> Acts 8. 9, 13.
And another Noted Sorcerer, was not only
rebuked by St. <hi>Paul</hi> after this severe manner,
<hi>Thou Child of the Devil,</hi> (a fit accost to such a
one as He, for <hi>Magick</hi> is properly the <hi>Devil's
Work) thou Enemy of all Righteousness, wilt thou
not cease to pervert the right Ways of the Lord?</hi>
Acts 13. 10. but he was <hi>struck blind</hi> by the
fame Miraculous Hand, and disabled to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his impious Practices. St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewise
undertook the former of these Hellish Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
and in the midst of his Magick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and Adventures, brought him down
headlong and defeated him, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from very Ancient Writers. When
St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where several
of the Inhabitants were given to this Vile
Art, he as it were, by more Holy Charms
and Spells, made them throw away their
<hi>Books of Curious Arts,</hi> that is, of Inchantment,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105317:171"/>
and then bring them forth, and burn them,
<hi>Acts 19. 19.</hi>

                  </gap>
which St. <hi>Luke</hi> here makes use of, and let
you see how fitly it is here applied. This
word being no where to be found in the
New Testament but in this place and in one
other, we must consult other Writers, and
observe how 'tis taken in them. <gap reason="foreign">

it was well observed by an Historian,
concerning one of the Roman

Thus you see the Connection between

Thus you see what ground there is from the
denotation of the word it self, and from the
use of it among Writers, to fix that sense
upon it which we have done. But besides
this, if we take notice of the particular <hi>Place</hi>
and <hi>Persons</hi> that St. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uke</hi> here refers to, we
shall be yet farther confirmed in this
meaning. We may observe, that the Scene
of this Action is <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as is clear from the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:105317:173"/>
                  <hi>1st</hi> and <hi>17 verses</hi> of this Chapter. They are the
<hi>Ephesian</hi> Converts whom this Text speaks
of, these are they that had heretofore <hi>used
Curious Arts.</hi> By minding of this (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
after what hath been said already) we
may certainly gather what these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are,
for <hi>Ephesus</hi> before all other Cities was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to these Impious Studies. Not only
<note n="*" place="margin">In Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> but other very credible Writers
(whom the Reader may consult) particularly
take notice that the People of this Place
were in a more than ordinary manner encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to, and conversant in these Arts. This
was so common and notorious, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a <hi>Poverb,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was used
as a known expression to signify <hi>Magick Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
as several<note n="†" place="margin">Plutarch. Athenaeus, Hesychius, Suidas, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander ab Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro, &amp;c.</note> Antient Writers testify.
From this old Proverbial way of speaking,
we may gather what St. <hi>Luke</hi> here means
by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> those <hi>Ephesian Characters</hi>
or <hi>Charms,</hi> those <hi>Magical Notes</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi>
which that People were so famed for,
and by which they did such great Feats, or
seem'd to do so at least. The <hi>Ephesians</hi> had
a certain set of Letters and Words which
they used in Enchantments, and they never
failed; so greatly were they befriended by
the Author of them. The <hi>Christians</hi> call'd
these <hi>Diabolical,</hi> but St. <hi>Luke</hi> here useth the
word, which perhaps was receiv'd at <hi>Ephesus</hi>
as well as in other Places; and he tells us that
<hi>many of them who used these Curious Arts,</hi> were
now weary of them, and <hi>brought their Books
together, and burned them before all Men.</hi> When
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105317:173"/>
they came to be acquainted with the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
they soon disliked those <hi>Ephesian
Letters,</hi> and in a pious Revenge, used them
in the like manner that Books of that sort
used to be dealt with: for from the<note n="†" place="margin">Liv. lib. 39. Sueton. in Augusto.</note> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi>
Writers and others, we are informed, that
the Punishment which was wont to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
on Books of such a Nature, was <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of them: so that the very Penalty here
voluntarily inflicted on these Books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us of what kind they were. That
which particularly and signally shews the
Efficacy of the Gospel in destroying these
<hi>Diabolical Works,</hi> is this, that these <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
who were so addicted to Devilish Practices,
and were Magical even to a Proverb, that
these (I say) were reclaimed from these
damnable Studies by the Preaching of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
among them, and presently gave a <hi>demonstration</hi>
of their hearty Repentance for their past E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities,
by producing their Books of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
and committing them to the
Flames. And that which makes this yet
more remarkable is, that these Books which
they thus consumed to Ashes, were of so
great a Price, no less than <hi>five Myriads of Silver,</hi>
(for so 'tis in the Greek, and I do not know
why it should not be rendred so by us. This
Translation is more exact than <hi>[fifty thousand
Pieces of Silver]).</hi> These <hi>Ephesians</hi> shew'd the
Truth and Sincerity of their Conversion by
this one generous Instance, by parting with
that which cost them so dear, and by which
they could have gain'd so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:105317:174"/>So much for this Notable Passage in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> which is as great and Convincing a
Proof of the Matter in Hand as could be
offer'd, and therefore I thought good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon it. I might go on, and let you see
out of <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> that <hi>Conjurers</hi> were
not able to play their Magical Pranks in
the presence of Holy Christians. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and <hi>Lactantius</hi> agree, that the Heathen Gods,
or rather their Priests, complained that their
Rites could not be performed so long as any
Christians were in their Temples, or present
at their Sacrifices. The Astrologers and
Soothsayers of <hi>Alexandria</hi> cried out, that
they could do little or nothing in their
Wicked Art till <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was removed out of the City. And
'tis the Universal Testimony of Writers,
that when Christianity waxed Great in the
World, Magick dwindled, and grew less
and less. It will, I think, be confessed by
all Men, that the Transactions of the Devil,
with Witches and Persons of a resembling
Quality, are neither so frequent nor so
powerful as they have been heretofore. The
Light of the Gospel dispels these Works of
Darkness. This we find foretold by the
Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> and
his appearing in the Flesh, <hi>I will cut off Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts
out of thy Hand,</hi> Ch. 5. ver. 12. And it
follows in the next Verse, <hi>Thy graven Images
also will I cut off, and thy standing Images out of
the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Work of thy Hands.</hi> Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:105317:174"/>
me of the next thing contained in the
words.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, By <hi>the Works of the Devil,</hi> we must
needs understand <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Polytheism;</hi> than
which there was nothing more serviceable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the promoting his Kingdom in the
World. I grant, that the Pagan Priests
were no Losers by Idolatry, yea, that they
were Gainers by it; but 'tis absurd to infer
thence, (as I have shewed before in the like
Case) that it was not <hi>the Work of the Devil,</hi>
that it was not set up and managed by him
to advance his Interest in the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may know how to judg of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Doctrine, who saith, That<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Tho. P. B</hi>'s Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says.</note> 
                  <hi>the
setting up many Gods among the Gentiles was only
for the Priests Gain, because the Sacrifices and
Worship done to them were so profitable to them;
whereas the Worship of one God would not have
brought in so much Gain. This was the sole Cause
of Idolatry,</hi> saith he. Still he is wonderfully
civil and obliging, extreamly courteous and
friendly to the Great Enemy of Mankind,
and will not harbour any ill Thoughts of him,
either as to the <hi>Pagan Oracles,</hi> and I suppose
as to <hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Magick,</hi> and we are sure as
to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> He is perswaded, (but hold
there, I do not know that, for it may be he
speaks not his inward Sense, I may rather
say he tells us) that those most Cursed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
and Designs of that Hellish Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
were none of his, and that they were
only contrived by the Covetous Priests to get
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105317:175"/>
a Penny. I see the Devil is a very Innocent
and Harmless Creature, according to some
Persons; it will be well for them if they find
him so. But we have more reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is very Spightful, Malicious and
Destructive, and that he not only seeks for,
but makes use of all Occurrences and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to endamage Mankind, and that
he is pregnant in his Inventions to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And such we may justly reckon these
to be which I have mentioned, and therefore
I take them to be from another Spring than
what some imagine. It is evident that they
are properly the <hi>Devil's Works,</hi> and carry his
Mark upon them: particularly as to <hi>Idolatry</hi>
or <hi>Polytheism,</hi> it is plain that it is of his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up. <hi>Ye shall be as Gods,</hi> was the early
Insinuation and Suggestion of that Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to our first Parents in Paradise: The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>being Gods</hi> strangely wrought upon
them, and procured our Misery. This was
the first Temptation of Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is the first
step to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which of all <hi>his Works</hi> may
justly be stiled his <hi>Chief Master-piece.</hi> It is
true, the wisest of the Pagans asserted One
God, and knew that there were not Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Deities, but the generality of them
thought and believed otherwise; and the
Philosophers themselves complied with these
Vain Worshippers, and so confirmed the
People in their Error. Nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
than that the greater part of the World
heretofore declared for a Multiplicity of
Gods. The Idea of God, like some great
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105317:175"/>
Mirror, was broken in pieces by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and in every one of these they saw a
Deity, or fancied they did so. Every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of God, was a Distinct God. But
this was more pardonable; they proceeded
to worship the Heavenly Bodies, and ascrib'd
Life and Divinity to them. Nay, they ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack'd
for Gods and Goddesses below, as well
as above: they found them in the Earth, and
in the Deep, as well as in the Heavens. The
Number of these Deities had reached to
thirty thousand in<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Hesiod</hi>'s Time; and they
were almost as many more afterwards; for,
if <hi>Varro</hi>'s Computation be right, there were
above that Number of Gods and Goddesses
worshipp'd by the <hi>Europeans</hi> alone. Nor
would one way of worshipping them serve
their turn. There were as many various
Rites and different Sacrifices, as there were
Deities; the Solemnities which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to one, would not suffice another.
Nothing forsooth would please <hi>Ceres</hi> but a
Sow, nothing would serve <hi>Aesculapius</hi> but a
Cock, and the most acceptable Offering to
<hi>Neptune</hi> was a Bull. The Pagans fancied that
one God delighted in this Oblation, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that; and therefore to be sure to
please them they had Particular Services and
Diversities of Worship for them. <hi>Egypt</hi> was
the most fruitful Soil for this; it furnish'd the
rest of the World with Gods. The Grecians
(who afterwards stock'd the Romans) took
the Names of their Gods, their Temples,
their Altars, their Images, and most of their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105317:176"/>
Superstitious Ceremonies from that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

as this is called very frequently in the
Old Testament. The Heathen World was

Sin, though <hi>not willingly, i. e.</hi> as this Author
expounds it; the Devil forced them to it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

               <p>But this gross Folly and Madness was
soon disgraced and discountenanced by the
introducing of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and even in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
the Mother and Nurse of all Idolatry, where
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:105317:177"/>
Garlicks and Onions (no very fragrant
Deities) had Veneration paid them, and Cats
and Crocodiles were good fashionable Gods;
where they worship'd all things in Nature,
where every thing living or dead was a
Deity, even here this Prodigious Idolatry
was destroy'd by Christ's Coming; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s preaching there, and at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
especially, Images were soon demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
the Counterfeit Gods were thrown
away, and the only True God, Father, Son
and Holy Ghost were worshipp'd with an
unanimous Veneration. At <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and
even in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Palace, and in all the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
belonging to the Roman Emperours,
there were some to be found who discover'd
their hatred and detestation of Idols, and
adored the True God in Spirit and in Truth.
But the Pagan Worship had got such deep
rooting in the Hearts of Men, and had by
long Custom and Prescription so gained their
good Will and Approbation, that almost
four Centuries of Years had passed after
Christ's Incarnation, before it could be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
extirpated, and the True Worship
of God become the Religion of the Roman
Empire. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great made the
first remarkable and generous Essay towards
this Glorious Work; in his Reign it was
that Idolatry received its greatest mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and he was succeeded by many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
that imitated him. <hi>Let all the Images

and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Idol Temples were
all demolished, and Idolatry every where
in their Dominions destroyed, and all
False Gods discarded. Thus the Blessed
Work went on with great Life and Vigour,
being set forward by Royal Hands, and those
Hands being strengthned by the Son of God.
Therefore the Pious Father said well,<note n="*" place="margin">

of Idolatry over the World, and Christians
more powerful destroying of it. And you

the great Proof and Confirmation of the
Truth of the Christian Religion, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon with mighty Force and Reason
by all the Antient Apologists for Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                  </gap>ophecies were plainly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
when our Saviour came and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned

                  </gap>ound
the <hi>Worshipping of Devils,</hi> which had
been a thing very fashionable in the World
before Christ came into it. I say, <hi>the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:105317:179"/>
of Devils,</hi> the highest Strain of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
was confounded by our Saviour's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing:
for it seems the Devil could not
be content to cheat the World with his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
to enter into Mens Bodies, and to
make Leagues and Contracts with Persons,
but (as an Effort above all these) he affected
to be worshipped and adored as a God.
This is confess'd by <hi>Porphyrius</hi> in his Book
of <hi>Abstinence from Animals:</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> and
St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and other Fathers make use of
what he saith there against the Pagans, whom
they undertake to confute. That the Gods
whom the Gentiles sometimes worship'd,
were <hi>Devils,</hi> is also the acknowledgment of
<hi>Trismegistus</hi> in his <hi>Asclepius.</hi> And it is owned
by all the Wise and Understanding Heads
among them that the Service paid to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Gods was a kind of Adoring
the Devil. It is well known that these
Worshippers could, by certain Magick Spells
make these Infernal Fiends come to their
Images when they pleas'd: and when they
had brought them thither, they worship'd
these Wicked Ghosts to appease their Fury,
and that they might do them no harm. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Particulars which I insisted on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
do sufficiently evince the present Point;
for the consulting the Devil when he spake
in Oracles, and dealing with him by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Witchcraft and Sorcery, were a palpable
forsaking of the True God, and setting up
the Devil for a God. These were giving
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105317:179"/>
Divine Honour to the Prince of Darkness.
And, which is most convincing, do not the
infallible Oracles of Scripture expresly tell
us, that the Idolatrous Jews <hi>sacrificed unto
Devils, not to God?</hi> Deut. 32. 17. which (to
confirm the Truth and Certainty of it) is
repeated in <hi>Psal. 106. 37. They sacrificed their
Sons and Daughters unto Devils.</hi> And if I be
not mistaken, the Psalmist had before refer'd
to this abominable Practice, ver. 28. <hi>They
ate the Sacrifices of the Dead,</hi> i. e. (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
the Sacrifices that were offer'd to the
<hi>Manes,</hi> and to the <hi>Stygian Iupiter</hi> or <hi>Pluto</hi> the
God of the <hi>Dead:</hi> these are meant here by
<hi>Zibche methim,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifices of the Dead.</hi> I
know some Writers have lessen'd and minc'd
this Idolatry, as well as that before spoken
of, and tell us that the Pagans all along
worship'd <hi>God,</hi> though under a false Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.
It is partly true, that the best
of the Heathens did so, but others did not:
and as for those that defend the contrary,
they are confuted by downright Authority
from Scripture, which acquaints us, that
they worship'd even <hi>Devils:</hi> for sacrificing
to them, is worshipping them. If they can
evade this, let them. I could add, that the
<hi>Hebrew Masters</hi> were of Opinion that some
of the Jews worship'd the <hi>Devil</hi> in shape of
a <hi>Goat</hi> in Woods and Deserts, because the
word <hi>Sagnir</hi> is both <hi>Daemon</hi> and <hi>Hircus,
Lev. 17. 7. 2 Chron. 11. 15. Isa. 13. 21.</hi> &amp; 34.
14. And 'tis likely this worshipping of
<hi>Satyrs</hi> was a piece of Devilish Idolatry which
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105317:180"/>
they learnt and brought from<note n="*" place="margin">Diodor. Sic. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
'twas practis'd. But this we are certain of
from <hi>a more sure word,</hi> (as you heard) that
the Devils themselves were adored by them.
And concerning the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Worship, the
Apostle is peremptory, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 20. The
things which the Gentiles sacrificed, they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to Devils, and not to God.</hi> Whereas the
<hi>Greeks</hi> used to call the Victims or Beasts
which they offer'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the Apostle on
the contrary plainly stiles them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>things sacrificed to Idols,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 1, 4, 7. &amp;
10. 19, 28. In which places <hi>Idols</hi> are no other
than <hi>Diabolick Spirits</hi> which inhabited in those
Idols.</p>
               <p>But Christ by his coming soon put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to this Hellish Usage. When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
was so impudent as to make that offer
to him, <hi>All these things will I give thee if thou
wilt fall down and worship me,</hi> he presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
the bold Spirit, by alledging what was
<hi>written,</hi> not only in the Law, but in all
Mens Hearts, that they should <hi>worship the
Lord their God, and serve him only.</hi> And by
the whole System of his Heavenly Doctrine
he built up this Truth, and pull'd down the
Contrary, and all the least Tendencies to it.
After our Saviour left this Earth, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Followers managed the same Work,
and endeavour'd by all means to run down
this Cursed Project of the Devil, <hi>viz.</hi> of his
being worship'd. As a particular Effect of
their Care to baffle this Design, we read,
that the Primitive Christians solemnly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105317:180"/>
vowed at their Baptism <hi>to renounce the Devil
and all his Works.</hi> By which,<note n="*" place="margin">De Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctac. c. 4.</note> saith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
is principally meant <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yea, and
the worst kind of Idolatry, a giving Divine
Honour and Worship to those that are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and not Gods, a Sin very common at
Christ's Coming into the World, the greatest
part of it at that time living in this Vile Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith this Father, this was
made a chief part of the Baptismal Vow,
that the Proselytes and Converts to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
should in a solemn manner bid Defiance
to that detestable Enormity of the Heathens.
Conformably to this our Learned<note n="†" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> Pract. Cat. l. 6. Sect. 3. P. 375.</note> 
                  <hi>Catechist</hi>
in reply to that Question, <hi>What is meant by the
Devil and all his Works?</hi> answers thus, <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the principal thing here renounced, is the False
Gods,</hi> i. e. <hi>Devils, which the Heathen World did
worship so universally before Christ's Time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which the Catechists (who prepared all for
Baptism) did first labour to fortify their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and are for that Cause called in the Ancient
Church</hi> Exorcists, <hi>as those that cast out these
Devils.</hi> Very near a-kin to This, is that
which is added next in the Solemn Vow at
Baptism, <hi>viz. The renouncing the Vain Pomp and
Glory of the World:</hi> For that word <hi>Pomp</hi> in its
Original meaning, refers to the <hi>Idolatrous
Shews</hi> of the Heathens, it properly signifying
<hi>sending</hi> of some thing, and <hi>carrying</hi> it up and
down to be seen and exposed: so that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
are denoted those Splendid Sights and
Stately Processions in use of old among the
Heathens; at which Solemn Times the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:105317:181"/>
the Thrones, the Ornaments, and all
the Habiliments, as also the Oblations and
Sacrifices which were to be offer'd to their
Gods, were carried openly through the
Streets, and Honour was done to these false
Deities. The Ancient Fathers of the Church
very strictly caution'd their Flock against
these Devilish Customs; and particularly
when they admitted Converts into the
Church by Baptism, they took care to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
them against them. Hence may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Antiquity of the Form and Office
of Baptism, which our Church makes use of
at this Day. The solemn <hi>Renuntiation of the
Devil and his Works, and of the Pomp and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the World,</hi> is as old as Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
Yea, some Learned Men have
thought, that the Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> alludes to
it, in his <hi>1 Epist. Chap. 3. v. 21.</hi> and that <hi>the
Answer of a good Conscience</hi> there, refers to the
manner of <hi>Interrogation</hi> and <hi>Answer</hi> used in
Baptism. But this by the by. That which
you are chiefly to take notice of is, that
whereas the Wicked Ghosts and Daemons
were ambitious of Divine Adoration, it
pleased God so to bless and succeed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, that in a short time this wicked
Usage wore away, this cursed <hi>Work of the
Devil</hi> came to nought, the Christian Faith
being, by the wonderful Providence of
Heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>opagated so universally through
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:105317:181"/>Sixthly, I conceive, that by <hi>the Works of
the Devil</hi> are meant here especially <hi>those Sins
which have most of his Image upon them,</hi> and
wherein Men more immediately and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resemble that Accursed Spirit; those
Works which the Devil chiefly tempts Men
to, and which he himself is observed to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
most. As first, <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> are
the proper Guise and Character of <hi>Devils;</hi>
for these lapsed Spirits being irrecoverably
damned themselves, are fired with Revenge
and Malice against all Mankind; being thrust
down from Heaven, they endeavour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from coming thither. Wherefore
<hi>Envy</hi> (which is a Grieving at the Good and
Welfare of others) Sporting with Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
Exposing them to Obloquy and
Disgrace, Delighting in the Miseries of those
we affect not, Rejoicing at the Evils which
befal others; these have all an Impress of the
<hi>Devilish Spirit</hi> on them. Our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
concerning the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> whom he
found to be Envious and Malicious, that <hi>the
Works of their Father they would do,</hi> plainly
giving us to understand, that these Vices are
more eminently <hi>Diabolical.</hi> But the Laws of
Christianity strictly enjoin us,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to lay aside
all Malice and Envy,</hi> and command us to
<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them
that weep, and<note n="‖" place="margin">—V. 10.</note> to be kindly affectioned one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another,</hi> and to delight in the Welfare
and Happiness of our Brethren. Again,
<hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Passion, Bitter Strife</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:105317:182"/>
may be justly ranked among <hi>the Devil's Works.</hi>
Schism and Faction are from him, who was
the first Mutineer and Rebel against Heaven,
and ever since delights in Wars and Tumults,
and loves to ruffle and embroil the World,
and raise Tempests and Storms in it. But
Christ Jesus, our Blessed Peace-maker and
Reconciler, came to remove all Grounds of
Difference, and to introduce Universal Love
and Charity. And Christianity it self is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with Peaceable and Healing Principles,
and offers all the Motives and Incentives to
it imaginable. The Laws of Christ are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set against all undue Passion and Choler,
and there are in no Institution whatsoever so
severe Prohibitions of this Diabolical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Let all Bitterness, and Wrath, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
be put away from you.<note n="†" place="margin">V. 26, 27.</note> Let not the Sun
go down on your Wrath; neither give place to the
Devil.</hi> Where we learn, that the Fire of <hi>Hell</hi>
burns in <hi>Angry</hi> Breasts; the Brimstone of the
Bottomless Pit may be smelt there. He that
is overcome of <hi>Passion,</hi> gives place to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I add in the next place, that <hi>Pride</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>Diabolical.</hi> It was this which first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Fellow-Angels, and
thrust them down from their Heavenly Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and made them (what they now are)
Devils. But our Saviour on the contrary
throws down Pride, and exalts Humility,
and commends it to all his Followers from
his own Example, <hi>Learn of me, for I am
Meek and Lowly.</hi> This is a right Christian
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:105317:182"/>
Temper, and is Heavenly and God-like, and
whoso fosters it in his Breast is beloved of
God, and all Good Men. <hi>Reproaching</hi> and
<hi>Reviling</hi> are no less <hi>the Devil's Works,</hi> and
thence he hath his Name given him in the
Greek: A <hi>Devil</hi> and a <hi>Reviler</hi> are terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible.
It is the Office and Employ of the
Evil Spirit, first to raise, and then to keep
up Slanders and Contumelious Reports. But
behold, our Blessed Master hath left us Rules
diametrically opposite to these Practices.
<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 31.</note> We must <hi>put away from us all Evil-s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

We are not suffer'd to revile, though
we be reviled: Yea, we are to be possessors
of that Charity which<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor.

               <p>To proceed, <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Craft</hi> and
<hi>Treachery,</hi> most sensibly discover the <hi>Devilish</hi>
Nature. These Windings and Crooked
Courses are the Goings of the Serpent. We
are told, that <hi>the Devil put it into</hi> Judas'<hi>s
Heart to betray Christ,</hi> that we may thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that Treachery and Perfidiousness are
more immediately from that False Spirit:
And for this Reason chiefly our Saviour doth
once and again call this Mock-Apostle<note n="‖" place="margin">John 6. 70. &amp; 8. 44.</note> a
<hi>Devil.</hi> But certainly nothing is more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to Christianity, than this base and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Vice. And Christ and his Apostles, both
by Precept and Example, commend Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Truth and Sincerity, and disallow of all
Guile and Hypocrisy, and herein shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
opposite to the Wicked Spirit, who
<hi>is a Liar, and the Father of Lies,</hi> John 8.

               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:105317:183"/>In the same place it is said, <hi>He was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
from the beginning;</hi> which suggests to us
another Particular. He began betimes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
his Cruel Nature: in the first setting out
of Mankind, he stir'd up <hi>Cain</hi> to kill his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and ever since this Savage and Bloody

                  <hi>Apollyon</hi> is his Name, and he acts
agreeably to it. As for his Violence and
Cruelty towards Mens Bodies, in continual
haunting and worrying the <hi>Possessed,</hi> I have
said something already in this Discourse; but
it is another sort of Cruelty which I am now
to speak of, of which I will propound these
two notable Instances: First, <hi>The Humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>
which were offered in most parts of
the World. Secondly, The <hi>Bloody Prizes of
the Gladiators,</hi> which prevail'd in great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
chiefly at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mistress and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness
of the World: And I will briefly
hint to you how the Christian Religion <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
these Works of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I say, <hi>Humane Slaughter</hi> and <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
were no unusual things in the World.
The Evil Spirit taught Parents to make a
Burnt-Offering of their Children unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi>
to Sacrifice them alive in the Valley of
<hi>Hinnom;</hi> so that the Name of Hell, <hi>Gehenna,</hi>
takes its denomination <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rom that bloody
Usage. This <hi>Moloch</hi> was the God of the
<hi>Ammonites;</hi> but it appears from <hi>Ier. 7. 31.</hi>
and <hi>Psal. 106. 37.</hi> that even the <hi>Iews,</hi> God's
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:105317:183"/>
Select People, burnt their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to this Idol, nay, although they had been

the<note n="*" place="margin">Solomon Jarchi, D. Kimchi, Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note>
                  <hi>Rabbins</hi> hold, that the Children were not
burnt or killed, but that two Fires being
made, the Priests drew them between both,
and that was all. But this is a Rabbinical
Fancy, for 'tis clear from that place in the
fore-mentioned Psalm, that the Children
who were offered to <hi>Moloch,</hi> were slain and
burnt. <hi>They sacrificed their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
Iisbechu, Mactarunt, they killed them:</hi>
And therefore it immediately follows, <hi>They

23. <hi>i. e.</hi> Ceremonies that were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Slaughter and Death of their
Children. But I think I can guess at the
Reason why some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> conceited
that this <hi>passing through the Fire</hi> was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the Death of the Persons, but
was rather Purgative than Mortal. The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of this Opinion might be this; There
was a very old Custom of passing through
the Fire without Killing: for those that swore
to clear themselves of a supposed Guilt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
likewise to purge themselves, and
clear their Innocence, by going through, or
over, or between certain Fires, or hot glowing
Coals, or Irons; and if they came off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt,
they were believ'd to be Guiltless.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105317:184"/>

Piece of Superstition: and our own Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
tell us, that our Ancestors in this Island
were no strangers to such a kind of <hi>Ordeal.</hi>
This perhaps might give some Jewish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
occasion to imagine, that this kind of
<hi>Fiery Trial</hi> is spoken of, when the Scripture
saith, <hi>The Children pass'd through the Fire to</hi>
Moloch; and to think it was only a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating

were not burnt, but only pass'd between two
Fires; though in another place he is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion). But this is a gross Mistake,
for the fore-named Text informs us, that it
was a <hi>Bloody Rite;</hi> and accordingly <hi>Philo,</hi> a

to be of that Nature, and explode the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Nothing was more common with them, than
to offer up an Innocent Person to the Gods
in time of some Imminent Danger, to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their Wrath, and remove the Publick
Calamity. This Example of Devilish Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
was very frequent among the Pagans
<hi>before</hi> our Saviour's Coming, and a while
<hi>after:</hi> But as soon as Christianity had got
any footing in the World, it began to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
After Christ had offer'd himself a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

was propagated, this Custom of <hi>Sacrificing
Men</hi> ceased in a great part of the World. It
is true, this Cruel and Tyrannical Sway of
the Evil Spirit is not yet wholly destroyed.

We read of the Dreadful and Astonishing
Apparitions of Satan to the People of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi>
and <hi>Brasil,</hi> and other Countries where
Paganism is still in its Meridian. These
Devil-Worshippers complain, that he cuts
and tears their Flesh, and miserably torments
their poor Carcasses. Indeed those that give
an Account of the <hi>Americans</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi>
(as <hi>Acosta</hi> and others) do constantly take
notice, that flashing and cutting their Bodies
are usual in their Worship. But it is to be
hoped, that this and all other Acts of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
will at last be abandoned, when the
Christian Faith shall arrive among those
Bloody Men. We are to bless God, that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105317:186"/>
there are any Effects of it already in those parts
of the World, and to pray that there may
be yet a larger and more vigorous Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Laws of Christianity, which
are against nothing more than <hi>Cruelty</hi> and
<hi>Bloodshed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Bloody Spectacles of the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators</hi>
were no small Instance of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Empire</hi> in the Pagan World, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in Slaughter, and made it one of
their Publick Sports to see Men kill one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
upon the Theater. It was usual not
only to expose Men to fight with Beasts,
and at last to be torn by them, but they
kept others to fight with their own Kind,
and to dispatch one another. Of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
of these speaks that Pious
Bishop <hi>Salvian;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Spectaculis pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum deliciarum genus est mori homines, impleri se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum alvos humanis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, cum circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um voluptate &amp; conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientium laetitiâ.

                  <q>In those
Spectacles, saith he, the
main thing that pleased them
was, to feast their Eyes with
the slaughter of Men, and
to see Wild Beasts gorge
themselves with Humane
Flesh, and that with an
incredible Satisfaction and Delight.</q>
This was the Lot of some Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Malefactors, and of some that were
taken Captive in War. These who had
fought with <hi>Men,</hi> were now compell'd
to fight with <hi>Beasts,</hi> and so to lose
their Lives. And some think that the
Blessed St. <hi>Paul</hi> was put upon this sharp
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105317:186"/>
Service at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for they take that to be
the meaning of his words, when he saith,
<hi>He fought with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>1 Cor. 15.
32. i. e.</hi> not with <hi>Wicked Men</hi> (as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
interpreted) who are Irrational and
Savage Creatures, and Men only in Shape,
but really with <hi>Wild Beasts,</hi> with whom he
was condemned to fight for his Life, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Punishment inflicted on him. This
is the Interpretation which St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and
St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> give of the words: and it will not
seem strange, if we duly consider these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
things.</p>
               <p>1. When there is a plain and express
place of Scripture, 'tis not safe to evade it
by flying to Metaphors. Which is the Case
here: St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he fought with Beasts;</hi>
and we may very well understand it in the
plain and obvious Sense of the Words;
wherefore we are to chuse this Literal Sense
before a Metaphorical one: Especially if we
consider.</p>
               <p>2. That this was in those Times and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
an usual Punishment inflicted on the
<hi>Christians.<note n="*" place="margin">Tertul. Apol. c. 40.</note> Christianos ad Leones,</hi> was the
Peoples Cry: though, I grant, that <hi>merely to
be thrown to the Beasts</hi> was another thing; there
was no fighting then, they were thrown to
them to be torn in pieces presently, and to
be devoured, as that Glorious M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtyr<note n="†" place="margin">Euseb. Eccl. Hist. l. 3. c. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natins</hi>
was. But <hi>Others</hi> were exposed to <hi>fight</hi>
with them, and that on the Publick <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and they were armed for that purpose,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105317:187"/>
and if they could get the mastery of the
Beasts (of which the Instances are very rare)
they were set free: which known Custom
and Practice it is likely the Apostle's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in the forenamed place, may be well
applied.</p>
               <p>3. It is remarkably said <hi>[at Ephesus];</hi> for
in this Celebrated Place, that Bloody sort of
Prizes was very usual, as we are informed by
<note n="‖" place="margin">Oneiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit. l. 1. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Artemidorus</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>4. What you read to have been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the <hi>great Vproar against St.</hi> Paul <hi>at</hi>
Ephesus, <hi>the dragging his Companions into the
Theater,</hi> Acts 19. 29, 31. seems to have a
particular relation to this very thing.</p>
               <p>5. Those words in <hi>1 Cor. 4. 9. We are made
a Spectacle (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) unto the World,</hi> may be
thought to be an Allusion to this his fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Publick Stage; especially if you
mind the words immediately following, <hi>God
hath set forth us as 'twere appointed to Death,</hi>
design'd by our Adversaries to that Fatal
Combate.</p>
               <p>6. This is more than intimated to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
2 Cor. 1. 8. where he acquaints
them with <hi>his Trouble which came to him in</hi>
Asia, (of which <hi>Ephesus</hi> was the Chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
how <hi>he was press'd out of measure above
strength, in so much that he despair'd even of
Life:</hi> And in the next Verse he tells them,
that <hi>he had the Sentence of Death in himself:</hi>
And then in the next words he thankfully
acknowledgeth God's Hand in <hi>delivering him
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105317:187"/>
from so great a Death.</hi> All which Passages
seem to refer very plainly to this <hi>Deadly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the Beasts at</hi> Ephesus: Or at least
it appears hence, (as the Learned Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> acknowledg) that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was designed, appointed by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to this Punishment, although God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
their Bloody Designs. If it be
objected, that the Apostle makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this among his Dangerous and Bloody
Adventures which he particularly recounts in
<hi>2 Cor. 11. 23,</hi> &amp;c. This Answer may suffice,
that the Apostle underwent more than he
particularly sets down; but in those general
words <hi>[in Deaths oft]</hi> he comprehends all:
Yea, these very words may particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to his <hi>fighting with Wild Beasts,</hi> which
certainly had been attended with <hi>Death,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Divine Providence had in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner interposed. So that this
Objection is of no Force, and cannot hinder
us from taking the words in their proper
meaning. In brief, I will say this, although
perhaps none of these forementioned Texts
singly taken, may be thought sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to a belief of what I have propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet if we consider them altogether, I
think they will not fail to render it very
<hi>probable.</hi> This is all I suggest, leaving every
one to determine as they please. Though
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was deliver'd from so great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet
a Death, and that by no less than a
Miracle perhaps, yet in these Bloody Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:105317:188"/>
the Beasts generally got the better:
yea, sometimes one Lion was hard enough
for<note n="*" place="margin">Praeclara aedilitas! unus Leo, ducenti bestiarii. Cic. Orat. pro Ses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

happen'd, it was a Worthy and Noble
Prize indeed, for they always esteemed
these Games according to the Number of the
Persons that were dispatched by the Beasts:
when the most Men were killed upon the
Spot, the Sport was at the highest, which
shews how <hi>Devilish</hi> it was.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>latter sort of Prizes, viz.</hi> where
Men fought with their own Kind, was
the worst. In these Bloody and Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Matches, they first brought Slaves
on the Theater to combate one another,
and afterwards others of better Quality.
Besides, some were <hi>hired</hi> to undertake this
Employment, and some were <hi>bred up</hi> and

to Arm, to fit them for this Purpose.

               </p>
               <p>From these Passages we may be informed
how mad the World was upon Slaughter and
Bloodshed: We see what strange Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
these Civilized People admitted among
them, what Barbarous and Outragious Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were approved of by them. This I
might well mention as one Instance of the
<hi>Devil's working</hi> among them. But the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
continually declamed against those
Bloody Games, they Preach'd and wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these Inhumane Combates; and at
last<note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. in vit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. M. l. 4.</note> the Christian Emperors strictly forbad
them. You may read in the Antient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists,
how these Unlawful and Mad Shews
are struck at, and how the Christians are
particularly warned against them. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
was not permitted to be a Spectator
of them, but by his Profession and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:105317:189"/>
he was obliged to declare against
them, and draw off others (if he could)
from being present at them. Hear the words
of one of the most Learned Apologizers for
the Christian Religion against the Pagans;
<q>We,<note n="†" place="margin">Athena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, in Legat. pro Christian.</note> saith he, abstain from, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to these Spectacles of the Sword-Players,
being perswaded that there is no
great difference between being a Spectator
of these Bloody Prizes, and an Author of
the Bloodshed there committed.</q> Thus
the Primitive Christians shew'd their Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of these Entertainments, and so at
length they came to be wholly laid aside, and
accounted utterly unlawful. Thus this <hi>Work
of the Devil</hi> was <hi>destroyed:</hi> which we cannot
but attribute to the Manifestation of the Son
of God upon the Earth, and to his Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
which promotes Tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Pity, and condemns whatever is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
and Bloody.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the Slaughter and Murder of Souls</hi> are the
worst and highest Cruelty, the Main Work
and Business of that Implacable Enemy of
Mankind. Those Cursed Spirits being fallen
themselves from God, indeavour the Apostacy
of all Mankind; and this they do, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men into Error, and by tempting them
to Sin and Wickedness. They are as busy
in debauching Mens Minds by Erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and False Doctrines, as they are in
any other Design; and they get as much by
it: for by corrupting Mens Understandings
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:105317:189"/>
and Notions, they prepare the way for all
other Mischiefs to ensue. <hi>Heresies</hi> are of the
<hi>Devil,</hi> and lead to him; and therefore <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>
knew what he said, when he call'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>
(that Arch-Heretick) the <hi>first-born of
Satan.</hi> But the inveigling to Practical Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
which is no other than <hi>Vice,</hi> gives him
chiefly his Denomination of <hi>Tempter;</hi> and
consequently those who allure others to
Vice, those who entice them to Evil Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
are to be call'd by no softer Terms, than
those of <hi>Murderers</hi> and <hi>Devils;</hi> for <hi>Tempting,
i. e.</hi> drawing others to Sin, is properly <hi>the
Work of the Devil;</hi> this is that which he
constantly practiseth, and takes so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in. But the Blessed Founder of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is a Saviour and Lover of Souls, who
thus expostulated when he was on Earth;
<hi>What is a Man profited, if he shall gain the
whole World, and lose his own Soul? or what shall
a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> This Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was Loving and Kind-hearted, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to a painful and ignominious Death,
to give an undeniable Demonstration of his
Compassion to the Souls of Men. He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
the Cross, and shed his Blood there,
to convince the World how Tender he was
of their Immortal Concerns, and Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Welfare: And let me speak a Great
Word, He would even now leave all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and die once more for Man, if it were
necessary for the procuring of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:105317:190"/>Lastly, <hi>Carnality, Lewdness</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness,</hi>
may fitly be stiled <hi>the Devil's Works.</hi> It is well
known, that these prevailed even in the most
Solemn Rites and Devotions of the Pagans.
As the Poets represent the Gods Lewd and
Lascivious, so the most Serious Authors tell
us of the Impure and Filthy Sacrifices, the
Villanous and Beastly Rites performed to
them. They relate the Obscene Feasts of
<hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Priapus,</hi> of <hi>Flora</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and
acquaint us that they kept their <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> or
Festivals of <hi>Pan,</hi> in running up and down na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
behaving themselves in that lewd man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which cannot be named without injuring
chaste and modest Ears. Of the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,
in Honour of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina,</hi>
we have some Account from<note n="*" place="margin">Adv. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentin.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian:</hi>
and the Religious Ceremonies of <hi>Isis</hi> were
as lewd and obscene, saith<note n="†" place="margin">De Isid. &amp; Osir. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarch.</hi> It is
certain that Lewdness and Wantonness were
the very Ingredients of their Worship, and
their very Temples were <hi>Stews. Arnobius</hi>
makes it his Business in his fifth Book, to
shew how obscene and unchaste, how immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and shameless their <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
their <hi>Stories</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> were.
In brief, <hi>Vncleanness</hi> hath been so eminently
confirmed to be <hi>the Work of the Devil,</hi> that
the Foul Fiends have sometimes assumed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to act it in, as<note n="‖" place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin. de civ. Dei. lib. 15. Bodin. contr. Wier.</note> some have thought. But
Christ coming in the Flesh, destroyed even
the <hi>Deeds</hi> of the Flesh: he chose to be born
of a Pure Virgin, that he might give a Pattern
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:105317:190"/>
of Spotless Purity in the World; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his Holy Institution, was to Sanctify
Mens Bodies and Souls, and to fit them for
the unstained Pleasures of another Life. Thus
I have finish'd my Task, having largely and
particularly shew'd you what <hi>the Works of the
Devil</hi> are, either such Works as are done by
that Evil Spirit, or such Vices and Practices
in Men, as more nearly approach to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
Nature and Temper; and I have at the
same time proved that our Saviour and his
Religion, do overthrow and <hi>destroy</hi> these
<hi>Works</hi> of the Infernal Spirit.</p>
               <p>I will only add a Critical Remark on that
manner of Expression in the Text, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]
<hi>that he may loose</hi> (our English Word, it
is likely, coming from thence) or <hi>dissolve,</hi> &amp;c.
for that is the exact rendring of the Word.
This supposes <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Fetters:</hi> We were in
Durance and Captivity, we were shut and
lock'd up<note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 42. 7.</note> in the Prison-house, we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of Satan and Dominion of Sin:
but the Merciful <hi>Iesus</hi> came to rescue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
Mankind, to knock off their Fetters,
and to set them at Liberty. <hi>For this purpose
the Son of God was manifested,</hi> and for this only.
He came not (as the <hi>Iews</hi> fondly imagined
concerning their <hi>Messias)</hi> to be a Great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monarch, to wage War, and to beat the
<hi>Romans</hi> out of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and to make his People
Rich and Wealthy, and to promote them to
great Honours. This alas was a poor Design,
and not worthy of the <hi>Messias:</hi> but he came
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:105317:191"/>
to effect a thing of greater Moment, even of
Universal Concern, and that which is more
Noble and Glorious than all Worldly Empire
and Soveraignty. He came to free his People
from the Tyranny of Satan, to vanquish the
Prince of Darkness who had enslaved all
Mankind.</p>
               <p>Or, this Word gives us a true Notion of
our Saviour's Design, thus: The Devil had
corrupted Man, had been the great Instrument
at first of depraving his very Nature, and ever
since he hath made it his Work to debauch
Mens Minds and Manners, and by all ways
imaginable, to render them like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Hereupon the Son of God was sent,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he might <hi>dissolve, defeat, undo</hi>
these Works of the Devil. This is the short
and plain Account of the Grand End of
Christ's being manifested in the World, of
his Incarnation, Doctrine, Life, Sufferings,
Death, and all his Undertakings whatsoever;
it was no other than this, <hi>to undo, to annul</hi> all
that the Devil had done in the World. Christ's
task was to <hi>pull down</hi> what <hi>Satan</hi> had <hi>built up,</hi>
to untie, to untwist all his Knots and Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
