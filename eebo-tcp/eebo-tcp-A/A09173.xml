         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the fruite and effect receiued by his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
whereby he gaineth vnto himselfe the

direction and comfort of trauell. My selfe
<pb facs="tcp:14508:3"/>
hauing passed the morning tide of my Time
(wherein I should haue conuersed with the
learned for my better instruction) onely in the
vaine disports and pleasures of the field: And
now at the Sunne setting looking back to view
the benefit receiued thereby, do finde the seed
of pleasures to render no fruit, &amp; so by defect
of learning, insueth the effect of Idlenes, being
meerly nothing. The profite of which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
bestowed as a remembrance for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort in their yoonger yeeres, to mingle with
their pleasures some exercise of knowledge &amp;
learning, may happily produce in them an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in future time, wherby to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
answerable to their degrees &amp; callings,
both for the better performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
vnto the State, as also for the administring
of Iustice in the weale publike. For a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
without learning is like vnto an vnskilful
physition, who maketh the whole sick, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
seldome the diseased: or rather more fitly
compared with an vnlearned schoolemaister,
who in steed of instruction giueth correction.
For as he seldome well ruleth, who hath not
first duly obeied: euen so faileth he right to
<pb facs="tcp:14508:3"/>
censure, who hath not in him to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
right and wrong; the offended, and the
offence giuer. As Idlenes is the mother of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
so is it the nurse of aspiring and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiall
minds. Neither do I infer heerupon the
vnlearned to be ill affected, but onely the idle
to be woorst disposed. And as the qualities of
Idlenes are diuers, so are the effects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
some end in mischief, som others waste
Time without profit, other some giue good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which last of the three,
is the whole summe of my trauel. For finding in
my self the want of those ornaments and good
partes of learning which are requisite for the
honorable, could wish others not to feed the
flower of their yeeres with the vanities of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but to recompence the benefit of time with
some effect of knowledge, to the good of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as example of theirs. For in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or type of mans life, the most that we know
is the least part of the rest wherof we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
My deceased Grandfather (most gracious
Soueraign) your Maiesties late officer and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
being a President vnto his to shun Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and to performe their duties with all loial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:14508:4"/>
&amp; obedience passed many yeeres in Court,
as well to manifest the humble desire of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
mind towards his Princesse, as also for the
instruction of his posteritie to hold nothing
(next vnto the true knowledge and feare of
God) of like price, as the inestimable comfort
of the good opinion and fauour of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
wherof hoping, and by sundry assured
experiments finding no lesse from your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
towardes me, as onely proceeding from
your Highnes gracious inclination &amp; clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and not of any desert or my part giuing
cause thereof; am thereby the rather embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
most humbly to craue pardon, as one by
reason of many defects vnable to perform that
seruice which in desire I wish, and in duetie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth,
as chiefly acknowledging my selfe
greatly bound vnto your Highnes, in that your
Maiestie most graciously tendring my long
sicknes &amp; weake estate of body, would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to licence my late absence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so speciall a
cause of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce concerning the proceding
against those vnnaturall and traiterous parts
&amp; practises, tending to the destruction of your
Maiesties sacred and royall person: sorowing
<pb facs="tcp:14508:4"/>
the aduerse euent of my health at the instant,
especially such, as vpon so firme an argument
or token of your Maiesties most gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
and good opinion conceiued, not to be in
case by seruice to performe any thing answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in desert to the least part of so honorable a
credite &amp; fidelitie reposed. But (right mightie
and Soueraigne Lady) like as your Maiestie of
speciall grace hath hitherto accepted my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and dutifull mind in lieu of action: Euen so
on my knee I humbly beseech the continuance
of so gracious fauor, vntil my state of body wil
permit the accomplishment (by seruice) of my
humble good will and willingnes. And albeit
my time spent hath wrought no condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
whereupon I should presume to make this
humble petition, neither doth there proceed
therof any effect of gratuitie worthie the view
or acceptance of your Maiestie: And though
discretion forbiddeth me to present your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
with the fruit of my time passed, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
by many degrees inferior and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be offered to so learned and prudent a
Princesse: yet dutifull good will, not hauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to manifest it selfe vpon experience of
<pb facs="tcp:14508:5"/>
your Maiesties former graces, comforteth me
of your highnes fauourable acceptance. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might I with modestie presume to present
your Maiestie with so meere a trifle as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Idlenes (for other title or terme I may
not woorthily giue it, though in truth it be the
fruit of my time best spent, in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
more vainly passed) were it so that vpon
returne of my trauell an iourney taken in the
vanities of pleasures I had to report of better
choise of commoditie receiued. And bicause
Time requireth me to render an account, (as
whose Idlenes hath been greater than of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
others) and least my euill example might
withdraw the better disposed from the studie
and exercise of knowledge, I do confesse my
errour therein accordingly as the title of this
Pamphlet giueth testimonie, which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
your Maiesties presence in so simple an

as also becommeth an humble petitioner to

<pb facs="tcp:14508:5"/>
of your Highnes former fauors and
clemencie, without which, neither he nor his
shall be in case to performe such offices as in

I discouer no monster. In shewing
an vnnaturall generation, happily you
will imagine that Idlenes can bring
foorth no good action, and therefore an vnkinde issue, to be called
by the name of Idlenes. But I answere, though your surmise or
imagination may engender such a report in the life of the <hi>L. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques:</hi>
yet (you see) my conception and deliuery sheweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
in that I obserued the former idle time in reading &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
the learned and wise, whose sentences and good saiengs, I so
greatly affected, that I did not onely reade them, but also commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many of them to writing: which being done onely for my owne

requested by diuers my louing friends to make the same more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest

haue neither done well, nor satisfied your expectation, blame them
that prouoked my euulgation, and deceiued your hope, and yet for
mine own part I wil be excused by the title of my booke, which can
warrant no more to you, than it afoorded to my selfe: which is
enough: if it keepe you onely from idlenes, and yet I wil assure you
something more, for you shall heare many wise, learned, and well
experienced men, which I haue painefully requested to giue you
some aduertisement. And if your fantasies be not ouer curious, or
your minds to scornefull, I doubt not but among so many variable
blossoms, you may happily catch one sauoring flower, if not though
it seemeth to be against all reason, that idlenes can beget some
fruitefull trauell, yet you shall see a greater miracle, which is, that

to my no smal contentation and delight, not onely to be instructed,
<pb facs="tcp:14508:6"/>
but also to the end that idlenes might not attach me, whose great
burden of vanities and suggestions, doth not onely surcharge vs
with the manifolde heape of sin, but also with the lamentable losse
of golden time, for (indeed) the want of some exercise bringeth
vs in open question with the world, and in hazard of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either to be barren of knowledge, or slow of wil: for as the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer

might be occasioned to take hold: and to say the truth, as we our
selues esteeme not the knife that is rustie, nor account of the trees
that are fruiteles, so we must thinke that if men would not speake
ill of our idlenes, verie Time it selfe passing by our doores without
entertainemet, would accuse our life of sluggishnes, or condemne
our consciences of contempt, and so we may both staine our name,
blemish our creation, and hazard our happie estate, that when
the iudge of all iudges shall heare the crime laide to our charge,
our consciences shall be assured to feele the gilte: therefore the
great stay of mans life requireth labor, first in searching Gods
word to know him, secondly in bending of our endeuors for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of our countrey, last of all by looking into our selues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the great filth which most horribly lieth stinking in mans
life, which for want of purge doth oftentimes smell of hypocrisie,
vngodlines, vncharitablenes, treason, diuelish inuentions and
wicked practizes, whereof sathan hath great store to plant in the
idell soile. Wherfore (my louing friends) I haue done this for my
selfe and for you, and though I haue not set it foorth with profound
learning, fined phrases, or eloquent termes, which are expected
but of wanton eares, yet I pray you allow of me in mine olde plaine
fashion, in the which if I cannot to your contentation make suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
shewe of mine assured good will, pardon my present weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

               <p>Againe, what was the strongest. He answered; The

of the rude, and causeth the coward to be

               <p>What was the hardest thing to know. He answered;
For a man to know himselfe: for there should be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

               <p>What was the sweetest thing to obtaine. He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;

for feare of death they procure to hasten death. Hauing
thereof due consideration, me seemeth that we ought
not greatly to loue life, nor with desperation to seeke

               <p>Princes and Lords ought to be perfect before they be

he saw quiet men troubled by seditious persons;
the humble subiect to the proud; the iust obedient to
the tyrant; the cruell commanding the mercifull; the
coward ruling the hardie; the ignorant teaching the
wise; and aboue al, I saw the most theeues hang vp the
innocent.</p>
               <p>The other was that in all the places and circuite that
he had bin in, I know not, neither could finde anie man
euerlasting, but that all are mortall; and that both high

               <p>We see the vapors to ascend high; the plants growe
high; the trees budde out on high; the sourges of
the sea mount high; the nature of the fire is alwaies

their stoutnes they may gouerne their own, and by their
riches they may represse their enimies.</p>
               <p>The prince which is too liberall in giuing his owne, is

haue they of great treasures.</p>
               <p>Princes become not poore for spending of their

               <p>High and noble harts that feele themselues woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

               <p>We suffer griefs &amp; know them not; with the hands we

take great fish; and with a little wound dieth a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
I meane that our life is so fraile, and fortune so fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
that in that part where we are best harnessed, we are
soonest wounded and grieued.</p>
               <p>The heauy and sorowfull harts of this world feele no

but more freely to commit vices, and oppresse the poore
at home.</p>
               <p>What profiteth vs to desire much, to procure much,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14508:55"/>
to attaine to much sith our days are so briefe, and our
person so fraile.</p>
               <p>Men are deceiued that thinke that temporall goods
shall remaine with them during life.</p>
               <p>I see no greater mishaps to fall to any, than vnto them
which haue the greatest riches: so that we may boldly
say, that he alone which is shut in the graue, is in safegard
from the inconstancie of fortune.</p>
               <p>The earth is cold and drie;<note place="margin">A descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> the water cold and moist;
the aire hote and moist; the fire hote and dry.</p>
               <p>The wicked world is the euill life of the worldlings,
where the earth is the desire; fire the couetice; water
the inconstancie; aire the folly; the stones are the pride;
the flowers of trees the thoughts; the deep sea the hart.</p>
               <p>The worldlings and their worldly liues, are called the
world: for sinnes they be called the seruants of sinne, &amp;
must be subiects of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Pride, auarice, enuie, blasphemie, pleasures, lecherie,
negligence, gluttonie, ire, malice, vanitie, and folly: this is
the world against which we fight all the days of our life;
and where the good are princes of vices, and vices are
lords of the vicious.</p>
               <p>This world is our cruell enimie:<note place="margin">A descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world.</note> A deceitfull friend
that always keepeth vs in trauell, and taketh from vs our
rest, he robbeth vs of our treasure, and maketh himselfe
to be feared of the good, and is greatly beloued of the
euill. It is that which of the goods of others is prodigal;
of his own very miserable; the inuenter of all vices; and
the scourge of all vertues: it is he which entertaineth all
his in flattery and faire speach; bringeth men to dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
robbeth the renowme of those that be dead; and
sacketh the good name of those that be aliue. This cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
world is he which to all ought to render acccount,
and of whom none dare to aske account.</p>
               <p>He should beare false witnes that would say: that in
this world there is any thing assured, healthfull, &amp; true:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14508:55"/>
as he that would say in heauen there is any thing vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
variable, or false.</p>
               <p>I maruell not though the worldlings at euery mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
be deceiued, since superficiously they behold the world
with their eies, and loue it profoundly with their harts,
(but if they desired as profoundly) to consider it as they
do vainely follow it, they should see very plainly that the
world did not flatter them with prosperitie, but threaten
them with aduersitie; fo that vnder the greatest point of
the Die which is the sise, is hid the least which is the ase.</p>
               <p>The world is of such a condition, that if he let vs rest
our first sleep, that commonly ere the morning, yea som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
within an hower after, he waketh vs with a new
care.</p>
               <p>Suppose that the world doth honor you much,<note place="margin">Deceit of the world.</note> flatter
you much, visite you oft, offer you great treasures, and
giue you much: yet it is not bicause he will giue you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, but that afterwards he might take it all
from you in one day: for it is the custome of the world,
that those men which aboue all men are set before, now
at a turne they are farthest behind.</p>
               <p>O filthie world, that when thou doest receiue vs, thou
doest cast vs off; when thou doest assemble vs, thou doest
separate vs; when thou seemest to reioice vs, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
vs sad; when thou pleasest vs, how quickly thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
displease vs; when thou exaltest vs, how thou hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
vs; and when thou doest chastise vs, how thou doest
reioyce.</p>
               <p>As me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be diuers in gestures,<note place="margin">The world a Cater for all kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> so are they much more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
in their appetites: &amp; sith the world hath experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in many yeeres, it hath appetites prepared for all kind of
people: for the presumptuous he procureth honors; to
the auaricious, he procureth riches; and to those which
are gluttons, he presenteth diuers meats; the carnall he
blindeth with women; the negligent, he feedeth with
rest; and thus he doth baite them as fish, and in the end
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14508:56"/>
will catch them in the nets of all vices.</p>
               <p>If at the first temptations we had resisted the world, it
were impossible that so oftentimes it durst assault vs, for
of our small resistance, commeth his so great boldnes.</p>
               <p>The world hath made vs now so ready to his law,<note place="margin">In seruing the world we are made changelings.</note> that
from one hower to another it changeth the whole estate
of our life: so that to day he maketh vs hath that which
yesterday we loued: he causeth vs to complaine of that
which we commended: he maketh vs to be offended
with that which before we did desire: and to account
those our mortall enimies, which before we accepted as
our speciall friends.</p>
               <p>If he did giue any perfect or certain thing, we were the
rather to serue him: but he giueth them with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they shall render it to him againe, when he
shall demaund it, and not at the discretion of him that
doth possesse it.</p>
               <p>The world hath no good thing to giue vs, but only by
lending or by vsurie: if it be by vsurie, there is no gaine
of money, but rather returne with restitution of vices: if
ye aske whether he hath any vertuous thing in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance,
he will answer that he doth sell such merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
in his shop, and therefore cannot giue that which he
hath not for himself.</p>
               <p>If ye exchange any thing with it, he is so subtile to sel,
and so curious to buy, that that which he taketh shall be
of great measure, and that which he selleth shall want
waight.</p>
               <p>They which are in prosperitie haue no lesse neede of
good counsell, than the vnhappy hath of remedy.</p>
               <p>When euery man thinketh he hath made peace with
fortune, than she hath a new demaund ready forged.</p>
               <p>Man being born in the world; nourished in the world;
liuing in the world; being a child of the world; &amp; folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world; what is man to hope for of the world, but
things of the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:14508:56"/>
Man alone thinketh to eate the flesh without bones;
to giue battell without perill; to trauell without pain, &amp;
saile by the seas without danger: but it is impossible for
mortal men to liue in the world vnlesse they wil become
subiects to the sorowes of the world.</p>
               <p>We are now come to so great folly, that we forget and
will not serue God that created vs, nor abstaine from the
world that persecuteth vs.</p>
               <p>O filthy world how far art thou from iust; and howe
far ought they to be from thee which desire to be iust,
for naturally thou art a friend of nouelties and an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of vertues.</p>
               <p>How much do we put our trust in fortune; how lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do we passe our dais; how much blinded in the world;
yet for all that we giue him so much credit, as though
he had neuer deceiued vs.</p>
               <p>The world is an embassador of the euill, and a scourge
of the good; a nurse to vices; and a tyrant to vertues; a
breaker of peace; a maintainer of war; a table of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;
and a fornace of concupiscence; it is the danger
of <hi>Charybdis</hi> where the harts do perish, and the perill of
<hi>Scylla</hi> where the harts do waste.</p>
               <p>The men that are borne of women are so euill a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and so cruell is the worlde wherein we liue, and
fortune so empoisoned with whom we frequent, that we
cannot escape without being spurned with his feete;
bitten with his teeth; torne with his nailes; or empoiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with his venime.</p>
               <p>If a stranger or neighbor yea our proper brother doe
enuie vs,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we will neuer pardon him though he earnestly
request it, yet cease we not to follow the world, though
he continually persecute vs, thus we see that we drawe
our swords against flies, and will kill the Elephants with
needles.</p>
               <p>Some I see which willingly fall;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and some which would
recouer themselues. I finde that all do complaine but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14508:57"/>
few that will amend.</p>
               <p>Riches, youth, pride, and libertie, are fowre plagues
which poison princes, replenish the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth with
filth, kill the liuing, and defame the dead.</p>
               <p>How vnhappie are they which are in prosperitie, for
iustly they that be set vp in high estate cannot flee from
the peril of <hi>Scilla,</hi> without falling into the danger of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O miserable world, thou art a sepulchre of the dead;
a prison of the liuing; a shop of vices; a hangman of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
an obliuion of antiquitie; an enimie of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
a snare of the rich; a burthen to the poore; a house
of pilgrims; and a den of theeues.</p>
               <p>O world, thou art a slanderer of the good; a rauener
of the wicked; a deceiuer; and an abuser of ail; and to
speak the truth, it is impossible to liue contented, much
lesse to liue in honor, in the which is most to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
either the euil man aduanced without desart, or the
good man ouerthrowen without cause.</p>
               <p>The tokens of a valiant captaine are wounds of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons:
and the signe of a studious person is the despising
of the world.</p>
               <p>Not those that haue most knowledge,<note place="margin">Riches ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> but those that
haue most riches in the common welth do command,
I doubt whether the diuine power hath depriued them,
or that the wordly malice hath lost the taste of them.</p>
               <p>O world, world, I know not how to escape thy hands,
not howe the simple men and idiot defendeth himselfe
out of thy snares, when the sage and wise men withall
their wisedome can scarsely set their foote sure on earth,
for al that the wise men know, is little enough to defend
them from the wicked.</p>
               <p>He onely passeth without trauell the dangers of life,
which banisheth from him the thought of the temporal
goods of this world.</p>
               <p>The traiterous world in no one thing beguileth the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14508:57"/>
worldly so much as by feeding them with vain hope, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng,
that they shall haue time enough to be vertuous.</p>
               <p>The more the world encreaseth in yeeres,<note place="margin">The elder the world is, the worse are the people.</note> so much the
more it is loden with vices.</p>
               <p>The world hath alwaies bin in contention, and rest
hath alwaies bin banished: for if some sigh for peace, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be as desirous of wars.</p>
               <p>O world for that thou art the world, so small is our
force, and so great is our debilitie, that thou willing it,
&amp; we not resisting it, thou dost swallow vs vp in the most
perilous gulfe, and in the thornes most sharpe, thou
dost pricke vs, by the priuie waies thou dost leade vs, and
by the most stonie waies thou cariest vs, thou bringest vs
to the highest fauorers, to the ende that afterward with
a push of thy pike thou mightest ouerthrow vs.</p>
               <p>What,<note place="margin">Burden.</note> I thinke I haue somewhat in the world, I finde
that all that I haue is but a burthen.</p>
               <p>I haue prooued all the vices of the world for no other

the more I sleepe the more drowsie I am; the more
I haue, the more I couet; the more I desire the more I
am tormented; the more I procure the lesse I obtaine;
finally, I neuer had so great paine through want, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
