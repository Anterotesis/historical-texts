         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ever had of kiſſing your Lordſhips Hands,
amongſt the happy Encounters of my Life,
and take this occaſion, ſo many Years after,
to tell you ſo, your Lordſhip will not, I hope,
think your ſelf injur'd by ſuch a Declaration
from a Man that honours You; nor condemn
my Ambition, when I publiſh to the World,
that I am not altogether unknown to You.
Your Lordſhip, peradventure, may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a Converſation ſo little worthy your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:
but the memory of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's

cannot, I would not flatter you, I do not
think your Lordſhip capable of being flatter'd,
neither am I inclin'd to do it to thoſe that

PREFACE TO THE

            <p>MY Deſign in attempting this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was to preſent my Country with
a true Copy of a very brave Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
How far I have ſucceeded in that
Deſign is left to every one to judge; and I
expect to be the more gently cenſured, for
having my ſelf ſo modeſt an Opinion of my own
Performance, as to confeſs that the Author has
ſuffered by me, as well as the former Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
though I hope, and dare affirm, that the
miſinter pretations I ſhall be found guilty of,
are neither ſo numerous, nor ſo groſs. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcern my own Errours, it were unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
in me if I could, and did not mend
them; but I can ſee his (except when we are
both miſtaken) and thoſe I have corrected;
but am not ſo ill natur'd as to ſhew where.
In truth, both Mr. <hi>Florio,</hi> and I are to be
excuſed, where we miſs of the ſence of the
<pb facs="tcp:100899:8"/>
Author, whoſe Language is ſuch in many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as Grammar cannot reconcile, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it the hardeſt Book to make a juſtifiable
verſion of that I yet ever ſaw in that, or any
other Language I underſtand: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſomuch, that
though I do think, and am pretty confident, I
underſtand French as well as many Men,
I have yet ſometimes been forc'd to grope at
his meaning. Peradventure the greateſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
would in ſome Places have found my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
abſtruſe enough. Yet are not theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
I ſpeak of either ſo many, or of ſo great
importance, as to caſt any ſcandalous blemiſh
upon the Book, but ſuch as few Readers can
diſcover, and they that do, will I hope eaſily
excuſe.</p>
            <p>The Errors of the Preſs, I muſt in part take
upon my ſelf, living at ſo remote a diſtance

            <p>THE Race of <hi>Michael Seigneur de Montaigne,</hi>

any great luſtre till his time: As to Eſtate,
he was ſeiz'd of above two thouſand Crowns of
yearly Revenue. He was born to his Father the
third in order of Birth of his Children, and by
him delivered to Goſſips of the meaneſt Condition
to be baptized, with a Deſign rather to oblige, and
link him to thoſe who were likely to ſtand in need
of him, than to ſuch as he might ſtand in need of:
He moreover ſent him from his Cradle to be
brought up in a poor Village of his, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
him all the while he was at Nurſe, and
longer, forming him to the loweſt, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
manner of Living: Wherein he certainly ſo
well inur'd himſelf to Frugality and Auſterity, that
they had much ado, during all the time of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
eſpecially, to correct the refuſals he made of
things that Children of his age are commonly
greedy of; as Sugars, Sweet-meats, Marchpanes,
and the like.</p>
            <p>No doubt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues are a
<pb facs="tcp:100899:9"/>
very Fair, and a very great Advance; but, as he
himſelf obſerves, they are now adays too dear
bought. His Father having made all diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
that poſſibly could be amongſt the Learned
Men for an exquiſite method of Education, was
caution'd of the inconvenience then in Uſe, and
told, that the tedious time that is employ'd in the
Languages of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which
coſt them nothing, is the only reaſon, that we
cannot arrive to that grandeur of Soul, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Knowledge that was in them. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that he found out for this was, that whilſt
he was at Nurſe, and before he began to Speak,
he delivered him to the Care of a <hi>German,</hi> who
ſince died a famous Phyſician in <hi>France,</hi> totally
ignorant of our Language, and very well vers'd
in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. This Man, that he had
brought out of his own Country, and entertain'd
with a very great Salary for this purpoſe, had the
Child continually in his Arms, to whom there
were added two others more moderately Learned,
to attend him, and to Relieve the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, which three
entertain'd him with no other Language but <hi>Latin.</hi>
As to the reſt of the Family, it was an inviolable
Rule, that neither his Father, nor ſo much as his
Mother, Man or Maid, ſpoke any Word in his
hearing, but ſuch as every one had learn'd only to
prattle with him. And 'tis not to be believ'd how
all of them profitted by this Method; his Father
and Mother learn'd by this means <hi>Latin</hi> enough to
underſtand, and to ſerve themſelves withal at need,
as alſo thoſe Servants did, who were moſt about
his Perſon. To be ſhort, they did Latin it at ſuch
a Rate, that it overflowed to the Neighbouring
<pb facs="tcp:100899:9"/>
Villages, where, by Uſe, ſeveral Latin Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Artizans and their Tools, have got footing,
and there remain to this day. For his part, he
was above ſix years old before he underſtood any
more of <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Perigordin,</hi> than of <hi>Arabick,</hi> and
without Art, Books, Grammar, or Precepts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Whipping, and without Tears, he had learn'd
to ſpeak as pure <hi>Latin</hi> as his Maſter, for he could
neither alter it nor mix it. If, for Example, they
gave him a Theme, after the College Mode they
gave it to others in <hi>French,</hi> but they were fain to
give it him in ill <hi>Latin</hi> to put it into good: And
<hi>Nicholas Gronchi,</hi> who has writ a Book <hi>de Commitiis
Romanorum, Guiliaume Guerente,</hi> who has writ a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
upon <hi>Ariſtotle, George Buchanan,</hi> that great
<hi>Scotch</hi> Poet, and <hi>Mark Anthony de Mureta,</hi> whom
both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> acknowledge for the beſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of his Time, his Domeſtick Tutors, have oft
ſince told him, that he had that Language in his
Childhood ſo ready, and at hand, they were afraid
to accoſt him.</p>
            <p>As to the Greek, his Father deſign'd to have it
taught him by Art, but by a new Method, and
that by way of Sport and Recreation, they toſt
their Declenſions to and fro, after the manner of
thoſe, who by certain Tricks upon the Cheſs board,
learn <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and <hi>Geometry:</hi> ſo, amongſt other
things, he had been advis'd to make him reliſh
Learning and Duty, by an unforc'd Will, and his
own Device, and to Educate his Soul with all
Sweetneſs and Liberty, without Auſterity or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.
Which he alſo did to ſuch a degree of
Superſtition, that ſeeing ſome are of Opinion, that
it troubles the Brains of Children to be ſuddenly
<pb facs="tcp:100899:10"/>
rous'd in a Morning, and to be ſnatch'd away
from ſleep, wherein they are much deeper plung'd
than men, with haſte and violence; he always
cauſed him to be waked by the ſound of ſome
Muſical Inſtrument, and was never unprovided of a
Muſician for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But as they who are impatient to be cur'd, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to all ſorts of Remedies, and every ones Advice;
the good Man, being extreamly timorous of failing
in a thing he had ſo much ſet his Heart upon,
ſuffered himſelf at laſt to be carried away by the
common Opinion, which like Cranes always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that which went before, and ſubmitted to
Cuſtom, having now no more thoſe Perſons about
him, who had given him the firſt Inſtructions, that
he had brought out of <hi>Italy.</hi> And about the ſixth
Year of his Age ſent him to the College of <hi>Guyenne,</hi>
at that time very flouriſhing, and the beſt in <hi>France.</hi>
And there it was not poſſible to add any thing to
the Care he had in chooſing for him the beſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Tutors,
and in all other Circumſtances of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
wherein he reſerv'd ſeveral particular
Forms, contrary to the College Uſance; but ſo
it was, that it was a College ſtill, and this unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
method of Education, was here of no greater
advantage to him, than at his firſt coming to preferr
him to one of the higher Claſſes, for at thirteen
Years of Age, he had run thorough his whole
Courſe.</p>
            <p>At the Age of three and thirty he married a
Wife, though, might he have been left free to his
own Choice, he would have avoided marrying,
even <hi>Wiſdom</hi> her ſelf, had ſhe been willing. But
'tis to much purpoſe, ſays he, to reſiſt Cuſtom,
<pb facs="tcp:100899:10"/>
and the common Uſance of Life will have it ſo.
Nevertheleſs, this Marriage of his was not Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
he was put upon it, and led to it by odd Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.
And as great a Libertine as he confeſſes
himſelf to be, he more ſtrictly obſerv'd his Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Vow, than he expected from, or had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to himſelf.</p>
            <p>His Father left him <hi>Montaigne</hi> in Partage as the
eldeſt of his Sons, Propheſying that he would Ruine
it, conſidering his Humour; ſo little diſpos'd to live
at home: But he was deceiv'd for he liv'd upon it
as he entred into it, excepting, that it was ſomething
better, and yet without Office, or any other Foreign
helps. As to the reſt, if Fortune never did him any
violent or extraordinary Offence, ſo ſhe never ſhewed
him any ſignal Favour: Whatever he had in his
Houſe that proceeded from her Liberality, was there
before he came to it, and above a hundred Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Time: He never in his own particular had
any ſolid and eſſential Advantages, for which he ſtood
indebted to her Bounty. She ſhew'd him Airy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary,
and Titular Favours, without Subſtance;
She procur'd for him the Collar of the Order of St.
<hi>Michael,</hi> which, when young, he covered above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, it being at that time the utmoſt mark
of Honour of the <hi>French</hi> Nobleſs, and very Rare.
But of all her Favours, there was none with which
he was ſo well pleas'd, as an Authentick Bull of a
<hi>Roman</hi> Burgeſs, that was granted to him with great
civility and bounty, in a Journey he made to <hi>Rome,</hi>
which is tranſcrib'd in Form in the ſixth Chapter of
the third Book of his Eſſays.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meſſieurs de Bourdeax,</hi> elected him Mayor of
their City, being then out of the Kingdom, and at
<pb facs="tcp:100899:11"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet more Remote from any ſuch Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which made him excuſe himſelf; but that would
not ſerve his turn, and moreover the King interpos'd
his Command. 'Tis an Office that ought to be look'd
upon with the greateſt Eſteem, as it has no other
Perquiſits and Benefits belonging to it, than the
meer honour of its Execution. It laſts but two years,
but may, by a ſecond Election, be continued longer,
though that rarely happens. It was to him, and had
been ſo twice before, once ſome years ſince to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
de Lauſac,</hi> and more lately to <hi>Monſieur de Byron,
Mareſchal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in whoſe place he ſucceeded, and
leſt his to <hi>Monſieur de Matiguon,</hi> alſo <hi>Mareſchal</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> proud of ſo noble a Fraternity. His Father,
a Man of great Honour and Equity, had formerly
alſo had the ſame Dignity. All the Children his
Wife brought died at Nurſe ſaving <hi>Leonor</hi> an only
Daughter whom he diſpos'd in marriage ſome two
Years before his Death.</p>
            <p>The firſt printing of his Eſſaies was in the Year
1580, at which time the publick Applauſe gave
him, as he ſays, a little more aſſurance than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
He has ſince added, but corrected nothing:
His Book having been always the ſame, ſaving that
upon every new Impreſſion, he took the Privilege
to add ſomething, that the Buyer might not go away
with his Hands quite empty. His Perſon was ſtrong,
and well knit; his Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not fat, but full, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
betwixt Jovial and Melancholick, moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sanguine and hot; his Conſtitution healthful and
ſpritely, rarely troubled with Diſeaſes, till he grew
into Years, that he begun to be afflicted with the
Cholick and Stone. As to the reſt, very obſtinate
in his hatred, and contempt of Phyſicians Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb facs="tcp:100899:11"/>
an hereditary Antipathy; his Father having
liv'd threeſcore and fourteen Years, his Grand-father
threeſcore and nine; and his great Grandfather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
fourſcore Years, without having ever taſted
any ſort of Medicine.</p>
            <p>He died in the Year 1592<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
a very conſtant, and Philoſophical Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aged fifty nine Years, ſix Months, and eleven
Days; and was buried at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Church
of a Commendary of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> now given to the
Religious <hi>Feuillantines:</hi> where his Wife <hi>Francoiſe de
la Caſſaigne,</hi> and his Daughter, have erected for him
an honourable Monument, having, like his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
paſt over his Life and Death in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion.</p>

            <head>A
VINDICATION
OF
Montagne's Eſſays.</head>
            <p>THe Eſſays of <hi>Michel de Montagne</hi> are
juſtly ranked amongſt Miſcellaneous
Books: for they are on various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
without order and connexion; and the
very body of the diſcourſes has ſtill a greater
variety. This ſort of confuſion does not
however hinder people of all qualities to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
theſe Eſſays above all the Books that ever
they read, and they make them their chief
ſtudy. They think that other Miſcellanies of
ancient and modern Books are nothing but
an unneceſſary heap of quotations, whereas
we find in this authorities to the purpoſe,
intermixed with the Authors own thoughts;
which being bold and extraordinary, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effectual to cure men of their Weakneſs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100899:14"/>
and Vanity, and induce them to ſeek Virtue
and Felicity by lawful means. But becauſe
every body is not of this opinion, we muſt
take notice here of what is ſaid againſt, and
in favour of theſe Eſſays, to know what we
ſhould believe of 'em; and this is the
more neceſſary, becauſe one meets with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
opportunities to talk of this Author,
his Book being almoſt in the hands of all
people.</p>
            <p>The enemies of <hi>Montagne</hi> tell us, that his
Book is ſo far from inſpiring his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
with the love of Virtue, that on the
contrary, ſome of his diſcourſes being ſtuff'd
with free and licentious words, they teach
them ſome Vices of which they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or elſe are the occaſion that they take a
pleaſure in ſpeaking thereof, and at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to fall into the ſame. That his
Diſcourſes upon ſeveral effects of Nature are
rather fit to divert their thoughts from true
Religion, than to convince them of the truth
of it, and are altogether unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Philoſopher. That notwithſtanding his
Propoſitions and Aſſertions are for the moſt
part weak and falſe, yet they are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
for ſeveral perſons, who either want
Learning, or have too great a byaſs for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm.
That beſides an indifferent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of practical Morals and Hiſtory, which
<hi>Montagne</hi> had acquir'd in reading <hi>Seneca</hi> and
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> having converſed with few other
Books, as he owns himſelf, he had hardly a
tincture of other Sciences and Arts, even not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100899:14"/>
of the Theory of Moral Philoſophy. That
he was as ignorant in other Parts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
as Phyſick, Metaphyſick and Logick;
which does ſufficiently appear by his wrong
inferences on ſeveral things. That he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
very little what we call Humanity, or
<hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> as one may ſee by his unpolite
ſtile, and the confuſion of his diſcourſes,
which ſhew him a very ill Grammarian, and
a bad Rhetorician; and as he talks as poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and boldly as the moſt learned men,
<hi>Scaliger</hi> was uſed to ſtile him <hi>a bold Ignorant.</hi>
Theſe angry Gentlemen do likewiſe pretend,
that what is moſt admir'd in <hi>Montagne</hi> is ſtole
from ſome ancient Authors, and that if thoſe
quotations and the little ſtories he tells us
about his Temper and Inclinations were taken
out of his Book, the reſt would be very little
or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the moſt material
objections made againſt <hi>Montagne;</hi> not to
mention here ſeveral Authors, who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
written againſt his opinions, as Mr <hi>de
Silhon</hi> in his Book of the Immortality of the
Soul, wherein he confutes what <hi>Montagne</hi> has
alledg'd to prove that Brutes are capable of
thinking. <hi>Chanet</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of the operations
of the Underſtanding,</hi> quotes <hi>Montagne</hi>'s Eſſays,
as a work wherein Judgment had no ſhare,
Becauſe, ſays he, every judicious man loves
order, and there is nothing but confuſion in
that whole Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100899:15"/>
Having thus impartially related what is
urged againſt <hi>Montagne,</hi> we proceed now to
mention what is ſaid in his vindication. And
we might here, in the firſt place, make uſe of
the long Preface Mademoiſelle <hi>de Gournay</hi> has
prefixed to the <hi>French</hi> Folio Edition of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays,
1652, wherein ſhe does not only give
a full anſwer to all the objections made, or
that can be made againſt <hi>Montagne,</hi> but alſo
talks of him as of a man whoſe works have
revived Truth in his Age, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe calls <hi>the quinteſſence of Philoſophy, the
Hellebore of Mans Folly, the Setter at Liberty of
Underſtanding, and the Iudicial Throne of Reaſon.</hi>
But we do not think fit to inſiſt upon her
Evidence, for notwithſtanding the ſolid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
her opinion is grounded upon, ſhe
may be ſuſpected to be blindfolded with the
paſſionate Love ſhe had for her excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and beſides, we have ſo many great
men to produce in favour of <hi>Montagne,</hi> that
we may without any prejudice to his Cauſe,
wave the evidence of Mademoiſelle <hi>de Gournay.</hi>
Theſe will tell you, that if he has handled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matters with an uncommon freedom, this
is an effect of his generous Temper, which
was free from any baſe or ſervile compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and as to his Love for Virtue, and his
Religion, they appeal to his very Book itſelf,
whereby that truth will appear, if the paſſages
alledged to prove the contrary are examined
without partiality, and not by themſelves,
but according to the connexion they have
with what precedes or follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100899:15"/>
               <hi>Stephen Paſquier,</hi> that ſincere Writer, deals
more fairly with <hi>Montagne</hi> than <hi>Silhon, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac,</hi>
or any other of his oppoſers, for he does
not conceal his faults, nor paſs by what may
be ſaid to attenuate or excuſe them. <q>
                  <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi>
ſays he in one of his Letters, has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chapters, whereof the Body is no
ways anſwerable to the Head, witneſs theſe
following, <hi>The Hiſtory of Spurina;</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of Children to their Parents, of
the Verſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi> of Coaches, of Lame
people, of Vanity, and Phyſiognomy. Theſe
are incoherent things, wherein the Author
runs from one ſubject to another, without
any order or connexion. But after all, we
muſt take of <hi>Montagne</hi> what is good, and
not look upon his Titles, but into his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
for poſſibly he deſigned to <hi>laugh</hi> at
himſelf, others, and humane capacity, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus the Rules and ſervile Laws of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall add on this point, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſeveral of his diſcourſes do contain
quite different things from what is promiſed
in the Titles, as <hi>Paſquier</hi> has obſerved it, yet
it does not always happen ſo; and when he
has done it, methinks it is rather through
affectation than inadvertency, to ſhew that
he did not intend to make a regular Work.
This does likewiſe appear, by the odd, or
rather fantaſtical connexion of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
wherein from one matter he makes
long digreſſions upon ſeveral others. No
doubt but he thought that one might take the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100899:16"/>
ſame Liberty in his Meditations, as is aſſumed
in common Converſations, in which, tho
there be but two or three Interlocutors, 'tis
obſerved that there is ſuch a variety in their
diſcourſes, that if they were ſet down in
writing, it would appear that by digreſſions
they are run away from their firſt ſubject,
and that the laſt part of their converſation is
very little anſwerable to the firſt. This I
verily believe was his true intention, that he
might preſent the World with a free and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Work; for <hi>Chanct</hi> nor any other of his
Adverſaries will not be able to convince the
World, that this proceeded from want of
Judgment in a man of ſuch parts as they are
oblig'd to own in <hi>Montagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deſigned alſo ſometimes to conceal his
deſign in his Titles; as for inſtance, in his
third Book, when having ſpent almoſt a
whole Chapter againſt Phyſicians, it is moſt
likely that his intention was to conceal it by
intitling the ſame, <hi>of the Reſemblance of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to their Parents.</hi> For this gives him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to tell us that he was afflicted with
the Gravel as his Father was, and to diſcourſe
of the Cure of ſeveral diſtempers, and at the
ſame time of the uncertainty of Phyſick, or
rather of the ignorance of Phyſicians;
from whence I conclude, that in this whole
Chapter, and ſeveral others, there is rather a
reſin'd Art, than Ignorance. It has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
objected againſt him, that he was ſo much
in love with himſelf, that he talks of no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe in his Writings, as if he intended to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100899:16"/>
propoſe himſelf as a neceſſary Pattern to the
reſt of Mankind, tho what he ſays of himſelf
is for the moſt part odd and fantaſtical. To
this I anſwer, that any man may be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to others, either for doing Good, or
eſchewing evil; and that <hi>Montagne</hi> does not
pretend that what he ſays of himſelf ſhould
be taken for any other thing than really it
is, having a ſufficient knowledge of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailties, and of his own in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſomewhat ſurprizing that <hi>Montagne</hi>
ſhould be blamed for quoting ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
when this quotations are made <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi>
that is, for confirming or illuſtrating
what he ſays, ſeeing <hi>Plutarch</hi> and ſeveral
other excellent Authors have taken the ſame
liberty; and if it be objected, that the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in <hi>Plutarch</hi> are taken from <hi>Greek</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and conſequently are in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as his, whereas <hi>Montagne</hi> has ſtuff'd
his <hi>French</hi> Book with <hi>Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>
Verſes; I anſwer that this is trifling, for if
<hi>Montagne</hi> found nothing in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
worthy of being cited, or elſe if he
thought that Ancient or Foreign Writers had
better treated the matter he ſpeaks of, Pray by
what Law, is he forbidden to make uſe of
their Authority? I own, that in ſome places,
he has tranſlated ſome paſſages of Ancient
Authors into <hi>French,</hi> and has ſo dexterouſly
incorporated them into his Work, that he has
in ſome manner made them his own, but where
is the great Crime in this, eſpecially ſeeing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100899:17"/>
he has a World of thoughts of his own, which
are more ſublime and excellent, than what
he has alledged from others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balſac,</hi> in his <hi>XIX Entretien,</hi> reflects upon
his Language, tho at the ſame time he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
it. <q>He lived, ſays he, in the Reign of
the Family of <hi>Valois,</hi> and was a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> by Birth,
and therefore it is impoſſible, but his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
muſt have ſomething of the Vice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to his Age and Country. However,
we muſt own, that his Soul was eloquent, and
that he expreſſed his thoughts in bold maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
expreſſions, and that his Stile has ſome
Beauties, above what we could have expected
from his Age. I'll ſay no more on this' Head,
and I know that it would be a ſort of miracle,
that a Perſon could politely ſpeak <hi>French</hi> in
the Barbary of <hi>Quercy</hi> and <hi>Perigord.</hi> Should
a Man, beſet with bad examples, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of good ones, have courage and ſtrength
enough to defend himſelf alone againſt a
whole Nation? againſt his own Wife, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends, who are as many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the purity of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue?
The Court was likewiſe as corrupted as the
Country, ſo that it was then lawful to fail,
there being then no ſettled rules for our
language; and thoſe faults, which are more
ancient than the Laws themſelves, are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Innocent.</q>
               <q> I conclude, ſays he in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, that I have a great veneration for
him, and that in my opinion he is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to thoſe Ancients whom we call <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos
Ingenio, Arte rudes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100899:17"/>
What <hi>Balzac</hi> ſays in relation to the Court
of <hi>France</hi> in the days of <hi>Montagne</hi> is true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and very much to the purpoſe; but
obſerve here the vanity and malice of that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percritick,
who muſt reflect upon <hi>Montagne</hi>'s
Country, as if it were impoſſible that any body
born in <hi>Perigord</hi> or <hi>Quercy</hi> ſhould write <hi>French</hi>
as politely as he who was not born within a
days journey from <hi>Montagne.</hi> I know <hi>Balzac</hi>
has written more politely than <hi>Montagne,</hi>
and that the <hi>French</hi> Tongue is much indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, but he whoſe excellency was
chiefly in the connexion of words, muſt not
for all that pretend to ſet up for a Judge of
the thoughts of <hi>Montagne,</hi> as he has raſhly
ventur'd upon in his 18th and 19th <hi>Entretien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>Montagne</hi> has ſome provincial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
but they are few in number; and
it is to be obſerved, that ſeveral words of his
which were at firſt excepted againſt, have
been ſince adopted by the beſt Writers, this
being the priviledge of great Authors to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
new words. The <hi>French</hi> word <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joue
(Merry)</hi> has not been always in uſe, tho
it is now in the mouth of all the Learned and
Polite people, and <hi>Montagne</hi> was the firſt
Author that I know of who made uſe of it;
and ſo they are obliged to him for this word,
which does not only ſignifie a merry man,
but likewiſe expreſſes the very effects of mirth
in his face, and chiefly upon his cheek,
(<hi>joues</hi>).</p>
            <p>Thoſe who tell us that <hi>Scaliger</hi> was uſed to
call him a bold <hi>Ignorant,</hi> do certainly a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100899:18"/>
Injury to <hi>Scaliger</hi> than to <hi>Montagne,</hi> for
the reputation of that great man will never ſo
far byaſs mankind as to make them believe
that the Author of a Book wherein there is
ſo much Learning ſhould be an Ignorant
Fellow. <hi>Scaliger</hi> was a better Judge, and as
this is not to be found in any one of his Works,
I think one may venture to ſay, that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
was contrived by ſome of his Envious
Enemies, who having not ſtrength enough to
encounter him, made uſe of this artifice, to
run down his merit with that great name.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Plaſſac,</hi> a great admirer of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi>
corrected his Chapter of the Vanity of
Words into Modern <hi>French,</hi> but as he owns
it himſelf, it was no more <hi>Montagne</hi>'s, whoſe
ſimiles and proverbial expreſſions, have a
greater ſtrenght, than the nice Politeneſs
of the Modern <hi>French</hi> Language, and beſides
<hi>Montagne</hi>'s diſcourſe is every where full of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and ſolid Reaſon, which do not always
admit that ſmooth but empty way of writing,
ſo much in vogue in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not however deſign to defend <hi>Montagne</hi>
in every thing; far from it, I blame his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in ſeveral places, and I cannot abide, that
after having diſcourſed of the exemplary Life
of a Holy Man, he ſhould immediately talk
as he does of Cuckoldom and Privy Parts, and
other things of this nature, which tho perhaps
tolerable in another place, cannot be ſuffered
in this; and I wiſh he had left out theſe things,
that Ladies might not be put to the bluſh, when
his Eſſays are found in their Libraries, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100899:18"/>
that they might improve themſelves by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this excellent Book, without putting
their modeſty to any torment, as they muſt
needs do, when they come to theſe places.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt, there is hardly any humane
Book extant, ſo fit as this to teach Men what
they are, and lead them inſenſibly to a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
obſervation of the moſt ſecret Springs
of their Actions; and therefore it ought to be
the <hi>manuale</hi> of all Gentlemen, his uncommon
way of teaching, winning People to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Virtue, as much as other Books fright
them away from it, by the dogmatical and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
way which they aſſume.</p>
            <p>Thus we have anſwered all the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
made againſt <hi>Montagne;</hi> for I think
the other trifles, which are objected againſt
him, do not deſerve to be taken notice of, and
I wonder that the Author of the <hi>Search after
Truth</hi> ſhould ſpend his time upon them in a
manner ſo unbecoming his Character. He
tells us, after <hi>Balzac</hi> and ſome others, that
<hi>Montagne</hi>'s Vanity and Pride, are not ſutable
to an Author and Philoſopher, that it was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and uſeleſs to keep a Page, having
hardly 6000 Livres a year, and more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſtill to have ſo often mentioned it in his
Writings: but I may anſwer, that it was very
common in his time, for Gentlemen of noble
extraction to keep a Page, to ſhew their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
tho their Eſtate could hardly afford
them to keep a Footman, and that the 6000
Livres a year, were then more than 20000
now adays. It was likewiſe very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100899:19"/>
the gravity of our famous <hi>Searcher af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Truth,</hi> to rail at <hi>Montagne</hi> becauſe he does
not mention in his Eſſays, that he kept a
Clerk, when he was Councellor in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for <hi>Montagne</hi> having exerciſed
that noble employment but for a ſhort time,
in his youth he had no occaſion to mention it,
and who ſhall believe, that he has concealed
it out of Vanity, he who, in the opinion
of <hi>Malbranche</hi> himſelf, talks of his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and vices, with too great a freedom?
It is likewiſe very ungenerous and ungentleman
like to take no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice, that he did not very
well ſucceed in his Mayoralty of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi>
The times he lived in were very troubleſome,
and ſuppoſing he committed ſome Error,
which they ſay without any Proof, what is
that to the merit of his Book? <hi>Balzac</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a Gentleman, ſpeaking thus to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of <hi>Montagne.</hi> 
               <q>You may praiſe your
Author if you will more than our <hi>Cicero,</hi> but
I cannot fancy that a man, who governed
all the World, was not at leaſt equal to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who did not know how to govern
<hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </q> This may very well paſs for a
jeſt; but is it a rational way for confuting
an Author, to have recourſe unto perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
or ſome incidents relating to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſon or Quality, This is ſo mean,
that I cannot fancy <hi>Balzac</hi> could be guilty of
it, and I wholly impute it to thoſe, who have
publiſhed after his Death, ſome looſe diſcourſes
on ſeveral Subjects, which they have intitled
his <hi>Entretiens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100899:19"/>
Notwithſtanding theſe objections, <hi>Montagne</hi>
always had, and is like to have Admirers,
as long as Senſe and Reaſon have any credit
in the World. <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> calls him the <hi>French
Thales,</hi> and <hi>Mezeray</hi> the Chriſtian <hi>Seneca,</hi> and
the incomparable <hi>Thuanus</hi> has made an Eulogy
of him, which being very ſhort, I ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it here.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michel de Montagne</hi> Chevalier, was born
in <hi>Perigord,</hi> in a Caſtle, which had the name
of his Family. He was made Councellor in
the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> with <hi>Stephen de
la Boetie,</hi> with whom he contracted ſo great
a Friendſhip, that that dear Friend was even
after his Death the object of his reſpect and
veneration. <hi>Montagne</hi> was extraordinary
<hi>Free and Sincere,</hi> as Poſterity will ſee by his
<hi>Eſſays,</hi> for ſo he has intitled that Immortal
Monument of his Genius.</p>
               <p>While he was at <hi>Venice,</hi> he was elected
Mayor of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which place was only
beſtowed upon perſons of the firſt quality,
and even the Governors of the Province
thought it was an honor for them. The
Mareſchal <hi>de Matignon,</hi> who commanded the
Kings Forces in that Province, during the
troubles of the State, had ſuch an eſteem
for him, that he communicated unto him
the moſt important affairs, and admitted
him into his Council. As I had a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with him while I was in his
Country, and ſince at Court, the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of our Studies and Inclinations uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us moſt intimately. He dyed at <hi>Montagne</hi>
in the 60th year of his Age.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100899:20"/>
This teſtimony of <hi>Thuanus</hi> is ſufficient to
juſtify the memory of our Author, for no
body will believe that a man of that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
would have been ſo great a Friend,
with ſo vicious a man as <hi>Malbranche</hi> has
repreſented <hi>Montagne.</hi> I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this diſcourſe with a very remarkable
circumſtance mentioned by <hi>Thuanus</hi> in his
own Life, lib. 3. which ſhew that <hi>Montagne</hi>
was beloved by the greateſt Princes in his
time and honored with their confidence. While
the States of the Kingdom, ſays he, were
ſitting at <hi>Blois, Montagne</hi> and I were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the diviſion between the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whereupon he
told me, that he knew the moſt ſecret
thoughts of thoſe Princes, as having been
employed to compoſe their differences, and
that he was perſwaded, that neither of 'em
was of the Religion he profeſſed. That
the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> would have willingly
embrac'd the Religion of his Predeceſſors,
if he had not feared that his Party had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him, and that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>
would have declared himſelf for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> which the Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> his Unkle had inſpired him with, if he
could have done it, without any prejudice to
his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>I thought this circumſtance was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of being placed here; but I muſt beg
the Readers pardon for having been ſo long,
which muſt be attributed to the reſpect I
have for the Memory of that excellent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100899:20"/>
I deſigned to ſhew the reaſon why
<hi>Montagne</hi> meets with a more favourable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
in <hi>England</hi> than in his Native
Country, but having been already too long,
I ſhall content my ſelf to obſerve that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
who talks freely of every thing, is not
ſuitable to the temper of a ſervile Nation, who
has loſt all ſence of Liberty.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>La Bruyere</hi> in his celebrated Book
of the Characters or Manners of the Age,
gives another reaſon why ſome people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>Montagne.</hi> 
               <q>Two Writers,</q> ſays he,
(meaning <hi>La Mothe Le Vayer</hi> and <hi>Malbranche</hi>)
<q>have condemned <hi>Montagne:</hi> I know that
Author may be juſtly blamed in ſome
things, but neither of 'em will allow him
to have any thing valuable. One of 'em
thinks too little to taſte ſuch an Author,
who thinks a great deal; and the other
thinks too ſubtilely to be pleaſed with what

with ſuch as have not read of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100899:22"/>
prodigious Force and Valour of that invincible
Prince. The Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beſieg'd <hi>Guelpho</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> would
not be prevail'd upon, what mean and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Satisfactions ſoever had been tender'd to
him, to condeſcend to milder Conditions, than
that the <hi>Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> only who
were in the Town might go out without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of their Honour, on Foot and with ſo
much only as they could carry about them.
Which was no ſooner known, but that out of
Magnanimity of Heart,<note place="margin">Conjugal Love.</note> and an Exceſs of good
Nature, they preſently contriv'd to carry out,
upon their Shoulders, their Husbands and
Children, and even the Duke himſelf; a Sight
at which the Emperour was ſo pleaſed, that
raviſh'd with the Generoſity of the Action, he
wept for Joy, and immediately extinguiſhing
in his Heart the mortal and implacable Hatred
he had conceiv'd againſt this Duke, he from that

Humanity and Affection. The one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               </note> who will
that we ſuccour the Afflicted, but not that we
ſhould be ſo affected with their Sufferings as to
ſuffer with them. I conceiv'd theſe Examples
not ill ſuited to the Queſtion in hand, and the
rather, becauſe therein we obſerve theſe great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100899:23"/>
Souls, aſſaulted and tryed by theſe two ſeveral
ways to reſiſt the one without relenting, and
to be ſhook and ſubjected by the other. It is
true, that to ſuffer a Man's Heart to be totally
ſubdued by Compaſſion, may be imputed Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Effeminacy, and Over-tenderneſs; whence
it comes to paſs, that the weakeſt Natures, as
of Women, Children, and the Common ſort of
People, are the moſt ſubject to it: but after
having reſiſted, and diſdain'd the Power of
Sighs and Tears, to ſurrender a Man's Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to the ſole Reverence of the Sacred Image
of Vertue, this can be no other than the Effect
of a ſtrong and inflexible Soul, enamour'd of,
and raviſh'd with a Maſculine and obſtinate Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Nevertheleſs, Aſtoniſhment and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may in leſs generous Minds beget a like
Effect. Witneſs the People of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who
having put two of their Generals upon Tryal
for their Lives, for having continued in Arms
beyond the preciſe Term of their Commiſſion,
very hardly pardon'd <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> who bowing
under the weight of ſo dangerous an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had made no manner of Defence for
himſelf, nor producd other Arguments than
Prayers and Supplications to ſecure his Head;
whereas, on the contrary, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being
brought to the Bar, and falling to magnifie the
Exploits he had perform'd in their Service,
and after a haughty and arrogant manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
them with Ingratitude and Injuſtice,
they had not the Heart to proceed any further
in his Tryal, but broke up the Court and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,

the Courage and Confidence of this Man.
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder,<note place="margin">The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> the Tyrant.</note> after having by a tedious
Siege, and through exceeding great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
taken the City of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and in it the
Governour <hi>Phyton,</hi> a very gallant Man, who
had made ſo obſtinate a Defence, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make him a tragical Example of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
in order whereunto, and the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
to afflict him, he firſt told him, <hi>That he
had the Day before caus'd his Son and all his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to be drown'd:</hi> To which <hi>Phyton</hi> return'd
no other Anſwer but this, <hi>That they were then
by one Day happier than he.</hi> After which, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to be ſtrip'd, and delivering him into
the Hands of the Tormentors, he was by them
not only dragg'd through the Streets of the
Town, and moſt ignominiouſly and cruelly
whipp'd, but moreover, vilified with moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and contumelious Language: yet ſtill, in the
Fury of all this Perſecution, he maintain'd his
Courage entire all the way, with a ſtrong
Voice and undaunted Countenance proclaiming
the glorious Cauſe of his Death; namely, for
that he would not deliver up his Countrey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of a Mercileſs Tyrant; at the
ſame time denouncing againſt him a ſudden
Chaſtiſement from the offended Gods. At
which the Tyrant rowling his Eyes about, and
reading in his Souldiers looks, that inſtead of
being incens'd at the haughty Language of this
conquer'd Enemy, to the Contempt of him
their Captain and his Triumph, they not only
ſeem'd ſtruck with Admiration of ſo rare a
Vertue, but moreover inclin'd to Mutiny, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100899:24"/>
were even ready to reſcue the Priſoner out of
the Hangman's hands, he cauſed the Execution
to ceaſe, and afterwards privately caus'd him
to be thrown into the Sea. Man (in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt)
is a Marvellous vain, fickle, and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Subject, and on whom it is very hard to
form any certain or proportionate Judgment.
For <hi>Pompey</hi> could pardon the whole City of
the <hi>Mammertines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pompey.</note> though furiouſly incens'd
againſt it, upon the ſingle Account of the
Vertue and Magnanimity of one Citizen, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
who took the Fault of the Publick whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon himſelf; neither intreated other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
but alone to undergo the Puniſhment
for all: And yet <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Hoſt, having in the
City of <hi>Peruſia</hi> manifeſted the ſame Vertue,
obtain'd nothing by it, either for himſelf or
his Fellow Citizens. And, directly contrary
to my firſt Examples, the braveſt of all Men,
and who was reputed ſo gracious and civil
to all thoſe he overcame, <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alexander.</note>
having after many great Difficulties forc'd the
City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and entring found <hi>Betis,</hi> who
commanded there, and of whoſe Valour in the
time of this Siege he had moſt noble and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Proof, alone, forſaken by all his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
his Arms hack'd and hew'd to pieces, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
all over with Blood and Wounds, and
yet ſtill fighting in the Crowd of a great
Number of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were laying on
him on all ſides, he ſaid to him, netled at ſo
dear bought Victory, and two freſh Wounds
he had newly received in his own Perſon, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not die</hi> Betis <hi>ſo honourably as thou doſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100899:24"/>
intend, but ſhalt aſſuredly ſuffer all the Torments
that can be inflicted on a miſerable Captive.</hi> To
which Menaces the other returning no other
Anſwer, but only a fierce and diſdainful Look;
What, ſays the Conqueror<note place="margin">Obſtinate ſilence of <hi>Betis.</hi>
               </note> (obſerving his
obſtinate Silence) <hi>Is he too ſtiff to bend a Knee!
Is he too proud to utter one ſuppliant Word! I ſhall
certainly conquer this Silence; and if I cannot force
a Word from his Mouth, I ſhall at leaſt extract a
Groan from his Heart.</hi> And thereupon converting
his Anger into Fury, preſently commanded
his Heels to be boar'd through, cauſing him
alive to be dragg'd, mangled, and diſmembred
at an infamous Carts-Tail. Was it that the
height of Courage was ſo natural and familiar
to this Conqueror, that becauſe he could not
admire, he ſhould the leſs eſteem this <hi>Hero?</hi>
Or was it that he conceiv'd Valour to be a
Vertue ſo peculiar to himſelf, that his Pride
could not, without Envy, endure it in another?
Or was it that the natural Impetuoſity of his
Fury was incapable of Oppoſition? Certainly,
had it been capable of any manner of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Saticty, it is to be believ'd, that in
the Sack and Deſolation of <hi>Thebes,</hi> to ſee ſo
many valiant Men loſt and totally deſtitute of
any further Defence, cruelly maſſacred before
his Eyes, would have appeas'd it. Where
there were above ſix thouſand put to the
Sword, of which not one was ſeen to fly, or
heard to cry out for Quarter; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
every one running here and there to
ſeek out and to provoke the Victorious Enemy
to help them to an honourable end. Not one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100899:25"/>
who did not to his laſt Gaſp yet endeavour to
revenge himſelf, and with all the Arms of a
brave Deſpair to ſweeten his own Death in the
Death of an Enemy. Yet did their Vertue
create no Pity, and the length of one day was
not enough to ſatiate the Thirſt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour's
Revenge; but the Slaughter continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the laſt drop of Bloud that was capable
of being ſhed, and ſtopp'd not till it met with
none but naked and impotent Perſons, old
Men, Women, and Children, of them to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away to the number of thirty thouſand
Slaves.</p>

expreſly, and particularly forbidden their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100899:25"/>
But the Story, nevertheleſs, ſays, that
<hi>Pſammenitus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being defeated
and taken Priſoner by <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
ſeeing his own Daughter paſs by him in a
wretched Habit, with a Bucket to draw Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though his Friends about him were ſo
concerned as to break out into Tears and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
at the miſerable ſight; yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
remain'd unmov'd, without uttering a
Word of Diſcontent, with his Eyes fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground: and ſeeing moreover his Son
immediately after led to Execution, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the ſame Gravity and Indifference; till
ſpying at laſt one of his Domeſticks dragg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
amongſt the Captives, he could then hold
no longer, but fell to tearing his Hair, and
beating his Breaſt, with all the other Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of a wild and deſperate Sorrow. A
Story that may very fitly be coupled with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the ſame kind, of a late Prince of our
own Nation, who being at <hi>Trent,</hi> and having
News there brought him of the Death of his
Elder Brother, but a Brother on whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the whole Support and Honour of his
Houſe, and ſoon after of that of a younger
Brother, the ſecond Hope of his Family, and
having withſtood theſe two Aſſaults with an
exemplary Reſolution, one of his Servants
happening a few days after to die, he ſuffer'd
his Conſtancy to be overcome by his laſt Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and parting with his Courage, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
himſelf to Sorrow and Mourning,
that ſome from thence were forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he was only touch'd to the Quick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100899:26"/>
by this laſt Stroak of Fortune; but, in truth,
it was, that being before brim full of Grief,
the leaſt Addition overflow'd the Bounds of all
Patience. Which might alſo be ſaid of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Example, did not the Story proceed to
tell us, That <hi>Cambyſes</hi> asking <hi>Pſammenitus,
Why, not being mov'd at the Calamity of his Son
and Daughter, he ſhould with ſo great Impatience
bear the Misfortune of his Friend? It is</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
he) <hi>becauſe this laſt affliction was only
to be manifeſted by Tears, the two firſt exceeding
all manner of Expreſſion.</hi> And peradventure
ſomething like this might be working in the
Fancy of the ancient Painter who being in the
Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to repreſent the Sorrow
of the Aſſiſtants proportionably to the ſeveral
Degrees of Intereſt every one had in the Death
of this fair innocent Virgin; and having in
the other Figures laid out the utmoſt Power of
his Art, when he came to that of her Father,
he drew him with a veil over his Face, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, that no kind of Countenance was
capable of expreſſing ſuch a degree of Sorrow.
Which is alſo the reaſon why the Poets feign

Of which two Parts, both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
generally comprehend our whole Duty,
and conſequently do each of them complicate
and involve the other; for, who will do his
own Work aright, will find that his firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is to know himſelf: And who rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
himſelf, will never miſtake another
Man's Work for his own, but will love and
improve himſelf above all other things, will
refuſe ſuperfluous Employments, and reject all
unprofitable Thoughts and Propoſitions. And,
as folly on the one ſide, though it ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

diſpences his Sages from all Fore-ſight and

relate to the Dead, I look upon that to be the
beſt, by which the Actions of Princes are to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100899:29"/>
be examined and ſifted after their Deceaſe.
They are equal at leaſt, while Living, if not
above the Laws, and therefore what Juſtice
could not inflict upon their Perſons, 'tis but
reaſon ſhould be executed upon their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Eſtates of their Succeſſors,
Things that we often value above Life it ſelf:
A Cuſtom of ſingular advantage to thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
where it is in uſe, and by all good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as much to be deſired, who have reaſon to
take it ill, that the Memories of the Tyrannical
and Wicked ſhould be us'd with the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Reſpect with theirs. We owe,
'tis true, Subjection and Obedience to all our
Kings, whether good or bad, alike, for that
has reſpect unto their Office; but as to Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Eſteem, thoſe are only due to their
Vertue. Let it be granted, that by the Rule
of Government we are with Patience to endure
unworthy Princes, to conceal their Vices, and
to aſſiſt them in their indifferent Actions,
whilſt their Authority ſtands in need of our
Support: Yet, the Relation of Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being once at an end, there is no reaſon we
ſhould deny the Publication of our real wrongs
and ſufferings to our own Liberty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

the Glory of having ſubmiſſively and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerv'd a Prince, whoſe Imperfections were
to them ſo perfectly known, were to deprive
Poſterity of ſo good an Example; and
ſuch as out of reſpect to ſome private Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

the Memory of a faulty Prince, do a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Right at the Expence, and to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Publick Juſtice. <hi>Livy</hi> does very
truly ſay, That the Language of Men bred up
in Courts, is always ſounding of vain Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that their Teſtimony is rarely true,
every one indifferently magnifying his own
Maſter, and ſtretching his Commendation to
the utmoſt extent of Vertue and Sovereign
Grandeur: And 'tis not impoſſible but ſome
may condemn the freedom of thoſe two Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who ſo roundly anſwer'd <hi>Nero</hi> to his Face,
the one being ask'd by him, <hi>Why he bore him ill

who, finding himſelf wounded to Death
with a Harquebuze Shot, and being by his

I was by no means pleas'd with a Story was

Age, of an exceſſive Pain of the Stone, he ſpent
the laſt Hours of his Life in an extraordinary
Solicitude about ordering the Ceremony of his
Funeral, preſſing all the Men of Condition who
came to ſee him, to engage their Word to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him to his Grave, importuning this very
Prince, who came to viſit him at his laſt Gaſp,
with a moſt earneſt Supplication, that he
would order his Family to be aſſiſting there,
and withal repreſenting before him ſeveral
Reaſons and Examples to prove that it was a
Reſpect due to a Man of his Condition; and
ſeem'd to die content, having obtain'd this
Promiſe, and appointed the Method and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Funeral Parade. I have ſeldom
heard of ſo long liv'd a Vanity. Another,

his Brains at the laſt Moments of his Life,

Is it not Temperance and Frugality to avoid
the Expence and Pleaſure of which the uſe and

were at all neceſſary in this Caſe, I ſhould be of
Opinion, that in this, as in all other Actions of

Life, the Ceremony and Expence ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by the Ability of the Perſon deceas'd;

his Executors to diſpoſe of his Body where
they ſhould think moſt fit, and as to his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
to order them neither too ſuperfluous,
nor too mean. For my part, I ſhould wholly
referr the ordering of this Ceremony to Cuſtom,

leave it to their Diſcretion, to whoſe Lot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it

create one frivolous and falſe; as we ſee that
the Soul in the exerciſe of its Paſſions, inclines
rather to deceive it ſelf, by creating a falſe and

fled into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> into his Hands;
which <hi>Philip</hi> (not knowing how to evade it)

nevertheleſs, that <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould attempt
nothing againſt the Life of the ſaid Duke, which
during his own Life he perform'd; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to die, in his laſt Will, commanded his

though he had not died with him: for we
cannot be oblig'd beyond what we are able to

during the time of his Life, kept the Secret of
the treaſure of the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> his Maſter,
at his Death diſcover'd it to his Children. I

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100899:44"/>
of it, without branding me with Malice,
a Vice ſo much a Stranger, and ſo contrary to
my Nature. However, I derive theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
from my Infirmity; firſt, that it is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
from which principally I have found reaſon
to correct a worſe, that would eaſily enough
have grown upon me; namely, Ambition; this
Defect being intolerable in thoſe who take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the Negotiations of the World, an
Employment of the greateſt Honour and Truſt
among Men: Secondly, that (as ſeveral like
Examples in the Progreſs of Nature demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to us) ſhe has fortified me in my other
Faculties, proportionably as ſhe has unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
me in this; I ſhould otherwiſe have
been apt implicitely to have repos'd my Wit
and Judgment upon the bare Report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men, without ever ſetting them to work
upon any Inquiſition whatever, had the
ſtrange Inventions and Opinions of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
I have read, been ever preſent with me
by the Benefit of Memory: Thirdly, That by
this Means I am not ſo talkative, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of the Memory is ever better furniſh'd
with matter than that of the Invention; and
had mine been faithful to me, I had ere this,
deaf'd all my Friends with my eternal Babble,
the Subjects themſelves rowſing and ſtirring up
the little Faculty I have of handling, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
them, heating and extending my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
'Tis a great Imperfection, and what
I have obſerv'd in ſeveral of my intimate
Friends, who, as their Memories ſupply them
with a preſent and entire Review of things,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100899:44"/>
derive their Narratives from ſo remote a
Fountain, and crowd them with ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Circumſtances, that though the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be good in it ſelf, they make a ſhift to ſpoil
it; and if otherwiſe, you are either to curſe
the Strength of their Memory, or the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Judgment: And it is a hard thing
to cloſe up a Diſcourſe, and to cut it ſhort, when
you are once in, and have a great deal more to
ſay. Neither is there any thing wherein the
Force and Readineſs of a Horſe is ſo much ſeen,
as in a round, graceful, and ſudden ſtop; and
I ſee even thoſe who are pertinent enough, who
would, but cannot ſtop ſhort in their Career;
for whilſt they are ſeeking out a handſome
Period to conclude the Sence, they talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and are ſo perplex'd, and entangled in
their own Eloquence, that they know not
what they ſay. But above all, old Men, who
yet retain the Memory of things paſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
how often they have told them, are the
moſt dangerous Company for this fault; and I
have known Stories from the Mouth of a Man
of very great Quality, otherwiſe very pleaſant
in themſelves becoming very troubleſome, by
being a Hundred times repeated over and over
again. The fourth Obligation I have to this
infirm Memory of mine is, that by this means
I leſs remember the Injuries I have receiv'd;
inſomuch, that (as the Ancient ſaid) I ſhould
have a <hi>Protocoll,</hi> a Regiſter of Injuries,
or a Prompter, like <hi>Darius,</hi> who, that he
might not forget the Offence he had receiv'd
from thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo oft as he ſat down to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100899:45"/>
Dinner, order'd one of his Pages three times
to whoop in his Ear, <hi>Sir, Remember the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi>
and alſo, the Places which I reviſit,
and the Books I read over again, ſtill ſmile
upon me with a freſh Novelty. It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
good Reaſon ſaid, That he who has not a
good Memory ſhould never take upon him the
Trade of Lying. I know very well, that the
<hi>Grammarians</hi> diſtinguiſh betwixt an <hi>Untruth</hi>
and a <hi>Lye,</hi> and ſay that to tell an <hi>Untruth</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to tell a thing that is falſe, but that we our
ſelves believes to be true; and that to <hi>Lye,</hi> is
to tell a thing that we know in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be utterly falſe and untrue; and it is
of this laſt ſort of Lyars only that I now ſpeak.
Now theſe do either wholly contrive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Untruths they utter, or ſo alter and
diſguiſe a true Story, that it always ends in a
Lye; and when they diſguiſe and often alter
the ſame Story according to their own Fancy,
'tis very hard for them at one time or another
to eſcape being trap'd, by reaſon that the real
Truth of the thing having firſt taken Poſſeſſion
of the Memory, and being there lodg'd, and
imprinted by the way of Knowledge and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it will be ever ready to preſent it ſelf
to the Imagination, and to ſhoulder out any
Falſhood of their own contriving, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
there have ſo ſure and ſettled Footing as
the other; and the Circumſtances of the firſt
true Knowledge evermore running in their
Minds, will be apt to make them forget thoſe
that are illegitimate, and only forg'd by their
own Fancy. In what they wholly invent,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100899:45"/>
foraſmuch as there is no contrary Impreſſion
to juſtle their Invention, there ſeems to be leſs
danger of tripping; and yet even this alſo,
by reaſon it is a vain Body, and without any
other Foundation than fancy only, is very apt
to eſcape the Memory, if they be not careful
to make themſelves very perfect in their Tale.
Of which I have had very Pleaſant Experience,
at the Expence of ſuch as Profeſs only to form,
and accommodate their Speech to the Affair
they have in hand, or to the Humour of the
Perſon with whom they have to do; for the
Circumſtances to which theſe men ſtick not to
enſlave their Conſciences, and their Faith being
ſubject to ſeveral Changes, their Language
muſt accordingly vary: From whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
that of the ſame thing they tell one Man,
that it is this, and another that it is that, giving
it ſeveral Forms, and Colours; which Men, if
they once come to confert Notes, and find out
the Cheat, what becomes of this fine Art? To
which may be added, that they muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
very often ridiculouſly trap themſelves;
for, what Memory can be ſufficient to retain ſo
many different Shapes as they have forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one and the ſame Subject? I have known
many in my Time, very ambitious of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of this fine piece of Diſcretion; but they
do not ſee, that if there be a Reputation of
being wiſe, there is really no Prudence in it.
In plain Truth, Lying is a hateful and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
Vice. We are not Men, nor have other
Tye upon one another, but our Word. If we
did but diſcover the Horror and ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100899:46"/>
of it, we ſhould purſue it with Fire and
Sword, and more juſtly than other Crimes. I
ſee that Parents commonly, and with Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enough, correct their Children for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
innocent Faults, and torment them for
wanton childiſh Tricks, that have neither Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
nor tend to any Conſequence: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
in my Opinion, Lying only, and (what is
of ſomething a lower Form) Stomach, are the
Faults which are to be ſeverely whip'd out of
them, both in the Infancy and Progreſs of the
Vices, which will otherwiſe grow up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
with them; and after a Tongue has
once got the Knack of lying, 'tis not to be
imagined how impoſſible almoſt it is to reclaim
it. Whence it comes to paſs, that we ſee
ſome, who are otherwiſe very honeſt Men, ſo
ſubject to this Vice. I have an honeſt Lad to
my Taylor, who I never knew guilty of one
Truth, no not when it had been to his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
If <hi>Falſhood</hi> had, like <hi>Truth,</hi> but one
Face only, we ſhould be upon better Terms;
for we ſhould then take the contrary to what
the <hi>Lyar</hi> ſays for certain Truth; but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of <hi>Truth</hi> has an hundred thouſand Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and a Field indefinite without Bound or
Limit. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> make <hi>Good</hi> to be
certain and finite, and <hi>Evil,</hi> infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
there are a thouſand ways to miſs the
White, there is only one to hit it. For my
own part, I have this Vice in ſo great horror,
that I am not ſure I could prevail with my
Conſcience to ſecure my ſelf from the moſt
manifeſt and extream Danger, by an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100899:46"/>
and ſolemn Lye. An ancient Father ſays,

King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt bragg'd, that he had,
by this means, non-plus'd <hi>Franciſco Taverna,</hi>
the Embaſſador of <hi>Franciſco Sforza,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Milan,</hi> a Man very famous for his Eloquence
in thoſe days. This Gentleman had been ſent
to excuſe his Maſter to his Majeſty about a
thing of very great Conſequence; which was
this: King <hi>Francis,</hi> to maintain evermore ſome
intelligence in <hi>Italy,</hi> out of which he had lately
been driven, and particularly in the Dutchy of
<hi>Milan,</hi> had thought it (to that end) convenient
to have evermore a Gentleman on his Behalf to
lie Leiger in the Court of that Duke; an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
in Effect, but in outward Appearance
no other than a private Perſon who pretended
to reſide there upon the ſingle Account of his
own particular Affairs; which was ſo carried,
by reaſon that the Duke, much more depending
upon the Emperour, eſpecially at a time when
he was in a Treaty of a Marriage with his Neece,
Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and ſince
Dowager of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> could not own any
Friendſhip or intelligence with us, but very
much to his own Prejudice. For this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
then one <hi>Merveille</hi> a <hi>Milanois</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and Epuerry to the King, being
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100899:47"/>
thought very fit, he was accordingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
thither with private Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
his Inſtructions of Ambaſſador, and other
Letters of Recommendation to the Duke about
his own private Concerns, the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
the Buſineſs; and ſo long continued in
that Court, that the Emperour at laſt had
ſome Incling of his real Employment there,
and complain'd of it to the Duke, which was
the Occaſion of what followed after, as we
ſuppoſe; which was, that under Pretence of
a Murther by him committed, his Tryal was
in two days diſpath'd, and his Head in the
Night ſtruck off in Priſon. Signior <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>
then being upon this Account, come to the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> and prepar'd with a long
counterfeit Story to excuſe a thing of ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Example, (for the King had apply'd
himſelf to all the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as
well as to the Duke himſelf, to demand Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for this Outrage upon the Perſon of his
Miniſter) had his Audience at the morning
Council; where, after he had for the Support
of his Cauſe, in a long premeditated Oration,
laid open ſeveral plauſible Juſtifications of the
Fact, he concluded, that the Duke his Maſter
had never look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d upon this <hi>Merveille</hi> for other
than a private Gentleman, and his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
who was there only in order to his own
Buſineſs, neither had he ever liv'd after any
other manner; abſolutely diſowning that he
had ever heard he was one of the King's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Servants, or that his Majeſty ſo much
as knew him, ſo far was he from taking him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100899:47"/>
for an Ambaſſadour. When having made an
end, and the King preſſing him with ſeveral
Objections and Demands, and ſifting him on all
hands, gravell'd him at laſt, by asking, why
then the Execution was perform'd by Night,
and as it were by Stealth? At which the poor
confounded Ambaſſador, the more handſomly
to diſingage himſelf, made Anſwer, That the
Duke would have been very loath, out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to his Majeſty, that ſuch an Execution
ſhould have been perform'd in the Face of the
Sun. Any one may gueſs if he was not well
ſchool'd when he came home, for having ſo gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly

Anſwer, inſiſting upon the Difficulties he
found in ſetting on foot ſo great a Preparation
as would be neceſſary to attack ſo Potent a

to ſet out the Grace and Beauty of thoſe
Parts wherein their chiefeſt Ornament and
Perfection lie; ſo in theſe two advantages
of Eloquence, to which the Lawyers and
Preachers of our Age ſeem Principally to
pretend. If I were worthy to adviſe, the
ſlow Speaker, methinks, ſhould be more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Pulpit, and the other for the Bar;
and that becauſe the Employment of the firſt
does naturally allow him all the Leiſure he can

compells him to enter the Liſts upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

of his adverſe Party, juſtle him out of his

Yet, at the Interview betwixt Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> and King <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Marceilles,</hi> it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
quite contrary, that <hi>Monſieur Poyet,</hi> a man
bred up all his Life at the Bar, and in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Repute for Eloquence, having the Charge
of making the Harangue to the Pope commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, and having ſo long meditated on
it before-hand, as (it was ſaid) to have brought
it ready made along with him from <hi>Paris;</hi> the

Pope, fearing ſome thing might be ſaid that
might give Offence to the other Princes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
who were there attending on him,
ſent to acquaint the King with the Argument
which he conceiv'd moſt ſuiting to the Time

to that <hi>Monſieur de Poyet</hi> had taken ſo much
Pains about: So that the fine Speech he had
prepared, was of no uſe, and he was upon the
Inſtant to contrive another; which finding
himſelf unable to do, Cardinal <hi>Bellay</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to perform that Office. The Pleader's
Part is, doubtleſs, much harder than that of
the Preacher; and yet, in my Opinion we ſee
more paſſable Lawyers than Preachers. It
ſhould ſeem that the nature of Wit is, to have
its operation prompt and ſudden, and that of
Judgment, to have it more deliberate, and
more ſlow: but he who remains totally ſilent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100899:49"/>
for want of leiſure to prepare himſelf to ſpeak
well, and he alſo whom leiſure does no ways

'Tis ſaid of <hi>Severus,</hi>

and that his Adverſaries were afraid to nettle
him, leſt his Anger ſhould redouble his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
I know experimentally, a Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo impatient of a tedious and elaborate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediation,
that if it do not go frankly and
gayly to work, can perform nothing to
purpoſe We ſay of ſome Compoſitions, that
they ſtink of Oyl, and ſmell of the Lamp, by
reaſon of a certain rough harſhneſs that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
handling imprints upon thoſe where
great Force has been employ'd: but beſides
this, the ſolicitude of doing well, and a
certain ſtriving and contending of a mind too

breaks, and hinders it ſelf, like Water,
that by force of its own preſſing violence and
abundance cannot find a ready iſſue through

would be too violent and rude: it would not
be juſtled, but ſollicited, and would be rouz'd

Occaſions. If it be left to it ſelf, it flags
and languiſhes, Agitation only gives it grace

Accident has more title to any thing that comes
from me, than I; Occaſion, Company, and
even the very riſing and falling of my own
Voice, extract more from my Fancy, than I can
find when I examine and employ it by my ſelf;
by which means, the things I ſay are better
than thoſe I write, if either were to be preferr'd
where neither are worth any thing. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
befalls me, that I am at a loſs, when I ſeek,
and light upon things more by chance, than by
any inquiſition of my own Judgment. I perhaps
ſometimes hit upon ſomething when I write
that ſeems queint and ſpritely to me, but will
appear dull and heavy to another. But let us
leave this Subject. Every one talks thus of
himſelf according to his Talent. For my part,
I am already ſo loſt in it, that I know not
what I was about to ſay, and in ſuch caſes, a
ſtranger often finds it out before me. If I ſhould
always carry my Razor about me, to uſe ſo oft
as this inconvenience befalls me, I ſhould make
clean work: but ſome Occurrence or other,
may at ſome other time, lay it as viſible to me

being rare, incredible, and prodigious.
So <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ſurnam'd the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> anſwer'd
him in <hi>Samothrace,</hi> who ſhewing him in the

ſaid to him, <hi>Look you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you

the Philoſophers who have acknowledg'd a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

relie too much upon theſe Fopperies. I wiſh
I had given any thing, that I had with my own

that in publick Confuſions, men aſtoniſh'd at
their Fortune, have abandon'd their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſuperſtitiouſly to ſeek out in the Stars the
ancient Cauſes and Menaces of their preſent
miſhaps, and in my time have been ſo ſtrangely
ſucceſsful in it, as to make men believe, that
this Study, being proper to fix and ſettle pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and volatile Wits, thoſe who have been
any thing vers'd in this knack of unfolding and
untying Riddles, are capable in any ſort of
Writing, to find out what they deſire. But
above all, that which gives them the greateſt
Room to play in, is the obſcure, ambiguous,
and fantaſtick Gibberiſh of their prophetick
Canting, where their Authors deliver nothing
of clear Sence, but ſhroud all in Riddle, to the
end that Poſterity may interpret, and apply
it according to their own Fancy. <hi>Socrates</hi> his
<hi>Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Familiar,</hi> might perhaps be no other
but a certain Impulſion of the will, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
it ſelf upon him without the advice or

            <p>THE Law of Reſolution and Conſtancy
does not imply, that we ought not, as

our ſelves from the Miſchiefs and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that threaten us; nor conſequently, that
we ſhall not fear leſt they ſhould ſurprize us:
on the contrary, all decent and honeſt ways
and means of ſecuring our ſelves from Harms,
are not only permitted, but moreover com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and the Buſineſs of Conſtancy
chiefly is, bravely to ſtand to, and ſtoutly to
ſuffer thoſe Inconveniences which are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
poſſibly to be avoided. There is no
motion of Body, nor any guard in the handling
of Arms, how irregular or ungraceful ſoever,

conſent that he ſhould tremble at the

And in like manner, at the Aſſignation of the

Pope and the Emperour at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
gave the Pope leave to come thither firſt,
and came himſelf after; for which, the reaſon
then given was this; that at all the Interviews
of ſuch Princes, the greater ought to be firſt
at the appointed Place, eſpecially before the
other, in whoſe Territories the Interview is
appointed to be, intimating thereby a kind of
deference to the other, it appearing proper
for the leſs to ſeek out, and to apply themſelves
to the greater, and not the greater to them.

            <head type="sub">Of the Puniſhment of Cowardice.</head>
            <p>I Once heard of a Prince, and a great Captain,
having a Narration given him as he ſat at
Table of the proceeding againſt Monſieur <hi>de
Vervins,</hi> who was ſentenc'd to Death for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſurrendred <hi>Bullen</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> openly
maintain'd, that a Souldier could not juſtly
be put to Death for his want of Courage. And,
in truth, a Man ſhould make a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Faults that merely proceed from
Infirmity, and thoſe that are viſibly the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Treachery and Malice; for in the laſt
they will fully act againſt the Rules of Reaſon
that Nature has imprinted in us; whereas in
the former it ſeems as if we might produce
the ſame Nature, who left us in ſuch a ſtate
of Imperfection, and defect of Courage for
our juſtification. Inſomuch, that many have
thought we are not juſtly queſtionable for any
thing, but what we commit againſt the Light
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100899:58"/>
of our own Conſcience. And it is partly upon
this Rule, that thoſe ground their Opinion,
who diſapprove of Capital and Sanguinary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
inflicted upon Hereticks and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants;
and theirs alſo, who hold that an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
or a Judge are not accountable for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ignorantly fail'd in their Adminiſtration.
But as to Cowardice, it is moſt certain, that
the moſt uſual way of chaſtiſing that is by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
and Diſgrace; and it is ſuppos'd, that
this Practice was firſt brought into uſe by the
Legiſlator <hi>Cherondas;</hi> and that before his time
the Laws of <hi>Greece</hi> puniſh'd thoſe with Death
who fled from a Battel; whereas he ordain'd
only that they ſhould be three days expos'd in
the publick Place dreſs'd in Womens Attire,
hoping yet for ſome Service from them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
awak'd their Courage by this open
Shame; <hi>Suffundere malis hominis ſanguinem quam
effundere,</hi> chooſing rather to bring the Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Cheeks than to let it out of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
It appears alſo, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws did
anciently puniſh thoſe with Death who had run
away: for <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> ſays, that the
Emperor <hi>Iulian</hi> commanded ten of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who had turn'd their Backs in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to be firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,
and afterwards put to death, according
(ſays he) to the ancient Laws, and yet elſe-where
for the like Offence, he only condemns others
to remain amongſt the Priſoners under the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
Enſign. The puniſhment the People of
<hi>Rome</hi> inflicted upon thoſe who fled from the
Battel of <hi>Cannae,</hi> and thoſe who run away
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100899:59"/>
with <hi>Cneius Fulvius,</hi> at his Defeat, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Death. And yet methinks Men ſhould
conſider what they do in ſuch Caſes, leſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
ſhould make ſuch Delinquents deſperate,
and not only faint Friends but implacable and
mortal Enemies. Of late memory, the <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
de Franget,</hi> Lieutenant to the Mareſchal
<hi>de Chattilion</hi>'s Company, having by the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Chabanes</hi> been put in Governour of
<hi>Fontarabie,</hi> in the Place of <hi>Monſieur de Lude,</hi>
and having ſurrender'd it to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he
was for that condemn'd to be degraded from
all Nobility, and both himſelf and his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
declar'd ignoble, taxable, and for ever
incapable of bearing Arms; which ſevere ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was afterwards accordingly executed at

were in <hi>Guiſe</hi> when <hi>Count Naſſau</hi> enter'd
into it, underwent the ſame puniſhment, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others have done ſince for the like Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Notwithſtanding, in caſe of ſuch a
manifeſt Ignorance or Cowardice as exceeds all
other ordinary Example, 'tis but reaſon to
take it for a ſufficient Proof of Treachery and
Malice, and for ſuch it ought to be cenſur'd

prove him a great Captain, and that he knew

he took very great Pains to get a particular

cut out for a Poet. A Gentleman of the long
Robe being not long ſince brought to ſee a

of his own and all other Faculties, took no
occaſion at all to entertain himſelf with any

always to put the Architect, the Painter,

upon diſcourſe of their own Capacities. And
to this purpoſe, in reading Hiſtories, which
is every Body's Subject, I uſe to conſider
what kind of Men are the Authors; which, if
Perſons that profeſs nothing but mere Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I in and from them principally obſerve
and learn the Stile and Language; If Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
I upon that account the rather incline to
credit what they report of the Temperature
of the Air, of the Health and Complexions
of Princes, of Wounds, and Diſeaſes; if
Lawyers, we are from them to take notice of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100899:60"/>
the Controverſies of Right and Title, the
Eſtabliſhment of Laws and Civil Government,
and the like; if Divines, the Affairs of the
Church, Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, Marriages
and Diſpenſations; if Courtiers, Manners and
Ceremonies; if Souldiers, the things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to their Trade, and principally
the Accounts of ſuch Actions and Enterprizes
wherein they were perſonally engaged; and
if Ambaſſadours, we are to obſerve their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations,
Intelligences, and Practices, and the
Manner how they are to be carried on. And
this is the reaſon why (which perhaps I ſhould
have lightly paſs'd over in another) I dwelt
upon and maturely conſider'd one Paſſage in
the Hiſtory writ by Mounſieur <hi>de Langey</hi> (a
Man of very great Judgment in things of that
nature) which was, after having given a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the fine Oration <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had
made in the Conſiſtory at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the
Preſence of the Biſhop of <hi>Maſcon</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Velley</hi> our Ambaſſadours there, wherein
he had mixed ſeveral tart and injurious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
to the Diſhonour of our Nation; and
amongſt the reſt, <hi>That if his Captains and
Souldiers were not Men of another kind of Fidelity,
Reſolution, and ſufficiency in the Knowledge of
Arms, than thoſe of the King, he would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
go with a Rope about his Neck and ſue to
him for Mercy,</hi> (and it ſhould ſeem the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had really this, or a very little better
Opinion of our military Men, for he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
twice or thrice in his Life, ſaid the
very ſame thing) as alſo, that he challenged
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100899:61"/>
the King to fight him in his Shirt with Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Poiniard in a Boat: the ſaid <hi>Sieur de
Langey</hi> purſuing his Hiſtory, adds, that the
forenam'd Ambaſſadours, ſending a Diſpatch
to the King of theſe things, conceal'd the
greateſt part, and particularly the two laſt
Paſſages. At which I could not but wonder,
that it ſhould be in the Power of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
to diſpenſe with any thing which he
ought to ſignifie to his Maſter, eſpecially of
ſo great importance as this, coming from the
Mouth of ſuch a Perſon, and ſpoke in ſo
great an Aſſembly; and ſhould rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it had been the Servant's Duty faithfully
to have repreſented to him the whole and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Truth as it paſt, to the end that the
Liberty of diſpoſing, judging and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
might abſolutely have remain'd in him:
for either to conceal, or to diſguiſe the Truth
for fear he ſhould take it otherwiſe than he
ought to do, and leſt it ſhould prompt him

Fear; and even in thoſe of the beſt
ſettled Temper, it is moſt certain, that it
begets a terrible Aſtoniſhment and Confuſion
during the Fit. I omit the Vulgar ſort, to

When <hi>Mounſieur de Bourbon</hi> took the City of

Fright upon the firſt Alarm, that he threw
himſelf out at a Breach with his Colun

he retreated full ſpeed through the

two oppoſite ways, the one and the other to
the ſame place, from which either of them
had fled before. Sometimes it adds Wings to
the Heels, as in the two firſt, and ſometimes
nails them to the Ground, and fetters them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100899:63"/>

manifeſt its utmoſt Power and Effect, when

Such as are in immediate Fear of loſing their

of Fear exceeding any we have ſpoke of yet,
a Paſſion that ſurpriſes us without any viſible
Cauſe, by an impulſe from Heaven; ſo that
whole Armies and Nations have been ſtruck
with it. Such a one was that, which brought
ſo wonderful a Deſolation upon <hi>Carthage,</hi>
where nothing was to be heard but Voices,
and Outcries of Fear, where the Inhabitants
were ſeen to ſally out of their Houſes as to an
Alarm, and there to charge, wound, and kill
one another, as if they had been Enemies come
to ſurprize their City. All things were in
ſtrange Diſorder and Fury, till with Prayers
and Sacrifices they had appeas'd their Gods:
and this is that they call a Panick Terror.</p>

The reaſon of which is, becauſe Study and

and more manly, is only to be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
voluptuous, and we ought to give it
the Name of Pleaſure, as that which is more
benign, gentle, and natural, and not that of
Vigour, from which we have deriv'd it: the
other more mean and ſenſual part of Pleaſure,
if it could deſerve this fair Name, it ought
to be upon the Account of Concurrence, and
not of Privilege; I find it leſs exempt from
Traverſes and Inconveniences, than Vertue it
ſelf; and beſides that, the enjoyment is more
momentary, fluid, and frail; it has its Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Faſts, and Labours, even to Sweat and
Blood; and moreover, has particular to it
ſelf ſo many ſeveral ſorts of ſharp and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paſſions, and ſo ſtupid a Satiety attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, as are equal to the ſevereſt Penance.
And we miſtake to think that Difficulties
ſhould ſerve it for a Spur, and a ſeaſoning to
its Sweetneſs, as in Nature one Contrary is
quickned by another, and to ſay when we
come to Vertue, that like Conſequences and
Difficulties overwhelm and render it auſtere
and inacceſſible; whereas, much more aptly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100899:68"/>
than in Voluptuouſneſs, they enable, ſharpen,
and heighten the Perfect and divine Pleaſure
they procure us. He renders himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it who will counterpoiſe his Expence
with the Fruit, and does neither underſtand
the Bleſſing, nor how to uſe it. Thoſe who
Preach to us, that the queſt of it is craggy, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and painful, but the Fruition pleaſant
and grateful, what do they mean by that but
to tell us that it is always unpleaſing? The
moſt perfect have been forc'd to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to aſpire unto it, and to approach it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without ever poſſeſſing it. But they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and do not take notice, that of all the
Pleaſures we know, the very Purſuit is
pleaſant. The Attempt ever reliſhes of the
quality of the thing to which it is directed,
for it is a good part of, and conſubſtantial
with the Effect. The Felicity and Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that glitters in Vertue, ſhines through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all her Apartments and Avenues, even
to the firſt Entry, and utmoſt Pale and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
Now of all the Benefits that Vertue
confers upon us, the Contempt of Death is
one of the greateſt, as the means that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates
Humane Life with a ſoft and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
Tranquillity, and gives us a pure and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Taſte of Living, without which all other
pleaſure would be extinct; which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why all the Rules by which we are to live,
centre and concur in this own Article. And
altho they all in like manner with one conſent
endeavour to teach us alſo to deſpiſe Grief,
Poverty, and the other Accidents to which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100899:68"/>
humane Life by its own Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is ſubjected, it is not nevertheleſs with
the ſame Importunity, as well by reaſon the
fore-named Accidents are not of ſo great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
the greater part of Mankind paſſing
over their whole Lives without ever knowing
what Poverty is, and ſome without Sorrow
or Sickneſs as <hi>Xenophilus</hi> the Muſician, who
liv'd a hundred and ſix Years in a perfect and
continual Health; as alſo becauſe, at the
worſt, Death can, whenever we pleaſe, cut
ſhort, and put an end to all theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
But as to Death, it is inevitable.</p>

Where Death waits for us in uncertain; let
us every where look for him. The Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Death is the Premeditation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
who has learnt to die has forgot to
ſerve. There is nothing of Evil in Life, for
him who rightly comprehends, that Death is
no Evil; to know how to die delivers us from
all Subjection and Conſtraint. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi>

in all things, if Nature do not help a little, it
is very hard for Art and Induſtry to perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not melancholy, but thoughtful; and there is
nothing I have more continually entertain'd my

and very ſeldom interrupted, does prolong,

For any thing I have to do before I

than a League's diſtance only from my own
Houſe, and merry and well, yet when that
thing came into my Head; I made haſt to
write it down there, becauſe I was not certain
to live till I came home. As a man that am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally

I am upon the matter at all hours as

Death, whenever he ſhall come, can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

ſome one may object, and ſay, that

the pain and terror of dying indeed does ſo
infinitely exceed all manner of imagination,
that the beſt Fencer will be quite out of his

a very great Advantage; and beſides, is
it nothing to come ſo far, at leaſt, without
any viſible Diſturbance or Alteration? But
moreover, Nature her ſelf does aſſiſt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

I find, that as I engage further in my

and diſdain of Life. I find I have much
more ado to digeſt this Reſolution of dying
when I am well in Health than when ſick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
of a Fever; and by how much I have
leſs to do with the Commodities of Life, by
reaſon I even begin to loſe the uſe and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

with leſs Terror and Amazement; which
makes me hope, that the further I remove
from the firſt, and the nearer I approach to
the latter, I ſhall ſooner ſtrike a bargain, and
with leſs Unwillingneſs exchange the one for
the other. And, as I have experimented in
other Occurrences, that, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſays, things
often appear greater to us at diſtance than

I have had Diſeaſes in much greater Horror

Let us but obſerve in the ordinary changes and
Declinations our Conſtitutions daily ſuffer, how

Humanity capable of enduring ſuch a change:
but Nature, leading us by the hand, an eaſie,
and as it were, an inſenſible pace, ſtep by ſtep
conducts us to that miſerable condition, and
by that means makes it familiar to us, ſo that
we perceive not, nor are ſenſible of the ſtroak

really a harder Death, than the final Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

not ſo great from an uneaſie being to none at
all, as it is from a ſpritely and florid Being to
one that is unweildy and Painful. The Body,
when bow'd beyond its natural ſpring of
Strength, has leſs Force either to riſe with,
or ſupport a burthen; and it is with the Soul
the ſame, and therefore it is, that we are to

Not only the Argument of Reaſon invites us
to it; for why ſhould we fear to loſe a

by ſo many ſorts of Death, is it not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
worſe eternally to fear them all, than

our Death is the Death of all things included.

is the ſame Folly as to be ſorry we were not

ſo did we put of our former Veil in entring
into it. Nothing can be grievous that is but
once, and is it reaſonable ſo long to fear a
thing that will ſo ſoon be diſpatch'd? Long
Life and ſhort, are by Death made all one;
for there is no long, nor ſhort, to things
that are no more. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that
there are certain little Beaſts upon the Banks
of the River <hi>Hypanis,</hi> that never live above
a day: they which die at eight of the Clock
in the Morning, die in their Youth, and
thoſe that die at five in the Evening, in their
extreameſt Age: Which of us would not laugh
to ſee this Moment of Continuance put into
the conſideration of Weal or Woe? The
moſt, and the leaſt of ours in compariſon of
Eternity, or yet to the Duration of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Rivers, Stars, Trees, and even of ſome
Animals, is no leſs ridiculous. But Nature
compels us to it; <hi>Go out of this World, ſays
ſhe, as you enter'd into it; the ſame Paſs you
made from Death to Life, without Paſſion or
Fear, the ſame, after the ſame manner, repeat
from Life to Death.</hi> Your Death is a part of

Bitterneſs with it, to the end, that ſeeing
of what Conveniency and Uſe it is, you might
not too greedily and indiſcreetly ſeek and

in this Moderation, as neither to nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate

which I have decreed you ſhall once do, I
have temper'd the one and the other betwixt
Pleaſure and Pain: and twas I that firſt taught
<hi>Thales,</hi> the moſt eminent of all your <hi>Sages,</hi>
that to Live and to Die were indifferent;
which made him very wiſely anſwer him who
ask'd him, Why then did he not die? becauſe
(ſays he) <hi>it is indifferent.</hi> The Elements of
Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, and the other
Parts of this Creation of thine, are no more
the Inſtruments of thy Life than they are of
thy Death. Why doſt thou fear thy laſt day,
it contributes no more to thy diſſolution than
every one of the reſt? The laſt Step is not the
cauſe of laſſitude, it does but confeſs it. Every
Day travels towards Death, the laſt only arrives
at it. Theſe are the good Leſſons our Mother
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100899:81"/>
Nature teaches. I have often conſider'd with
my ſelf whence it ſhould proceed, that in
War the Image of Death, whether we look
upon it as to our own particular danger, or
that of another, ſhould without Compariſon
appear leſs dreadful than at home in our own
Houſes, (for if it were not ſo, it would be
an Army of whining Milk-ſops) and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill in all Places the ſame, there ſhould
be notwithſtanding much more Aſſurance in
Peaſants, and the meaner ſort of People, than
others of better Quality and Education: and
I do verily believe, that it is thoſe terrible Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and Preparations wherewith we ſet
it out, that more terrifie us than the thing it
ſelf; a new quite contrary way of living,
the Cries of Mothers, Wives and Children,
the Viſits of aſtoniſh'd and afflicted Friends,
the Attendance of pale and blubber'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
a dark Room ſet round with hurning
Tapers, our Beds environed with Phyſicians
and Divines; in ſum, nothing but Ghoſtlineſs
and Horror round about us, render it ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
that a Man almoſt fanſies himſelf
dead and buried already. Children are afraid
even of thoſe they love beſt, and are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, when diſguiſed in a Vizor,
and ſo are we; the Vizor muſt be removed
as well from Things as Perſons; which being
taken away, we ſhall find nothing underneath
but the very ſame Death that a mean Servant,
or a poor Chamber-maid, died a day or two
ago, without any manner of Apprehenſion or
Concern. Happy therefore is the Death that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100899:82"/>
deprives us of the leiſure to prepare things
requiſite for this unneceſſary Pomp, a Pomp

               <hi>Soiſſons</hi> had in Confirmation, call'd <hi>German,</hi>
whom all the Inhabitants of the Place had
known to be a Girl till two and twenty Years
of Age, call'd <hi>Mary.</hi> He was at the time of
my being there very full of Beard, Old, and
not Married, who told us, that by ſtraining
himſelf in a Leap, his male Inſtruments came
out; and the Maids of that Place have to this
day a Song, wherein they adviſe one another
not to take too great Strides, for fear of being
turn'd into Men, as <hi>Mary German</hi> was. It is
no wonder if this ſort of Accident frequently
happen; for if Imagination have any Power in
ſuch things, it is ſo continually and vigorouſly
bent upon this Subject, that to the end it
may not ſo often relapſe into the ſame
Thought, and Violence of Deſire, it were
better once for all to give theſe young Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Things they long for. Some ſtick
not to attribute the Scars of King <hi>Dagobert,</hi>
and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> to the Force of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and it is ſaid, that by it Bodies will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be removed from their Places; and <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
tells us of a Prieſt whoſe Soul would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd
into ſuch an Ecſtaſie, that the Body
would, for a long time remain without Senſe
or Reſpiration. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes mention of
another, who, upon the hearing of any lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
or doleful Cries, would preſently fall into
a Swoon, and be ſo far out of himſelf, that it
was in vain to call, hollow in his Ears, pinch,
or burn him, till he voluntarily came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and then he would ſay that he had heard
Voices as it were a far off, and did feel when
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100899:84"/>
they pinch'd and burn'd him: and to prove
that this was no obſtinate Diſſimulation in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of his Senſe of Feeling, it was manifeſt,
that all the while he had neither Pulſe nor
Breathing. 'Tis very probable, that Viſions,
Exchantments, and all Extraordinary Effects
of that Nature, derive their Credit principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Power of Imagination, working
and making its chiefeſt Impreſſion upon vulgar
and more eaſie Souls, whoſe Belief is ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impos'd upon as to think they ſee what they
do not. I am not ſatisfied, and make a very
great Queſtion, Whether thoſe pleaſant Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with which this Age of ours is ſo fetter'd,
and there is almoſt no other Talk, are not
mere voluntary Impreſſions of Apprehenſion
and fear; for I know by experience, in the
Caſe of a particular Friend of mine, one for
whom I can be as Reſponſible as for my ſelf,
and a Man that cannot poſſibly fall under any
manner of Suſpicion of inſufficiency, and as
little of being enchanted, who having heard
a Companion of his make a Relation of an
unuſual Frigidity that ſurpriz'd him at a very
unſeaſonable time, being afterwards himſelf
engag'd upon the ſame Account, the Horror
of the former Story on a ſudden ſo ſtrangely
poſſeſs'd his Imagination, that he ran the ſame
Fortune the other had done; and from that
time forward (the ſcurvy Remembrance
of his Diſaſter running in his Mind, and
tyrannizing over him) was extreamly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Relapſe into the ſame Misfortune.
He found ſome Remedy, however, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100899:84"/>
this Incovenience, by himſelf franckly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing,
and declaring before-hand to the
Party with whom he was to have to do, the
Subjection he lay under, and the infirmity he
was Subject to, by which means the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Soul was in ſome ſort appeas'd;
and knowing that now ſome ſuch Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was expected from him, the Reſtraint
upon thoſe Faculties grew leſs, and he leſs
ſuffer'd by it, and afterwards, at ſuch times as
he could be in no ſuch Apprehenſion, as not
being about any ſuch Act (his Thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then diſengag'd and free, and his Body
being in its true and natural Eſtate) by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe Parts to be handled and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Knowledge of others, he was at
laſt totally freed from that vexatious Infirmity.
After a Man has once done a Woman right,
he is never after in danger of misbehaving
himſelf with that Perſon, unleſs upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a manifeſt and inexcuſable Weakneſs.
Neither is this Diſaſter to be fear'd, but in
Adventures where the Soul is over-extended
with Deſire or Reſpect, and eſpecially where
we meet with an unexpected Opportunity
that requires a ſudden and quick Diſpatch;
and in thoſe Caſes, there is no poſſible means
for a Man always to defend himſelf from ſuch
a Surprize as ſhall put him damnably out
of Countenance. And yet I have known
ſome, who have ſecured themſelves from
this Miſchance by coming half ſated elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
purpoſely to abate the ardour of his
Fury; and others, who by being grown old,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100899:85"/>
find themſelves leſs impotent by being loſs
able; and particularly one, who found an
Advantage by being aſſur'd by a Friend of
his, that he had a Counter-charm againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Enchantments that would defend him
from this Diſgrace. The Story it ſelf is not
much amiſs, and therefore you ſhall have it.
A Count of a very great Family, and with
whom I had the Honour to be very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
intimate, being married to a very fair
Lady, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> formerly been pretended to,
and importunately courted by one who was
invited to, and preſent at the Wedding: all
his Friends were in very great Fear, but
eſpecially an old Lady his Kinſwoman, who
had the ordering of the Solemnity, and in
whoſe Houſe it was kept, ſuſpecting his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
would, in Revenge, offer ſoul Play, and
procure ſome of theſe kind of Sorceries to
put a Trick upon him; which Fear ſhe alſo
communicated to me, who, to comfort her,
bad her not trouble her ſelf, but relie upon
my Care to prevent or fruſtrate any ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
Now I had, by chance, about me a
certain flat Plate of Gold whereon were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſome Coeleſtial Figures good to prevent
Frenzy occaſion'd by the Heat of the Sun, or
for any Pains of the Head, being applied to
the Suture; where, that it might the better
remain firm, it was ſowed to a Ribban to be
tyed under the Chin. A Foppery Cozen-Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to this of which I am ſpeaking, was by
<hi>Jaques Pelleti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> who liv'd in my Houſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to me for a ſingular Rarety, and a thing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100899:85"/>
of Sovereign Vertue. I had a fancy to make
ſome uſe of this Knack, and therefore private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told the Count, that he might poſſibly run
the ſame Fortune other Bridegrooms had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
done; eſpecially ſome Perſons being in
the Houſe, who no doubt would be glad to do
him ſuch a Courteſie, but let him boldly go to
Bed, for I would do him the Office of a Friend,
and if need were, would not ſpare a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that it was in my Power to do, provided
he would engage to me, upon his Honour,
to keep it to himſelf, and only when they
came to bring him his Cawdle,<note place="margin">A Cuſtom in <hi>France</hi> to bring the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom a Cawdle in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the night, on his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding night.</note> if Matters had
not gone well with him, to give me ſuch a
Sign, and leave the reſt to me. Now he had
his Ears ſo batter'd, and his mind ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with the eternal Tattle of this Buſineſs,
that when he came to't he did really find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
tied with the Trouble of his Imagination,
and accordingly at the time appointed gave
me the Sign: Whereupon, I whiſper'd him in
the Ear, That he ſhould riſe under Pretence
of putting us out of the Room, and after a
jeſting manner pull my Night-gown from my
Shoulders; throw it over his own, and there
keep it till he had perform'd what I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him to do, which was, that when
we were all gone out of the Chamber he
ſhould withdraw to make Water, ſhould
three times repeat ſuch and ſuch Words, and
as often do ſuch and ſuch Actions: that at
every of the three times he ſhould tie the
Ribban I put into his Hand about his Middle,
and be ſure to place the Medal was faſtned
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100899:86"/>
to it (the Figures in ſuch a Poſture) exactly
upon his Reins, which being done, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the laſt of the three times ſo well girt
and faſt tied the Ribban that it could neither
untie nor ſlip from its Place, let him confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
return to his Buſineſs, and withal not
to forget to ſpread my gown upon the Bed,
ſo that it might be ſure to cover them both.
Theſe ridiculous Circumſtances are the main
of the Effect, our fancy being ſo far ſeduc'd,
as to believe, that ſo ſtrange and uncouth
Formalities muſt of neceſſity proceed from
ſome abſtruſe Science. Their inanity gives
them Reverence and Weight. However, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that my Figures approv'd themſelves
more <hi>Venerean</hi> than <hi>Solar,</hi> and the fair Bride
had no reaſon to complain. Now I cannot
forbear to tell you, it was a ſudden Whimſey,
mix'd with a little Curioſity, that made me
do a thing ſo contrary to my Nature; for I
am an Enemy to all ſubtile, and counterfeit
Actions, and abominate all manner of Fraud,
though it be but for ſport; for though the
Action may not be wicked in it ſelf, yet 'tis
done after a wicked manner. <hi>Amaſis</hi> King
of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> married <hi>Laodicea</hi> a marvellous beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Greek</hi> Virgin, who, tho famous for his
Abilities elſewhere found himſelf quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man with his Wife, and could by no
means enjoy her; at which he was ſo enrag'd,
that he threatned to kill her, ſuſpecting her
to be a Witch. As 'tis uſually in things that
conſiſt in Fancy; ſhe put him upon Devotion,
who having accordingly made his Vows to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100899:86"/>
               <hi>Venus,</hi> he found himſelf divinely reſtor'd the
very firſt Night after his Oblations and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.
Now in plain truth, Women are to
blame, to entertain us with that diſdainful,
coy, and angry Countenance they commonly
do, which extinguiſhes our Vigour, as it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
our Deſire; which made the Daughter-in-Law
of <hi>Prthagoras</hi> to ſay, That <hi>the Woman
who goes to Bed to a Man, must put of her Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
with her Petticoat, and put it on again with the
ſame.</hi> The Soul of the Aſſailant being diſturb'd
with many ſeveral Alarms, is eaſily aſtoniſh'd,
and ſoon loſes the Power of Performance; and
whoever the Imagination has once put this
Trick upon and confounded with the Shame of
it, (and ſhe never does it but at the firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
by reaſon Men are then More ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and eager, and alſo at this firſt Account

of miſcarrying) having made an ill
Beginning, he enters into ſuch Indignations
and Deſpite at the Accident, as will in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Opportunities be apt to remain, and
continue him in the ſame Condition. As to
what concerns Married People, having the
Year before them (as we ſay) they ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to compell, or ſo much as to offer at the
Feat, if they do not find themſelves very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and it is better indecently to fail of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling
the Nuptial Sheets, and of paying
the Ceremony due to the Wedding-night,
when a Man perceives himſelf full of Agitation
and Trembling, expecting another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
at a better and more private Leiſure,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100899:87"/>
when his Fancy ſhall be better compos'd,
than to make himſelf perpetually miſerable
for having misbehav'd himſelf, and being baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
at the firſt Aſſault. Till poſſeſſion be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
a man that knows himſelf ſubject to this
Infirmity, ſhould leiſurely and by degrees
make ſeveral little tryals and light offers,
without obſtinately attempting at once to
force an abſolute conqueſt over his own mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
and indiſpos'd Faculties; ſuch as know
their members to be naturally obedient to
their deſires, need to take no other care but
only to counterplot their Fancy. The indocile
and rude liberty of this ſcurvy Member, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
remarkable, by its importunate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
and unſeaſonable tumidity and impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
at ſuch times as we have nothing for it to
do, and by its more unſeaſonable ſtupidity
and diſobedience, when we ſtand moſt in need
of his Vigour, ſo imperiouſly conteſting the
Authority of the Will, and with ſo much obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
denying all ſollicitation both of Hand
and Fancy. And yet though his Rebellion is ſo
univerſally complain'd of, and that proofs are
not wanting to condemn him, if he had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
fee'd me to plead his Cauſe, I ſhould
peradventure bring the reſt of his fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
into ſuſpicion of complo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
againſt him, out of pure envy at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and raviſhing pleaſure particular to
his Employment, ſo as to have by Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
arm'd the whole World againſt him, by
malevolently charging him alone with their
common offence. For let any one conſider,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100899:87"/>
whether there is any one Part of our Bodies
that does not often refuſe to perform its. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at the Precept of the Will, and that does
not often exerciſe its Function in defiance of
her Command. They have every one of them
proper Paſſions of their own, that rouze and
awake, ſtupifie and benumb them, without
our Leave or Conſent. How often do the
involuntary motions of the Countenance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
our inward Thoughts, and betray our
moſt private Secrets to the Knowledge of the
Standers by? The ſame Cauſe that animates
this Member, does alſo, without our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
animate the Lungs, Pulſe and Heart,
the ſight of a pleaſing Object imperceptibly
diffuſing a Flame through all our Parts with
a febrifick motion. Is there nothing but
theſe Veins and muſcles that ſwell, and flag
without the Conſent, not only of the Will,
but even of our Knowledge alſo? We do not
command our Hairs to ſtand on end, nor our
Skin to ſhiver either with Fear or Deſire. The
Hands often convey themſelves to Parts to
which we do not direct them. The Tongue will
be interdict, and the Voice ſometimes ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
when we know not how to help it.
When we have nothing to eat, and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
forbid it, the Appetite of Eating and
Drinking does not for all that forbear to ſtir
up the Parts that are ſubjected to it, no more
not leſs than the other Appetite we were
ſpeaking of, and in like manner does as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
leave us. The Veſſels that ſerve to
diſcharge the Belly have their proper Dila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100899:88"/>
and Compreſſions, without, and beyond
our Intelligence, as well as thoſe which are
deſtin'd to purge the Reins. And that which
to juſtifie the Prerogative of the Will, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
urges, of having ſeen a Man who could
command his Back-ſide to diſcharge as often
together as he pleas'd, and that <hi>Vives</hi> does
yet fortifie with another Example in his time
of one that could Fart, in Tune, does nothing
ſuppoſe any more pure Obedience of that
Part; for is any thing commonly more tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
or indiſcreet? To which let me add,
that I my ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f knew one ſo rude and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
as for forty Years together made his
Maſter-Vent with one continued and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Hurricane, and 'tis like will do till he
expire that way, and vaniſh in his own Smoak.
And I could heartily wiſh, that I only knew by
Reading, how oft a Man's Belly, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of one ſingle Puff, brings him to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
door of an exceeding painful Death; and
that the Emperour, who gave Liberty to let
fly in all Places, had at the ſame time given
us Power to do it. But for our Will, in
whoſe behalf we prefer this Accuſation, with
how much greater Similitude of Truth may
we reproach even her her ſelf with Mutiny
and Sedition for her Irregularity and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
Does ſhe always will what we would
have her to do? Does ſhe not often will what
we forbid her to will, and that to our manifeſt
Prejudice? Does ſhe ſuffer her ſelf any more
than any of the other, to be govern'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Reſults of our Reaſon? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,

that in this Fact, his Cauſe being inſeparably
conjoyn'd with an Acceſſary, yet he is only
call'd in Queſtion, and that by Arguments
and Accuſations that cannot be charg'd, nor
reflect upon the other: whoſe Buſineſs indeed
is ſometimes inopportunely to invite, but never
to refuſe, and to allure after a tacite and clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine

which, the Apothecary being gone, and the
Patient accommodated as if he had really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Clyſter, he found the ſame operation
and effect that thoſe do who have taken one
indeed; and if at any time the Phyſician did
not find the Operation ſufficient, he would
uſually give him two or three more after the
ſame manner. And the Fellow moreover
ſwore to me, that to ſave charges (for he
pay'd as if he had really taken them) this ſick
mans Wife, having ſometimes made tryal of
warm Water only, the effect diſcover'd the
Cheat, and finding theſe would do no good,
was fain to return to the old way. A Woman
fanſying ſhe had ſwallow'd a pin in a piece of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100899:89"/>
Bread, cry'd out of an intolerable pain in her
Throat, where ſhe thought ſhe felt it ſtick:
but an ingenious Fellow that was brought to
her, ſeeing no outward Tomour nor alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſuppoſing it only to be conceit taken at
ſome Cruſt of Bread that had hurt her as it
went down, caus'd her to vomit, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unſeen, threw a crooked Pin into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which the Woman no ſooner ſaw, but
believing ſhe had caſt it up, ſhe preſently
found her ſelf eas'd of her pain. I my ſelf
knew a Gentleman, who having treated a
great deal of good Company at his houſe,
three or four days after bragg'd in jeſt (for
there was no ſuch thing) that he had made
them eat of a bak'd Cat; at which, a young
Gentlewoman, who had been at the Feaſt,
took ſuch a horror, that falling into a violent
vomiting end a Fever, there was no poſſible
means to ſave her. Even brute Beaſts are alſo
ſubject to the force of Imagination a well
as we; as is ſeen by Dogs, who die of grief
for the loſs of their Maſters, and are ſeen to
queſt, tremble, and ſtart, as Horſes will kick
and whinney in their ſleep. Now all this may
be attributed to the affinity and relation betwixt
the Souls and Bodies of Brutes, but 'tis quite
another thing when the Imagination works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Souls of rational men, and not only to
the prejudice of their own particular Bodies,
but of others alſo. And as an infected Body
communicates its Malady to thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
or live near it, as we ſee in the Plague,
the ſmall Pox, and ſore Eyes that run through
whole Families and Cities;

Goats, and Sheep, and the Hares and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges
that the Snow turns white upon the
Mountains. There was at my Houſe a little
while ago, a Cat ſeen watching a Bird upon
the Top of a Tree, who for ſome time mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
fixing their Eyes upon one another, the
Bird at laſt let her ſelf fall as dead into the
Cats Claws, either dazled and aſtoniſh'd by
the Force of her own Imagination, or drawn by
ſome attractive Power of the Cat. Such as
are addicted to the Pleaſures of the Field,
have, I make no queſtion, heard the Story of
the Faulconer, who having earneſtly fix'd his
Eyes upon a Kite in the Air, lay'd a Wager,
that he would bring her down with the ſole
Power of his Sight, and did ſo, as it was ſaid;
for the Tales I borrow, I charge upon the
Conſciences of thoſe from whom I have them.
The Diſcourſes are my own, and found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the Proofs of Reaſon, not of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
to which every one has Liberty to
add his own Examples: and who has none,
(the Number and Varieties of Accidents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd)
let him not forbear to believe that
theſe I ſet down are enough: and if I do not
apply them well, let ſome other do it for me.
And alſo in the Subjects of which I treat, <hi>viz.</hi>
of our Manners and Motions, the Teſtimonies
and Inſtances I produce, how fabulous ſoever,
provided they are poſſible, ſerve as well as
the true; whether it has really happen'd or no,
at <hi>Rome</hi> or at <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> tis ſtill
within the Verge of Poſſibility, and humane
Capacity, which ſerves me to good uſe, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100899:91"/>
ſupplies me with Variety in the things I
write. I ſee, and make my Advantage of it
as well in Shadow as in Subſtance; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the various Examples I every where
meet with in Hiſtory, I cull out the moſt rare
and memorable to fit my own Turn. There
are ſome Authors whoſe only end and Deſign
it is, to give an Account of things that have
hapned; mine, if I could arrive unto it,
ſhould be to deliver what may come to paſs.
There is a juſt Liberty allow'd in the Schools,
of ſuppoſing and contriving <hi>Simile</hi>'s, when
they are at a Loſs for them in their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
I do not, however, make any uſe of
that Privilege, and as to that Affair in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Religion ſurpaſs all Hiſtorical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
In the Examples which I here bring in
of what I have heard, read, done, or ſaid, I
have forbid my ſelf to dare to alter even the
moſt light and indifferent Circumſtances; my
Conſcience does not falſifie one Tittle, what
my Ignorance may do I cannot ſay. And this
it is that makes me ſometimes enter into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with my own Thoughts, whether or no,
a Divine, or a Philoſopher, Men of ſo exact
and tender Wiſdom and Conſcience, are fit to
write Hiſtory: for, how can they ſtake their
Reputation upon the Publick Faith? how be
reſponſible for the Opinions of Men they do
not know? And with what Aſſurance deliver
their Conjectures for Current Pay? Of Actions

Perſons were Actors, they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to give Evidence upon Oath before a

Judge; and cannot be ſo familiarly and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
acquainted with any for whoſe Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they would become abſolute Caution.
For my part, I think it leſs hazardous to write
things paſt, than preſent, by how much the
Writer is only to give an Account of things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one knows he muſt of neceſſity borrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Truſt. I am ſollicited to write the Affairs
of my own Time by ſome who fanſie I look
upon them with an Eye leſs blinded with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
or Partiality, than another, and have
a clearer Inſight into them by reaſon of the free
Acceſs Fortune has given me to the Heads of
both Factions; but they do not conſider, that
to purchaſe the Glory of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> I would not
give my ſelf the Trouble, being a ſworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as I am to all Obligation, Aſſiduity, and
Perſeverance: beſides that, there is nothing ſo
contrary to my Stile, as a continued and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Narrative, I ſo often Interrupt, and
cut my ſelf ſhort in my Writing only for want
of Breath. I have neither Fancy, nor Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
worth any thing, and am ignorant beyond
a Child, of the Phraſes, and even the very
Words proper to expreſs the moſt common
things; and for that Reaſon it is, that I have
undertaken to ſay only what I can ſay, and
have accommodated my Subject to my Force.
Should I take one to be my Guide, peradventure
I ſhould not be able to keep Pace with him, and
in the Precipitancy of my Career might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Things, which upon better Thoughts, in
my own Judgment, and according to Reaſon,
would be criminal, and puniſhable in the

ſhould he not cozen in Crowns ſince he does
it in Pins, than as they do, who ſay, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

them in their Hearts, that the very Thought

            <p>I ſaw the other day, at my own Houſe, a

him, that indeed they have half forgot their
natural Office, and the uſe for which they
were deſign'd; the Fellow too calls them his
Hands, and we may allow him ſo to do, for
with them he cuts any thing, charges and
diſcharges a Piſtol, threds a Needle, Sows,
Writes, and puts off his Hat, combs his Head,
plays at Cards and Dice, and all this with as
much Dexterity as any other could do who
had more, and more proper Limbs to aſſiſt
him; and the Money I gave him he carried
away in his Foot, as we do in our Hand I
have ſeen another, who being yet a Boy,

for a Philoſopher, that is, for an Obſerver

from Minds prepoſſeſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with Cuſtom? I do
believe, that no ſo abſurd or ridiculous Fancy
can enter into Humane Imagination, that
does not meet with ſome Example of Publick
Practice, and that conſequently our Reaſon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100899:96"/>
does not ground, and ſupport it ſelf upon.
There are People amongſt whom it is the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to turn their Backs upon him they ſalute,
and never look upon the Man they intend to
honour. There is a Place, where, whenever
the King ſpits, the greateſt Ladies of his
Court put out their hands to receive it; and
another Nation, where the moſt eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
about him ſtoop to take up his Ordure in
a Linen-cloth. Let us here ſteal room to
inſert a Story. A <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, of my
acquaintance, was always wont to blow his
Noſe with his Fingers, (a thing very much
againſt our Faſhion) would juſtifie himſelf for
ſo doing, and was a man very famous for
pleaſant Repartees, who, upon that occaſion,
ask'd me what Privilege this filthy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had, that we muſt carry about us a fine
Handkerchief to receive it, and which was
more, afterwards to lap it carefully up, and
carry it all day about in our Pockets, which,
he ſaid, could not but be much more nauſeous
and offenſive, than to ſee it thrown away, as
we did all other Evacuations. I found that
what he ſaid was not altogether without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and by being frequently in his Company,
that ſlovenly action of his was at laſt grown
familiar to me; which nevertheleſs we make
a face at, when we hear it reported of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country. Miracles appear to be ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our ignorance of Nature, and not
according to the Eſſence of Nature. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
being accuſtom'd to any thing, blinds
the eye of our Judgment. <hi>Barbarians</hi> are no
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100899:96"/>
more a wonder to us, than we are to them;
nor with any more reaſon, as every one would
confeſs, if after having travell'd over thoſe
remote Examples, Men could ſettle themſelves
to reflect upon, and rightly to confer them.
Humane Reaſon is a Tincture equally infus'd
almoſt into all our Opinions and Cuſtoms, of
what form ſoever they are, infinite in Matter,
infinite in Diverſity. But I return to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>There are a People, where (his Wife aud
Children excepted) no one ſpeaks to the King
but through a Trunk. In one and the ſame
Nation the Virgins diſcover thoſe Parts that
Modeſty ſhould perſwade them to hide, and
the married Women carefully cover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal.
To which, this Cuſtom in another
Place has ſome Relation, where Chaſtity,
but in Marriage is of no Eſteem, for unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Women may proſtitute themſelves to as
many as they pleaſe, and being got with
Child, may lawfully take Phyſick in the ſight
of every one to deſtroy their Fruit. And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Place, if a Tradeſman marry, all of
the ſame Condition, who are invited to the
Wedding, lie with the Bride before him; and
the greater number of them there is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is her Honour, and the Opinion of her Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Strength: if an Officer marry, 'tis
the ſame, the ſame with a Nobleman, and ſo of
the reſt, except it be a Labourer, or one of
mean Condition, for them it belongs to the
Lord of the Place to perform that Office; and
yet a ſevere Loyalty during Marriage is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100899:97"/>
ſtrictneſs enjoyn'd. There is a place
where Bawdy-houſes of Young-men are kept
for the Pleaſure of Women, as we know
there are of Women for the Neceſſities of
Men; and alſo Marriages, where the Wives
go to War as well as the Husbands, and not
only ſhare in the dangers of Battle, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in the Honours of Command. Others,
where they wear Rings not only through their
Noſes, Lips, Cheeks, and on their Toes, but
alſo wighty Gymmals of Gold thruſt through
their Paps and Buttocks: Where, in eating,
they wipe their Fingers upon their Thighs,
Genetories, and the Soles of their Feet:
Where Children are excluded, and Brothers
and Nephews only inherit; and elſewhere,
Nephews only, ſaving in the Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the Succeſſion of the Crown: where,
for the Regulation of Community in Goods
and Eſtates obſerv'd in the Country, certain
Sovereign Magiſtrates have committed to them
the univerſal Charge, and over-ſeeing of the
Agriculture, and Diſtribution of the Fruits
according to the Neceſſity of every one:
Where they lament the Death of Children,
and Feaſt at the Deceaſe of old Men: Where
they lie ten or twelve in a Bed, Men and
their Wives together: Where Women,
whoſe Husbands come to violent Ends, may
marry again, and others not: Where the
ſervile Condition of Women is look'd upon
with ſuch Contempt, that they kill all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Females, and buy Wives of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to ſupply their Uſe; Where Husbands
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100899:97"/>
may repudiate their Wives, without ſhewing
any Cauſe, but Wives cannot part from their
Husbands, for what cauſe ſoever. Where
Husbands may ſell their Wives in caſe of ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
Where they boyl the Bodies of their
dead, and afterwards pound them to a pulp,
which they mix with their Wine, and drink
it; Where the moſt coveted Sepulture is to
be eaten with Dogs, and elſewhere by Birds;
Where they believe the Souls of the happy
live in all manner of Liberty, in delightful
Fields, furniſh'd with all ſorts of Delicacies,
and that it is thoſe Souls, repeating the words
we utter, which we call <hi>Echo.</hi> Where they
fight in the Water, and ſhoot their Arrows
with the moſt mortal aim, ſwimming; Where,
for a ſign of Subjection, they lift up their
Shoulders, and hang down their Heads, and
put off their ſhooes when they enter the King's
Palace. Where the Eunuchs, who take charge
of the Religious Women, have moreover
their Lips and Noſes cut away, and diſguis'd,
that they may not be lov'd; and the Prieſts
put out their own Eyes, to be better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and retain their Oracles: Where every
one creates to himſelf a Deity of what he likes
beſt, according to his own Fancy; the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a Lyon or a Fox; the Fiſher, ſome certain
Fiſh, and Idols of every Humane Action or
Paſſion; in which place the Sun, the Moon,
and the Earth are the principal Deities, and
the form of taking an Oath is to touch the
Earth, looking up to Heaven; and there both
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100899:98"/>
Fleſh and Fiſh is eaten raw; Where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Oath they take is, to ſwear by the Name
of ſome dead Perſon of Reputation, laying
their hand upon his Tomb; Where the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years
Gift the King ſends every Year to the
Princes, his Subjects, is Fire, which being
brought, all the old Fire is put out, and the
neighbouring People are bound to fetch of the
new, every one for themſelves upon pain of
Treaſon; Where, when the King, to betake
himſelf wholly to Devotion, retires from his
Adminiſtration, (which often falls out) his
next Succeſſor is oblig'd to do the ſame; by
which means the Right of the Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
to the third in Succeſſion; Where they
vary the Form of Government, according to the
ſeeming neceſſity of Affairs: Depoſe the King
when they think good, ſubſtituting ancient
men to govern in his ſtead, and ſometimes
transferring it into the hands of the Common-People;
Where Men and Women are both
Circumcis'd and alſo Baptiz'd; Where the
Souldier, who in one, or ſeveral Engagements,
has been ſo fortunate, as to preſent ſeven of the
Enemies Heads to the King, is made noble:
where they live in that rare and ſingular Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Mortality of the Soul: Where the
Women are deliver'd without Pain or Fear:
Where the Women wear Copper Fetters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both their Legs, and if a Louſe bite them,
are bound in Magnanimity to bite them again,
and dare not marry till firſt they have made
their King a Tender of their Virginity, if he
pleaſe to accept it: Where the ordinary way
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100899:98"/>
of Salutation is by putting a Finger down to
the Earth, and then pointing it up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
Where Men carry Burthens upon their
Heads, and Women on their Shoulders, the
Women piſſing ſtanding, and the Men cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
down: Where they ſend their Blood in
token of Friendſhip, and cenſe the men they
would honour, like Gods: Where not only to
the fourth, but in any other remote Degree,
Kindred are not permitted to marry: Where
the Children are four Years at Nurſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
twelve; in which Place alſo it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mortal to give the Child ſuck the firſt day
after it is born: Where the Correction of the
male Children is peculiarly deſign' d to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and to the Mothers of the Females; the
Puniſhment being to hang them by the Heels in
the Smoak. Where they eat all ſorts of Herbs,
without other Scruple, than of the Illneſs of
the Smell: Where all things are open, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Houſes, and that are furniſh'd with the
richeſt Furniture, without Doors, Windows,
Trunks, or Cheſts to lock, a Thief being
there puniſh'd double to what they are in
other Places: Where they crack Lice with
their Teeth like Monkeys, and abhorr to ſee
them kill'd with ones Nails: Where in all
their Lives they neither cut their Hair, nor
pare their Nails; and in another Place,
pare thoſe of the Right hand only, letting
the Left grow for Ornament and Bravery:
Where they ſuffer the Hair on the right ſide
to grow as long as it will, and ſhave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and in the neighb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring Provinces, ſome
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100899:99"/>
let their Hair grow long before, and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
ſhaving cloſe the reſt: Where Parents
let out their Children, and Husbands their
Wives, to their Gueſts to hire: Where a
man may get his own Mother with Child, and
Fathers make uſe of their own Daughters, or
their Sons, without Scandal or Offence:
Where, at their ſolemn Feaſts, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
lend their Children to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any conſideration of Nearneſs of
Blood. In one Place Men feed upon Humane
Fleſh, in another, 'tis reputed a charitable
Office for a Man to kill his Father at a certain
Age; and elſewhere, the Fathers diſpoſe of
their Children whilſt yet in their Mothers
Wombs, ſome to be preſerv'd and carefully
brought up, and others they proſcribe either
to be thrown off, or made away. Elſewhere
the old Husbands lend their Wives to Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and in another place they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
without offence; in one place parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
the Women take it for a mark of
Honour to have as many gay fring'd Taſſels at
the bottom of their Garment, as they have
lain with ſeveral men. Moreover has not
Cuſtom made a Republick of Women ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by themſelves? Has it not put Arms into
their Hands, made them to raiſe Armies, and
fight Battels? and does ſhe not by her own
Precept inſtruct the moſt ignorant Vulgar,
and make them perfect in things which all the
Philoſophy in the World could never beat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Heads of the wiſeſt men? For we know
entire Nations, Where Death was not only
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100899:99"/>
deſpis'd, but entertain'd with the greateſt
Triumph; where Children of ſeven years old
offer'd themſelves to be whip'd to death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
changing their Countenance; where Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were in ſuch Contempt, that the pooreſt
and moſt wretched Citizen would not have
deign'd to ſtoop to take up a Purſe of Crowns.
And we know Regions very fruitful in all
manner of Proviſions, where, notwithſtanding
the moſt ordinary Diet, and that they are
moſt pleas'd with, is only Bread, Creſſes, and
Water. Did not Cuſtom moreover work
that Miracle in <hi>Chios,</hi> that of ſeven hundred
Years it was never known that ever Maid or
Wife committed any act to the prejudice of
her Honour? To conclude; there is nothing
in my opinion, that ſhe does not, or may not
do; and therefore with very good reaſon it is,
that <hi>Pindar</hi> calls her the Queen, and Empreſs
of the World. He that was ſeen to beat his
Father, and reprov'd for ſo doing, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that it was the Cuſtom of their Family;
that in like manner his Father had beaten his
Grand-father, his Grand-father his great
Grand-father, and this, ſays he, pointing to
his Son, when he comes to my Age, ſhall beat
me. And the Father, whom the Son dragg'd
and hal'd along the ſtreets, commanded him to
ſtop at a certain Door, for he himſelf, he ſaid,
had dragg'd his Father no farther, that being
the utmoſt limit of the hereditary Inſolence
the Sons us'd to practiſe upon the Fathers in
their Family. It is as much by Cuſtom as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
(ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) that Women tear
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100899:100"/>
their Hair, bite their Nails, and eat Coals,
Chalk, and ſuch Traſh, and more by Cuſtom
than Nature, that men abuſe themſelves with
one another. The Laws of Conſcience, which
we pretend to be deriv'd from Nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Cuſtom; every one having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Veneration for the Opinions and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
approv'd and receiv'd amongſt his own
People, cannot without very great Reluctancy
depart from them, nor apply himſelf to them
without applauſe. In times paſt, when thoſe
of <hi>Creet</hi> would curſe any one, they pray'd the
Gods to engage them in ſome ill Cuſtom. But
the principal effect of the power of Cuſtom is,
ſo to ſeize and enſnare us, that it is hardly in
our power to diſengage our ſelves from its
gripe; or ſo to come to our ſelves, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of, and to weigh the things it enjoyns.
To ſay the Truth, by reaſon that we ſuck it in
with our Milk, and that the face of the World
preſents it ſelf in this poſture to our firſt ſight,
it ſeems as if we were born upon condition to
purſue this Practice; and the common Fancies
that we find in repute every where about us,
and infus'd into our Minds with the Seed of
our Fathers, appear to be moſt univerſal and
genuine. From whence it comes to paſs, that
whatever is off the hinge of Cuſtom, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
to be alſo off the hinges of Reaſon; and
how unreaſonably for the moſt part, God
knows. If, as we who ſtudy our ſelves, have
learn'd to do, every one who hears a good
Sentence, would immediately conſider how it
does any way touch his own private Concern,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100899:100"/>
every one would find, that it was not ſo much
a good Saying, as a ſevere Luſh to the ordinary
Beſtiality of his own Judgment: but men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Precepts and Admonitions of Truth,
as generally directed to the Common Sort,
and never particularly to themſelves; and
inſtead of applying them to their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
do only very ignorantly and unprofitably
commit them to memory, without ſuffering
themſelves to be at all inſtructed, or converted
by them: But let us return to the Empire of
Cuſtom. Such People as have been bred up to
Liberty, and ſubject to no other Dominion
but the authority of their own Will, every one
being a Sovereign to himſelf,<note place="margin">Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> or at leaſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by no wiſer Heads than there own, do
look upon all other Forms of Government as
monſtrous, and contrary to Nature. Thoſe
who are inur'd to Monarchy do the ſame;<note place="margin">Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> and
what opportunity ſoever Fortune preſents
them with to change, even then, when with
the greateſt difficulties they have diſengag'd
themſelves from one Maſter, that was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
and grievous to them, they preſently
run, with the ſame difficulties, to create ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
being not able, how roughly dealt
with ſoever, to hate the Government they
were born under, and the obedience they have
ſo long been accuſtom'd to. 'Tis by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and perſwaſion of Cuſtom, that every
one is content with the place where he is
planted by Nature; and the <hi>High-landers</hi> of
<hi>Scotland</hi> no more pant after the better Air of
<hi>Tourain,</hi> than the ſtarv'd <hi>Scythian</hi> after the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100899:101"/>
delightful Fields of <hi>Theſſaly. Darius</hi> asking
certain <hi>Greeks</hi> what they would take to aſſume
the Cuſtom of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of eating the dead
Corps of their Fathers, (for that was their
Uſe, believing they could not give them a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor more noble Sepulture, than to bury
them in their own Bodies) they made anſwer,
That nothing in the World ſhould hire them
to do it; but having alſo tryed to perſuade
the <hi>Indians</hi> to leave their barbarous Cuſtom,
and after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner, to burn the Bodies
of their Fathers, they conceiv'd a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
horrour at the motion. Every one does
the ſame, for as much as Uſe veils from us the
true Aſpect of things.</p>

            <p>Taking upon me once to juſtifie ſomething

abſolute Authority for a great many Leagues
round about us, and not content, as men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do, to eſtabliſh it only by force of Law,
and Example, but enquiring ſtill farther into
its Original, I found the foundation ſo weak,
that I who made it my buſineſs to confirm
others, was very near being diſſatisfy'd my
ſelf. 'Tis by this Receipt that <hi>Plato</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to cure this unnatural and prepoſterous
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100899:101"/>
Love of his Time, which he eſteems of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Virtue; namely That the publick Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condemns them; That the Poets, and all
other ſorts of Writers, relate horrible Stories
of them. A <hi>Recipe,</hi> by virtue of which the
moſt beautiful Daughters no more allure their
Fathers Luſt; nor Brothers of the fineſt Shape
and Faſhion their Siſters deſire. The very
Fables of <hi>Thyeſtes, Oedypus,</hi> and <hi>Macareus,</hi>
having with the Harmony of their Song infus'd
this wholeſome Opinion and Belief into the
tender Brains of Infants. Chaſtity is in truth a
great and ſhining Vertue, and of which the Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is ſufficiently known; but to govern, and
prevail with it according to Nature, is as hard,
as 'tis eaſie to do it according to Cuſtom, and
the Laws and precepts of ſober Practice. The
original and fundamental Reaſons are of very
obſcure and difficult ſearch, and our Maſters
either lightly paſs them over, or not daring
ſo much as to touch them, precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Liberty and Protection of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom;
ſuch as will not ſuffer themſelves to be
withdrawn from this original Source, do yet
commit a greater Error, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to wild and beaſtly Opinions; witneſs
<hi>Chryſippus,</hi> who in ſo many of his Writings
has ſtrew'd the little Account he made of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
Conjunctions committed with how
near Relations ſoever. Whoever would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
himſelf from this violent Prejudice of
Cuſtom, would find ſeveral things receiv'd
with abſolute and undoubting Opinion, that
have no other Support than the hoary Head
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100899:102"/>
and rivell'd Face of ancient Uſe; and things
being referr'd to the Deciſion of Truth and
Reaſon, he will find his Judgment convinc'd
and overthrown, and yet reſtor'd to a much
more ſure Eſtate. For Example, I ſhall ask
him, what can be more ſtrange than to ſee of
People oblig'd to obey and pay a Reverence to
Laws they never underſtood, and to be bound
in all their Affairs, both of private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Concern, as Marriages, Donations, Wills,
Sales, and Purchaſes, to Rules they cannot
poſſibly know, being neither writ nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
in their own Language, and of which
they are of Neceſſity to purchaſe both the
Interpretation and the Uſe? Not according to
the ingenious Opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd
his King to make the Trafficks and Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triations
of his Subjects, free, frank, and of
Profit to them, and their Quarrels and Debates
burdenſom, and tart, and loaden with heavy
Impoſitions and Penalties; but by a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Opinion to make Sale of Reaſon it ſelf,
and to allow the Law a courſe of Traffick. I
I think my ſelf oblig'd to Fortune that (as our
Hiſtorians report) it was a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> Gentleman,
a Country-man of mine, who firſt oppos'd
<hi>Charlemain,</hi> when he attempted to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us Latin and Imperial Laws. What can
be more ſevere or unjuſt, than to ſee a Nation,
where, by lawful Cuſtom, the Office of a Judge
is to be bought and ſold, where Judgments
are paid for with ready Money, and where
Juſtice may legally be denied to him that has
not wherewithal to pay; a Merchandize in ſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100899:102"/>
great Repute, as in a Government to ſerve a
fourth Eſtate of wrangling Lawyers, to add
to the three ancient ones of the Church, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and People; which fourth Eſtate, having
the Laws in their hands, and ſovereign Power
over Mens Lives and Fortunes, make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeparate Body of Nobility: from whence
it comes to paſs, that there are double Laws,
thoſe of Honour, and thoſe of Juſtice, in many
things poſitively oppoſite to one another; the
Nobles as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gorouſly condemning a <hi>Lye</hi> taken,
as the other do a <hi>Lye</hi> reveng'd: By the Law
of Arms, he ſhall be degraded from all Nobility
and Honour who puts up an Affront; and by
the Civil Law, he who vindicates his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Revenge incurs a Capital Puniſhment:
who applies himſelf to the Law for Reparation
of an Offence done to his Honour, diſgraces
himſelf; and who does not, is cenſur'd and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
by the Law. Yet of theſe two ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things, both of them referring to one Head,
the one has the Charge of Peace, the other of
War; thoſe have the Profit, theſe the Honour;
thoſe the Wiſdom, theſe the Vertue; thoſe the
Word, theſe the Action; thoſe Juſtice, theſe
Valour; thoſe Reaſon, theſe Force; thoſe the <hi>long
Robe,</hi> theſe the ſhort divided betwixt them.</p>
            <p>For what concerns indifferent things, as
Cloaths, who would debauch them from their
true and real uſe, which is the Bodies Service
and Convenience, and upon which their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal

Theſe Conſiderations notwithſtanding

Man to decline the common Mode; but on
the contrary, methinks all ſingular and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Faſhions are rather marks of Folly and
vain Affectation, than of ſound Reaſon, and that
a wiſeman ought within to withdraw and retire
his Soul from the Crowd, and there keep it at
Liberty, and in power to Judge freely of
things; but as to this outward Garb and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
abſolutely to follow and conform
himſelf to the Faſhion of the Time. Publick
Society has nothing to do with our Thoughts,
but the reſt, as our Actions, our Labours, our
Fortunes and our Lives, we are to lend and
abandon them to the common Opinion and
Publick Service, as did that good and great
<hi>Socrates</hi> who refus'd to preſerve his Life by a
Diſobedience to the Magiſtrate, though a very
wicked and unjuſt one: for it is the Rule of
Rules, and the general Law of Laws, that
every one obſerve thoſe of the Place wherein
he lives.

Simplicity, Obedience, and Example for his

ſo many Battles both by Land and Sea? And
after having ſettled the Univerſal Peace of the
whole World, ſhall this man be pardoned,
who has conſpired not only to Murther, but
to Sacrifice me? For the Conſpiracy was to
kill him at Sacrifice. After which, remaining
for ſome time ſilent, he re-begun louder, and
ſtraining his Voice more than before to exclaim
againſt himſelf, and ſay, Why liv'ſt thou? If
it be for the good of many that thou ſhould'ſt
Die? muſt there be no end of thy Revenges

<hi>Cinna</hi> is convict, forgive him, he will never
henceforth have the Heart to hurt thee, and it
will be an Act of Glory. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was glad
that he had met with an Advocate of his own
Humour; wherefore, having thank'd his
Wife, and in the Morning countermanded
his Friends he had before ſummon'd to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
he commanded <hi>Cinna</hi> all alone to be
brought to him; who being accordingly come,
and a Chair by his Appointment ſet him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commanded every one out of the Room,
he ſpake to him after this manner: In the firſt
place, <hi>Cinna,</hi> I demand of thee patient Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
do not interrupt me in what I am about
to ſay, and I will afterwards give thee Time
and Leiſure to anſwer. Thou know'ſt, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
that having taken thee Priſoner in the
Enemies Camp, and that an Enemy not only
made, but born ſo, I gave thee thy Life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
thee all thy Goods, and finally put thee
in ſo good a poſture, by my Bounty of living
well and at thy eaſe, that the Victorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
the Conquer'd. The Sacerdotal Office
which thou mad'ſt Suit to me for, I conferr'd
upon thee, after having deny'd it to others,
whoſe Fathers have ever born Arms in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
and after ſo many Obligations thou haſt
undertaken to kill me. At which <hi>Cinna</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, that he was very far from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any ſo wicked a Thought; Thou doſt not
keep thy Promiſe, <hi>Cinna,</hi> (continued <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>)
that thou would ſt not interrupt me.
Yes, thou haſt undertaken to murther me in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100899:110"/>
ſuch a Place, ſuch a Day, in ſuch and ſuch
Company, and in ſuch a Manner. At which
Words ſeeing <hi>Cinna</hi> aſtoniſh'd and ſilent, not
upon the Account of his Promiſe ſo to be, but
interdict with the Conſcience of his Crime;
Why, proceeded <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to what end
would'ſt thou do it? Is it to be Emperour?
Believe me, the Republick is in a very ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
if I am the only Man betwixt thee and
the Empire. Thou art not able ſo much as to
defend thy own Houſe, and but t'other day
waſt baffled in a Suit, by the oppos'd Intereſt
of a mean manumitted Slave. What, haſt
thou neither Means nor Power in any other
thing, but only to attempt againſt <hi>Caeſar?</hi> I
quit claim to the Empire, if there is no other
but I to obſtruct thy Hopes. Can'ſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that <hi>Paulus,</hi> that <hi>Fabius,</hi> that the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
and <hi>Servilians,</hi> and ſo many Noble <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
not only ſo in Title, but who by their
Virtue honour their Nobility, would ſuffer
or endure thee? After this, and a great deal
more that he ſaid to him, (for he was two
long Hours in ſpeaking) Well, <hi>Cinna,</hi> go thy
way, ſaid he, I again give thee that Life in
the Quality of a Traytor and a Parricide,
which I once before gave thee in the Quality
of an Enemy. Let Friendſhip from this time
forward begin betwixt us, and let us try to
make it appear whether I have given, or thou
haſt receiv'd thy Life with the better Faith;
and ſo departed from him. Some time after,
he preferr'd him to the Conſular Dignity,
complaining, that he had not the Confidence
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100899:110"/>
to demand it; had him ever after for his very
great Friend, and was at laſt made by him
ſole Heir to all his Eſtate. Now from the
time of this Accident, which befell <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
in the fortieth Year of his Age, he never had
any Conſpiracy or Attempt againſt him, and
therein reap'd the due Reward of this his ſo
generous and exemplary Clemency. But it
did not ſo well ſucceed with our Prince in the
former Story, his Moderation and Mercy not
being ſufficient ſo to ſecure him, that he did
not afterwards fall into the toils of the like
Treaſon, ſo vain and frivolous a thing is Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Prudence; and in ſpight of all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Counſels, and Precautions, Fortune
will ſtill be Miſtreſs of Events. We repute
Phyſicians fortunate when they hit upon a luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky
Cure, as if there was no other Art but
theirs that could not ſtand upon its own Legs,
and whoſe Foundations are too weak to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
its ſelf upon its own Baſis, and as if no
other Art ſtood in need of Fortunes Hand to
aſſiſt in its Operations. For my part, I think
of Phyſick as much good or ill as any one
would have me: for, Thanks be to God, we
have no great Traffick together. I am of a quite
contrary Humour to other men, for I always
deſpiſe it; but when I am ſick, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting,
or entring into Compoſition with it,
I begin yet more to hate, nauſeate, and fear
it, telling them who importune me to enter
into a courſe of Phyſick, that they muſt give
me time to recover my Strength and Health,
that I may be the better able to ſupport and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100899:111"/>
encounter the violence and danger of the Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo that I ſtill let Nature work, ſuppoſing her
to be ſufficiently arm'd with Teeth and Claw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to defend her ſelf from the Aſſaults of Infirmity,
and to uphold that Contexture, the Diſſolution
of which ſhe flies and abhors: for I am afraid,
leaſt inſtead of Aſſiſting her when grappled,
and ſtrugling with the Diſeaſe, I ſhould Aſſiſt
her Adverſary, and procure new Work, and
new Accidents to encounter. Now I ſay,
that not in Phyſick only, but in other more
certain Arts, Fortune has a very great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and ſhare. The Poetick Raptures, and
thoſe prodigious flights of Fancy, that raviſh
and tranſport the Author out of himſelf, why
ſhould we not atrribute them to his good
Fortune, ſince the Poet himſelf confeſſes they
exceed his Sufficiency and Force, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
them to proceed from ſomething elſe
than himſelf, and has them no more in his
Power than the Orators ſay they have thoſe
extraordinary Motions and Agitations that
ſometimes puſh them beyond their Deſign. It
is the ſame in Painting, where Touches ſhall
ſometimes ſlip from the hand of the Painter,
ſo ſurpaſſing both his Fancy and his Art, as to
beget his own Admiration. But Fortune does
yet more accidentally manifeſt the ſhare ſhe has
in all things of this kind, by the Graces and
Elegancies are found out in them, not only
beyond the Intention, but even without the
Knowledge of the Artiſt. A judicious Reader
does often find out in other Mens Writings,
other kind of Perfections, and finds in them a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100899:111"/>
better Sence and more queint Expreſſion than
the Author himſelf either intended or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
And, as to military Enterprizes and
Executions, every one ſees how great a hand
Fortune has in all thoſe Affairs; even in our
very Counſels and Deliberations there muſt
certainly be ſomething of Chance and good
Luck mix'd with Humane Prudence, for all
that our Wiſdom can do alone is no great
matter; the more piercing, quick, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
it is, the weaker ii finds it ſelf, and is
by ſo much more apt to miſtruſt its own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
I am of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Opinion, and when I
moſt ſtrictly and nearer hand examine the moſt
glorious Exploits of War, I perceive, me
thinks, that thoſe who carry them on, make
uſe of Counſel and Debate only for Cuſtoms
ſake, and leave the beſt part of the Enterprize
to Fortune, and relying upon her Favour and
Aſſiſtance, tranſgreſs at every turn the Bounds
of Military Conduct, and the Rules of War.
There happen ſometimes accidental Alacrities
and ſtrange Furies in their Deliberations, that
for the moſt part prompt them to follow the
worſt, and worſt grounded Counſels, and
that ſwell their Courag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s beyond the Limits of
Reaſon: from whence it falls out, that many
great Captains,<note place="margin">Monluc <hi>in his</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentariſſe.</note> to juſtifie thoſe temerarious
Deliberations, have been forc'd to tell their
Souldiers, that they were by ſome Inſpiration
and good <hi>Omen</hi> encourag'd and invited to ſuch
Attempts. Wherefore, in this Doubt and
Uncertainty that the ſhort-ſightedneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wiſdom to ſee and chooſe the beſt, (by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100899:112"/>
reaſon of the Difficulties that the various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and Circumſtances of things bring
along with them) does perplex us withall,
the ſureſt way in my Opinion, did no other
Conſideration invite us to it, were to pitch
upon that wherein is the greateſt Appearance
of Honeſty and Juſtice, and not being certain
of the ſhorteſt, to go the ſtraighteſt and moſt
direct way; as in theſe two Examples I have
before laid down; there is no queſtion to be
made but it was more noble and generous in
him who had receiv'd the Offence, to pardon
it, as they both did, than to do otherwiſe,
and if the former miſcarried in it, he is not
nevertheleſs to be blam'd for his good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
neither does any one know if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
otherwiſe, whether by that means he
had avoided the end his Deſtiny had appointed
for him; and he had however loſt the Glory of
ſo generous an Act. You will find in Hiſtory,
many who have been in this apprehenſion,
that the moſt part have taken the courſe to
meet, and prevent Conſpiracies by Puniſhment
and Revenge; but I find but very few who
have reap'd any Advantage by this proceeding;
witneſs ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
finds himſelf in this danger, ought not to
expect much either from his Vigilancy or
Power; for how hard a thing is it for a man
to ſecure himſelf from an Enemy, who lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
under the countenance of the moſt offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Friend we have, and to diſcover and know
the Wills and inward Thoughts of thoſe who
are continually doing us ſervice? 'Tis to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100899:112"/>
much purpoſe to have a Guard of Strangers
about a man's Perſon, and to be always ſenced
about with a Pale of armed men; whoſoever
deſpiſes his own Life, is always Maſter of that
of another man. And moreover, this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
ſuſpicion, that makes a Prince jealous of
all the World, muſt of neceſſity be a ſtrange
Torment to him, and therefore it was, that
<hi>Dion,</hi> being advertis'd that <hi>Calippus</hi> watch'd
all opportunities to take away his Life, had
never the Heart to enquire more particularly
into it, ſaying, That he had rather die, than
live in that miſery that he muſt continually
ſtand upon his Guard, not only againſt his
Enemies, but his Friends alſo; which <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
much more lively manifeſted in effect,
when having notice by a Letter from <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
that <hi>Philip,</hi> his moſt beloved Phyſician, was by
<hi>Darius</hi> his money corrupted to poyſon him,
at the ſame time that he gave the Letter to
<hi>Philip</hi> to read, ſup'd of the Potion he had
brought him. Was not this by ſuch a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to expreſs, that if his Friends had a mind
to diſpatch him out of the World, he was
willing to give them opportunity to do it?
This Prince is indeed the Sovereign Preſident
of all hazardous Actions; but I do not know
whether there be another paſſage in his Life
wherein there is ſo much ſteadineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
as in this, nor ſo illuſtrious an Image of
the greatneſs of his Mind. Thoſe who preach
to Prices ſo circumſpect and vigilant a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
and diſtruſt, under colour of Security,
preach to them ruine and diſhonour. Nothing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100899:113"/>
Noble can ever be perform'd without Danger.
I know a Perſon, naturally of a very great
daring and enterprizing Courage, whoſe good
fortune is continually prevented, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd
by ſuch perſwaſions, that he muſt retire
into the groſs of his own Body, and keep thoſe
he knows are his Friends continually about
him, that he muſt not hearken to any Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with his ancient Enemies, that he
muſt ſtand off, and not truſt his Perſon in
hands ſtronger than his own, what promiſes
or offers ſoever they may make him, or what
advantages ſoever he may ſee before him. And
I know another, who has unexpectedly made
his Fortune by following a contrary Advice.
Courage, the Reputation and Glory of which
men ſeek with ſo greedy an Appetite, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
and ſets it ſelf out when need requires,
as magnificently in Querpo, as in the neateſt
Arms, in a Cloſet, as Well as a Camp; and
this overcircumſpect and wary Prudence is a

'Tis an excellent way to gain the Heart, and
conquer the Will of another, to go ſubmit,
and intruſt a man's Perſon to him, provided
it appear to be frankly done, and without
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100899:114"/>
the conſtraint of neceſſity, and in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that a man manifeſtly does it out of a
pure and entire confidence in the Party, at
leaſt with a Countenance clear from any Cloud
of ſuſpicion. I ſaw, when I was a Boy, a
Gentleman, who was Governour of a great
City, upon occaſion of a Popular Commotion
and Fury, not knowing what other courſe to
take, go out of a Place of very great Strength
and Security, and commit himſelf to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the ſeditious Rabble, in hopes by that
means to appeaſe the Tumult before it grew
to a more formidable Head: but it was ill for
him that he did ſo, for he was there miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſlain. But I am not nevertheleſs of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he committed ſo great an Errour in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, as Men commonly reproach this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
withal, as he did in chooſing a gentle
and ſubmiſſive way for the effecting his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and in endeavouring to quiet this ſtorm,
rather by obeying than commanding, and by
Entreaty rather than Remonſtrance; and am
inclin'd to believe, that a gracious Severity,
with a Souldier-like way of commanding, full
of Security, and confidence ſuitable to the
Quality of his Perſon; and the Dignity of his
Command, would have ſucceeded better with
him; at leaſt, he had periſh'd with greater
Decency and Reputation. There is nothing
ſo little to be expected, or hop'd for from this
many-headed Monſter, when ſo incens'd, as
Humanity and good Nature; it is much more
capable of Reverence and Fear. I ſhould alſo
reproach him, that having taken a Reſolution
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100899:114"/>
(in my Judgment rather brave than raſh) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf weak and naked in this tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sea of enraged Franticks; he ought boldly
to have ſtem'd the Current, and to have born
himſelf bravely aloft; whereas coming to
diſcover his Danger nearer hand, and his
Noſe thereupon happning to bleed, he again
chang'd that demiſs and fawning Countenance
he had at firſt put on, into another of Fear
and Amazement, and filling both his Voice
and Eyes with Entreaties and Tears, and in
that Poſture endeavouring to withdraw and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Perſon, that Carriage more enflam'd
their Fury, and ſoon brought the Effects of it
upon him. It was upon a time in a certain
Place order'd by ſome, who had no very good
Meaning in it, that there ſhould be a general
Muſter of ſeveral Troops in Arms (for that is
the moſt proper Scene of ſcecret Revenges, and
there is no Place where they can be executed
with greater Safety) and there were publick
and manifeſt Appearances, that there was no
ſafe coming for ſome, whoſe principal and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Office it was to view them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a Conſultation was call'd, and ſeveral
Counſels were propos'd, as in a caſe that was
very nice, and of great Difficulty; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
of important conſequence. Mine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, was, that they ſhould by all
means avoid giving any ſign of Suſpicion, but
that the Officers who were moſt in danger
ſhould boldly go, and with cheerful and erect
Countenances ride boldly and confidently tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the Files and Diviſions, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100899:115"/>
of ſparing Fire (which the Counſels of
the major part tended to) they ſhould entreat
the Captains to command the Souldiers to
give round and full Volleys in Honour of the
Spectators, and not to ſpare their Powder:
which was accordingly done, and ſerv'd to
ſo good uſe, as to pleaſe and gratifie the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Troops, and thenceforward to beget a
mutual and wholeſome Confidence and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
amongſt them. I look upon <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
way of winning Men to him as the beſt,
and moſt plauſible, that can poſſibly be put in
practice. Firſt, he try'd by Clemency to make
himſelf belov'd even by his very Enemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himſelf in detected Conſpiracies, only
publickly to declare, that he was pre-acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them; which being done, he took a
noble Reſolution to expect, without Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or Fear, whatever might be the Event,
wholly reſigning up himſelf to the Protection
of the Gods and Fortune: for queſtionleſs in
this very Eſtate he was at the time when he was
kill'd. A Stranger having publickly ſaid, that
he could teach <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſa</hi>
an infallible way to find out and diſcover all
the Conſpiracies his Subjects ſhould contrive
againſt him, if he would give him a good Sum
of Money for his Pains: <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> hearing of
it, caus'd the Man to be brought to him, that
he might learn an Art ſo neceſſary to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
and having ask'd him by what
Art he might make ſuch Diſcoveries, the
Fellow made Anſwer, That all the Art
he knew, was, That he ſhould give him a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100899:115"/>
Talent, and afterwards boaſt that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a ſingular Secret from him. <hi>Dionyſius</hi>
lik'd the Invention, and accordingly caus'd fix
hundred Crowns to be counted out to him.
It was not likely he ſhould give ſo great a
Sum to a Perſon unknown, but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſome extraordinary Diſcovery, the
belief of which ſerv'd to keep his Enemies in
awe. Princes however do very wiſely, to
publiſh the Informations they receive of all
the Practices againſt their Lives, to poſſeſs
men with an opinion they have ſo good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and ſo many Spies abroad, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be plotted againſt them, but they
have preſent notice of it. The Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
did a great many ridiculous things to
eſtabliſh his new Tyranny over <hi>Florence:</hi> but
this eſpecially was moſt remarkable, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd the firſt intimation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
the People were hatching againſt
him, by <hi>Mattheo di Moroſo,</hi> one of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
he preſently put him to death, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
that Rumour, that it might not be
thought any of the City diſlik'd his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

continual Searches were every day made for

ſuch a kind of Life, and how much better it
was for him to die once for all, than to be
perpetually at this paſs, he ſtarted from his Seat
himſelf, call'd them back, ſhew'd them his

their Cruelty, by that means to free both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

not. become more quick and ſpritely, and
that a groſs and vulgar underſtanding ſhould
yet inhabit there without correcting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
it ſelf, where all the Diſcourſes, and
Judgments of the greateſt Wits the World e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had, are collected, and ſtor'd up, I am yet
to ſeek. To admit ſo many ſtrange Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo great and ſo high Fancies, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
(as a young Lady, and one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100899:117"/>
Princeſſes of the Kingdom, ſaid to me
once) that a man's own be crowded, and
ſqueez'd together into a leſs compaſs, to
make room for the other. I ſhould be apt to
conclude, that as Plants are ſuffocated, and
drown'd with too much nouriſhment, and
Lamps with too much Oyl, ſo is the active
part of the Underſtanding with too much ſtudy
and Matter, which being embaraſs'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the diverſity of things, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Force and Power to diſengage it
ſelf; and that by the preſſure of this weight, it
is bow'd, ſubjected, and rendred of no uſe.
But it is quite otherwiſe, for a Soul ſtretches
and dilates it ſelf proportionably as it fills.
And in the Examples of elder times, we ſee
quite contrary, men very proper for publick
Buſineſs, great Captains, and great States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
very Learned withall; whereas the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
a ſort of men retir'd from all Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, have been, ſometimes alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd,
and render'd contemptible by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
liberty of their own Times; their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſingularity of Manners, making them
appear to men of another method of living,
ridiculous and abſurd. Would you make
them Judges of a Controverſie of common
Right, or of the Actions of Men? they are
ready to take it upon them, and ſtraight begin
to examine, if he has Life, if he has Motion,
if Man be any other than an Oxe? What it is
to do, and to ſuffer? and what Animals Law
and Juſtice are? Do they ſpeak of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
'tis with a rude, irreverent, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100899:117"/>
liberty. Do they hear a Prince, or a
King commended for his Vertue, they make
no more of him, than of a Shepherd, Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
or Neat-herd; a lazy <hi>Corydon,</hi> that
buſies himſelf only about milking, and ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Herds and Flocks, and that after the
rudeſt manner. Do you repute any man the
greater for being Lord of two thouſand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
of Land? they laugh at ſuch a pitiful Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as laying claim themſelves to the
whole World for their poſſeſſion. Do you
boaſt of your Nobility and Blood, for being
deſcended from ſeven rich ſucceſſive Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors?
they will look upon you with an eye of
Contempt, as men who have not a right Idea
of the Univerſal Image of Nature, and that do
not conſider how many Predeceſſors every
one of us has had, Rich, Poor, Kings, Slaves,
Greeks, and Barbarians. And though you
were the fiftieth deſcent from <hi>Hercules,</hi> they
look upon it as a great vanity, ſo highly to
value this, which is only a gift of Fortune.
And even ſo did the Vulgar ſort of men nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeare
them, as men ignorant of the beginning
of things, where all things were common,
accuſing them of Preſumption and Inſolence.
But this <hi>Platonick</hi> Picture is far different from
that theſe Pedants are preſented by: For
thoſe were envied for raiſing themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the common ſort of men, for deſpiſing
the ordinary Actions and Offices of Life, for
having aſſum'd a particular and inimitable
way of living, and for uſing a certain Method

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100899:118"/>
from the ordinary way of ſpeaking:

inſomuch, that <hi>Empedocles</hi> refus'd the Royalty
that the <hi>Agrigentines</hi> offer'd to him. <hi>Thales,</hi>
once inveighing in Diſcourſe againſt the Pains

that he did like the Fox, who found fault with

had a mind, for the Jeſt's ſake, to ſhew them
to the contrary; and having upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for once made a muſter of all his Wits,
wholly to employ them in the Service of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
he ſet a Traffick on foot, which in one
Year brought him in ſo great Riches, that the
moſt experienc'd in that Trade could hardly
in their whole Lives, with all their Induſtry,
have rak'd ſo much together. That which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reports of ſome who ſaid of him,
<hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and others of their Profeſſion,
that they were wiſe but not prudent, in not
applying their Study to more profitable things
(though I do not well digeſt this nice Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100899:119"/>
that will not however ſerve to excuſe my
Pedantick ſort of Men, for to ſee the low and
neceſſitous Fortune wherewith they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
we have rather Reaſon to pronounce
that they are neither wiſe, nor prudent. But
letting this firſt Reaſon alone, I think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſay, that this Inconvenience proceeds
from their applying themſelves the wrong
way to the Study of Sciences; and that after
the manner we are inſtructed, it is no wonder
if neither the Scholars nor the Maſters become,
though more learned, ever the wiſer, or
more fit for Buſineſs. In plain Truth, the
Cares and Expence our Parents are at in out
Education, point at nothing, but to furniſh
our Heads with Knowledge; but not a Word
of Judgment and Vertue. Cry out of one

Birds who fly abroad to forage for Grain,

underſtand others, nor themſelves; and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100899:122"/>
that their Memories are full enough, 'tis

profeſſion, than that of mere Learning only,
and in that, in my opinion, the greateſt man
that has been theſe thouſand years, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of his Gown, and a little exteriour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
that could not be civiliz'd to the Garb,
which are nothing; and I hate our People,
who can worſe endure a Pedantick Mode, than
an ill contriv'd Mind, and take their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
by the Leg a man makes, by his behaviour
and ſo much as the very faſhion of his Boots,
what a kind of man he is. For within all
this, there was not a more illuſtrious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Soul living upon Earth. I have often
purpoſely put him upon Arguments quite
wide of his Profeſſion, wherein I found he
had ſo clear an inſight, ſo quick an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſo ſolid a Judgment: that a man
would have thought he had never practis'd
any other thing but Arms, and been all his
life enploy'd in Affairs of State. And theſe
are great and vigorous Natures.</p>

of a Pedantick Education. But it is not
enough that our Education does not ſpoil us;
it muſt moreover alter us for the better. Some
of our Parliaments, when they are to admit

that it is no ſo great wonder, as they make of
it, that our Anceſtors had Letters in no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Eſteem, and that even to this day, they
are but rarely met with in the Privy Councils
of Princes; and if this End and Deſign of
acquiring Riches (which is the only thing we
propoſe to our ſelves, by the means of Law,
Phyſick, Pedantry, and even Divinity it ſelf)
did not uphold, and keep them in credit, you
would without doubt ſee them as poor and

they ceaſe to be good. All other knowledge

glanc'd upon but now, may it not alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from hence, that our Study, having
almoſt no other Aim, but Profit, fewer of
thoſe, who by Nature are born to Offices and
Employments, rather of Glory than Gain,
addict themſelves to Letters; or for ſo little
a while (being taken from their Studies before
they can come to have any taſte of them, to a
Proſeſſion that has nothing to do with Books)
that there ordinarily remain no other to apply
themſelves wholly to Learning, but People of
mean Condition, who in that only ſtudy to
live, and have Preferment only in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
and by ſuch People, whoſe Souls are
both by Nature, and Education, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Example, of the baſeſt Metal and Allay,
the Fruits of Knowledge are both immaturely
gathered, ill-digeſted, and deliver'd to their
Pupils quite another thing. For it is not for
Knowledge to enlighten a Soul that is dark of
it ſelf; nor to make a blind man to ſee. Her
Buſineſſ is not to find a man Eyes, but to
guide, govern, and direct his ſteps, provided
he have ſound Feet, and ſtraight Legs to go
upon. Knowledge is an excellent Drug, but
no Drug has virtue enough to preſerve it ſelf
from Corruption and Decay, if the Veſſel be
tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep.
Such a one may have a Sight clear and good
enough, who looks a ſquint, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſees what is good, but does not follow it,
and ſees Knowledge, but makes no uſe of it.

that <hi>Xenophon</hi> attributes to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> we
find, that they taught their Children Vertue,
as other Nations do Letters. <hi>Plato</hi> tells us,
that the eldeſt Son in their Royal Succeſſion,
was thus brought up; ſo ſoon as he was born
he was deliver'd, not to Women, but to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
of the greateſt Authority about their
Kings for their Vertue, whoſe Charge it was
to keep his Body healthful, and in good plight;
and after he came to ſeven Years of Age, to
teach him to ride, and to go a Hunting: when
he arriv'd at fourteen he was transferr'd into
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100899:125"/>
the hands of four, the wiſeſt, the moſt juſt,
the moſt temperate, and moſt valiant of the
Nation; of which, the firſt was to inſtruct
him in Religion, the ſecond to be always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and ſincere, the third to conquer his
Appetites and Deſires, and the fourth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
all Danger. 'Tis a thing worthy of
very great Conſideration, that in that excellent,
and, in truth, for its Perfection, prodigious
form, and civil Regiment ſet down by <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
though ſollicitous of the Education of
Children, as a thing of the greateſt Concern,
and even in the very Seat of the Muſes, he
ſhould make ſo little mention of Learning; as
if their generous Youth, diſdaining all other
Subjection, but that of Vertue only, ought to
be ſupply'd, inſtead of Tutors to read to them
Arts and Sciences, with ſuch Maſters, as ſhould
only inſtruct them in Valour, Prudence, and
Juſtice. An Example that <hi>Plato</hi> has followed
in his Laws; the manner of whoſe Diſcipline
was to propound to them Queſtions upon the
Judgment of Men, and of their Actions; and if
they commended or condemned this or that
Perſon, or Fact, they were to give a Reaſon
for ſo doing: by which means they at once
ſharp'ned their Underſtanding, and became
skillful in the Laws. <hi>Mandane,</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi>
asking her Son <hi>Cyrus</hi> how he would do to learn
Juſtice, and the other Vertues amongſt the
<hi>Medes,</hi> having left all his Maſters behind him
in <hi>Perſia?</hi> He made Anſwer, That he had
learn'd thoſe things long ſince; that his Maſter
had often made him a Judge of the Differences
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100899:125"/>
amongſt his School-Fellows, and had one day
whip'd him for giving a wrong Sentence; and
thus it was. A great Boy in the School, having
a little ſhort. Caſſock, by force took a longer
from another that was not ſo tall as he, and
gave him his own in exchange: whereupon,
I being appointed Judge of the Controverſie,
gave Judgment, That I thought it beſt either
of them ſhould keep the Coat he had, for that
they both of them were better fitted with that
of one another than with their own: upon
which, my Maſter told me, I had done ill, in
that I had only conſider'd the Fitneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of the Garments, whereas I ought to
have conſider'd the Juſtice of the thing, which
requires that no one ſhould have any thing
forcibly taken from him that is his own. But

of Action, in lively forming and
moulding them; not only by Words and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,

the end it might not be a Knowledge of the

and not an Acquiſition, but a natural Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
One asking to this Purpoſe, <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi>
what he thought moſt proper for Boys to
learn? What they ought to do when they come
to be Men, ſaid he. It is therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if ſuch an Inſtitution have produc'd ſo
admirable Effects. They us'd to go, 'tis ſaid, in
the other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> to enquire out Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians,
Painters, and Muſick-Maſters; but in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon</hi>
Legiſlators, Magiſtrates, and Generals of
Armies; at <hi>Athens</hi> they learnt to ſpeak well, and
here to do well; there to diſengage themſelves
from a ſophiſtical Argument, and to unravel
Syllogiſms, here to evade the Baits and Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Pleaſure, and with a noble Courage
and Reſolution to confute and conquer the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces
of Fortune and Death; thoſe cudgell'd
their Brains about Words, theſe made it their
Buſineſs to enquire into things; there was an
eternal Babble of the Tongue, here a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Exerciſe of the Soul. And therefore it is
nothing ſtrange, if, when <hi>Antipater</hi> demanded
of them fifty Children for Hoſtages, they
made Anſwer, quite contrary to what we
ſhould do, That they would rather give him
twice as many full grown Men, ſo much did
they value the loſs of their Country's Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> courted <hi>Xenophon</hi> to ſend
his Children to <hi>Sparta</hi> to be bred, It is not,
ſaid he, there to learn Logick or Rhetorick,
but to be inſtructed in the nobleſt of all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
namely, the Science to Obey, and to
Command. It is very pleaſant to ſee <hi>Socrates,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:100899:126"/>
after his manner, rallying <hi>Hippias,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
to him what a World of Money he has
got, eſpecially in certain little Villages of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> by teaching School, and that he got
never a Penny at <hi>Sparta.</hi> What a Sottiſh and
ſtupid People (ſays <hi>Socrates</hi>) are they, without
Senſe or Underſtanding, that make no Account
either of Grammar, or Poetry, and only buſie
themſelves in ſtudying the Genealogies and
Succeſſions of their Kings, the Foundations,
Riſes, and Declenſions of States, and ſuch
Tales of a Tub! After which, having made
<hi>Hippias</hi> particularly to acknowledge the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their Form of Publick Adminiſtration,
and the Felicity and Vertue of their Private
Life, he leaves him to gueſs at the Concluſion
he makes of the Inutilities of his Pedantick
Arts. Examples have Demonſtrated to us,
that in Military Affairs, and all others of the
like Active Nature, the Study of Sciences does
more ſoften and untemper the Courages of
Men, that any way fortifie and incite them.
The moſt Potent Empire, that at this Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

The indiſcreet Scriblers of our Times, who
amongſt their laborious Nothings, inſert
whole Sections, Paragraphs, and Pages, out
of Ancient Authors, with a Deſign by that
means to illuſtrate their own Writings, do
quite contrary; for this infinite Diſſimilitude
of Ornaments renders the Complexions of
their own Compoſitions, ſo pale, ſallow and
deform'd, that they loſe much more than
they get. The Philoſophers, <hi>Chryſippus</hi> and
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> were, in this, of too quite contrary
Humours; for the firſt did not only in his
Books mix the Paſſages and Sayings of other
Authors, but entire Pieces, and in one the
whole <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides;</hi> which gave <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
occaſion to ſay, That ſhould a Man pick
out of his Writings all that was none of his,
he would leave him nothing but blank Paper:
whereas the latter, quite contrary, in three
hundred Volumes that he left behind him,
has not ſo much as any one Quotation. I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the other day upon this Piece of Fortune;
I was reading a <hi>French</hi> Book, where after I
had a long time run dreaming over a great
many Words, ſo dull, ſo inſipid, ſo void of
all Wit, or common Sence, that indeed they
were only words; after a long and tedious
travel, I came at laſt to meet with a piece
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100899:129"/>
that was lofty, rich, and elevated to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Clouds: of which, had I found either the
Declivity eaſie, or the Aſcent acceſſible,
there had been ſome excuſe; but it was ſo
perpendicular a Precipice, and ſo wholly cut
off from the reſt of the Work, that by the
ſix firſt words I found my ſelf flying into the
other World, and from thence diſcover'd the
Vale from whence I came ſo deep and low,
that I had never ſince the Heart to deſcend
into it any more. If I ſhould ſet out my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
with ſuch rich Spoils as theſe, the
Plagiary would be too manifeſt in his own
Defects, and I ſhould too much diſcover the
imperfection of my own Writing. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the fault in others, that I am guilty
of my ſelf, appears to me no more unreaſonable,
than to condemn, as I often do, thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in my ſelf. They are to be every
where reprov'd, and ought to have no Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
allow'd them. I know very well how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently
I my ſelf at every turn attempt to
equal my ſelf to my thefts, and to make
my ſtyle go hand in hand with them, not
without a temerarious hope of deceiving the
eyes of my Reader from diſcerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
but withal, it is as much by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of my Application, that I hope to do it,
as by that of my Invention, or any Force of
my own. Beſides, I do not offer to contend
with the whole Body of theſe Champions,
nor hand to hand with any one of them, 'tis
only by ſlights and little light attempts that
I engage them; I do not grapple with them, but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100899:129"/>
try their ſtrength only, and never engage ſo
far as I make a ſhew to do; and if I could
hold them in play, I were a brave Fellow;
for I never attaque them, but where they are
moſt ſinewy and ſtrong. To cover a man's
ſelf (as I have ſeen ſome do) with another
man's Arms, ſo as not to diſcover ſo much as
their fingers ends; to carry on a Deſign (as
it is not hard for a Man that has any thing of
a Scholar in him, in an ordinary Subject to
do) under old Inventions, patcht up here and
there with his own Trumpery: and then to
endeavour to conceal the theft, and to make
it paſs for his own, is firſt injuſtice, and
meanneſs of Spirit in whoever do it, who
having nothing in them of their own fit to
procure them a Reputation, endeavour to do
it by attempting to impoſe things upon the
World in their own Name, which they have
really no manner of title to; and then a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Folly to content themſelves with acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ignorant approbation of the Vulgar
by ſuch a pitiful Cheat, at the Price at the
ſame time of diſcovering their inſufficiency
to men of Underſtanding, who will ſoon
ſmell out and trace them in thoſe borrow'd
Allegories, and from whom alone they are
to expect a legitimate Applauſe. For my
own part, there is nothing I would not ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
do than that, neither have I ſaid ſo much
of others, but to get a better Opportunity to
excuſe my ſelf: neither in this do I in the
leaſt glance at the Compoſers of Cento's,
who declare themſelves for ſuch; of which
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100899:130"/>
ſort of Writers, I have in my time known
many very ingenious, and have their Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodies
in very great Eſteem, and particularly
one, under the Name of <hi>Capilulus,</hi> beſides
the Ancients. Theſe are really Men of Wit,
and that make it appear they are ſo, both by
that and other ways of Writing; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Lipſius,</hi> in that learned and laborious
Contexture of his Politicks. But, be it how
it will, and how inconſiderable ſoever theſe
Eſſays of mine may be, I will ingeniouſly
confeſs, I never intended to conceal them, no
more than my old bald grizled Picture before
them, where the graver has not preſented you
with a perfect Face, but the Reſemblance of
mine. And theſe alſo are but my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
Opinions and Fancies, and I deliver
them for no other, but only, what I my ſelf
believe, and not for what is really to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.
Neither have I any other end in this
Writing, but only to diſcover my ſelf, who
alſo ſhall peradventure be another thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow,
if I chance to meet any Book, or
Friend, to convince me in the mean time. I
have no Authority to be believ'd, neither do I
deſire it being too conſcious of my own ineru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be able to inſtruct others.</p>
            <p>A Friend of mine then having read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Chapter, the other day told me, that I
ſhould a little longer have inſiſted upon the
Education of Children; and farther have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
my Diſcourſe upon ſo neceſſary a point:
which, how fit I am to do, let my Friends
ſlatter me if they pleaſe, I have in the mean
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100899:130"/>
time no ſuch Opinion of my own Talent, as
to promiſe my ſelf any very good ſucceſs from
my endeavour; but (Madam) if I had any
ſufficiency in this Subject, I could not poſſibly
better employ it, than to preſent my beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
to the little Gentleman that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
you ſhortly with a happy Birth; (for you
are too generous to begin otherwiſe than with
a male) for having had ſo great a hand in the
treaty of your Marriage, I have a certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
right and intereſt in the greatneſs and
proſperity of the Iſſue that ſhall ſpring from
it; beſides that, you having had the beſt of
my Services ſo long in poſſeſſion, does ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
oblige me to deſire the Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of all wherein you ſhall be concerned.
But, in truth, all I underſtand as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
is only this, that the greateſt and moſt
important difficulty of Humane Science is the
Education of Children. For as in Agriculture,
the Husbandry that is to precede planting,
as alſo Planting it ſelf, is certain, plain, eaſie,
and very well known; but after that which is
planted comes to take root, to ſpread, and
ſhoot up, there is a great deal more to be done,
more Art to be us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, more care to be taken,
and much more difficulty to cultivate and
bring them to Perfection: ſo it is with Men;
it is no hard matter to get Children; but after
they are born, then begins the Trouble, Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
and Care, vertuouſly to train, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and bring them up. The Symptoms of
their Inclinations in that young and tender
Age are ſo obſcure, and the Promiſes ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100899:131"/>
and fallacious, that it is very hard to
eſtabliſh any ſolid Judgment or Conjecture
upon them. As <hi>Simon,</hi> for Example, and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles,</hi>
and a thouſand others, who have
very much deceiv'd the little Expectation the
World had of them: Cubs of Bears, and
Bitches Puppies, do truly and indeed diſcover
their natural Inclination; but Men, ſo ſoon
as ever grown up, immediately applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to certain Habits, engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in certain Opinions, and conforming
themſelves to particular Laws and Cuſtoms,
do eaſily alter, or at leaſt diſguiſe their true
and real Diſpoſition. And yet it is hard to
force the Propenſion of Nature; whence it
comes to paſs, that for not having choſen the
right Courſe, a Man often takes very great
Pains, and conſumes good part of his Age in
training up Children to things, for which, by
their natural Averſion, they are totally unfit.
In this Difficulty, nevertheleſs, I am clearly
of Opinion, that they ought to be elemented
in the beſt and moſt advantageous Studies,
without taking too much notice of, or being
too ſuperſtitious in thoſe light Prognoſticks
they give of themſelves in their tender Years;
to which <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Republick, gives, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
too much Authority. But (<hi>Madam</hi>)
Science is doubtleſs a very great Ornament,
and a thing of marvellous uſe, eſpecially in
Perſons rais'd to that degree of Fortune you
are; and in truth, in Perſons of mean and
low Condition, cannot perform its true and
genuine Office, being naturally more prompt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100899:131"/>
to aſſiſt in the Conduct of War, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Armies and Provinces, and in negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the Leagues and Friendſhips of Princes
and foreign Nations, than in forming a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm
in Logick, in pleading a Proceſs in Law,
or in preſcribing a Doſe of Pills in Phyſick.
Wherefore, <hi>Madam,</hi> believing you will not
omit this ſo neceſſary Embelliſhment in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
of your Poſterity, who your ſelf have
taſted the Fruits of it, and are of a Learned extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(for we yet have the Writings of the
ancient Counts of <hi>Foix,</hi> from whom my Lord,
your Husband and your ſelf are both of you
deſcended, and <hi>Monſieur de Candale,</hi> your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
does every day oblige the World with
others, which will extend the knowledge of
this Quality in your Family ſo many ſucceeding
Ages) I will upon this occaſion preſume to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Ladiſhip with one particular Fancy
of my own, contrary to the common Method,
which alſo is all I am able to contribute to
your Service in this Affair. The charge of the
Tutor or Governour you ſhall provide for
your Son, upon the choice of whom depends
the whole Succeſs of his Education, has ſeveral
other great and conſiderable Parts and Duties
requir'd in ſo important a Truſt, beſides that of
which I am about to ſpeak, which however I
ſhall not mention, as being unable to add any
thing of moment to the common Rules, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one who is qualified for a Governour is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in: and alſo in this wherein I take upon me
to adviſe, he may follow it ſo far only as it ſhall
appear rational and conducing to the end at
which he does aim and intend.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>
to Letters not upon the account of Profit,
(for ſo mean an Object as that is unworthy
of the grace and favour of the Muſes; and
moreover, in that a man directs his Service
to and profeſſes to depend upon others)
nor ſo much for outward ornament, as for his
own proper and peculiar uſe, and to furniſh and
enrich himſelf within, having rather a Deſire
to go out an accompliſh'd Cavalier, and a
fine Gentleman, than a mere Scholar, and a
Learned Man; for ſuch a one, I ſay, I would
alſo have his Friends ſollicitous to find him
out a Tutor, who has rather an Elegant than
a Learned Head, and both, if ſuch a Perſon
can be found; but however, to prefer his
Manners and his Judgment before his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that this Man ſhould purſue the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Charge after a new method. 'Tis
the Cuſtom of School-maſters, to be eternally
thundring in their Pupils Ears, as they were
pouring into a Funnel, whilſt their Buſineſs
is only to repeat what the other have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Now I would have a Tutor to correct
this Error, and that at the very firſt, he
ſhould according to the Capacity he has to
deal with, put it to the Teſt, permitting his
Pupil himſelf to taſte and reliſh things, and of
himſelf to chooſe and diſcern them ſometimes
opening the way to him, and ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him to break the Ice himſelf; that is, I
would not have him alone to invent and
ſpeak, but that he ſhould alſo hear his Pupil
ſpeak in turn. <hi>Socrates,</hi> and ſince him <hi>Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Authority of thoſe who teach, is very oft an
impediment to thoſe who deſire to learn. It
is good to make him, like a young Horſe,
trot before him that he may judge of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and how much he is to abate of his
own Speed, to accommodate himſelf to the
Vigour and Capacity of the other. For want
of which due proportion, we ſpoil all; which
alſo to know how to adjuſt, and to keep within
an exact and due meaſure is one of the hardeſt
things I know, and an effect of a judicious and
well-temper'd Soul, to know how to condeſcend
to his Puerile Motions, and to govern and direct
them. I walk firmer, and more ſecure up

common way of Teaching undertake, with one

miſtaken in their Method; and at this rate,
'tis no wonder, if in a multitude of Scholars,
there are not found above two or three who
bring away any good account of their Time
and Diſcipline. Let the Maſter not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine

Men that live upon Rapine, and borrowing,
expoſe their Purchaſes and Buildings to every

how they came by the Money. We do
not ſee the Fees, and Perquiſites belonging to
the Function and Offices of a Gentleman of the

wherewith he fortifies himſelf and his Family,
and the Titles and Honours he has obtain'd
for him and his. No man divulges his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
or at leaſt which way it comes in: but
every one publiſhes his Purchaſes, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

a Roguy Trick of a Page, a ſottiſh Miſtake of

And, that we may whet and ſharpen our Wits
by rubbing them upon thoſe of others. I
would that a Boy ſhould be ſent abroad very

bend. And alſo 'tis the general Opinion of
all, that a Child ſhould not be brought up in
his Mother's Lap. Mothers are too tender,
and their natural Affection is apt to make the

they can neither find in their Hearts to give
them due Correction for the Faults they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,

on the Good, as well as the Bad. As
for Proof, in our preſent Civil war, whoever
draws his Sword againſt the Laws, threatens
all honeſt Men with the Whip and the Halter.
And moreover, by living at home, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Governour, which ought to be
ſovereign over the Boy he has receiv'd into
his charge, is often check'd, interrupted; and
hindred by the Preſence of Parents; to which
may alſo be added, that the Reſpect the whole

And yet even in this converſing with Men I

for a mere clatter of Words and Syllogiſms,
and is no further engag'd to any Argument

my Humour, he will form his Will to be a
very good and Loyal Subject to his Prince,
very affectionate to his Perſon, and very
ſtout in his Quarrel; but withall, he will
cool in him the deſire of having any other

Duty; becauſe, beſides ſeveral other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
that are very inconſiſtent with the

with Ingratitude or Indiſcretion. A man
that is purely a Courtier, can neither have
Power non Wit to ſpeak or think otherwiſe
than favourably and well of a Maſter, who,
amongſt ſo many millions of other Subjects has
pick'd out him with his own hand to nouriſh
and advance. This Favour, and the Profit
flowing from it, muſt needs, and not without
ſome ſhew of Reaſon, corrupt his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deprive him of the freedom of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
and alſo we commonly ſee theſe People
ſpeak in another kind of Phraſe than is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
ſpoken by others of the ſame Nation,
though what they ſay in that Courtly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is not much to be believ'd in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Let his Conſcience and Vertue be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
manifeſt in his ſpeaking, and have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Reaſon for their guide. Make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that to acknowledge the Errour he
ſhall diſcover in his own Argument, though
only found out by himſelf, is an Effect of
Judgment and Sincerity, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
things he is to ſeek after. That Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
and contention are common qualities,
moſt appearing in, and beſt becoming, a mean
and illiterate Soul. That to recollect, and to
correct himſelf, and to forſake an unjuſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in the height and heat of Diſpute, are
great, and philoſophical Qualities. Let him be
advis'd, being in Company, to have his Eye
and Ear in every corner of the Room; for I
find that the Places of greateſt Honour are
commonly poſſeſt by Men that have leaſt in

him examine every Mans Talent, a Peaſant, a
Bricklayer, or a Paſſenger; a Man may learn
ſomething from every one of theſe in their
ſeveral Capacities, and ſomething will be
pick'd out of their Diſcourſe, whereof ſome

very pleaſant to learn, and very uſeful
to know. In this Converſing with Men, I
mean, and principally thoſe who only live in
the Records of Hiſtory, he ſhall by reading
thoſe Books,<note place="margin">Reading Hiſtory.</note> converſe with thoſe great and
heroick Souls of former and better Ages. 'Tis
an idle and vain Study I confeſs, to thoſe who
make it ſo, by doing it after a negligent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but to thoſe who do it with care and

What profit ſhall he not reap as to the Buſineſs
of Men, by reading the Lives of <hi>Plutarch?</hi>
But withall, let my Governour remember to
what end his Inſtructions are principally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and that he do not ſo much imprint in
his Pupils Memory, the date of the Ruine of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> as the manners of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio;</hi>
nor ſo much where <hi>Marcellus</hi> dy'd, as
why it was unworthy of his Duty that he di'd
there. That he do not teach him ſo much
the Narrative part, as the Buſineſs of Hiſtory.
The reading of which, in my Opinion, is a
thing that of all others we apply our ſelves unto
with the moſt differing, and uncertain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
I have read an hundred things in <hi>Livy</hi>
that another has not, or not taken notice of at

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100899:139"/>
Anatomy of Philoſophy, by which the moſt
ſecret, and abſtruſe parts of our humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are penetrated into. There are in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
many long<note place="margin">Elegy of <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </note> Diſcourſes very worthy to be
carefully read and obſerv'd, for he is, in my
Opinion, of all other, the greateſt Maſter in that
kind of Writing; but withall, there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
others which he has only touch'd, and
glanc'd upon, where he only points with his
Finger to direct us which way we may go if
we will, and contents himſelf ſometimes with
giving only one brisk hit in the niceſt Article
of the Queſtion; from whence we are to
grope out the reſt: as for Example, where he
ſays, <hi>That the Inhabitants of</hi> Aſia <hi>came to be
Vaſſals to one only, for not having been able to
pronounce one Syllable, which is,</hi> No. Which
Saying of his, gave perhaps matter and
occaſion to <hi>Boetius</hi> to write his <hi>Voluntary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</hi>
Even this but to ſee him pick out
a light Action in a man's Life, or a Word,
that does not ſeem to be of any ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
is it ſelf a whole Diſcourſe. 'Tis to our
Prejudice that men of Underſtanding ſhould
ſo immoderately affect Brevity; no doubt but
their Reputation is the better by its but in
the mean time we are the worſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
had rather we ſhould applaud his Judgment,
than commend his Knowledge, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leave us with an Appetite to read more,
than glutted with that we have already read.
He knew very well, that a Man may ſay too
much even upon the beſt Subjects, and that

made very elegant, but two long Speeches to

them.</hi> Such as have lean and ſpare Bodies ſtuff
themſelves out with Cloaths; ſo they who are
defective in Matter, endeavour to make amends
with Words. Humane underſtanding is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
enlightned by daily Converſation
with men, for we are otherwiſe of our ſelves
ſo ſtupid as to have our Sight limited to the
length of our own Noſes. One asking <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
of what Country he was, he did not make
Anſwer of <hi>Athens,</hi> but of the World; he
whoſe Imagination is better levell'd, could
carry further, embrac'd the whole World
for his Country, and extended his society
and Friendſhip to all Mankind; not as we do,
who look no further' than our Feet. When
the Vines of our Village are nip'd with the
Froſt, the Pariſh Prieſt preſently concludes,
that the indignation of God is gone out againſt
all Humane Race, and that the <hi>Cannihals</hi> have
already got the Pip. Who is it, that ſeeing
the bloudy Havock of theſe Civil Wars of
ours, does not cry out, That the machine of
the World is near Diſſolution, and that the
Day of Judgment is at hand; without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that many worſe Revolutions have
been ſeen, and that, in the mean time, People
are very merry in a thouſand other Parts of

the Licenſe and Impunity that always

whoever ſhall obſerve himſelf in that Figure,

which ſome do yet multiply as ſeveral <hi>Species</hi>

are to behold our ſelves, to be able to know

would have this to be the Book my young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
ſhould ſtudy with the moſt Attention;
for ſo many Humours, ſo many Sects, ſo many

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100899:140"/>
our Underſtandings to diſcover their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and natural Infirnity, which is no
trivial Speculation. So many Mutations of
States and Kingdoms, and ſo many Turns and
Revolutions of publick Fortune, will make us
wiſe enough to make no great wonder of our
own. So many great Names, ſo many famous
Victories and Conqueſts drown'd and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
in Oblivion, render our Hopes ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of eternizing our Names by the taking
of half a ſcore light Horſe, or a paltry Turret,
which only derives its Memory from its Ruine.
The Pride and Arrogancy of ſo many foreign
Pomps and Ceremonies, the tumorous Majeſty
of ſo many Courts and Grandeurs, accuſtom
and fortifie our Sight without Aſtoniſhment to
behold and endure the luſtre of our own. So
many millions of men buried before us, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us not to fear to go ſeek ſo good Company

choice of that which directly and profeſs'dly
ſerves to that end. If we are once able to
reſtrain the Offices of Humane Life within
their juſt and natural Limits, we ſhall find that
moſt of the Sciences in uſe are of no great uſe
to us, and even in thoſe that are, that there are
many very unneceſſary. Cavities and Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which we were better to let alone, and
following <hi>Socrates</hi> his Direction, limit the
Courſe of our Studies to thoſe things only
where a true and real Utility and Advantage
are to be expected and found.</p>

The Soul that entertains Philoſophy,
ought to be of ſuch a Conſtitution of Health,

and her Contentment ought to faſhion
the outward Behaviour to her own Mould,

Confidence, an active Carriage, and with a

is not, as the School-men ſay, ſituate upon
the ſummity of a perpendicular Rock, and an

from whence ſhe eaſily diſcovers all things
ſubjected to her; to which Place any one may

ſo far from Difficulty, that Boys, as well as
Men, and the innocent as well as the ſubtle,
may make it their own; and it is by Order
and good Conduct, and not by Force, that
it is to be acquir'd. <hi>Socrates,</hi> her firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is ſo averſe to all manner of Violence, as
totally to throw it aſide, to ſlip into the more
natural Facility of her own Progreſs: 'Tis
the Nurſing-Mother of all humane Pleaſures,
who in rendring them juſt, renders them alſo
pure and permanent; in moderating them,
keeps them in Breath and Appetite; in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting

that ſhe meet with an indocile Diſpoſition, ſhe
paſſes that Diſciple by, and takes another, not
ſo fickle and unſteady as the other, which ſhe
forms wholly her own. She can be Rich, be
Potent and Wiſe, and knows how to lie upon
ſoft Down, and perfum'd Quilts too: ſhe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100899:145"/>
loves Life, Beauty, Glory, and Health; but
her proper and peculiar Office is to know re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
how to make uſe of all theſe good
things, and how to part with them without
Concern: an Office much more noble than
troubleſome, and without which the whole

the Formatrix of Judgment and Manners, ſhall
be his principal Leſſon, has that privilege
to have a hand in every thing. The orator

and commended his Anſwer; <hi>It is not now a time,</hi>

and Rhetorical Diſputes in a Company
met together to laugh and make good cheer,
had been very unſeaſonable and improper,
and as much might have been ſaid of all
the other Sciences: But as to what concerns
Philoſophy, that part of it at leaſt that treats
of Man, and of his Offices and Duties, it has
been the joynt Opinion of all wiſe men, that,
out of reſpect to the ſweetneſs of her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,

occurring, without any ſet obligation of

his outward faſhion and mien, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his Limbs form'd at the ſame time

we ought not to divide him. And, as <hi>Plato</hi>
ſays, we are not to faſhion one without the
other, but make them draw together like two
Horſes harneſs'd to a Coach. By which Saying
of his, does he not ſeem to allow more time
for, and to take more care of Exerciſes for the
Body,<note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> and to believe that the Mind in a good
Proportion does her Buſineſs at the ſame time
too? As to the reſt, this Method of Education
ought to be carried on with a ſevere ſweetneſs
quite contrary to the Practice of our Pedants,
who,<note place="margin">Severity an Enemy to Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> inſtead of tempting and alluring Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Letters by apt and gentle ways, do in
truth preſent nothing before them but Rods
and Ferula's, Horror and Cruelty. Away
with this Violence! away with this Compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
than which, I certainly believe nothing
more dulls and degenerates a well-deſcended
Nature. If you would have him apprehend
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100899:148"/>
ſhame and chaſtiſement, do not harden him to
them. Inure him to Heat and Cold, to Wind
and Sun, and to Dangers that he ought to
deſpiſe. Wean him from all effeminacy, and
delicacy in Cloaths and Lodging, Eating and
Drinking; accuſtom him to every thing, that
he may not be a Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> a Carpet-Knight,
but a ſinewy, hardy, and vigorous young
man. I have ever from a Child to the age
wherein I now am, been of this opinion, and
am ſtill conſtant to it. But amongſt other
things, the ſtrict Government of moſt of our
Colleges has evermore diſpleas'd me, and peradventure
they might have err'd leſs pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
on the indulgent ſide. 'Tis the true Houſe
of Correction of Impriſon'd youth. They are
taught to be debauch'd, by being puniſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are ſo. Do but come in when they
are about their Leſſon, and you ſhall hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the out-cries of Boys under execution,
with the thund ring noiſe of their <hi>Pedagogues,</hi>
drunk with Fury, to make up the Conſort. A
very pretty way this! to tempt theſe tender
and timorous Souls to love their Book, with a
furious Countenance, and a Rod in hand! A
curſed and pernicious way of Proceeding! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what <hi>Quintilian</hi> has very well obſerv'd, that
this inſolent Authority is often attended by
very dangerous Conſequences, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our way of Chaſtiſing. How much more
decent would it be to ſee their Claſſes ſtrew'd
with green Leaves and fine flowers, than
with the bloody Stumps of Birch and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows?
Were it left to my ordering, I ſhould
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100899:148"/>
paint the School with the Pictures of Joy
and Gladneſs; <hi>Flora,</hi> and the <hi>Graces,</hi> as the
Philoſopher <hi>Speuſippus</hi> did his; that where
their Profit is, they might there have their
Pleaſure too. Such Viands as are proper and
wholſom for Children, ſhould be ſeaſon'd
with Sugar, and ſuch as are dangerous to
to them, with Gall. A Man ſhould admire
to ſee how ſollicitous <hi>Plato</hi> is in his Laws
concerning the Gayety and Diverſion of the
Youth of his City, and how much he enlarges
himſelf upon their Races, Sports, Songs,
Leaps, and Dances; of which, he ſays, that
Antiquity has given the ordering and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
particularly to <hi>Apollo, Minerva,</hi> and the
Muſes. He inſiſts long upon, and is very
particular in giving innumerable Precepts for
Exerciſes; but as to the Lettered Sciences,
ſays very little, and only ſeems particularly
to recommend Poeſie upon the Account of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
All Singularity in our Manners and
Conditions, is by all means to be avoided
as inconſiſtent with civil Society. Who
would not be aſtoniſh'd at ſo ſtrange a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
as that of <hi>Demophon,</hi> Steward to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Great, who ſweat in the Shade, and
ſhiver'd in the Sun? I have ſeen thoſe who
have run from the ſmell of a mellow Apple
with greater Precipitation than from a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze
Shot; others run away from a Mouſe;
others vomit at the ſight of Cream; others
ready to ſwoon at the ſight of a Cat, as
<hi>Germanicus,</hi> who could neither endure the
Sight nor the Crowing of a Cock. I will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100899:149"/>
not deny, but that there may peradventure be
ſome occult Cauſe and natural Averſion in
theſe Caſes; but certainly a Man might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it, if he took it in time. Precept has in
this wrought ſo effectually upon me, though
not without ſome Endeavour on my part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
that Beer accepted, my Appetite accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates
its ſelf indifferently to all ſorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.
Young Bodies are ſupple, one ſhould
therefore in that Age bend and ply them to all
Faſhions and Cuſtoms: and provided a Man
can contain the Appetite and the Will within
their due limits, let a Young-man, a Gods
Name, be rendred fit for all Nations and all
Companies, even to Debauchery and Exceſs if
occaſion be; that is, where he ſhall do it out of
Complacency to the Cuſtoms of the Place. Let
him be able to do every thing, but love to do
nothing but what is good. The Philoſophers
themſelves do not juſtifie <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the Favour of his Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, by refuſing to pledge him a Cup of
Wine. Let him laugh, play and drink with
his Prince: nay I would have him, even in his
Debauches, too hard for the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and to excel his Companions in Ability
and Vigour, and that he may not give over doing
it, either thorought Defect of Power or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

which of all Arts is the greateſt, by their

and not thoſe that are painted; why do
you not alſo chooſe Exerciſes which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

A Man cannot ſo ſoon get his Leſſon

one of our College <hi>Latiniſts,</hi> who has
thrown away ſo much time in nothing but
learning to ſpeak. The World is nothing
but Babble; and I hardly ever yet ſaw that
Man who did not rather prate too much, than
ſpeak too little; and yet half of our Age is
embezled this way. We are kept four or five
Years to learn Words only, and to tack them
together into Clauſes; as many more to make
Exerciſes, and to divide a continued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
into ſo many Parts; and other five
Years at leaſt to learn ſuccinctly to mix and
interweave them after a ſubtle and intricate
manner. Let us leave it to the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.
Going one Day to <hi>Orleans,</hi> I met
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100899:151"/>
in the Plain on this ſide <hi>Clery,</hi> two Pedants
travelling towards <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> about fifty
Paces diſtant from one another, and a good
way further behind them, I diſcovered a
Troop of Horſe, with a Gentleman in the
Head of them, which was the late <hi>Monſteur le
Compte de la Rochefoucaut;</hi> one of my People
enquir'd of the foremoſt of theſe <hi>Domines,</hi>
who that Gentleman was that came after him,
who having not ſeen the Train that followed
after, and I thinking he meant his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pleaſantly anſwer'd,<note place="margin">A pleaſant Anſwer of a Pedant.</note> 
               <hi>He is not a Gentleman,
Sir, he is a Grammarian, and I am a Logician.</hi>
Now we who quite contrary, do not here
pretend to breed a Grammarian, or a Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
but a compleat Gentleman, let us leave
them to throw away their Time at their own
Fancy: our Buſineſs lies elſe-where. Let but

to have their Fancies full of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
very fine things, which yet, for want of
Elocution, they cannot utter; a meer Shift,
and nothing elſe. Will you know what I
think of it? I think they are nothing but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of ſome imperfect Images and Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that they know not what to make of

they do not yet themſelves underſtand what

in the form of Speaking.<note place="margin">Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Courtier.</note> All Affectation, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

reaſon, an eaſie and natural Negligence does
well. I no more like a Web where the Knots

that is dedicated to Truth be plain and
unaffected. For who ſtudies to ſpeak quaintly
and accurately, that does not at the ſame time
deſign to perplex his Auditory?</hi> That Eloquence
prejudices the Subject it would advance, that
wholly attracts us to it ſelf. And as in our
outward Habit, 'tis a ridiculous Effeminacy to
diſtinguiſh our ſelves by a particular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practis'd
Garb or Faſhion; ſo in Language,
to ſtudy new Phraſes, and to affect Words
that are not of currant uſe, proceeds from a
Childiſh and Scholaſtick Ambition. Shall I be
bound to ſpeak no other Language than what
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100899:154"/>
is ſpoken in the Courts of <hi>Paris? Ariſtophanes</hi>
the Grammarian was a little out, when he
reprehended <hi>Epicurus</hi> for this plain way of
delivering himſelf, the End and Deſign of his
Oratory being only Perſpicuity of Speech,
and to be underſtood. The Imitation of
Words by its own Facility, immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes
it ſelf thorough a whole People: but
the imitation of inventing, and fitly applying
thoſe Words, is of a ſlower Progreſs. The
Generality of Readers, for having found a
like Robe, very miſtakingly imagine they have
the ſame Body and inſide too, whereas Force
and Sinews are never to be borrowed, the
Gloſs and outward Ornament, that is, Words
and Elocution, may. Moſt of thoſe I converſe
with, ſpeak the ſame Language I here write;
but whether they think the ſame Thoughts I
cannot ſay. The <hi>Athenians</hi> (ſays <hi>Plato</hi>) are
obſerv'd to ſtudy length and elegancy of
Speaking; the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to affect Brevity;
and thoſe of <hi>Creet</hi> to aim more at the Fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of Conception than the Fertility of Speech;
and theſe are the beſt. <hi>Zenon</hi> us'd to ſay, that

Speaking is not a very good and commendable
Quality; but not ſo excellent and ſo neceſſary
as ſome would make it; and I am ſcandaliz'd
that our whole Life ſhould be ſpent in nothing
elſe. I would firſt underſtand my own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and that of my Neighbours with whom
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100899:155"/>
moſt of my Buſineſs and Converſation lies.
No doubt but <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> are very great
Ornaments, and of very great uſe, but we buy
them too dear: I will here diſcover one way,
which alſo has been experimented in my own
Perſon, by which they are to be had better
cheap, and ſuch may make uſe of it as will.
My Father having made the moſt preciſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
that any man could poſſibly make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men of the greateſt Learning and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of an exact method of Education, was
by them caution'd of the Inconvenience then
in uſe, and made to believe, that the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
time we applyed to the learning of the
Tongues of them who had them for nothing,
was the ſole cauſe we could not arrive to that
Grandeur of Soul, and Perfection of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
with the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> I
do not however believe that to be the only
Cauſe: but the Expedient my Father found
out for this, was, that in my Infancy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I began to ſpeak, he committed me to the
care of a <hi>German,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> who ſince died a famous
Phyſician in <hi>France,</hi> totally ignorant of our
Language, but very fluent, and a great Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
in Latin. This Man, whom he had
fetch'd out of his own Country, and whom he
entertained with a very great Salary for this
only end, had me continually in his Arms: to
whom there were alſo joyn'd two others of the
ſame Nation, but of inferiour Learning, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
me, and ſometimes to relieve him; who
all of them entertain'd me with no other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
but Latin. As to the reſt of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100899:155"/>
it was an inviolable Rule, that neither Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor my Mother, Man nor Maid, ſhould
ſpeak any thing in my Company, but ſuch
Latin Words as every one had learnt only to
gabble with me. It is not to be imagin'd how
great an advantage this prov'd to the whole
Family, my Father, and my Mother, by this
means learning Latin enough to underſtand it
perfectly well, and to ſpeak it to ſuch a Degree,
as was ſufficient for any neceſſary Uſe; as alſo
thoſe of the Servants did, who were moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
with me. To be ſhort, we did Latin it at
ſuch a Rate, that it overflowed to all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Villages, where there yet remain, that
have eſtabliſh'd themſelves by Cuſtom, ſeveral
Latin Appellations of Artizans and their
Tools. As for what concerns my ſelf, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ſix years of Age before I underſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
French or Perigordin, any more than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick,
and without Art, Book, Grammar, or
Precept, Whipping, or the expence of a Tear,
had by that time learn'd to ſpeak as pure La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
as my Maſter himſelf. If (for Example)
they were to give me a Theam after the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
faſhion, they gave it to others in <hi>French,</hi>
but to me they were of neceſſity to give it in
the worſt Latin, to turn it into that which
was pure and good; and <hi>Nicholas Grouchi,</hi>
who writ a Book <hi>de Comitiis Romanorum;
William Guirentes,</hi> who has writ a Comment
upon <hi>Ariſtotle; George Bucanan,</hi> that great
<hi>Scotch</hi> Poet, and <hi>Marcus Antonius Muretus</hi>
(whom both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
for the beſt Orator of his time) my
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100899:156"/>
domeſtick Tutors, have all of them often told
me, that I had in my Infancy that Language
ſo very fluent and ready, that they were afraid
to enter into Diſcourſe with me; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Bucanan,</hi> whom I ſince ſaw attending
the late <hi>Mareſchal de Briſſac,</hi> then told me,
that he was about to write a Treatiſe of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the Example of which, he intended
to take from mine, for he was then Tutor to
that Count <hi>de Briſſac,</hi> who afterwards prov'd
ſo valiant and ſo brave a Gentleman. As to
Greek, of which I have but a very little
Smattering, my Father alſo deſign'd to have
it taught me by a Trick; but a new one, and
by way of ſport; toſſing our Declenſions to
and fro, after the manner of thoſe, who by
certain Games at Tables and Cheſs, learn Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry
and Arithmetick: for he, amongſt
other Rules, had been advis'd to make me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Science and Duty by an unforc'd Will,
and of my own voluntary motion, and to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my Soul in all Liberty and Delight,
without any Severity or Conſtraint. Which
alſo he was an Obſerver of to ſuch a degree
even of Superſtition, if I may ſay ſo, that ſome
being of Opinion, it did trouble and diſturb
the Brains of Children ſuddenly to wake them
in the Morning, and to ſnatch them violently
and over haſtily from Sleep, (wherein they
are much more profoundly envolv'd than we)
he only caus'd me to be wak'd by the Sound
of ſome muſical Inſtrument, and was never
unprovided of a Muſician for that purpoſe:
by which Example you may judge of the reſt,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100899:156"/>
this alone being ſufficient to recommend both
the Prudence and the Affection of ſo good a
Father; who therefore is not to be blam'd
if he did not reap Fruits anſwerable to ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
a Culture: of which, two things were
the cauſe. Firſt, a ſteril and improper Soil:
for, tho I was of a ſtrong and healthful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and of a Diſpoſition tolerably ſweet
and tractable; yet I was withal ſo heavy, idle,
and indiſpos'd, that they could not rouze me
from this Stupidity to any Exerciſe of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
nor get me out to play. What I ſaw,
I ſaw clearly enough, and under this lazy
Complexion nouriſh'd a bold Imagination,
and Opinions above my Age. I had a ſlothful
Wit, that would go no faſter than it was led,
a ſlow Underſtanding, a languiſhing Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and after all, incredible defect of Memory,
ſo that it is no wonder, if from all theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conſiderable can be extracted. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(like thoſe, who, impatient of a long and
ſteady cure, ſubmit to all ſorts of Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Receipts) the good Man being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
timorous of any way failing in a thing
he had ſo wholly ſet his Heart upon, ſuffer'd
himſelf at laſt to be over-rul'd by the common
Opinion, and complying with the method of
the time, having no more thoſe Perſons he had
brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and who had given him
the firſt Model of Education, about him, he
ſent me at ſix Years of Age to the College
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> at that time the beſt and moſt
flouriſhing in <hi>France.</hi> And there it was not
poſſible to add any thing to the care he had to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100899:157"/>
provide me the moſt able Tutors, with all
other Circumſtances of Education, reſerving
alſo ſeveral particular Rules contrary to the
College Practice; but ſo it was, that wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
all theſe Precautions, it was a College ſtill.
My Latin immediately grew corrupt, of
which alſo by Diſcontinuance I have ſince loſt
all manner of uſe: ſo that this new way of
Inſtitution ſerv'd me to no other end, than
only at my firſt coming to preferr me to the
firſt Forms: for at thirteen Years old, that I
came out of the College, I had run thorough
my whole Courſe (as they call it) and in
truth without any manner of Improvement,
that I can honeſtly brag of, in all this time.
The firſt thing that gave me any Taſte of
Books, was the Pleaſure I took in reading
the Fables of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Metamorphoſes, and with
them I was ſo taken, that being but Seven or
Eight Years old, I would ſteal from all other
Divertiſements to read them, both by reaſon
that this was my own natural Language, the
eaſieſt Book that I was acquainted with,
and for the Subject, the moſt accommodated
to the Capacity of my Age: for as for <hi>Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
du Lake, Amadis de Gaule, Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi>
and ſuch Trumpery, which Children are
moſt delighted with, I had never ſo much as
heard their Names, no more than I yet know
what they contain; ſo exact was the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
wherein I was brought up. But this was
enough to make me neglect the other Leſſons
were preſcrib'd me; and here it was infinitely
to my advantage, to have to do with an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100899:157"/>
underſtanding Tutor, who very well knew
diſcreetly to connive at this and other Truan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of the ſame nature; for by this means I
ran thorough <hi>Virgil'</hi>s <hi>Aeneids, Terence, Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Comedies, allur'd by the
Softneſs and Pleaſure of the Subject; whereas
had he been ſo fooliſh as to have taken me off
this Diverſion, I do really believe, I had
brought nothing away from the College but
a Hatred of Books, as almoſt all our
young Gentlemen do: but he carried himſelf
very diſcreetly in that Buſineſs, ſeeming to
take no notice, and allowing me only ſuch
time as I could ſteal from my other regular,
and yet moderate Studies, which whetted my
Appetite to devour thoſe Books I was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo much in love with before. For the chief
things my Father expected from their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to whom he had deliver'd me for Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was Affability of Manners, and good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and, to ſay the truth, mine had no other
Vice but Sloth and want of Mettle. There was no
fear that I would no ill, but that I would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
no body ſuſpected that I would be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but uſeleſs; they foreſaw an Idleneſs, but no
Malice in my Nature; and I find it falls out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
The Complaints I hear of my ſelf
are theſe, He is idle, cold in the Offices of
Friendſhip and Relation, and remiſs in thoſe
of the Publick; he is too particular, he is too
proud: but the moſt Injurious do not ſay,
Why has he taken ſuch a thing? Why has he
not paid ſuch a one? But why does he part
with nothing? Why does he not give? And I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100899:158"/>
ſhould take it for a Favour that Men would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from me no greater Effects of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
than theſe. But they are unjuſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
from me what I do not owe; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
me to it, they Efface the Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Act, and deprive me of the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that would be due to me upon ſuch a
Bounty; whereas the active Benefit ought to
be of ſo much the greater Value from my hands,
by how much I am not paſſive that way at all
I can the more freely diſpoſe of my Fortune
the more it is mine, and of my ſelf, the more
I am my own. Nevertheleſs, if I were good
at ſetting out my own Actions, I could perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
very well repell theſe Reproaches,
and could give ſome to underſtand, that they
are not ſo much offended, that I do not
enough, as that I am able to do a great deal
more than I do. Yet for all this heavy Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of mine, my Mind, when retir'd into it
ſelf, was not altogether idle, nor wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of ſolid Inquiſition, nor of certain and
infallible Reſults about thoſe Objects it could
comprehend, and could alſo without any Helps
digeſt them; but amongſt other things, I do
really believe, it had been totally impoſſible to
have made it to ſubmit by Violence and Force.

and by how much the Soul is more empty,

that I my ſelf was to be pitied as much at

me any thing to convince my former Opinion,
tho' my Curioſity has endeavoured that way;
but Reaſon has inſtructed me, that thus Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100899:160"/>
to condemn any thing for falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
is arrogantly and impiouſly to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe
and limit the Will of God, and the

greater. If we give the Names of Monſter

comprehend, how many are continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
before our Eyes? Let us but conſider
through what Clouds, and as it were groping
in the Dark, our Teachers lead us to the
Knowledge of moſt of the things we apply our
Studies to, and we ſhall find that it is rather
Cuſtom than Knowledge that takes away the
Wonder, and renders them eaſie and familiar
to us.

to Mens Minds by being often ſeen; ſo that they
neither admire, nor are inquiſitive into things they
daily ſee.</hi> The Novelty, rather than the
greatneſs of things, tempts us to enquire into
their Cauſes. But we are to judge with more
reverence, and with greater Acknowledgment
of our own Ignorance and Infirmity of this
infinite Power of Nature. How many unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things are there teſtified by People of very
good Repute, which if we cannot perſuade our
ſelves abſolutely to believe we ought at leaſt to
leave them in Suſpence; for to conclude them
impoſſible, is by a temerarious Preſumption to
pretend to know the utmoſt Bounds of Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Did we rightly underſtand the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

we may be allow'd to be a little merry at it,
as alſo at what our Annals report, that Pope

that in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the News

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100899:161"/>
yet there is ſcarce a Puiſne Sophiſter that does
not convince him of untruth, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to inſtruct him in the Progreſs of
the Works of Nature: When we read in <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet</hi>
the Miracles of St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Relicks; away
with it, his Authority is not ſufficient to bear
us the liberty of contradicting him: but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to condemn all ſuch like Stories, ſeems
to me an impudence of the worſt Character.
The great St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> profeſſes himſelf to
have ſeen a blind Child recover ſight upon the
Relick of St. <hi>Gervaſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Protaſius</hi> at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>

being alſo tranſported thence into the Church,
a Paralytick to have there been ſuddenly cur'd
by it. A Woman in Proceſſion, having touch'd
St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Shrine with a Noſegay, and after

her Sight loſt many Years: before; with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Miracles, of which he profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to have been an Eye-Witneſs. Of what
ſhall we accuſe him and the two Holy Biſhops,
<hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> both which he atteſts
to the Truth of theſe things? Shall it be of
Ignarance, Simplicity, and Facility; or of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and impoſture? Is any Man now living
ſo impudent, as to think himſelf comparable to
them,<note place="margin">Ciciro 2. de Div. l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>either in Virtue, Piety, Learning, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Who though they ſhould give me no Reaſon
for what they affirm, would yet convince me with
their Authority.</hi> 'Tis a Preſumption of great
Danger and Conſequence, beſides the abſurd
Temerity it draws after it, to contemn what
we do not comprehend. For after that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your fine Underſtanding, you have
eſtabliſh'd the Limits of Truth and Error, and
that afterwards there appears a Neceſſity
upon you of believing ſtranger things than
thoſe you have contradicted, you are already
oblig'd to quit your hold, and to aquieſce. That
which ſeems to me ſo much to diſorder our
Conſciences in the Commotions we are now in
concerning Religion, is the Catholicks diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo much with their Belief; they fanſie they
appear Moderate, and Wiſe, when they grant
to the <hi>Huguenots</hi> ſome of the Articles in
Queſtion; but beſides that, they do not diſcern
what advantage it is to thoſe with whom we
contend, to begin to give Ground, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and how much this animates our Enemy
to follow his blow: theſe Articles which they
inſiſt upon as things indifferent, are ſometimes
of very great importance, and dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
We are either wholly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſubmit our ſelves to the Authority of our
Eccleſiaſtical Polity, or totally throw off all
Obedience to it. 'Tis not for us to determine
what and how much Obedience we owe to it,
and this I can ſay, as having my ſelf made tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of it, that having formerly taken the liberty
of my own Swing and Fancy, and omitted or
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100899:162"/>
neglected certain Rules of the Diſcipline of
our Church, which ſeem'd to me vain, and of
no Foundation: coming afterwards to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
it with learned Men, I have found thoſe
very things to be built upon very good and
ſolid Ground, and ſtrong Foundation; and
that nothing but Brutality and Ignorance
make us Receive them with leſs Reverence
than the reſt: Why do we not conſider what
Contradictions we find in our own Judgments,
how many things were yeſterday Articles of
our Faith, that to day appear no other than
Fables? Glory and Curioſity are the Scourges
of the Soul; of which the laſt prompts us to
thruſt our Noſes into every thing, and the
other forbids us to leave any thing doubtful and
undecided.</p>

not being ſuch, that I dare to offer at a brave
piece, finely painted, and ſet off according to
Art. I have therefore thought fit to borrow
one of <hi>Eſtienno de Boitic,</hi> and ſuch a one as
ſhall honour and adorn all the reſt of my work;
namely, a Diſcourſe that he called, <hi>The Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Servitude,</hi> a piece writ in his younger
Years, by way of Eſſay, in honour of Liberty
againſt Tyrants, and which has ſince run
through the hands of ſeveral Men of great
Learning and Judgment, not without ſingular,
and merited commendation, for it is finely
writ, and as full, as any thing can poſſibly be:
Though a Man may confidently ſay it is
far ſhort of what he was able to do; and if
in that more mature Age, wherein I had the
happineſs to know him, he had taken a deſign
like this of mine, to commit his thoughts to
writing, we ſhould have ſeen a great many
rare things, and ſuch as would have gone ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near to have rival'd the beſt Writings of
Antiquity: For in Natural parts eſpecially,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100899:163"/>
I know no man comparable to him. But he
has left nothing behind him, ſave this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
only, (and that too by chance, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he never ſaw it after it firſt went out
of his hands,) and ſome Obſervations upon
that Edict of <hi>January</hi> made Famous by our
Civil Wars, which alſo ſhall elſewhere perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
find a place. Theſe were all I could
recover of his Remains, I to whom, with
ſo affectionate a remembrance, upon his
Death-bed, he by his laſt Will bequeath'd his
Library, and Papers, the little Book of his
Works only excepted, which I committed
to the preſs. And this particular obligation
I have to this Treatiſe of his, that it was the
occaſion of my firſt coming acquainted with
him; for it was ſhew'd to me long before I
had the good fortune to know him; and gave
me the firſt knowledge of his name; proving
ſo the firſt cauſe and foundation of a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which we afterward improv'd, and
maintain'd, ſo long as God was pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
us together, ſo perfect, inviolate, and
entire, that certainly the like is hardly to be
found in Story, and amongſt the Men of this
Age, there is no ſign nor trace of any ſuch
thing in uſe; ſo much concurrence is requir'd
to the building of ſuch a one, that 'tis much,
if Fortune bring it but once to paſs in three
Ages. There is nothing to which Nature
ſeems ſo much to have enclin'd us as to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that the good <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
had more reſpect to Friendſhip, than to
Juſtice. Now the moſt ſupream point of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100899:164"/>
its perfection is this:<note place="margin">Perfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, what.</note> for generally all thoſe
that Pleaſure, Profit, Publick or Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
Create and Nouriſh, are ſo much the
leſs Generous, and ſo much the leſs Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
by how much they mix another cauſe,
and deſign, than ſimple, and pure Friendſhip
it ſelf. Neither do the four Ancient Kinds,
Natural, Sociable, Hoſpitable and Venerean,
either ſeparately, or jointly, make up a true
and perfect Friendſhip. That of Children to
Parents is rather reſpect: Friendſhip being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht
by Communication, which cannot, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the great diſparity, be betwixt them: but
would rather perhaps violate the Duties of
Nature; for neither are all the ſecret thoughts
of Fathers fit to be communicated to Children,
leſt it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt
them; neither can the advices, and reproofs,
which is one of the principal offices of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
be properly perform'd by the Son to
the Father. There are ſome Countries, where
'tis the Cuſtom for Children, to kill their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and others, where the Fathers kill'd their
Children, to avoid being ſometimes an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to one another in their deſigns; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the Expectation of the one does naturally
depend upon the ruine of the other. There
have been great Philoſophers who have made
nothing of this tie of Nature, as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi>
for one, who being preſt home about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he ow'd to his Children, as being come
out of him, preſently fell to ſpit, ſaying, that
that alſo came out of him, and that he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
breed Worms, and Lice; and that other,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100899:164"/>
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> endeavoured to reconcile to his
Brother, I make never the more account of
him ſaid he, for coming out of the ſame hole.
This name of Brother does indeed carry with
it an amicable and affectionate ſound, and for
that reaſon, he and I call'd Brothers: but the
complication of intereſt, the diviſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and that the raiſing of the one, ſhould
be the undoing of the other, does ſtrangely
unnerve and ſlacken this fraternal tie: And
Brothers purſuing their Fortune and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the ſame Path, 'tis hardly poſſible,
but they muſt of neceſſity often juſtle, and
hinder one another. Beſides, why is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that the correſpondence of Manners
Parts and Inclinations, which beget theſe true
and perfect Friendſhips, ſhould always meet
and concurr in theſe relations. The Father and
the Son may be of quite contrary humours, and
Brothers without any manner of Sympathy in
their Natures. He is my Son, he is my Brother, or
he and I are Couſin-germans; but he is Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
ill Natur'd, or a Fool. And moreover,
by how much theſe are Friendſhips, that the
Law, and Natural Obligation, impoſe upon
us; ſo much leſs is there of our own choice,
and voluntary freedom. Whereas that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
liberty of ours, has nothing but that of
Affection and Friendſhip, properly its own.
Not that I have not in my own perſon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
all can poſſibly be expected of that
kind, having had the beſt, and moſt indulgent
Father, even to an extream old Age, that ever
was, and who was himſelf deſcended from a

and improves by enjoyment, as being of it
ſelf Spiritual, and the Soul growing ſtill more
perfect by practice. Under, and ſubſellious
to this perfect Friendſhip, I cannot deny, but
that the other vain Affections, have in my
younger Years found ſome place in my thoughts
that I may ſay nothing of him, who himſelf
confeſſes but too much in his Verſes: So that
I had both theſe Paſſions, but always ſo, that I
could my ſelf well enough diſtinguiſh them,
and never in any degree of compariſon with
one another. The firſt maintaining its flight
in ſo lofty and ſo brave a place, as with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to look down, and ſee the other flying
at a far humbler pitch below. As concerning
Marriage, beſides, that it is a Covenant, the
entrance into which, is only free, but the
continuance in it, forc'd and compell'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
another dependance, than that of our

happens a Thouſand Intricacies in it, to unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
enough to break the Thread, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Current of a lively Affection: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Friendſhip has no manner of Buſineſs or
Traffick with any but it ſelf. Moreover, to
ſay truth, the ordinary Talent of Women,
is not ſuch, as is ſufficient to maintain the
Conference and Communication required, to
the ſupport of this Conjugal Tie; nor do
they appear to be endu'd with Conſtancy of
Mind, to endure the pinch of ſo hard and
durable a Knot. And doubtleſs if without
this, there could be ſuch a free and voluntary
familiarity contracted, where not only the
Souls might have this entire fruition, but the
Bodies alſo might ſhare in the Alliance, and a
Man be engag'd throughout, the Friendſhip
would certainly be more full and perfect; but
it is without example, that this Sex could ever
arrive at ſuch perfection, and by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

why does no one Love a deform'd Youth, or
a comely Old Man?</hi> Neither will that very
Picture that the Academy preſents of it, as
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100899:166"/>
I conceive, contradict me, when I ſay, that
the firſt fury inſpir'd by the Son of <hi>Venus</hi> into
the heart of the Lover, upon the ſight of the
Flower, and prime of a Springing and bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Youth, to whom they allow all the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and Paſſionate Attempts, that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Ardour can produce, was ſimply
founded upon an external Beauty, the falſe
image of Corporal Generation; for upon the
Soul it could not ground this Love, the ſight
of which, as yet lay conceal'd, was but now
ſpringing, and not of maturity to Bloſſom.
Which fury, if it ſeiz'd upon a mean Courage,
the means by which he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eferr'd his ſuit, were
rich Preſents, favour in advancement to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and ſuch Trumpery, which they by
no means approve: If on a more generous
Soul, the purſuit was ſuitably generous, by
Philoſophical Inſtructions, Precepts to revere
Religion, to obey the Laws, to die for the
good of his Country; by examples of Valour,
Prudence and Juſtice, the Lover ſtudying to
render himſelf acceptable by the Grace and
Beauty of his Soul, that of his Body being
long ſince faded and decay'd, hoping by this
mutual Society to eſtabliſh a more firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Contract. When this Courtſhip came to
affect in due ſeaſon, (for that which they do
not require in the Lover, namely, Leiſure,
and Diſcretion in his purſuit, they ſtrictly
require in the perſon Loved; foraſmuch as he
is to judge of an internal Beauty, of difficult
Knowledge, and obſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Diſcovery,) then
there ſprung in the Perſon Loved the deſire of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100899:167"/>
a ſpiritual Conception, by the mediation of a
ſpiritual Beauty. This was the Principal, the
Corporeal, Accidental, and Second Cauſes, are
all the wrong ſide of the Lover. For this reaſon
they preferr the Perſon Beloved, maintaining,
that the Gods in like manner preferr him too,
and very much blame the Poet <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> for
having, in the Loves of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi>
given the Lovers part to <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was in the
firſt flower and pubeſcency of his Youth, and the
handſomeſt of all the <hi>Greeks.</hi> After this general
Familiarity, &amp; mutual Community of Thoughts,
is once ſetled, ſuppoſing the ſoveraign and moſt
worthy Part to preſide and govern, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
its proper Offices, they ſay, that from
thence great Utility deriv'd, both to private
and publick Concerns, that the force and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Countries receiv'd their beginning from
thence, and that it was the chiefeſt ſecurity of
Liberty and Juſtice. Of which, the Salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Loves of <hi>Harmonius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogiton</hi> is a
good inſtance; and therefore it is, that they
call'd it Sacred and Divine, and do conceive,
that nothing but the Violence of Tyrants, and
the Baſeneſs of the common People, is mimical
to it: finally, all that can be ſaid in favour
of the Academy, is, that it was a Love which
ended in Friendſhip; which alſo well enough
agrees with the Stoical definition of Love. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem

For the reſt, which we commonly call Friends,
and Friendſhips, are nothing but Acquaintance,
and Familiarities, either occaſionally contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or upon ſome deſign, by means of which,
there happens ſome little intercourſe betwixt
our Souls: but in the Friendſhip I ſpeak of,
they mix and work themſelves into one piece,
with ſo univerſal a mixture, that there is no
more ſign of the Seam by which they were firſt
conjoyn'd. If a Man ſhould importune me to
give a reaſon why I Lov'd him; I find it could
no otherwiſe be expreſt, than by making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
becauſe it was he, becauſe it was I.
There is beyond I am able to ſay, I know not
what inexplicable and fatal power that
brought on this Union. We ſought one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
long before we met, and by the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
we heard of one another, which wrought
more upon our Affections, than in reaſon,
meer reports ſhould do, I think by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
appointment of Heaven, we embrac'd in
our Names; and at our firſt meeting, which
was accidentally at a great City entertainment,
we found our ſelves ſo mutually taken with one
another, ſo acquainted, and ſo endear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our ſelves, that from thenceforward
nothing was ſo near to us as one another. He
writ an excellent Latin Satyr, which I ſince
Printed, wherein he excuſes the precipitation
of our Intelligence, ſo ſuddenly come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ſaying, that being to have ſo ſhort
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100899:168"/>
continuance, as being begun ſo late, (for we were
both full grown Men, and he ſome Years the
older,) there was no time to loſe; nor was
ti'd to conform it ſelf to the example of thoſe
ſlow and regular Friendſhips, that require
ſo many precautions of a long praeliminary
Converſation. This has no other Idea, than
that of its ſelf: this is no one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
nor two, nor three, nor four,
nor a thouſand: 'tis I know not what quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence
of all this mixture, which, ſeizing
my whole Will, carried it to plunge and loſe
it ſelf in his, and that having ſeiz'd his whole
Will; brought it back with equal concurrence
and appetite, to plunge and loſe it ſelf in
mine. I may truly ſay, loſe, reſerving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our ſelves, that was either his or
mine. When <hi>Laelius,</hi> in the preſence of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, (who after they had ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd
<hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> proſecuted all thoſe
who had had any familiarity with him alſo,)
came to ask <hi>Cajus Bloſius,</hi> (who was his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friend and Confident,) how much he
would have done for him? And that he made
Anſwer, All things. How! All things!
ſaid <hi>Laelius,</hi> And what if he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you to Fire our Temples? he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have commanded me that, repli'd <hi>Bloſius,</hi>
But what if he had? ſaid <hi>Laelius.</hi> Why, if
he had, I would have Obey'd him, ſaid the
other. If he was ſo perfect a Friend to <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
as the Hiſtories report him to have been,
there was yet no neceſſity of offending the
Conſuls by ſuch a bold confeſſion, though he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100899:168"/>
might ſtill have retain'd the aſſurance he had
of <hi>Gracchus</hi> his diſpoſition. However, thoſe
who accuſe this Anſwer as Seditious, do not
well underſtand the Myſtery; nor preſuppoſe,
as it was true, that he had <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Will
in his ſleeve, both by the power of a Friend,
and the perfect knowledge he had of the Man.
They were more Friends, than Citizens, and
more Friends to one another, than either
Friends or Enemies to their Country, or than
Friends to Ambition and Innovation. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
abſolutely given up themſelves to one
another, either held abſolutely the reins of
the others Inclination, which alſo they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Vertue, and guided by the conduct
of Reaſon, (which alſo without theſe, it had
not been poſſible to do,) and therefore <hi>Bloſius</hi>
his Anſwer was ſuch as it ought to be. If either
of their Actions flew out of the handle, they
were neither (according to my meaſure of
Friendſhip,) Friends to one another; nor to
themſelves. As to the reſt, this Anſwer car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
no worſe ſound, than mine would do to
one that ſhould ask me, If your Will ſhould
command you to Kill your Daughter, would
you do it? And that I ſhould make Anſwer,
that I would, for this expreſſes no conſent to
ſuch an Act, foraſmuch as I do not in the leaſt
ſuſpect my own Will, and as little that of
ſuch a Friend. 'Tis not in the power of all
the Eloquence in the World, to diſpoſſeſs me
of the certainty I have of the intenſions and
reſolutions of mine; nay, no one Action of his,
what face ſoever it might bear, could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100899:169"/>
to me, of which I could not preſently,
and at firſt ſight, find out the moving cauſe:
Our Souls have drawn ſo unanimouſly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and we have with ſo mutual a confidence
laid open the very bottom of our hearts to one
anothers view, that I not only know his as
well as my own; but ſhould certainly in any
concern of mine, have truſted my intereſt
much more willingly with him, than with my
ſelf. Let no one therefore rank other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Friendſhips with ſuch a one as this. I
have had as much experience of theſe, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of the moſt perfect of their kind:
but I do not adviſe, that any ſhould confound
the Rules of the one, and the other; for they
would then find themſelves much deceiv'd. In
thoſe other ordinary Friendſhips, you are to
walk with a Bridle in your hand, with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Circumſpection, for in them the
Knot is not ſo ſure, that a Man may not half
ſuſpect it will ſlip: Love him (ſaid <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ilo</hi>) ſo,
as if you were one Day to Hate him; and Hate
him ſo, as you were one Day to Love him. A
Precept, that though abominable in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and perfect Friendſhip which I intend,
is nevertheleſs very ſound, as to the practice
of the ordinary ones, now in faſhion, and to
which the ſaying that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had ſo frequent
in his Mouth, <hi>O my Friends, there is no Friend;</hi>
may very fitly be apply'd. And this glorious
Commerce of good Offices, Preſents and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
by which other Friendſhips are ſupported
and maintain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, do not deſerve ſo much as to
be mention'd here; and is by this concurrence
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100899:169"/>
and conſent of Wills, totally taken away, and
rendred of no uſe; as the kindneſs I have for
my ſelf, receives no increaſe, for any thing I
relieve my ſelf withall in time of need, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Stoicks ſay,) and as I do not find
my Self oblig'd to my Self, for any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I do my Self: So the Union of ſuch
Friends, being really perfect, deprives
them of all acknowledgment of ſuch Duties,
and makes them loath and baniſh from their
Converſation, theſe words of Diverſion, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
Benefit, Obligation, Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Entreaty, Thanks, and the like: All
Things, Wills, Thoughts, Opinions, Goods,
Wives, Children, Honours and Lives, being
in effect, common betwixt them, and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
concurrence of Affections being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than one Soul in two Bodies, (according
to that very proper definition of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>)
they can neither lend, nor give any thing to
one another. This is the reaſon why the
Law-givers, to honour Marriage with ſome
imaginary reſemblance of this divine Alliance,
interdict all Gifts betwixt Man and Wife; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
by that, that all ſhould belong to each
of them, and that they have nothing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide;
or to give. If, in the Friendſhip of
which I ſpeak, one could give to the other,
the receiver of the Benefit would be the Man
that oblig'd his Friend; for each of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
and above all things, ſtudying how
to be uſeful to one another, he that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
the occaſion, is the liberal Man, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Friend the Satisfaction of doing that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100899:170"/>
towards him, which above all things he does
moſt deſire. When the Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes</hi>
wanted Money, he uſed to ſay, that he redeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it of his Friends, not that he demanded
it; and to let you ſee the effectual practice of
this, I will here produce an ancient and a rare
Example; <hi>Eudamidas</hi> a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> had two
Friends, <hi>Charixenus</hi> a <hi>Sycionian,</hi> and <hi>Aretheus</hi>
a <hi>Corinthian;</hi> this Man coming to Die, being
Poor, and his two Friends Rich, he made his
Will after this manner, I bequeath to <hi>Arethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Maintenance of my Mother, to ſupport
and provide for her in her old Age, and to
<hi>Charixenus</hi> I bequeath the care of marrying
my Daughter, and to give her as good a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as he is able; and in caſe that one of
theſe chance to Die, I hereby ſubſtitute the
Surviver in his Place. They who firſt ſaw
this Will, made themſelves very merry at the
Contents; but the Executors being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, accepted the Legacies with
very great Content; and one of them, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixenus,</hi>
dying within five Days after, and <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
by that means having the Charge of both
devolved ſolely to him, he nouriſht that old
Woman with very great Care and Tenderneſs,
and of five Talents he had in Eſtate, he gave
two and a half in Marriage with an only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had of his own, and two and a half in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the Daughter of <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> and in
one and the ſame day ſolemnized both their
Nuptials. This Example is very full, if one
thing were not to be objected, namely the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Friends: for the perfect Friendſhip I
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100899:170"/>
ſpeak of, is indiviſible, every one gives himſelf ſo
entirely to his Friend, that he has nothing left
to diſtribute to others: But on the Contrary, is
ſorry, that he is not double, treble, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple,
and that he has not many Souls, and
many Wills, to conferr them all upon this
one Subject. Common Friendſhips will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of Diviſion, one may love the Beauty of
this, the good humour of that Perſon, the
liberty of a third, the paternal Affection of
the fourth, the fraternal Love of a fifth, and
ſo of the reſt. But this Friendſhip that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the whole Soul, and there Rules and ſways
with an abſolute Soveraignty, can poſſibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no Rival. If two at the ſame time
ſhould call to you for ſuccour, to which of
them would you run? Should they require of
you contrary Offices; how could you ſerve
them both? Should one commit a thing to
your Secrecy, that it were of importance to
the other to know, how would you diſingage
your ſelf? A ſingular and particular Friendſhip
diſunites and diſſolves all other Obligations
whatſoever. The ſecret I have ſworn not to
reveal to any other, I may withour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
communicate to him who is not another,
but my ſelf. 'Tis Miracle enough certainly,
for a Man to double himſelf, and thoſe that
talk of tripling, talk they know not of what.
Nothing is extream, that has its like; and
who ſhall preſuppoſe, that of two, I love
one as much as the other, that they Love one
another too, and love me as much as I love
them, does multiply in Friendſhip, the moſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100899:171"/>
ſingle and united of all things, and wherein
moreover, one alone, is the hardeſt thing in
the World to find. The remaining part of
this Story ſuits very well with what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for <hi>Eudamidas</hi> as a Bounty and Favour,
Bequeaths to his Friends a Legacy of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in his Neceſſity; he leaves
them Heirs to this Liberality of his, which
conſiſts, in giving them the Opportunity of
conferring a Benefit upon him, and doubtleſs
the force of Friendſhip is more eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in this act of his, than in that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retheus.</hi>
In ſhort, theſe are effects not to be
imagin'd nor comprehended by ſuch as have
not experience of them, and which makes me
infinitely honour and admire the Anſwer of
that young Soldier to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by whom being
askt how much he would take for a Horſe,
with which he had won the prize of a Courſe,
and whether he would exchange him for a
Kingdom? No, truly Sir, ſaid he, but I would
give him with all my Heart, to find a true
Friend, could I find, out any Man worthy of
that Relation. He did not ſay ill in ſaying,
could I find, for though a Man may almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where meet with Men ſufficiently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for a ſuperficial acquaintance; yet in this,
where a Man is to deal from the very bottom
of his Heart, without any manner of reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it will be requiſite, that all the Wards
and Springs be neatly and truly wrought, and
perfectly ſure. In Leagues that hold but by
one end, we are only to provide againſt the
imperfections, that particularly concern that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100899:171"/>
end. It can be of no importance to me, of
what Religion my Phyſician or my Lawyer
is, provided the one be a good Lawyer, and
the other a good Phyſician; this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath nothing in common with the Offices
of Friendſhip, and I am of the ſame indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
in the domeſtick acquaintance, my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
muſt neceſſarily contract with me; I
never enquire, when I am to take a Footman,
if he be Chaſte, but if he be Diligent; and
am not ſollicitous, if my Chair-man be given
to Gaming, as if he be ſtrong and able, or if
my Cook be a Swearer, or a good Cook. I
do not however take upon me to direct what
other Men ſhould do in the Government of
their Families, there are enow that meddle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with that; but only give an account of
my method in my own.</p>

Witty, before the Learned and the Grave:
In Bed, Beauty before Modeſty, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Diſcourſe, Eloquence, whether or no
there be ſincerity in that Caſe. And, as he

playing with his Children, entreated the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

a more equal Judge of ſuch an Action: So I

experience of what I ſay; though, knowing
how remote a thing ſuch a Friendſhip is from
the common Practice, and how rarely ſuch

               <hi>In this place I did once intend to have inſerted
thoſe Memoirs upon that famous Edict of</hi> January:
<hi>But being I ſince find that they are already Printed,
and with a malicious deſign, by ſome who make it
their buſineſs to moleſt, and endeavour to ſubvert
the ſtate of our Government, not caring whether
they mend and reform it, or no; and that they

               <hi>I deſiſted from that purpoſe:
But that the Memory of the Father may not be
intereſted, nor ſuffer with ſuch, as could not come
near hand to be acquainted with his Principles;
I here give them truly to underſtand, that it was
writ by him in his very green Years, and that by
way of Exerciſe only, as a common Theme that
has been tumbled and toſt by a Thouſand Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I make no queſtion, but that he himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
what he writ, being ſo Conſciencious that
way, that he would not ſo much as lye in jeſt: and
do moreover know, that could it have been in his
own Choice, he had rather have been Born at</hi>
Venice, <hi>than at</hi> Soarlac, <hi>and he had reaſon:
But he had another Maxim Soveraignly imprinted
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100899:174"/>
in his Soul, very Religiouſly to Obey, and ſubmit
to the Laws under which he was Born. There
never was a better Citizen, more affectionate to
his Country; nor a greater Enemy to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
and Innovations of his time: So that he
would doubtleſs much rather have employ'd his
Talent to the extinguiſhing of thoſe Civil Flames,
than have added any Fewel to them: For he had
a Mind faſhion'd to the Model of better Ages.
But in exchange of this Serious Piece, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

the limits of Profit: that taken mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
it is pleaſant and uſeful; but that in
the end, it renders a Man Brutiſh and Vicious:
A Contemner of Religion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Laws, an Enemy to civil Converſation,
and all Humane Pleaſures, incapable of all
Publick Adminiſtration, unfit either to aſſiſt
others, or to relieve himſelf, and a fit Object
for all ſorts of Injuries and Affronts, without
remedy, or ſatisfaction: He ſays true, for in its
Exceſs, it enſlaves our Natural Freedom, and
by an impertinent ſubtilty, leads us out of the
fair and beaten way that Nature has plain'd
out for us. The Love we bear to our Wives
is very lawful, and yet Theology thinks fit to
curb and reſtrain it. As I remember, I have
read in one place of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi>
where he condemns Marriages within any of
the forbidden degrees, for this reaſon, amongſt
others, that there is ſome danger, leſt the
Friendſhip a Man bears to ſuch a Woman,
ſhould be immoderate; for if the Conjugal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
be full and perfect betwixt them, as
it ought to be, and that it be over and above
ſurcharg'd with that of Kindred too, there is
no doubt, but ſuch an addition will carry the
Husband beyond the bounds of reaſon. Thoſe
Sciences that regulate the manners of Men,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100899:176"/>
Divinity and Philoſophy, will have a ſaying to
every thing. There is no Action ſo private
that can eſcape their Inſpection and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but they are beſt taught, who are beſt able
to cenſure and curb their own Liberty. 'Tis
the Women that expoſe their Nudities over
freely upon the account of Pleaſure, though in
the Neceſſities of Phyſick and Chirurgery,
they are more ſhy, and more reſerv'd. I will
therefore in their behalf teach the Husbands,
that is, ſuch as are too extravagant and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in the exerciſe of the Matrimonial Duty, this
Leſſon, that the very Pleaſures they enjoy in the
Society of their Wives, are Reproachable, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,
and that a Licentious and Riotous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of them, are Faults, as reproveable here, as il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate
and adulterous Practices. Thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt
and Debauch'd Tricks and Poſtures, that
the firſt Ardour ſuggeſts to us in this Affair,
are not only indecently, but inconveniently
practis'd upon our Wives. Let them at leaſt
learn impudency from another hand; they are
always ready enough for our Buſineſs, and I
for my part always went the plain way to
work. Marriage is a Solemn and Religious
Tie, and therefore the pleaſure we extract
from thence, ſhould be a ſober and ſerious
delight, and mix with a certain kind of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
it ſhould be a kind of diſcreet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
pleaſure. And being that the chief
end of it is Generation, ſome make a Queſtion,
whether when Men are out of hopes of that
fruit, as when they are ſuperannuated, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with Child, it be lawful to lie with our
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100899:176"/>
Wives. 'Tis Homicide, according to <hi>Plato,</hi>
and certain Nations, (the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> a
mongſt others,) Abominate all Conjunction
with Women with Child, and others alſo,
with thoſe who are Unclean. <hi>Zenobia</hi> would
never admit her Husband for more than one
Encounter, after which, ſhe left him to his
own ſwing for the whole time of her Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not till after that, would any more
receive him: A brave Example of Conjugal
Continency. It was doubtleſs from ſome
Laſcivious Poet, and one that himſelf was in
great diſtreſs for a little of this ſport, that
<hi>Plato</hi> borrowed this Story; that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was
one Day ſo hot upon his Wife, that not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo much patience, as till ſhe could get to
the Couch, he threw her upon the Floor,
where the vehemency of pleaſure made him
forget the great and important Reſolutions he
had but newly taken with the reſt of the Gods,
in his Celeſtial Council; and to brag, that he
had had as good a Bout, as when he got her
Maidenhead unknown to their Parents. The
Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> were wont to invite their
Wives to the beginning of their Feſtivals;
but when the Wine began to work in good
earneſt, and that they were to give the Reins
to pleaſure, they ſent them back to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Apartments, that they might not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of their immoderate Luſt, ſending for
other Women in their ſtead, with whom they
were not oblig'd to ſo great a decorum of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
All Pleaſures, and all ſorts of Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
are not properly and fitly conferr'd
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100899:177"/>
upon all ſorts of Perſons. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had
Committed a young Man for certain Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
for whom <hi>Pelopidas</hi> mediated, that at
his requeſt he might be ſet at liberty, which,
notwithſtanding the great intelligence betwixt
them, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> reſolutely deny'd to him,
but granted it at the firſt word to a Wench of
his, that made the ſame interceſſion; ſaying,
that it was a Gratification fit for ſuch a one
as ſhe, but not for a Captain. <hi>Sophocles</hi> being
joint Praetor with <hi>Pericles,</hi> ſeeing accidentally a
fine Boy paſs by: O what a delicate Boy is
that ſaid he; I, that were a Prize, anſwered
<hi>Pericles,</hi> for any other than a Praetor, who
ought not only to have his Hands, but his Eyes
Chaſte too. <hi>Elius Verus</hi> the Emperour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
his Wife, who Reproach'd him with his
Love to other Women, That he did it upon a
Conſcientious account, foraſmuch as Marriage
was a Name of Honour, and Dignity, not of
Wanton and Laſcivious Deſire. And our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Hiſtory preſerves the Memory of
that Woman in great Veneration, who parted
from her Husband, becauſe ſhe would not
comply with his indecent and inordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
In fine, there is no ſo juſt and lawful
pleaſure, wherein the Intemperance and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
is not to be Condemn'd. But, to ſpeak
the truth, is not Man a moſt miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the while? It is ſcarce, by his Natural

pure and entire; and yet muſt he be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Doctrines and Precepts, to Curtail that

Talent, when ſhe exerciſes it in reſcinding
from the number and ſweetneſs of thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
that are naturally our due, as ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
it favourably, and well, in Artifically
diſguiſing and tricking out the ills of Life, to
alleviate the Senſe of them. Had I rul'd the
Roaſt, I ſhould have taken another, and more
natural courſe, which, to ſay the truth, is
both Commodious and Sacred, and ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
have been able to have limited it
too. Notwithſtanding that both our Spiritual
and corporal Phyſicians, as by compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themſelves, can find no other way to
cure, nor other Remedy for the Infirmities
of the Body, and the Soul, than what is
oft times worſe than the Diſeaſe, by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
us more and by adding to our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Pain. To this end Watchings, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Hair-ſhirts, remote and ſolitary Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
perpetual Impriſonments, Whips,
and other Afflictions, have been introduc'd
amongſt Men: But ſo, that they ſhould carry
a ſting with them, and be real Afflictions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
and not fall out ſo, as it once did
to one <hi>Gallio,</hi> who having been ſent an Exile
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100899:178"/>
into the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> news was not long after
brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he there Liv'd as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as the Day was long; and that what
had been enjoyn'd him for a Penance, turn'd
to his greateſt Pleaſure and Satisfaction:
Whereupon the Senate thought fit to recall
him home to his Wife and Family, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
him to his own Houſe, to accommodate
their Puniſhment to his feeling and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For to him whom Faſting would make
more Heathful and more Spritely, and to him
to whoſe Palate Fiſh were more acceptable
than Fleſh, it would be no proper, nor ſanative
Receipt; no more than in the other ſort of
Phyſick, where the Drugs have no effect upon
him who ſwallows them with Appetite and
Pleaſure. The Bitterneſs of the Portion, and
the Abhorrency of the Patient, are neceſſary
Circumſtances to the Operation. The Nature
that would eat Rheubarb like Butter'd Turnips,
would fruſtrate the uſe and virtue of it; it
muſt be ſomething to trouble and diſturb the
Stomach, that muſt Purge and Cure it: and
here the common Rule, that things are Cur'd
by their contraries, fails; for in this, one ill
is Cur'd by another. This Belief a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
that other ſo Ancient one, of thinking
to gratifie the Gods and Nature, by Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
an Opinion univerſally once receiv'd in
all Religions, and to this day retain'd in ſome.
For in theſe latter times wherein our Fathers
Liv'd, <hi>Amurath</hi> at the taking of <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated
Six Hundred Young <hi>Greeks</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Soul, in the nature of a propitiatoy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100899:178"/>
for the Sins of the Deceaſed. And in
thoſe new Countries diſcover'd in this Age of
ours, which are pure, and Virgins yet, in
compariſon of ours, this practice is in ſome
meaſure every where receiv'd. All their Idols
reek with humane Bloud, not without various
Examples of Horrid Cruelty. Some they burn
alive, and half Broil'd take them off the Coals
to tear out their Hearts and Entrails; others,
even Women, they fley alive, and with their
Bloudy Skins Cloth and Diſguiſe others. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we without great Examples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Reſolution in this Affair: The
poor Souls that are to be Sacrific'd, Old Men,
Women and Children, going ſome Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to beg Alms for the Offering of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and ſo ſinging and dancing, preſent
themſelves to the Slaughter. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of the King of <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſetting out to
<hi>Fernando Cortez</hi> the Power and Greatneſs of
their Maſter, after having told him, that he
had Thirty Vaſſals, of which each was able to
Raiſe an Hundred Thouſand Fighting Men,
and that he kept his Court in the faireſt and
beſt Fortified City under the Sun, added at
laſt, that he was oblig'd Yearly to offer the
Gods Fifty Thouſand Men. And it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirm'd, that he maintain'd a continual
War, with ſome Potent Neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not only to keep the Young Men in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
but principally, to have wherewithal
to furniſh his Sacrifices with his Priſoners of
War. At a certain Town in another place,
for the welcome of the ſaid <hi>Cortez,</hi> they Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100899:179"/>
Fifty Men at once. I will tell you
this one Tale more, and I have done; Some
of theſe People being Beaten by him, ſent to
Complement him, and to Treat with him of
a Peace, whoſe Meſſengers carried him Three
ſorts of Preſents, which they preſented in
theſe terms: Behold, Lord, here are Five
Slaves, if thou beeſt a furious God that feedeſt
upon Fleſh and Bloud, eat theſe, and we will
bring thee more; if thou beeſt an Affable God,
behold here Incenſe and Feathers; but if thou
beeſt a Man, take theſe Fowls and theſe Fruits,
that we have brought thee.</p>

Opinion, and that we are to judge by the
Eye of Reaſon, and not from common report.
I have long had a Man in my Houſe, that
Liv'd ten or Twelve Years in the new World
diſcover'd in theſe latter Days, and in that
part of it where <hi>Velegaignon</hi> Landed, which
he call'd Antartick <hi>France.</hi> This Diſcovery
of ſo vaſt a Country ſeems to be of very great
Conſideration; and we are not ſure, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
there may not be another, ſo many wiſer
Men than we have been deceiv'd in this. I am
afraid our Eyes are bigger than our Bellies, and
that we have more Curioſity than Capacity:
for we graſp at all, but catch nothing but Air.
<hi>Plato</hi> brings in <hi>Solon,</hi> telling a Story, that he
had heard from the Prieſts of <hi>Sais</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
that of Old, and before the Deluge, there was
a great Iſland call'd <hi>Atlantis,</hi> ſituate directly
at the Mouth of the Streight of <hi>Gibralter,</hi>
which contain'd more Ground, than both
<hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> put together; and that the
Kings of that Country, who not only poſſeſt
that Iſle, but extended their Dominion ſo far
into the Continent, that they had a Country,
as large as <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and as long as
<hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> attempted to Encroach even
upon <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to ſubjugate all the Nations
that Border upon the Mediterranean Sea, as

that effect, over-ran all <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and

they, and their Iſland, were ſwallowed
by the Flood.</p>
            <p>It is very likely, that this Violent Irruption
and Inundation of Water, made a wonderful

But there is no great appearance, that this
Iſle was this new World ſo lately diſcover'd:
for that almoſt toucht upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and it were
an incredible effect of an Inundation, to have
tumbled ſo prodigious a Maſs, above Twelve
Hundred Leagues: Beſides that our Modern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100899:180"/>
have already almoſt diſcover'd it
to be no Iſland, but firm Land, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
with the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> on the one ſide, and
with the Land under the two Poles on two
others; or if it be ſeparate from them, 'tis
by ſo narrow a Streight, and ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Channel, that it never the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the Name of an Iſland for that. It
ſhould ſeem, that in this great Body, there
are two ſorts of Motions, the one Natural,
and the other Febrifick, as there are in ours.
When I conſider the Impreſſion that our River
of <hi>Dordoigne</hi> has made in my time, on the right
Bank of its deſcent, and that in Twenty Years
it has gain'd ſo much, and undermin'd the
Foundations of ſo many Houſes, I perceive
it to be an extraordinary Agitation: for had it
always follow'd this Courſe, or were hereafter
to do it, the proſpect of the World would be
totally chang'd. But Rivers alter their Courſe,
ſometimes beating againſt the one ſide, and
ſometimes the other, and ſometimes quietly
keeping the Channel. I do not ſpeak of ſudden
Inundations, the cauſes of which every Body
underſtands. In <hi>Medoc,</hi> by the Sea-ſhore, the
<hi>Sieur d' Arſac</hi> my Brother, ſees an Eſtate, he
had there, Buried under the Sands which the
Sea Vomits before it: where the tops of ſome
Houſes are yet to be ſeen, and where his Rents
and Revenues are converted into pitiful Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Paſturage. The Inhabitants of which
place affirm, That of late Years the Sea has
driven ſo vehemently upon them, that they
have loſt above Four Leagues of Land. Theſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100899:181"/>
Sands are her Harbingers. And we now ſee
great heaps of moving Sand, that march half a
League before her.</p>
            <p>The other Teſtimony from Antiquity, to
which ſome would apply this diſcovery of the
new World, is in <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> at leaſt, if that
little Book of unheard of Miracles be his. He
there tells us, That certain <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
having croſt the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea without the
Streight of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and Sailed a very long
time, diſcover'd at laſt a great and fruitful
Iſland, all cover'd over with Wood, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
with ſeveral broad and deep Rivers;
far remote from all firm Land, and that they,
and others after them, allur'd by the pleaſantneſs
and fertility of the Soil, went thither with
their Wives and Children, and began to Plant
a Colony: But the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> viſibly
perceiving their People by little and little, to
grow thin, Iſſu'd out an expreſs Prohibition,
That no one, upon pain of Death, ſhould
Tranſport themſelves thither; and alſo drove
out theſe new Inhabitants; fearing, 'tis ſaid,
leaſt in proceſs of time, they ſhould ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as to ſupplant them themſelves, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
their State: But this Relation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s,
does no more agree with our new found Lands,
than the other. This Man that I have is a
plain ignorant Fellow, and therefore the
more likely to tell Truth: For your better
bred ſort of Men, are much more Curious in
their Obſervation, 'tis true, and diſcover a
great deal more, but then they gloſs upon it,
and to give the greater weight to what they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100899:181"/>
deliver, and allure your Belief, they cannot
forbear a little to alter the Story: they never
repreſent things to you ſimply as they are,
but rather as they appear'd to them, or as
they would have them appear to you, and to
gain the reputation of Men of Judgment, and
the better to induce your Faith, are willing
to help out the Buſineſs with ſomething more
than is really true, of their own Invention.
Now in this Caſe, we ſhould either have a Man
of Irreproachable Veracity: or ſo Simple, that
he has not wherewithal to Contrive, and to
give a Colour of Truth to Falſe Relations,
and that can have no Ends in Forging an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.
Such a one is mine; and beſides, the
little ſuſpicion the Man lies under, he has
divers times ſhew'd me ſeveral Sea men, and
Merchants, that at the ſame time went the
ſame Voyage. I ſhall therefore content my
ſelf with his Information, without enquiring
what the Coſmographers ſay to the Buineſs.
We ſhould have Maps to trace out to us the
particular places where they have been; but
for having had this advantage over us, to have
ſeen the Holy Land, they would have the
privilege forſooth, to tell us Stories of all
the other parts of the World beſides. I would
have every one Write what he knows, and as
much as he knows, but no more; and that not
in this only, but in all other Subjects: For
ſuch a Perſon may have ſome particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Experience of the nature of ſuch a
River; or ſuch a Fountain, that as to other
things, knows no more, than what every Body
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100899:182"/>
ders, and yet to keep a clutter with this Little
Pittance of his, will undertake to Write the
whole Body of Phyſicks: a Vice from whence
great Inconveniences derive their Original.</p>
            <p>Now, to return to my Subject, I find, that
there is nothing Barbarous and Savage in this
Nation, by any thing that I can gather, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,
That every one gives the Title of
Barbarity to every thing that is not in uſe in
his own Country: As indeed we have no other
level of Truth and Reaſon, than the Example
and Idea of the Opinions and Cuſtoms of the
place wherein we Live. There is always the
true Religion, there the perfect Government,
and the moſt exact and accompliſh'd Uſance of
all things. They are Savages at the ſame rate,
that we ſay Fruits are wild, which Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
of her ſelf, and by her own ordinary
progreſs; whereas in truth, we ought rather
to call thoſe wild, whoſe Natures we have
chang'd by our Artifice, and diverted from the
common Order. In thoſe, the Genuine, moſt
uſeful and natural Vertues and Properties, are
Vigorous and Spritely, which we have help'd
to Degenerate in theſe, by accommodating
them to the pleaſure of our own Corrupted
Palate. And yet for all this, our Taſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
a flavour and delicacy, excellent even to
Emulation of the beſt of ours, in ſeveral Fruits
thoſe Countries abound with, without Art or
Culture; neither is it reaſonable, that Art
ſhould gain the Prehemence of our great and
powerful Mother Nature. We have ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
her with the additional Ornaments and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100899:182"/>
Graces, we have added to the Beauty and Riches
of her own Works, by our Inventions, that we
have almoſt Smother'd and Choak'd her; and
yet in other places, where ſhe ſhines in her own
purity, and proper luſtre, ſhe ſtrangely baffles &amp;
diſgraces all our vain and frivolous Attempts.</p>

Spider. All things, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> are
produc'd either by Nature, by Fortune, or by
Art; the greateſt and moſt beautiful by the
one, or the other of the former, the leaſt and
the moſt imperfect by the laſt. Theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then ſeem to me to be ſo far Barbarous;
as having receiv'd but very little form and
faſhion from Art and Humane Invention, and
conſequently, not much remote from their
Original Simplicity. The Laws of Nature
however govern them ſtill, not as yet much
vitiated with any mixture of ours: But in
ſuch Purity, that I am ſometimes troubled we
were no ſooner acquainted with theſe People,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100899:183"/>
and that they were not diſcovered in thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, when there were Men much more
able to judge of them, than we are. I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had no knowledge of
them; for to my apprehenſion, what we now
ſee in thoſe Natives, does not only ſurpaſs all
the Images with which the Poets have adorn'd
the Golden Age, and all their Inventions in
ſeigning a Happy Eſtate of Man; but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the Fancy, and even the Wiſh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Philoſophy it ſelf; ſo Native, and ſo
pure a Simplicity, as we by Experience ſee to
be in them, could never enter into their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
nor could they ever believe that
Humane Society could have been maintained
with ſo little Artifice; ſhould I tell <hi>Plato</hi> that
it is a Nation wherein there is no manner of
Traffick, no knowledge of Letters, no ſcience
of Numbers, no name of Magiſtrate, nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Superiority; no uſe of Service, Riches
or Poverty, no Contracts, no Succeſſions, no
Dividends, no proprieties, no Employments,
but thoſe of Leiſure, no reſpect of Kindred,
but common, no Cloathing, no Agriculture,
no Metal, no uſe of Corn or Wine, and
where ſo much as the very words that ſignifie,
Lying, Treachery, Diſſimulation, Avarice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Detraction and Pardon, were never heard
of: How much would he find his Imaginary

As to the reſt, they Live in a Country,
beautiful and pleaſant to a Miracle, and ſo Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
withal, as my intelligence informs me,
that 'tis very rare to hear of a ſick Perſon, and
they moreover aſſure me, that they never ſaw
any of the Natives, either Paralytick, Blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed,
Toothleſs, or Crooked with Age. The
ſituation of their Country is all along by the
Sea ſhore, and enclos'd on the other ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lands, with great and high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
having about a Hundred Leagues in
breadth between. They have great ſtore of
Fiſh and Fleſh, that have no reſemblance
to thoſe of ours: which they Eat without any
other Cookery, than plain Boiling, Roaſting,
and Broiling. The firſt that carried a Horſe
thither, though in ſeveral other Voyages he
had contracted an acquaintance and familiarity
with them, put them into ſo terrible a Fright,
that they Kill'd him with their Arrows before
they could come to diſcover who he was.
Their Buildings are very long, and of Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to hold Two or Three hundred People,
made of the Barks of tall Trees, rear'd with
one end upon the ground, and leaning to,
and ſupporting one another, at the top, like
ſome of our Barns, of which the Covering
hangs down to the very ground, and ſerves
for the ſide Walls, They have Wood ſo hard,
that they cleave it into Swords, and make
Grills of it to Broil their Meat. Their Beds
are of Cotton, hung ſwinging in the Roof, like
our Seamens Hammocks, for every one one, for
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100899:184"/>
the Wives lie apart from their Husbands.
They riſe with the Sun, and ſo ſoon as they
are up, Eat for all Day, for they have no more
Meals but that: They do not then Drink,
(as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports of ſome other People of the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> that never Drink at their Meals,) but
Drink very often all Day after, and ſometimes
to a rouſing pitch. Their Drink is made of a
certain Root, and is of the Colour of our Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;
which they never Drink but Luke-warm.
It will keep above two or three Days, has a
quick Taſte, is nothing Heady, but very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to the Stomach, looſning to Strangers,
and a very pleaſant Beverage to ſuch as are
us'd to it. They make uſe inſtead of Bread,
of a certain White Matter, like <hi>Coriander</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
I have taſted of it, the taſte is ſweet,
and a little flat. All the whole Day is ſpent
in Dancing. Their Young Men go a Hunting
after Wild Beaſts with Bows and Arrows,
and one part of their Women are employ'd
in preparing their Drink the while, which is
their chief Employment. There are ſome of
their Old Men, who in the Morning before they
fall to Eating, Preach to the whole Family,
as they walk to and again from the one end of
the Houſe to the other, ſeveral times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Hundred Yards long,) Valour towards: their
Enemies, and Love towards their Wives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the two heads of his Diſcourſe, never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the cloſe, to put them in mind, that
they have ſo much the greater obligation to it;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100899:184"/>
becauſe they provide them their Drink warm,
and well order'd. The faſhion of their Beds,
Ropes, Swords, and Wooden Bracelets, they
tie about their Wriſts, when they go to Fight
and great Canes, boar'd hollow at one end,
by the ſound of which they keep the Cadence
of their Dances, are to be ſeen in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and amongſt others, at my Houſe. They
ſhave all their hairy parts, and much more
nearly than we, without other Razor,
than one of Wood, or of Stone. They
believe the Immortality of the Soul, and that
thoſe who have Merited well of the Gods, are
Lodg'd in that part of Heaven where the Sun
riſes; and the Accurſed in the Weſt. They
have I know not what kind of Prieſts, and
Prophets, that very rarely preſent themſelves
to the People, having their abode in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
At their arrival there is a great Feaſt,
and ſolemn Aſſembly of many Villages made:
that is all the Neighbouring Families, for
every Houſe, as I have deſcrib'd it, makes a
Village, and are about a <hi>French</hi> League diſtant
from one another. This Prophet declaims to
them in publick, exhorting them to Vertue,
and their Duty: But all their Ethicks are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in theſe two Articles, of Reſolution in
War, and Affection to their Wives. This
alſo Prophecies to them Events to come, and
the Iſſues they are to expect from their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
prompts them to, or diverts them from
War: But let him look to't; for if he fail in
his Divination, and any thing happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
than he has foretold, he is cut into a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100899:185"/>
thouſand pieces, if he be caught, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
for a falſe Prophet; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if any of them finds himſelf miſtaken, he
is no more to be heard of. Divination is a
gift of God, and therefore to abuſe it, ought
to be a Puniſhable Impoſture. Amongſt the
<hi>Scythians,</hi> where their Diviners fail'd in the
promis'd Effect, they were laid, Bound Hand
and Foot, upon Carts loaden with Furs and
Bavins, and drawn with Oxen, on which they
were Burnt to Death. Such as only meddle
with things subject to the Conduct of Humane
Capacity, are excuſable in doing the beſt they
can: But thoſe other ſort of People that come
to delude us, with Aſſurances of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Faculty, beyond our underſtanding,
ought they not to be Puniſh'd, when they do
not make good the effect of their Promiſe, and
for the temerity of their Impoſture? They
have continual War with the Nations that
Live further within the main Land, beyond
their Mountains, to which they go Naked,
and without other Arms, than their Bows,
and Wooden-Swords, faſhion'd at one end
like the head of a Javelin. The Obſtinacy of
their Battels is wonderful, and never end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great effuſion of Blood: For as to running
away, they know not what it is. Every one
for a Trophy brings home the head of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
he has Kill'd, which he fixes over the
Door of his Houſe. After having a long time
treated their Priſoners very well, and given
them all the Regalia's they can think of, he to
whom the Priſoner belongs, invites a great
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100899:185"/>
Aſſembly of his Kindred and Friends, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, he ties a Rope to one of the Arms
of the Priſoner, of which, at a diſtance, out
of his reach, he holds the one end himſelf and
gives to the Friend he Loves beſt, the other
Arm to hold after the ſame manner; which
being done, they two in the preſence of all
the Aſſembly, diſpatch him with their Swords.
After that, they Roaſt him, Eat him amongſt
them, and ſend ſome Chops to their abſent
Friends, which nevertheleſs they do not do,
as ſome think, for Nouriſhment, as the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
anciently did, but as a repreſentation of an
extream Revenge; as will appear by this,
That having obſerv'd the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were
in League with their Enemies, to inflict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of Death upon any of them they took
Priſoners: Which was, to ſet them up to the
Girdle in the Earth, to ſhoot at the remaining
part till it was ſtuck full of Arrows, and then
to hang them: They that thought thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the other World, (as thoſe who had
ſown the knowledge of a great many Vices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
their Neighbours, and who were much
greater Maſters in all ſorts of Miſchief than
they,) did not exerciſe this ſort of Revenge
without Myſtery, and that it muſt needs be
more painful than theirs; and ſo began to
leave their old way, and to follow this. I am
not ſorry that we ſhould here take notice of
the Barbarous Horrour of ſo Cruel an Action,
but that ſeeing ſo clearly into their faults, we
ſhould be ſo blind in our own: For I conceive,
there is more Barbarity in Eating a Man Alive.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100899:186"/>
than when he is Dead; in tearing a Body
Limb from Limb, by Racks and Torments,
that is yet in perfect Senſe, in Roaſting it by
degrees, cauſing it to be bit and worried by
Dogs and Swine, (as we have not only read,
but lately ſeen; not amongſt inveterate and
mortal Enemies, but Neighbours, and fellow
Citizens, and which is worſe, under colour of
Piety and Religion,) than to Roaſt, and Eat
him after he is Dead. <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi> the

That there was no hurt in making uſe

Treachery, Diſloyalty, Tyranny and Cruelty
which are our familiar Vices. We may then
call theſe People Barbarous, in reſpect to
the Rules of Reaſon: but not in reſpect to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100899:186"/>
our ſelves, who in all ſorts of Barbarity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them. Their Wars are throughout No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Generous, and carry as much Excuſe
and fair Pretence, as their Humane Diſeaſe
is capable of; having with them no other
foundation, than the ſole Jealouſie of Vertue.
Their Diſputes are not for the Conqueſt of
new Lands, thoſe they already poſſeſs, being ſo
fruitful by Nature, as to ſupply them without
Labour or Concern, with all things neceſſary,
in ſuch abundance, that they have no need to
enlarge their Borders. And they are moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happy in this, that they only covet ſo much
as their natural neceſſities require: all beyond
that is ſuperfluous to them: Men of the ſame
Age generally call one another Brothers, thoſe
who are younger, Sons and Daughters, and
the old Men are Fathers to all. Theſe leave
to their Heirs in common this full poſſeſſion of
Goods, without any manner of Diviſion, or
other Title, than what Nature beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Creatures, in bringing them into the
World. If their Neighbours paſs over the
Mountains, and come to aſſault them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Victory, all the Victors gain by it is
Glory only, and the advantage of having prov'd
themſelves the better in Valour and Vertue:
for they never meddle with the Goods of
the Conquer'd, but preſently return into their
own Country, where they have no want of
any thing neceſſary; nor of this greateſt of
all Goods, to know happily how to enjoy their
Condition, and to be Content. And theſe in
turn do the ſame. They demand of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100899:187"/>
ſoners no other Ranſom, than acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they are overcome: but there is
not one found in an Age, who will rather not
chooſe to die, than make ſuch a Confeſſion, or
either by Word or Look, recede from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Grandeur of an invincible Courage. There
is not a Man amongſt them, who had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be Kill'd and Eaten, than ſo much as to
open his mouth to entreat he may not. They
uſe them with all Liberality and Freedom, to
the end their Lives may be ſo much the dearer
to them: but frequently entertain them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
with Menaces of their approaching Death,
of the Torments they are to ſuffer, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
are making in order to it, of
the mangling their Limbs, and of the Feaſt is
to be made, where their Carcaſſes is to be the
only Diſh. All which they do, to no other
end, but only to extort ſome gentle or ſubmiſſive
word from them, or to Fright them ſo as
to make them run away; to obtain this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that they were terrified, and that their
Conſtancy was ſhaken; and indeed, if rightly
taken, it is in this point only, that a true
Victory does conſiſt.</p>

We have ſeveral advantages over our
Enemies that are borrowed, and not truly our
own; 'tis the quality of a Porter, and no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Vertue to have ſtronger Arms and Legs,
'tis a Dead and Corporeal quality to be Active,
'tis an Exploit of fortune to make our Enemy
ſtumble, or to dazle him with the light of
the Sun; 'tis a trick of Science and Art, and
that may happen in a mean baſe Fellow, to
be a good Fencer. The Eſtimate and Valour
of a Man conſiſt in the Heart, and in the
Will, there his true Honour Lives. Valour is
Stability, not of Legs, and Arms, but of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and the Soul; it does not lie in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of our Horſe, or our Arms, but in our

But to return to my Story, theſe Priſoners
are ſo far from diſcovering the leaſt Weakneſs,
for all the Terrors can be repreſented to them,
that, on the contrary, during the two or three
Months, that they are kept, they always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with a chearful Countenance; importune
their Maſters to make haſte to bring them to
the Teſt, Defie, Rail at them, and Reproach
them with Cowardize, and the number of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
they have loſt againſt thoſe of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
I have a Song made by one of theſe Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
wherein he bids them <hi>come all, and Dine
upon him, and welcome, for they ſhall withall Eat
their own Fathers, and Grandfathers, whoſe Fleſh
has ſerv'd to feed and nouriſh him. Thoſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>this Fleſh, and theſe Veins, are your
own: Poor ſilly Souls as you are, you little think
that the ſubſtance of your Anceſtors Limbs is here
yet: but mind as you Eat, and you will find in it
the Taſte of your own Fleſh:</hi> In which Song
there is to be obſerv'd, an Invention that does
nothing reliſh of the Barbarian. Thoſe that
paint theſe People Dying after this manner,
repreſent the Priſoner ſpitting in the faces of
his Executioners, and making at them a wry
Mouth. And 'tis moſt certain, that to the
very laſt gaſp, they never ceaſe to Brave and
Defie them both in Word and Geſture. In
plain truth, theſe Men are very Savage in
compariſon of us, and of neceſſity, they muſt
either be abſolutely ſo, or elſe we are Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
for there is a vaſt difference betwixt their
Manners, and ours.</p>
            <p>The Men there have ſeveral Wives, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100899:189"/>
the greater number, by how much they
have the greater Reputation and Valour, and
it is one very remarkable Vertue their Women
have, that the ſame Endeavour our Wives have
to hinder and divert us from the Friendſhip
and Familiarity of other Women, thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
to promote their Husbands Deſires, and
to procure them many Spouſes; for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things ſollicitous of their Husbands
Honour, 'tis their chiefeſt care to ſeek out,
and to bring in the moſt Companions they can,
foraſmuch as it is a Teſtimony of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Vertue. I know moſt of ours will
cry out, that 'tis Monſtrous; whereas in truth,
it is not ſo; but a truly Matrimonial Vertue;
though of the higheſt form. In the Bible,
<hi>Sarah, Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> gave the moſt Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their Maids to their Husbands, <hi>Livia</hi>
preferred the Paſſion of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to her own
intereſt, and the Wife of King <hi>Dejotarus</hi> of
<hi>Stratonica,</hi> did not only give up a fair young
Maid that ſerv'd her, to her Husband's Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but moreover carefully brought up the
Children he had by her, and aſſiſted them in
the Succeſſion to their Father's Crown. And
that it may not be ſuppos'd, that all this is done
by a ſimple and ſervile Obſervation to their
common Practice, or by any Authoritative
Impreſſion of their Ancient Cuſtom, without
Judgment, or Examination; and for having a
Soul ſo ſtupid, that it cannot contrive what
elſe to do, I muſt here give you ſome touches
of their ſufficiency, in point of Underſtanding;
beſides what I repeated to you before, which
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100899:189"/>
was one of their Songs of War, I have another,
and a Love Song, that begins thus; <hi>Stay, Adder,
ſtay, that by thy Pattern my Siſter may draw the
Faſhion, and work of a Noble Wreath, that I
may preſent to my Beloved, by which means thy
Beauty, and the excellent Order of thy Scales
ſhall for ever be preferr'd before all other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi>
Wherein the firſt Couplet, <hi>Stay, Adder,
&amp;c.</hi> makes the Burthen of the Song. Now I
have convers'd enough with Poetry to judge
thus much: that not only, there is nothing of
Barbarous in this Invention: But moreover,
that it is perfectly <hi>Anacreontick:</hi> to which
their Language is ſoft, of a pleaſing Accent,
and ſomething bordering upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
Three of theſe People, not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
how dear their knowledge of the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this part of the World, would one Day
coſt their Happineſs and Repoſe, and that the
effect of this Commerce would be their Ruine,
as I preſuppoſe it is in a very fair way, (Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Men to ſuffer themſelves to be deluded
with deſire of Novelty, and to have left the
Serenity of their own Heaven, to come ſo far
to gaze at ours,) came to <hi>Roan,</hi> at the time
that the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth was
there: where the King himſelf talk'd to them
a good white, and they were made to ſee our
Faſhions, our Pomp, and the form of a great
City; after which, ſome one ask'd their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and would know of them, what of all
the things they had ſeen, they found moſt to
be admired? To which they made Anſwer,
Three things, of which I have forgot the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100899:190"/>
Third, and am troubled at it; but two I yet,
remember. They ſaid, that in the firſt place
they thought it very ſtrange, that ſo many tall
Men wearing Beards, ſtrong and well Arm'd,
who were about the King, ('tis like they
meant the <hi>Swiſs</hi> of the Guard,) ſhould ſubmit
to Obey a Child, and that they did not chooſe
out one amongſt themſelves to Command:
Secondly, (they have a way of ſpeaking in
their Language, to call Men the half of one
another,) that they had Obſerv'd, that there
were amongſt us, Men full, and cramm'd with
all manner of Conveniences, whilſt in the mean
time, their halves were Begging at their
Doors, Lean, and half ſtarv'd with Hunger
and Poverty; and thought it ſtrange, that
theſe Neceſſitous halves, were able to ſuffer ſo
great an Inequality and Injuſtice, and that
they did not take the others by the Throats,
or ſet Fire to their Houſes. I talk'd to one
of them a great while together, but I had ſo
ill an Interpreter, and that was ſo perplex'd
by his own Ignorance, to apprehend my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I could get nothing out of him, of
any moment; Asking him, what advantage he
reapt from the Superiority he had amongſt his
own People? (For he was a Captain, and our
Mariners call'd him King,) he told me, to March
in the Head of them to War: and demanding
of him further, how many Men he had to follow
him? He ſhewed me a ſpace of Ground, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
as many as could March in ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs:
which might be Four or Five Thouſand
Men; and putting the queſtion to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100899:190"/>
or no his Authority expir'd with the War;
He told me this remain'd; that when he went
to Viſit the Village of his dependance, they
plain'd him Paths through the thick of their
Woods, through which he might paſs at his eaſe.
All this does not ſound very ill, and the laſt was
not much amiſs; for they wear no Breeches.</p>

and to that, ſubmitting their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reaſon. 'Tis enough for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to believe, that all things come from God,
to receive them with acknowledgement of his
divine and inſtructable Wiſdom, and alſo
thankfully to accept and receive them, with
what Face ſoever they may preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
But I do not approve of what I ſee in
uſe, that is, to ſeek to continue and ſupport
our Religion by the Proſperity of our Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.
Our Belief has other Foundation enough,
without going about to Authorize it by Events:
For the People accuſtomed to ſuch Arguments
as theſe, and ſo proper to their own Taſte, it
is to be fear'd, leſt when they fail of Succeſs,
they ſhould alſo ſtagger in their Faith: As in
the War wherein we are now Engag'd, upon
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100899:191"/>
the account of Religion, thoſe who had the
better in the Buſineſs of <hi>Rochelabeille;</hi> making
great Brags of that ſucceſs, as an infallible
approbation of their Cauſe, when they came
afterwards to excuſe their Misfortunes of <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi>
and <hi>Moncontour,</hi> 'twas by ſaying, they
were Fatherly Scourges and Corrections; if
they have not a People wholly at their Mercy,
they make it manifeſtly enough to appear,
what it is to take two ſorts of Griſt out of the
ſame Sack, and with the ſame Mouth to blow
Hot and Cold. It were better to poſſeſs the
Vulgar with the ſolid and real Foundations of
Truth. 'Twas a brave Naval-Battel that was
gain'd a few Months ſince, againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi>
under the command of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi>
but it has alſo pleas'd God at other times to
let us ſee as great Victories at our own Expence.
In fine, 'tis a hard matter to reduce Divine
things to our Balance, without waſte, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a great deal of the weight. And who
would take upon him to give a reaſon, that
<hi>Arius,</hi> and his Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> the principal Heads
of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, ſhould Die at ſeveral
times of ſo like and ſtrange Deaths, (for being
withdrawn from the Diſputation, by the Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Guts, they both of them ſuddenly
gave up the Ghoſt upon the Stool,) and would
aggravate this Divine Vengeance by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the place; might as well add the
Death of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who was alſo ſlain in a
Houſe of Office. But what? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in the ſame Fortune; God being pleas'd
to ſhew us, that the Good have ſomething,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100899:192"/>
elſe to hope for; and the Wicked ſomething
elſe to fear, than the Fortunes, or Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
of this World: He manages, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
them, according to his own ſecret Will
and Pleaſure, and deprives us of the means,
fooliſhly to make our own profit. And thoſe
People both abuſe themſelves, and us, who will
pretend to dive into theſe Myſteries by the
ſtrength of Humane Reaſon. They never
give one hit, that they do not receive two for
it; of which, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives a very great
proof upon his Adverſaries. 'Tis a Conflict,
that is more decided by ſtrength of Memory,
than the force of Reaſon. We are to content
our ſelves with the Light it pleaſes the Sun to
communicate to us, by Virtue of his Rays,
and who will lift up his Eyes to take in a
greater, let him not think it ſtrange, if for
the reward of his preſumption, he there loſe

that ſhe ſhould remove her Affection from

found out a much greater and more worthy
Fortune for her, a Husband of much greater
Power and Magnificence, that would preſent
her with Robes, and Jewels of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
wherein his deſign was, to diſpoſſeſs her of
the Appetite, and uſe of Worldly delights, to
join her wholly to God: But the neareſt and

the Death of his Daughter; he never

expreſt a ſingular Joy. This ſeems to out do
the other, foraſmuch as the applies himſelf to

take ſubſidiarily, and beſides, it was towards
his only Daughter. But I will not omit the

was brought about, by his deſires and deſign,
and how much happier ſhe was, to he remov'd

conceiv'd ſo Lively an Apprehenſion of the

Begg'd of her Husband with the extreameſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,

having ſat down before a City, and being ſtole
away from the Siege, to go keep the Feaſt of
St. <hi>Aignan</hi> at <hi>Orleans;</hi> as he was in Devotion,
at a certain place of the Maſs, the Walls of

for Captain <hi>Renſe</hi> laying Siege to the City
<hi>Verona,</hi> and having carried a Mine under a

entire, and ſo exactly upon its foundation, that

            <p>WHatever I ſhall ſay upon this Subject, I
am of neceſſity to invade ſome of the
bounds of Cuſtom, ſo careful has ſhe been to
ſhut up all the Avenues. I was diſputing
with my ſelf in this ſhivering ſeaſon, whether
the faſhion of going Naked in thoſe Nations
lately diſcover'd, is impos'd upon them, by
the hot temperature of the Air, as we ſay of
the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> or whether it be the
Original faſhion of Mankind; Men of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
foraſmuch as all things under the
Sun, as the Holy Writ declares, are ſubject to
the ſame Laws, were wont in ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as theſe, where we are to diſtinguiſh the
Natural Laws from thoſe have been impos'd
by Man's Invention, to have recourſe to the
general Polity of the World, where there can
be nothing Counterfeited. Now all other
Creatures being ſufficiently furniſh'd with all
things neceſſary for the ſupport of their being,
it is not to be imagin'd, that we only ſhould
be brought into the World in a defective and
indigent Condition, and in ſuch an eſtate as
cannot ſubſiſt without Foreign aſſiſtance; and
therefore it is, that I believe, that as Plants,
Trees, and Animals, and all things that have
Life, are ſeen to be by Nature ſufficiently
Cloath'd and Cover'd, to defend them from
the Injuries of Weather;

ſo were we: But as thoſe who by Artificial
Light put out that of the Day, ſo we by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Forms and Faſhions have deſtroy'd our
own. And 'tis plain enough to be ſeen, that
'tis Cuſtom only which renders that impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that otherwiſe is nothing ſo; for of thoſe
Nations who have no manner of knowledge of
Cloathing, ſome are ſituated under the ſame
Temperature that we are, and ſome in much
Colder Climates. And beſides, our moſt tender
Parts are always expos'd to the Air, as the
Eyes, Mouth, Noſe, and Ears; and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Labourers, like our Anceſtors in former
times, go with their Breaſts and Bellies open.
Had we been Born with a neceſſity upon us
of wearing Petticoats and Breeches, there is
no doubt, but Nature would have Fortified
thoſe Parts ſhe intended ſhould be expoſed to
the Fury of the Seaſons, with a thicker Skin,
as ſhe has done the Finger ends, and the Soles
of the Feet. And why ſhould this ſeem hard
to believe? I Obſerve much greater diſtance
betwixt my Habit, and that of one of our
Country Boors, than betwixt his, and a Man
that has no other Covering but his Skin. How
many Men, eſpecially in <hi>Turky,</hi> go naked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100899:198"/>
would ask a Beggar, whom he ſhould ſee in
his Shirt in the depth of Winter, as Brisk
and Frolick, as he who goes Muffled up to the
Ears in Furs, how he is able to endure to go
ſo? Why Sir, he might Anſwer, you go
with your Face bare, and I am all Face. The
<hi>Italians</hi> have a Story of the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>
his Fool, whom his Maſter Asking, <hi>How being

when he himſelf, warm wrapt as he was,

Stormy, or Rainy, ſoever the Weather might
be: Which alſo is reported of the Emperour
<hi>Severus. Herodotus</hi> tells us, that in the Battels

found to be without compariſon harder, than

Fought the Enemy dry-foot, and given them
a notable Defeat, the Summer following he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

in the Engagement they had with the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> near <hi>Placentia,</hi> by reaſon, that
they went on to Charge with their Blood
fix'd, and their Limbs Numb'd with Cold,
whereas <hi>Hannihal</hi> had caus'd great Fires to be
diſpers'd quite through his Camp to warm his
Souldiers, and Oil to be diſtributed amongſt
them; to the end, that Anointing themſelves,
they might render their Nerves more Supple
and Active, and ſortifie the Pores againſt the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100899:200"/>
violence of the Air, and Freezing Wind, that
Rag'd in that Seaſon. The Retreat the <hi>Greeks</hi>
made from <hi>Babylon</hi> into their own Country, is
Famous, for the Difficulties and Calamities
they had to overcome. Of which, this was
one, that being Encounter'd in the Mountains
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> with a horrible Storm of Snow,
they loſt all knowledge of the Country, and of
the ways, and being driven up, were a Day
and a Night without Eating or Drinking; moſt
of their Cattel died, many of themſelves Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Dead, ſeveral ſtruck Blind with the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and the glittering of the Snow, many of
them Maim'd in their Fingers and Toes, and
many Stiff and Motionleſs with the extremity
of the Cold, who had yet their Underſtanding
entire. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaw a Nation, where they
Bury the Fruit-Trees is Winter, to defend
them from being deſtroy'd by the Froſt, and
we alſo may ſee the ſame. But concerning
Cloaths, the King of <hi>Mexico</hi> chang'd four
times a Day his Apparel, and never put them
on more, employing thoſe he left off, in his
continual Liberalities and Rewards, as alſo,
neither Pot, Diſh, nor other Utenſil of his
Kitchen, or Table, was ever ſerv'd in Twice.</p>

no more Vertuous Actions exſtant, and thoſe
Actions that carry a ſhew of Vertue, have yet
nothing of its Eſſence; by reaſon, that Profit,
Glory, Fear and Cuſtom, and other ſuch like
foreign Cauſes, put us in the way to produce
them. Our Juſtice alſo, Valour, and good
Offices, may then be call'd ſo too, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to others, and according to the face
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100899:201"/>
they appear with to the Publick; but in the

there is another end propos'd, another mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cauſe. Now vertue owns nothing to be
hers, but what is done by her ſelf, and for
her ſelf alone. In that great Battel of <hi>Potidaea,</hi>
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> under the Command of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi>
obtain'd againſt <hi>Mardonius,</hi> and the

Glory of the Exploit, they attributed to the
<hi>Spartan</hi> Nation the Preheminence of Valour
in this Engagement. The <hi>Spartans,</hi> great
Judges of Vertue, when they came to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
to what particular Man of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Honour was due, of having the beſt
Behav'd himſelf upon this occaſion, found,
that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> had of all others hazarded
his Perſon with the greateſt Bravery: but
did not however allow him any Prize, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
by reaſon that his Vertue had been
incited by a deſire, to clear his Reputation
from the Reproach of his Miſcarriage at the
Buſineſs of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> and with a deſire to
Die Bravely, to wipe off that former Blemiſh.
Our Judgments are yet ſick, and Obey the
Humour of our deprav'd Manners. I Obſerve
moſt of the Wits of theſe Times pretend to
Ingenuity, by endeavouring to blemiſh and to
darken the Glory of the Braveſt and moſt
Generous Actions of former Ages, putting
one Vile Interpretation or another upon them,
and forging and ſuppoſing vain Cauſes and
Motives for thoſe Noble things they did.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100899:202"/>
A mighty ſubtilty indeed? Give me the greateſt
and moſt unblemiſh'd Action that ever the
Day beheld, and I will contrive a Hundred
plauſible Drifts and Ends to obſcure it: God
knows, whoever will ſtretch them out to the
full, what diverſity of Images our internal
Wills do ſuffer under; they do not ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
play the Cenſurers, as they do it
Ignorantly and Rudely in all their Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The ſame pains and licence that others
take to Blemiſh and Beſpatter theſe illuſtrious
Names, I would willingly undergo to lend
them a ſhoulder to raiſe them higher. Theſe
rare Images, and that are cull'd out by the
conſent of the wiſeſt Men of all Ages, for the
Worlds Example, I ſhould endeavour to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
anew, as far as my Invention would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
in all the Circumſtances of favourable
Interpretation. And we are to believe, that
the force of our Invention is infinitely ſhort
of their Merit. 'Tis the Duty of good Men
to Pourtray Vertues as Beautiful as they can,
and there would be no Indecency in the Caſe,
ſhould our Paſſion a little Tranſport us in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of ſo Sacred a Form. What theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do to the contrary, they either do out of
Malice, or by the Vice of confining their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to their own Capacity; or, which I am
more inclin'd to think, for not having their
ſight ſtrong, clear and elevated enough, to
conceive the ſplendour of Vertue in her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Purity: As <hi>Plutarch</hi> complains, that in
his time ſome Attributed the cauſe of the
Younger <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death, to his Fear of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:100899:202"/>
at which he ſeems very Angry, and with good
reaſon: and by that a Man may gueſs how
much more he would have been offended
with thoſe, who have Attributed it to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Senceleſs People! He would rather
have perform'd a handſome, juſt and generous
Action, and to have had Ignominy for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
than for Glory. That Man was in
truth a Pattern, that Nature choſe out to ſhew
to what height Humane Vertue and Conſtancy
could arrive: but I am not capable of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſo Noble an Argument, and ſhall therefore
only ſet five Latin Poets together by the
Ears, who has done beſt in the praiſe of <hi>Cato;</hi>
and incluſively for their own too. Now a
Man well Read in Poetry, will think the two
firſt, in compariſon of the others, a little Flat
and Languiſhing; the Third more Vigorous,
but overthrown by the Extravagancy of his
own force. He will then think, that there
will be yet room for one or two Gradations
of Invention to come to the Fourth; but
coming to mount the pitch of that, he will
lift up his Hands for admiration; the laſt, the
firſt by ſome ſpace, (but a ſpace that he will
ſwear is not to be fill'd up by any Humane
Wit,) he will be aſtoniſh'd, he will not know
where he is. Theſe are Wonders. We have
more Poets, than Judges and Interpreters of
Poetry. It is eaſier to Write an indifferent
Poem, than to underſtand a good one. There
is indeed a certain low and moderate ſort of
Poetry, that a Man may well enough judge by
certain Rules of Art; but the true, ſupream
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100899:203"/>
and divine Poeſie, is equally above all Rules
and Reaſon. And whoever diſcerns the Beauty
of it, with the moſt aſſured and moſt ſteady
ſight, ſees no more than the quick reflection
of a Flaſh of Lightning. This is a ſort of
Poeſie, that does not exerciſe, but raviſhes and
overwhelms our Judgment. The Fury that
poſſeſſes him who is able to penetrate into it,
wounds yet a Third Man by hearing him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it. Like a Loadſtone, that not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the Needle, but alſo infuſes into it the
Vertue to attract others. And it is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Eminent upon our Theatres, that the
Sacred Inſpiration of the Muſes, having firſt
ſtirr'd up the Poet to Anger, Sorrow, Hatred,
and out of himſelf, to whatever they will,
does moreover by the Poet poſſeſs the Actor,
and by the Actor conſecutively all the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
So much do our Paſſions hang and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon one another. Poetry has ever had
that power over me from a Child, to Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierce
and Tranſport me: But this quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
that is Natural to me, has been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
handled by Variety of Forms, not ſo
much higher and lower, (for they were ever
the higheſt of every kind,) as differing in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Firſt, a Gay and Spritely Fluency, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a Lofty and Penetrating Subtilty;
and laſtly, a Mature and Conſtant Force.

            <p>LEt us pretermit that old compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

and as for the fine ſaying, with which Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

let, us boldly appeal to thoſe who are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted

hand upon their Hearts, and then ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the contrary, they do not rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to Titles and Offices, and that tumult of
the World to make their private advantage
at the publick expence. But we need not
ask them the queſtion; for the corrupt ways
by which they arrive at the height to which
their ambitions aſpire, does manifeſtly enough
declare that their ends cannot be very good.
Let us then tell Ambition, that it is ſhe her
ſelf who gives us a taſte of Solitude; for what
does ſhe ſo much avoid as Society? What does
ſhe ſo much ſeek as Elbow-room? A man
may do well, or ill every where: but if what
<hi>Bias</hi> ſays be true, that the greateſt part is the
worſe, or what the Preacher ſays, that there
is not one good of a thouſand:</p>

            </q>
            <p>the contagion is very dangerous in the
Crown. A man muſt either imitate the vicious,
or hate them: Both are dangerous, either to
reſemble them, becauſe they are many, or to
hare many, becauſe they are unreſembling.
And Merchants that go to Sea are in the right
when they are cautious that thoſe who embark
with them in the ſame bottom, be neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Blaſphemers, nor vicious otherways;
looking upon ſuch ſociety as unfortunate. And
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100899:207"/>
therefore it was, that <hi>Bias</hi> pleaſantly ſaid to
ſome, who being with him in adangerous ſtorm,
implor'd the aſſiſtance of the Gods, <hi>Peace,
ſpeak ſoftly,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that they may not know you
are here in my company:</hi> And of more preſſing
example. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> Vice Roy in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
for <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in an extream
peril of Shipwrack, took a young Boy upon
his Shoulders, for this only end, that in the
Society of their common danger, his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
might ſerve to protect him, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to the Divine favour, that they
might get ſafe to Shoar: 'Tis not that a Wiſe
Man may not live every where content, either
alone, or in the crowd of a Palace: But if it be
left to his one choice, he will tell you, that he
would fly the very ſight of the latter; he can
endure it if need be; but if it be referred to
him, he will chooſe the firſt. He cannot
think himſelf ſufficiently rid of Vice, if he
muſt yet contend with it in other Men: <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondas</hi>
Puniſht thoſe for ill Men, who were
Convict of keeping of ill Company. There
is nothing ſo Unſociable, and Sociable, as
Man, the one by his Vice, the other by his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> in my opinion, did
not give him a ſatisfactory Anſwer, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
him with frequenting ill Company,
by ſaying, <hi>That the Phyſicians Liv'd well enough
amongſt the Sick:</hi> for if they contribute to the
health of the Sick, no doubt, but by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
continual ſight of, and familiarity
with Diſeaſes, they muſt of neceſſity impair
their own. Now the end I ſuppoſe is all one,

but Men do not always take the right way;
for they often think they have totally taken

exchang'd one Employment for another.

Fire that Conſum'd the City where he Liv'd,
and where he had his Wife, Children, Goods,
and all that ever he was Maſter of, deſtroy'd
by the Flame; <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes</hi> ſeeing him
in ſo great a Ruine of his Country, appear with
ſo Serene and Undiſturb'd a Countenance,
ask'd him, if he had receiv'd no Loſs? To
which he made Anſwer, No; and that, thanks
be to God, nothing was loſt of his; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was the meaning of the Philoſopher <hi>Antiſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
when he pleaſantly ſaid, That Men ſhould
only furniſh themſelves with ſuch things as
would Swim, and might with the Owner eſcape
the Storm; and certainly, a Wiſe Man never
loſes any thing, if he have himſelf. When the

Treaſures, that can ſecure themſelves from
Plunder and Violence, and to hide them in
ſuch a place, into which no one can enter, and
that are not to be betray'd by any but our
ſelves. Wives, Children and Goods, muſt
be had, and eſpecially Health, by him that
can get it; but we are not ſo to ſet our Hearts
upon them, that our Happineſs muſt have its

a Back-ſhop, a Withdrawing Room, wholly our

true Liberty, our principal Solitude and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
And in this, we muſt for the moſt

if without Wife, Children, Goods, Train, or
Attendance, to the end, that when it ſhall ſo

it may be no new thing to be without them.
We have a Mind pliable of it ſelf, that will

let us now call in our Thoughts, and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to our Selves, and to our own Eaſe, and

Retreat, it will be enough to do without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other Enterpriſes, and Deſigns, ſince God
gives us leiſure to prepare for, and to order
our Remove, let us make Ready, Truſs our

that Boys are to cauſe themſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
Men to Exerciſe themſelves in well
doing, and Old Men to retire from all Civil,
and Military employments, living at their own
Diſcretion, without the Obligation to any
certain Office. There are ſome Complexions
more proper for theſe Precepts of Retirement,
than others, ſuch as are of a Soft and Faint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
and of a tender Will, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as I am, will ſooner encline to this Advice,
than Active and Buſie Souls; which embrace
all, engage in all, and are hot upon every

up to every occaſion. We are to ſerve our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves
with theſe accidental and extraneous
things; ſo far as they are pleaſant to us, but
by no means to lay our principal Foundation
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:100899:212"/>
there. This is no true one, neither Nature,
nor Reaſon, can allow it ſo to be, and why
therefore ſhould we contrary to their Laws,
enſlave our own contentment, by giving it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the power of another: To anticipate alſo
the accidents of Fortune, and to deprive our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves
of thoſe things we have in our own
power, as ſeveral have done upon the account
of Devotion, and ſome Philoſophers by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
to ſerve a Mans ſelf, to lie hard, to
put out our own Eyes, throw Wealth into the
River, and to ſeek our Grief, (the one by the
uneaſineſs, and miſery of this Life, to pretend
to bliſs in another; the other by laying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
low to avoid the Danger of falling) are
acts of an exceſſive Nature. The Stouteſt, and

The Imagination of thoſe who
ſeek Solitude, upon the account of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
filling their Hopes with certainty of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100899:214"/>
Divine Promiſes in the other Life, is much
more rationally founded. They propoſe to
themſelves Gods, an infinite Object in Goodneſs
and Power. The Soul has there wherewithal,
at full liberty, to ſatiate her Deſires. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Sufferings turn to their advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
undergone for the acquiſition of an eternal
Health, and everlaſting Joys. Death is to
be wiſh'd and long'd for, where it is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to ſo perfect a Condition. And the
Tartneſs of theſe ſevere Rules they impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves, is immediately taken away by
Cuſtom, and all their Carnal Appetites baffled
and ſubdu'd, by refuſing to humour and feed
them; they being only ſupported by uſe and
exerciſe. This ſole end therefore, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
happy and immortal Life, is that which
really merits, that we ſhould abandon the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and conveniences of this. And who can
really and conſtantly enflame his Soul with
the Ardour of this Lively Faith and Hope,
does erect for himſelf in this Solitude, a more
Voluptuous and Delicious Life, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of Living whatever. Neither the
end then, nor the means of this Advice, of <hi>Pliny</hi>
pleaſes me, for we often fall out of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pan
into the Fire. This Book Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as painful as any other, and as great
an Enemy to Health, which ought to be the
firſt thing in every Man's proſpect; neither
ought a Man to be allur'd with the pleaſure of
it, which is the ſame that deſtroys the Wary,
Avaritious, Voluptuous and Ambitious Men.
The Wiſe give us Caution enough, to beware
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100899:214"/>
the Treachery of our Deſires, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

give it over; for I for my part am one of
thoſe who think, that no Fruit deriv'd from

limits of Pleaſure, but muſt take heed of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
further, where Solitude and Trouble
begin to mix. We are to reſerve ſo much
Employment only, as is neceſſary to keep us
in Breath, and to defend us from the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
that the other Extream, of a Dull and
Stupid Lazineſs brings along with it. There
are ſome Steril, Knotty Sciences, and chiefly
Hammer'd out for the Crowd; let ſuch be

Death.</p>

ſee how they ſhoot ſhort? Let us put into the
Counterpoiſe the Advice of two Philoſophers,
of two very different Sects, Writing, the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100899:216"/>
one to <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> the other to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> their
Friends, to Retire into Solitude from World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honours, and the Adminiſtration of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs. You have, ſay they, hitherto
Liv'd Swimming and Floating, come now,
and Die in the Harbour: You have given
the firſt part of your Life to the Light, give
what remains to the Shade. It is impoſſible
to give over Buſineſs, if you do not alſo quit
the Fruit, and therefore diſengage your
ſelves from all the Concerns of Name and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
'Tis to be fear'd, the Luſtre of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Actions will give you but too much Light,
and follow you into your moſt private, and
moſt obſcure Retreat: Quit with other Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
that which proceeds from the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of another: And as to your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Parts, never concern your ſelves,
they will not loſe their effect, if your ſelves
be ever the better for them. Remember him,
who being ask'd, why he took ſo much Pains
in an Art, that could come to the Knowledge
of but few Perſons? A few are enough for
me, reply'd he, I have enough of one, I have
enough of never a one. He ſaid true, you,
and a Companion, are Theatre enough to one
another, or you to your ſelf. Let us be to
you the whole People, and the whole People
to you but one: 'Tis an unworthy Ambition,
to think to derive Glory from a Man's Sloath
and Privacy: You are to do like the Beaſts
of Chace, who put out the Track at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into their Den. You are no more to
concern your ſelf, how the World talks of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100899:216"/>
you, but how you are to talk to your ſelf:
Retire your ſelf into your ſelf, but firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your ſelf there to receive your ſelf: It
were a folly to truſt your ſelf in your own
Hands, if you cannot Govern your ſelf, a Man
may as well miſcarry alone, as in Company,
till you have rendred your ſelf as ſuch, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom you dare not Trip and till you
have a Baſhfulneſs and Reſpect for your ſelf,
<hi>Obſervantur ſpecies honeſtae animo,</hi>

               <hi>Let juſt and

Preſent continually to you Imagination, <hi>Cato,
Phocion</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> in whoſe preſence, the
Fools themſelves will hide their Faults; and
make them Controulers of all your Intentions.
Should they deviate from Vertue, your Reſpect
to them will again ſet you right; they will
keep you in the way of being Contented with
your ſelf, to Borrow nothing of any other
but your ſelf; to reſtrain and fix your Soul
in certain and limited Thoughts, wherein ſhe
may pleaſe her ſelf, and having underſtood the
true and real Goods, which Men the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
the more they underſtand, to reſt ſatisfied,
without deſire of prolongation of Life or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.

Prating Philoſophy, ſuch as that of the two
former.</p>

            <p>ONe Word more by way of Compariſon,
betwixt theſe two. There are to be
gather'd out of the Writings of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and
this Younger <hi>Pliny,</hi> (but little in my opinion,
reſembling his Uncle in his Humour,) infinite
Teſtimonies of a beyond meaſure, Ambitious
Nature; and amongſt others, this for one,
that they both, in the ſight of all the World,
ſolicite the Hiſtorians of their time, not to
forget them in their Memoirs; and Fortune,
as if in ſpite, has made the Vacancy of thoſe
Requeſts Live upon Record down to this Age
of ours, when ſhe has long ſince Damn'd the
Hiſtories themſelves to Oblivion. But this
exceeds all meanneſs of Spirit in Perſons
of ſuch Quality, as they were, to think to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
any great and living Renown from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and Prating; even to the Publiſhing of
their private Letters to their Friends, and ſo
withal, that though ſome of them were never
ſent, the opportunity being loſt, they never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
expoſe them to the light, with this
worthy excuſe, that they were hereafter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to loſe their Labours, and have their
Lucubrations thrown away. Was it not very
well becoming two Conſuls of <hi>Rome,</hi> Soveraign
Magiſtrates of the Republick that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the World, to ſpend their time in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Quaint and Elegant Miſſives, thence to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100899:217"/>
gain the Reputation of being Criticks, in their
own Mother Tongues: What could a pitiful
School-maſter have done worſe, whoſe trade
it was to get his Living? If the Acts of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had not far enough tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
their Eloquence, I ſcarce believe they
would ever have taken the pains to have writ
them. They made it their buſineſs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
not their Speaking, but their doing.
And could the perfection of eloquence have
added any luſtre proportionable to the merit
of a great Perſon, certainly <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Laelius,</hi>
had never reſigned the honour of their Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
with all the luxuriances, and delicacies of
the Latine Tongue, to an <hi>African</hi> Slave; for
that, that work was theirs, the Beauty and
Excellency of it do ſufficiently declare; beſides,
<hi>Terence</hi> himſelf confeſſes as much, and I ſhould
take it ill from any one, that would diſpoſſeſs
me of that belief. 'Tis a kind of injurious
Mockery, and Offence, to extol a Man for
Qualities, misbecoming his Merit, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
though otherwiſe commendable in
themſelves, but ſuch as ought not however to

               <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays moreover, that to appear ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in theſe leſs neceſſary Qualities, is to
produce Witneſs againſt a Mans ſelf, that he
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100899:219"/>
has ſpent his time, and apply'd his Study ill,
which ought to have been employ'd in the
acquiſition of more neceſſary, and more uſeful
things, ſo that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard that Great <hi>Alexander</hi> his Son, Sing
once at a Feaſt to the Wonder, and Envy of
the beſt Muſicians there: Art not thou aſham'd
ſaid he to him, to Sing ſo well? And to the
ſame <hi>Philip</hi> a Muſician, with whom he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
about ſome things concerning his Art:
Heav'n forbid! Sir, ſaid he, <hi>that ſo great a
misfortune ſhould ever befal you, as to underſtand
theſe things better than I.</hi> A King ſhould be
able to anſwer as <hi>Iphicrates</hi> did the Orator,
who preſt upon him in his invective after this
manner: And what art thou, that thou
brav'ſt it at this rate? art thou a Man at
Arms, art thou an Archer, art thou a Pike?
I am none of all this; but I know how to
Command all theſe. And <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> took it
for an argument of little Valour, in <hi>Iſmenas,</hi>
that he was commended for Playing excellently
well upon a Flute. I know very well, that
when I hear any one inſiſt upon the Language
of <hi>Eſſays,</hi> I had rather a great deal he would
ſay nothing. 'Tis not ſo much to elevate the
Stile as to depreſs the Sence, and ſo much the
more offenſively, as they do it Diſgracefully,
and out of the Way. I am much deceived if
many other Eſſayiſts, deliver more worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as to the matter, and how well, or ill
ſoever, if any other Writer has ſtrewed them
either much more Material, or thicker upon
his Paper than my ſelf. To bring the more
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100899:220"/>
in, I only Muſter up the Heads, ſhould I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
the ſequel, I ſhould ſtrangely Multiply this
Volume: And how many Stories have I Seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
up and down, in this Book, that I only
touch upon, which ſhould any one more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
ſearch into, they would find matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to produce infinite Eſſays: Neither
thoſe Stories, nor my allegations do always
ſerve ſimply for Example, Authority, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
I do not only regard them for the uſe
I make of them: They carry ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what I apply them to, the ſeed of a more
Rich, and a Bolder matter, and ſometimes
collaterally a more delicate Sound both to me
my ſelf, who will expreſs no more in this
Place, and to others who ſhall happen to be
of my Ear.</p>
            <p>But returning to the ſpeaking vertue; I
find no great choice betwixt, not knowing
to ſpeak any thing but very ill, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak any thing but very well. <hi>Non
eſt ornamentum virile concinnitas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 6.</note> Neatneſs of
Stile, is no Manly Ornament. The <hi>Sages</hi> tell
us, that as to what concerns Knowledge,
there is nothing but Philoſophy; and to what
concerns effects, nothing but vertue, that is
generally proper to all Degrees, and to all
orders. There is ſomething like this in theſe
two other Philoſophers, for they alſo promiſe
Eternity, to the Letters they Write to their
Friends; but 'tis after another manner, and
by accommodating themſelves, for a good end,
to the vanity of another; for they Write to
them, that if the concern of making themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:100899:220"/>
known to future Ages, and the Thirſt of
Glory, do yet detain them in the management
of publick affairs, and make them fear the
Solitude, and Retirement to which they would
perſuade them; let them never trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more about it, foraſmuch as they ſhall
have Credit enough with Poſterity to aſſure
them, that were there nothing elſe but the
very Letters thus Writ to them, thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
will render their names as known, and
famous as their own publick actions themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
could do. And beſides this difference,
theſe are not Idle, and empty Letters, that
contain nothing but a fine Gingle of well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Words, and fine Couch'd Phraſes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repleat, and abounding with Grave, and
Learn'd Diſcourſes, by which a Man may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himſelf not more Eloquent but more Wiſe,
and that inſtruct us not to ſpeak, but to do
well: A way with that Eloquence that ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
us with its Harmony, that we ſhould
more Study it than things. Unleſs you will
allow that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> to be of ſo Supream a
perfection, as to form a compleat Body of it
ſelf: And of him I ſhall further add one
Story, we read of him to this purpoſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his nature will much more manifeſtly be
laid open to us: He was to make an Oration
in publick, and found himſelf a little ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in time, to fit his Words to his Mouth, as
he had a mind to do; when <hi>Eros</hi> one of his
Slaves brought him word, that the audience
was deferr'd till the next Day, at which he
was ſo raviſh'd with Joy, that he enfranchis'd
him for the good news.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:100899:221"/>
Upon this Subject of Letters, I will add this
more to what has been already ſaid, that it is
a kind of Writing, wherein my Friends think
I can do ſomething; and I am willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
I ſhould rather have choſe to publiſh my
Whimſies that way, than any other, had I had
to whom to Write; but I wanted ſuch a ſettled
Corrſepondency, as I once had to attract me
to it, to raiſe my Fancy, and maintain the reſt
againſt me. For to Traffick with the Wind,
as ſome others have done, and to Forge vain
Names to direct my Letters to, in a ſerious
ſubject, I could never do it but in a Dream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſworn Enemy to all manner of falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
I ſhould have been more diligent, and
more confidently ſecure, had I had a Judicious
and Indulgent Friend, to whom to addreſs,
than thus to expoſe my ſelf to various judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a whole People, and I am deceiv'd
if I had not ſucceeded better: I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
a Comick, and familiar Stile; but it is
a peculiar one, and not proper for Publick
buſineſs, but like the Language I ſpeak, too
Compact, Irregular, Abrupt, and Singular;
and as to Letters of Ceremony, that have no
other ſubſtance, than a fine contexture of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and obliging Words, I am wholly to
ſeek, I have neither faculty, nor reliſh, for
thoſe tedious offers of Service, and Affection;
I am not good natur'd to that degree, and
ſhould not forgive my ſelf, ſhould I offer more,
than I intend, which is very remote from the
preſent practice; for there never was ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and ſervile <hi>proſtitution of tenders of Life,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:100899:221"/>
Soul, Devotion, Adoration, Vaſſal, Slave,</hi> and I
cannot tell what, as now; all which expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſo commonly, and ſo indifferently Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to and fro by every one, and to every one,
that when they would profeſs a greater, and
more reſpective inclination upon more juſt
occaſions, they have not where-withal to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it: I hate all air of Flattery to Death,
which is the cauſe that I naturally fall into a
Shy, Rough, and Crude way of ſpeaking, that
to ſuch as do not know me, may ſeem a little
to reliſh of diſdain: I Honour thoſe moſt
to whom I ſhew the leaſt Honour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and where my Soul moves with the
greateſt Cheerfulneſs, I eaſily forget the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Look, and Geſture; I offer my ſelf
Faintly, and Bluntly, to them whoſe I effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
am, and tender my ſelf the leaſt to him,
to whom I am the moſt devoted: Methinks
they ſhould read it in my Heart, and that my
expreſſion would but injure the Love I have
conceived within. To Welcome, take Leave,
give Thanks, Accoſt, offer my Service, and
ſuch verbal Formalities, as the Laws of our
modern civility enjoyn. I know no Man ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly
unprovided of Language as my ſelf: And
have never been employ'd in Writing Letters
of Favour, and Recommendation, that he, in
whoſe behalf it was, did not think my media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Cold, and Imperfect. The <hi>Italians</hi> are
great Printers of Letters. I do believe I have
at leaſt an hundred ſeveral Volumes of them;
of all which, thoſe of <hi>Hannibal Caro,</hi> ſeem to
me to be the beſt: If all the Paper I have
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:100899:222"/>
Scribled to the Ladies all the time, when my
Hand was really prompted by my Paſſion, were
now in being, there might Peradventure be
found a Page worthy to be communicated to
our young enamorato's, that are Beſotted with
that Fury. I always Write my Letters Poſt,
and ſo precipitouſly, that though I Write an
intolerable ill Hand, I rather chooſe to do it
my ſelf, than to imploy another; for I can find
none able to follow me, and never tranſcribe
any; but have accuſtomed the great ones that
know me to endure my Blots, and Daſhes, and
upon Paper without Fold, or Margent. Thoſe
that coſt me the moſt Pains, are the worſt of
mine; when I once begin to draw it in by
Head and Shoulders, 'tis a ſign that I am not
there. I fall too without premeditation, or
deſign, the firſt word begets the ſecond, and
ſo to the end of the Chapter. The Letters
of this Age conſiſt more in fine Foldings, and
Prefaces, than matter; whereas I had rather
Write two Letters, than Cloſe, and Fold up
one, and always aſſign that employment to
ſome other; as alſo when the buſineſs of my
Letter is diſpatch'd, I would with all my heart
transferr it to another Hand, to add thoſe
long Harangues, Offers, and Prayers, that we
place at the Bottom, and ſhould be glad that
ſome new cuſtom would diſcharge us, of that
unneceſſary trouble; as alſo of ſuperſcribing
them with a long Ribble-row of Qualities,
and Titles, which for fear of miſtakes, I have
ſeveral times given over Writing, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MEN (ſays an ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Sentence)
are tormented with the Opinions they
have of things, and not by the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
It were a great Victory obtain'd for
the relief of our miſerable Humane Condition,
could this propoſition be eſtabliſh'd for certain,
and true throughout. For if evils have no
admiſſion into us; but by the judgment we our
ſelves make of them, it ſhould ſeem that it is
then in our own power to deſpiſe them, or
to turn them to good. If things ſurrender
themſelves to our mercy, why do we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and accommodate them to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
If what we call Evil, and Torment,
is neither Evil, nor Torment, of it ſelf, but
only that our Fancy gives it that Quality, and
makes it ſo, it is in us to change, and alter it,
and it being in our own choice, if there be no
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100899:223"/>
conſtraint upon us, we muſt certainly be very
ſtrange Fools, to take Arms for that ſide
which is moſt offenſive to us, and to give Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Want, and Contempt, a nauſeous taſte,
if it be in our power to give them a more
grateful Reliſh, and if Fortune ſimply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the matter, 'tis for us to give it the form.
Now that which we call Evil, is not ſo of it
ſelf, or at leaſt to that degree that we make
it; and that it depends upon us, to give it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
taſte or complexion, (for all comes
to one) let us examine how that can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
If the original being of thoſe things
we fear, had power to lodge themſelves in us,
by their own authority, it would then lodge
it ſelf alike, and in like manner in all; for
Men are all of the ſame kind, and ſaving in
greater, and leſs proportions, are all provided
with the ſame untenſils and inſtruments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and to judge; but the diverſity of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have or thoſe things, does clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that they only enter us by compoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
One particular Perſon, peradventure admits
them in their true being; but a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
give them a new, and contrary being in
them. We hold Death, Poverty, and Grief,
for our principal Enemies, but this Death
which ſome repute the moſt dreadful of all
dreadful things, who does not know that others
call it the only ſecure Harbour, from the
Storms, and Tempeſts of Life? The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
good of Nature? The ſole Support of
Liberty, and the common, and ſudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of all Evils? And as the one expect it
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100899:223"/>
with Fear, and Trembling, the other ſupport
it with greater Eaſe than Life. That Blade

The greateſt part of Philoſophers, are
obſerv'd to have either purpoſely prevented,
or haſtned, and aſſiſted their own Death.
How many ordinary people do we ſee led to
Execution, and that not to a ſimple Death, but
mixt with Shame, and ſometimes with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Torments, appear with ſuch aſſurance,
what through obſtinacy, or natural ſimplicity,
that a Man can diſcover no change from their
ordinary condition; Setling their Domeſtick
Affairs, recommending them to their Friends,
Singing, Preaching, and Diverting the People
ſo much, as ſometimes to Sally into Jeſts, and
to Drink to their Companions, as well as
<hi>Socrates.</hi> One that they were leading to the
Gallows, told them they muſt not carry him
through ſuch a Street, leſt a Merchant that
liv'd there, ſhould arreſt him by the way,
for an old Debt. Another told the Hangman,

heard the Tale of the <hi>Picard,</hi> to whom being

him (as our I aw does ſometimes permit!)
that if he would Marry her, they would ſave
his Life, he having a while conſidered her, and
perceiving that ſhe Halted, Come tye up, tye

Story of the ſame kind, of a fellow in

Head, and the like condition being propos'd
to him upon the Scaffold, refus'd it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Maid they offer'd him, had hollow
Cheeks, and too ſharp a Noſe. A Servant at
<hi>Tholouſe</hi> being accus'd of Hereſie, for the ſumm

Maſter, a young Student Priſoner with him,
chooſing rather to die, than ſuffer himſelf to

and the Fire, ſaid he, and the Prieſt, to give
him the extream Unction, Groping for his
Feet, which his Pain had made him pull up to
him, you will find them, ſaid he, at the end
of my Legs. To one that being preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted

all ſtript to their very Shirts. The news of

finding himſelf deceiv'd in his expectation, and
that they were all reſolv'd upon the Voyage;
he cut off two of the three Ports he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
them, to the end, that the length and

ſome; or that he might have opportunity, by
crouding them all into one place, the more

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:100899:226"/>

Death. I have ſeen an intimate Friend
of mine, run headlong upon Death with a real
affection, and that was rooted in his heart by
divers plauſible Arguments, which he would
never permit me to diſpoſſeſs him off, upon
the firſt Honourable occaſion that offer'd it ſelf
to him, to precipitate himſelf into it, without
any manner of viſible reaſon, with an obſtinate
and ardent deſire of Dying. We have ſeveral
Examples of our own times of thoſe, even ſo
much as to little Children, who for fear of a
Whipping, or ſome ſuch little thing, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd
themſelves. And, what ſhall we not
fear (ſays one of the Ancients to that purpoſe,)
if we dread that, which Cowardiſe it ſelf has
choſen for its refuge? Should I here produce a
tedious Catalogue of thoſe of all Sexes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and of all ſorts, even in the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Ages, who have either with great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
look'd Death in the Face, or voluntarily
ſought it; and ſought it not only to avoid the
Evils of this Life but ſome, purely to avoid the
Satiety of Living; and others, for the hope
of a better Condition elſewhere, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have done. Nay, the number is ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
that in truth, I ſhould have a better Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
on't, to reckon up thoſe who have fear'd
it. This one therefore ſhall ſerve for all;
<hi>Pyrrho</hi> the Philoſopher, being one Day in a
Boat, in a very great Tempeſt, ſhew'd to
thoſe he ſaw the moſt affrighted about him,
and encourag'd them by the Example of a Hog,
that was there, nothing at all concern'd at the
Storm. Shall we then dare to ſay, that this
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:100899:227"/>
advantage of Reaſon, of which we ſo much
Boaſt, and upon the account of which, we think
our ſelves Maſters and Emperours, over the
reſt of the Creatures, was given us for a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
To what end ſerves the Knowledge of
things, if it renders us more Unmanly? If we
loſe the Tranquility and Repoſe we ſhould
enjoy without it? And if it put us into a worſe
Condition, than <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s Hog? Shall we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Underſtanding, that was conferr'd
upon us for our greateſt Good, to our own
Ruine? Setting our ſelves againſt the deſign
of Nature, and the univerſal Order of things,
which intend, that every one ſhould make uſe
of the Faculties, Members and Means, he has,
to his own beſt Advantage? But it may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
be Objected againſt me; Your Rule is
true enough, as to what concerns Death: But
what will you ſay of Neceſſity? What will
you moreover ſay of Pain, that <hi>Ariſtippus, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eronymus,</hi>
and almoſt all the Wiſe Men, have
reputed the worſt of Evils? And thoſe who
have deny d it by Word of Mouth, did howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
confeſs it in Effects? <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
Tormented with a Sharp and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Diſeaſe, <hi>Pompeius</hi> came to Viſit him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
himſelf, that he had taken ſo unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a time to come to hear him diſcourſe of
Philoſophy; God forbid, ſaid <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> to
him again, that Pain ſhould ever have the
power to hinder me from talking, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
fell immediately upon a diſcourſe of the
Contempt of Pain: But in the mean time, his
own Infirmity was playing its part, and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:100899:227"/>
plagu'd him to the purpoſe; to which he
Cry'd out, thou may'ſt work thy Will Pain,
and Torment me with all the power thou haſt,
but thou ſhalt never make me ſay, that thou
art an Evil. This Story that they make ſuch
a Clutter withal, what is there in it, I fain
would know, to the Contempt of Pain? It
only Fights it with Words, and in the mean
time, if the Shootings and Dolours he felt,
did not move him, why did he interrupt his
Diſcourſe? Why did he fancy, he did ſo great
a thing, in forbearing to confeſs it an Evil?
All does not here conſiſt in the Imagination,
our Fancies may work upon other things: But
this here is a certain Science that is playing
its part, of which our Senſes themſelves are

makes Death Evil, but what follows it. And
I ſhould yet ſay more probably, that neither
that which goes before, nor that which follows

we find it doubly grievous, as it Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens

our Cowardice, for fearing a thing ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ſo inevitable, and ſo inſenſible, we take
the other as the more excuſable pretence. All
ills that carry no other danger along with
them, but ſimply the Evils themſelves, we
deſpiſe as things of no danger. The Tooth-Ach,
or the Gout, as painful as they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

fear'd in Poverty, but the Miſeries it brings
along with it, of Thriſt, Hunger, Cold, Heat,
Watching, and the other Inconveniencies it
makes us ſuffer, yet ſtill we have nothing to
do with any thing but Pain. I will grant, and
very willingly, that it is the worſt Accident of
our Being, (for I am the Man upon Earth, that
the moſt Hates, and avoids it, conſidering,
that hitherto I thank God I have had ſo little
Traffick with it,) but ſtill it is in us, if not to
annihilate, at leaſt, to leſſen it by Patience, and
though the Body ſhould Mutiny, to Maintain
the Soul nevertheleſs in a good Temper. And
were it not ſo, who had ever given Reputation
to Vertue, Valour, Force, Magnanimity, and
Reſolution? where were their parts to be

Contentment in the Soul, that we do not
enough relie upon her who is the ſole and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Miſtreſs of our Condition. The Body,
ſaving in greater or leſs proportion, has but
one and the ſame Bent and Biaſs; whereas the

to her ſelf, and to her own Empire, all
things whatſoever; both the Senſes of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

She makes her profit indifferently of all things.
Errour and Dreams ſerve her to good uſe, as
a Loyal matter to Lodge us in Safety and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
'Tis plain enough to be ſeen, that
'tis the ſharpneſs of our Conceit, that gives the
Edge to our Pains and Pleaſures. Beaſts that
have no ſuch thing, leave to their Bodies their
own free and natural Sentiments, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in every kind very near the ſame, as
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:100899:230"/>
appears by the reſembling Application of their
Motions. If we would not diſturb, in our
Members, the Juriſdiction that appertains to
them in this, 'tis to be believed, it would be
the better for us, and that Nature has given
them a juſt and moderate Temper, both to
Pleaſure and Pain; neither can it fail of being
Juſt, being Equal, and Common. But ſeeing
we have Enfranchis'd our ſelves from theſe
Rules, to give our ſelves up to the rambling
Liberty of our own Fancies, let us at leaſt
help to encline them to the moſt agreeable ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Plato</hi> fears our too vehemently engaging our
ſelves with Grief and Pleaſure, foraſmuch as
theſe too much Knit and Ally the Soul to the
Body: whereas I rather, quite contrary, by
reaſon it too much ſeparates and diſunites
them. As an Enemy is made more Fierce by
our Flight, ſo Pain grows Proud to ſee us
Truckle under it. She will ſurrender upon
much better Terms to them who make Head
againſt her: A Man muſt oppoſe, and ſtoutly
ſet himſelf againſt it. In retiring and giving
ground, we invite, and pull upon our ſelves
the Ruine that Threatens us. As the Body is
more firm in an Encounter, the more ſtiffly
and obſtinately it applys it ſelf to it; ſo is it
with the Soul. But let us come to Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which are the proper Commodity for
Fellows of ſuch feeble Reins as my ſelf;
where we ſhall find, that it is with Pain, as
with Stones, that receive a more ſpritely, or
a more languiſhing Luſtre, according to the
Foil they are ſet upon, that it has no more

They Griev'd ſo much the more, by how much

following their inſtruction, who have at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Years old endur'd to be Whipt to Death,
without changing their Countenance. And
<hi>Cicero</hi> has ſeen them Fight in Parties, with
Fiſts, Feet and Teeth, till they have fainted

overcome. Cuſtom would never Conquer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for ſhe is ever invincible, but we have
infected the Mind with Shadows, Delights,
Wantonneſs, Negligence and Sloath; and with
vain Opinions, and corrupt Manners, render'd
it Effeminate and Mean. Every one knows the
Story of <hi>Scaevola,</hi> that being ſlipt into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp to Kill their General, and having
miſs'd his Blow, to repair his fault, by a more
ſtrange Invention, and to deliver his Country,
he boldly confeſs'd to <hi>Porſenna,</hi> (who was the

in his Camp a great Number of <hi>Romans,</hi> his
Complices in the Enterprize, as good Men as
he, and to ſhew what a one he himſelf was,
having caus'd a Pan of Burning Coals to be
brought, he ſaw, and endur'd his Arm to
Broil and Roaſt, till the King himſelf, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Horrour at the ſight, commanded the Pan
to be taken away. What would you ſay of
him, that would not vouchſafe to reſpite his
Reading in a Book, whilſt he was under Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
And of the other that perſiſted to Mock

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:100899:231"/>
upon him; ſo that the provok'd Cruelty of the
Executioners that had him in handling, and
all the Inventions of Tortures redoubled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him one after another, ſpent in vain,
gave him the Bucklers? But he was a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.

Eye-witneſs of it, have both Writ and Sworn

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:100899:232"/>
Teſtimonies neareſt to us, when we have moſt
need of them; for Chriſtendom does furniſh
us with enow. And after the Example of our
Bleſſed Guide, there have been many who
would bear the Croſs. We Learn by Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
very worthy of belief, that the King St.
<hi>Lewis</hi> wore a Hair-ſhirt, till in his old Age
his Confeſſor gave him a Diſpenſation to leave

Shoulders to be drubb'd by his Prieſt with
Six ſmalls Chains of Iron, which were always
carried about amongſt his Night Accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for that purpoſe. <hi>William</hi> our laſt Duke
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> the Father of this <hi>Eleanor</hi> who has
Tranſmitted this Dutchy into the Houſes of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> continually for Ten or

Arms under a Religious Habit, by way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<hi>Fulkee</hi> Count of <hi>Anjou,</hi> went as far
as <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> there to cauſe himſelf to be
Whipt by Two of his Servants, with a Rope

Lord: But do we not moreover every <hi>Good
Friday,</hi> in ſeveral places, ſee great numbers of
Men and Women, Beat and Whip themſelves
till they Lacerate and Cut the Fleſh to the very
Bones; I have often ſeen this, and without
Enchantment, when it was ſaid, there were
ſome amongſt them, (for they go diſguis'd,)
who for Money undertook by this means to ſave
harmleſs the Religion of others, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

than thoſe of Avarice. <hi>Q. Maximus</hi> Buried his

with ſuch a Countenance as expreſs'd no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Perſon, that he had diſappointed the Divine
Juſtice: for the Violent Death of Three
grown up Children of his, being one Day ſent
him, for a ſevere Scourge, as it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
he was ſo far from being Afflicted at
the Accident, that he rather took it for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Grace and Favour of Heaven. I do
not follow theſe Monſtrous Humours, though
I loſt Two or Three at Nurſe, if not without
Grief, at leaſt, without Repining, and yet
there is hardly any Accident, that pierces near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the quick. I ſee a great many other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Sorrow, that ſhould they happen to

By which it is underſtood,<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> that the

Fierce People, who thought there was no Life
without Arms. How many do we know, who
have forſaken the Calms and Sweetneſs of a
Quiet Life, at Home amongſt their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
to ſeek out the Horrour of uninhabitable
Deſarts; and having precipitated themſelves
into ſo Abject a Condition, as to become
the Scorn and Contempt of the World, have
hug'd themſelves with the Conceit, even to
Affectation. Cardinal <hi>Barromeus,</hi> who Died
lately at <hi>Milan,</hi> in the midſt of all the Jollity
that the Air of <hi>Italy,</hi> his Youth, Birth and great
Riches invited him to, kept himſelf in ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere
a way of Living, that the ſame Robe he
wore in Summer, ſerv'd him for Winter too?
Had only Straw for his Bed, and his Hours of
vacancy from the Affairs of his Employment,
he continually ſpent in Study, upon his Knees,
having a little Bread and a Glaſs of Water ſet
by his Book, which was all the Proviſion of
his Repaſt, and all the time he ſpent in Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
I know ſome who conſentingly have Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
both Profit and Advancement from
Cuckoldry, of which the bare Name only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights
ſo many People. If the Sight be not
the moſt neceſſary of all our Senſes, 'tis at leaſt
the moſt pleaſant: But the moſt pleaſant and
moſt uſeful of all our Members, ſeem to be
thoſe of Generation, and yet a great many
have conceiv'd a Mortal Hatred againſt them,
only for this, that they were too Amiable; and
have depriv'd themſelves of them, only for
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:100899:234"/>
their Value. As much thought lie of his Eyes,
that put them out. The generality, and more
ſolid ſort of Men, look upon abundance of
Children as a great Bleſſing, I, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
think it as a great Benefit to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. And when you ask <hi>Thales,</hi> why he
does not Marry, he tells you, becauſe he has
no mind to leave any Poſterity behind him.
That our Opinion gives the value to things, is
very manifeſt in a great many of theſe which
we do not ſo much regard to prize them, but
our ſelves; and never conſider, either their
Vertues, or their Uſe; but only how dear
they coſt us: As though that were a part of
their ſubſtance: And we only repute for value
in them, not what they bring to us, but what
we add to them. By which I underſtand, that
we are great managers of our Expence. As it
weighs, it ſerves for ſo much as it weighs;
our Opinion will never ſuffer it to want of its
value. The Price gives value to the Diamond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Difficulty to Vertue, Suffering to Devotion,
and Griping to Phyſick. A certain Perſon, to
be Poor, threw his Crowns into the ſame Sea,
to which ſo many came from all parts of the
World to Fiſh and Rifle for Riches. <hi>Epicurus</hi>
ſays, That to be Rich, is no Advantage, but
only an alteration of Affairs. In plain truth,
it is not Want, but rather abundance, that
Creates Avarice. Neither will I ſtick to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

above all other Neceſſities whatever, by
no means to fail of Payment at the appointed
time, which alſo they have a Thouſand times
reſpited, ſeeing how careful I was to ſatisfie

doing a Juſt Action. Thoſe kind of payments
excepted, where the trouble of reckoning and
dodging are requir'd, and in ſuch caſes, where
I can meet with no Body to eaſe me of that
hateful Torment, I avoid them, how ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
and injuriouſly ſoever, all I poſſibly can,
for fear of thoſe little wrangling Diſputes, for

            <p>My Second Condition of Life was, to have
Money of my own; wherein I ſo order'd the
matter, that I had ſoon laid up a very notable
Summ out of ſo mean a Fortune; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with my ſelf, that that only was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
having, which a Man reſerv'd from his
ordinary Expence, and that a Man could not
abſolutely relie upon Revenue to receive, how
clear ſoever his Eſtate might be. For what,
ſaid I, if I ſhould be ſurpriz'd by ſuch or ſuch
an Accident; And after ſuch like vain and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Imaginations, would very Learnedly, by
this hoarding of Money, provide againſt all
Inconveniences; and could moreover anſwer,
ſuch as objected to me, that the number of
them was too infinite, that I could not lay
up for all, I could however do it at leaſt for
ſome, and for many. Yet was not this done
without a great deal of Solicitude and Anxiety
of Mind. I kept it very cloſe, and though I
dare talk ſo boldly of my ſelf, never ſpoke of
my Money, but falſely, as others do, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rich, pretend to be Poor, and being Poor,
pretend to be Rich, diſpenſing with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
for ever telling ſincerely what they
have. A ridiculous and ſhameful Prudence.

               </gap>t I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

my ſelf with Money, the more alſo was I load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Fear, one while of the danger of the
Roads, another of the Fidelity of him who
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:100899:236"/>
had the charge of my Sumpters, of whom, as
ſome others that I know, I was never ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Secure, if I had him not always in my
Eye. If I chanc'd to leave the Key of my
Cabinet behind me, what ſtrange Jealouſies,
and Anxiety of Mind did I enter into? And
which was worſe, without daring to acquaint
any Body with it. My Mind was eternally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with ſuch things as theſe, ſo that all
things conſider'd, there is more trouble in
keeping Money, than in getting it. And if I
did not altogether ſo much as I ſay, or was
not effectually ſo ſcandalouſly ſolicitous of my
Money, as I have made my ſelf; yet it coſt
me ſomething at leaſt to govern my ſelf from
being ſo. I reapt little or no advantage by
what I had, and my Expences ſeem'd nothing
leſs to me, for having the more to ſpend:
For, as <hi>Rion</hi> ſaid, The Hairy Men are as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
as the Bald to be pull'd; and after you are
once accuſtomed to it, and have once ſet your
heart upon your heap, it is no more at your
Service, you cannot find in your heart to break
it: 'Tis a Building that you will fanſie, muſt
of neceſſity all tumble down to Ruin, if you
ſtir but the leaſt Pibble. Neceſſity muſt firſt
take you by the Throat, before you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon your ſelf to touch it: And I would
ſooner have pawn'd any thing I had, or ſold a
Houſe, and with much leſs conſtraint upon my
ſelf, than have made the leaſt breach in that
beloved Purſe, I had ſo cunningly laid by. But
the danger was, that a Man cannot eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
certain limits to this deſire, (for they are
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100899:237"/>
hard to find in things that a Man conceives to
be good,) and to ſtint this good Husbandry
ſo, that it may not degenerate into Avarice:
Men ſtill being intent upon adding to the
heap, and encreaſing the ſtock, from Summ
to Summ, till at laſt they vilely deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the enjoyment of their own proper
Goods, and throw all into reſerve, without
making any uſe of them at all. According to
this Rule, they are the Richeſt People in the
World, who are ſet to guard the Goals, and
to defend the Walls of a Wealthy City. All
Mony'd Men I conclude to be Convetous. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Son, did a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Act upon this ſubject. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that one of the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> had hid a
Treaſure in the Earth, and thereupon ſent to
the Man to bring it to him, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did, privately reſerving a ſmall part of
it only to himſelf, with which he went to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
City, where being cur'd of his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of Hoarding, he began to Live at a more
liberal Rate. Which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> hearing, caus'd
the reſt of his Treaſure to be reſtored to him,

he very willingly returned it back unto him.</p>

a third way of living, (I ſpeak what I
think of it) doubtleſs much more pleaſant
and moderate, which is, that I live at the

ſometimes the other may perhaps exceed, but
'tis very little, and but rarely that they differ
at all; I live from Hand to Mouth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf in having ſufficient for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and ordinary Expence; for as to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occaſions, all the laying up in the
World would never ſuffice; and 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
folly imaginable to expect, that Fortune
ſhould ever ſufficiently arm us againſt her ſelf.
'Tis with our own Arms that we are to fight
her, accidental ones will betray us in the pinch
of the buſineſs. If I lay up, 'tis for ſome

I am very well pleaſed with my ſelf, that this

naturally inclined to Avarice, and that I ſee
my ſelf clear'd of a Folly ſo common to Old
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:100899:238"/>
Men, and the moſt ridiculous of all humane
Follies. <hi>Feraulez</hi> a Man that had run through
both Fortunes, and found that the encreaſe of
ſubſtance, was no encreaſe of appetite, either
to Eating, or Drinking, Sleeping, or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of his Wife, and who on the other
ſide, felt the care of his Oeconomy lie heavy
upon his Shoulders, as it does on mine; was
reſolved to pleaſe a poor Young Man his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Friend, who panted after Riches, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him a gift of all his, which was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
great, and moreover of all he was in the
daily way of getting by the liberality of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
his good Maſter, and by the War; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
that he ſhould take care handſomly
to maintain, and plentifully to entertain him,
as his Hoſt, and his Friend; which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
embrac'd, and performed, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
liv'd very happily together, both of
them equally content with the change of their
condition. An example that I could imitate
with all my heart. And very much approve
the Fortune of an Ancient <hi>Prelate,</hi> whom I
ſee to have ſo abſolutely ſtript himſelf of his
Purſe, his Revenue, and Care; of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
committing them one while to one
truſty Servant, and another while to another,
that he has ſpun out a long ſucceſſion of Years,
as ignorant by this means of his Domeſtick
Affairs, as a meer ſtranger. The confidence
of another Mans vertue, is no light evidence
of a Mans own; beſides God is pleaſed to
favour ſuch a confidence, as to what concerns
him of whom I am ſpeaking, I ſee no where
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:100899:238"/>
a better govern'd Family, nor a Houſe more
nobly, and conſtantly maintained than his,
happy in this to have ſtated his affairs to ſo
juſt a proportion, that his Eſtate is ſufficient
to do it without his care, or trouble, and
without any hinderance, either in the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or laying it up; to his other more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and quiet employments, and that are
more ſuitable both to his place, and liking.
Plenty then and indigence depend upon the
opinion every one has of them; and Riches
no more than Glory, or Health, have no more
either Beauty, or Pleaſure, than he is pleas'd
to lend them, by whom they are poſſeſt. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is well, or ill at eaſe, according as he
finds himſelf: Not he whom the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
but he who believes himſelf to be ſo,
is content; and in him alone belief gives it
ſelf being, and reality. Fortune does us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, nor hurt; ſhe only preſents us the
matter, and the ſeed, which our Soul, more
powerfully than ſhe, turns and applies as ſhe
beſt pleaſes; being the ſole cauſe, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Miſtreſs of her own happy, or unhappy
condition. All external acceſſions receive taſte
and Colour, from the internal conſtitution, as
Cloaths warm us, not with their Heat, but
our own, which they are fit to cover and keep
in; and who would cover a cold body, would
do the ſame ſervice for the Cold, for ſo Snow
and Ice are preſerved. And after the ſame
manner that Study is a torment to a Truant,
abſtinence from Wine to a good Fellow, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
to the Spend-thrift, and exerciſe to a
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:100899:239"/>
Lazy tender bred Fellow; ſo it is of all the
reſt. The things are not ſo painful, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
of themſelves, but our weakneſs or cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice
makes them ſo. To judge of great,
and high matters, requires a ſuitable Soul, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
we attribute the Vice to them, which
is really our own. A ſtraight Oar ſeems crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Water: It does not only import that
we ſee the thing, but how, and after what
manner we ſee it. But after all this, why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſo many diſcourſes, that by ſo many
arguments perſwade Men to deſpiſe Death, and
to endure pain, can we not find out one that
makes for us? And of ſo many ſorts of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
as have ſo prevailed upon others, as
to perſwade them to do ſo, why does not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one apply ſome one to himſelf, the moſt
ſuitable to his own humour? If he cannot
away with a ſtrong working Apozem to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Evil, let him at leaſt take a Lenitive
to eaſe it. <hi>Opinio eſt quaedam effeminata, ac le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis:</hi>

Becauſe it ceaſes not to attack even the wiſeſt,

Vice, of which reaſon does ſo clearly accuſe
the Vanity, as of that; but it is ſo deeply
rcoted in us, that I dare not determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any one ever clearly ſequeſtred himſelf
from it or no. After you have ſaid all, and
believed all has been ſaid to its prejudice, it

All other things are communicable, and fall
into Commerce; we lend our Goods, and
ſtake our Lives for the neceſſity, and ſervice
of our Friends; but to Communicate a Man's
Honour, and to Robe another with a Man's
own Glory, is very rarely ſeen. And yet we
have ſome examples of that kind. <hi>Catulus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatius</hi>
in the <hi>Cymbrian</hi> War, having done all

face about upon the Enemy, ran himſelf at

Coward, to the end his Men might rather ſeem
to follow their Captain, than to fly from the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:100899:240"/>
Enemy; which was to abandon his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to palliate the ſhame of others. When
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth came into <hi>Provence</hi> in the

the Emperour poſitively reſolv'd upon this

very much to his honour, did nevertheleſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtiffly oppoſe it in the Council, to the end
that the entire glory of that Reſolution ſhould
be attributed to his Maſter; and that it might
be ſaid, his own Wiſdom and foreſight had
been ſuch, as that contrary to the opinion of
all, he had brought about ſo great, and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
an Enterprize; which was to do him
Honour at his own Expence. The <hi>Thracian</hi>
Embaſſadors, coming to comfort <hi>Archileonida</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Braſidas</hi> upon the death of her
Son, and commending his to that height, as
to ſay he had not left his like behind him;
ſhe rejected this private, and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to attribute it to the publick: Tell
me not that, (ſaid ſhe) I know the City of
<hi>Sparta</hi> has ſeveral Citizens both greater, and
of greater Valour than he. In the Battel of
<hi>Creſſy,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being then very
young, had the Vantguard committed to him,
and the main ſtreſs of the Battel hapned to be
in that place, which made the Lords that were
with him, finding themſelves overmatcht, to
ſend to King <hi>Edward,</hi> that he would pleaſe
to advance to their Relief; who thereupon
enquiring of the condition his Son was in,
and being anſwered, that he was yet living,
and on Horſe-back: I ſhould then do him
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:100899:241"/>
wrong (ſaid the King) now to go, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive

he has ſo long, and ſo bravely diſputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what hazard ſoever he runs, it ſhall be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And what Fruition of Pleaſure, or Taſte of

Seven Thouſand Falconers? And beſides all

brings with it no little diſturbance and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon the Enjoyment of the moſt tempting
pleaſures: they are too conſpicuous, and lie
too open to every ones view. Neither do I

them to conceal their Errors, ſince what
is only reputed indiſcretion in us, they know
very well the people in them brand with the
names of Tyranny, and contempt of the Laws;
and beſides their proclivity to Vice, are apt to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:100899:248"/>
cenſure, that as a heightning pleaſure to
them, to Inſult over the Laws, and to trample
upon Publick Ordinances. <hi>Plato</hi> indeed, in
his <hi>Gorgeas</hi> defines a Tyrant to be one, who
in a City has Licence to do whatever his own
Will leads him to. And by reaſon of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,
the Over-tacting and Publication of
their Vices, does oft-times more Miſchief, than
the Vice it ſelf. Every one fears to be pry'd
into, and diſcover'd in their Evil Courſes; but
Princes are, even to their very Geſtures,
Looks and thoughts, the People conceiving
they have right and title to Cenſure, and be
Judges of them: Beſides, that the Blemiſhes
of the Great, naturally appear greater, by
reaſon of the Eminency and Luſtre of the
place where they are ſeated; and that a Mole
or a Wart appears greater in them, than the
greateſt Deformity in others. And this is the
reaſon why the <hi>Poets</hi> feign the Amours of
<hi>Jupiter</hi> to be perform'd in the diſguiſes of ſo
many borrowed ſhapes, that amongſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Amorous Practices they lay to his charge,
there is only one, as I remember, where he
appears in his own Majeſty and Grandeur. But
let us return to <hi>Hiero,</hi> who complains of the
Inconveniences he found in his Royalty, in that
he could not look abroad, and Travel the
World at liberty, being as it were a Priſoner
to the Bounds and Limits of his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And that in all his Actions, he was ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
ſurrounded with an importunate Crowd.
And in truth to ſee our Kings ſet all alone
at Table, environed with ſo many People pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:100899:248"/>
about them, and ſo many ſtrangers ſtaring
upon them, as they always are, I have often
been mov'd, rather to pity, than to envy,
their condition. King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was wont to
ſay, that in this, Aſſes were in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than Kings, their Maſters permitting them
to feed at their own eaſe and pleaſure; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that Kings cannot obtain of their Servants.
And it would never ſink into my fancy, that it
could be of any great benefit to the Life of a
Man of ſenſe, to have Twenty People prating
about him, when he is at Stool; or that the
Services of a Man of Ten Thouſand <hi>Livers</hi>
a Year, or that has taken <hi>Caſal,</hi> or defended
<hi>Siena,</hi> ſhould be either more commodious, or
more acceptable to him, than thoſe of a good
Groom of the Chamber, that underſtands his
place. The Advantages of Soveraignty, are
but Imaginary upon the matter: Every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Fortune has in it ſome Image of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> calls all the Lords of <hi>France,</hi>
having Free-Franchiſe within their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,
<hi>Roylets;</hi> and in truth, the Name of
<hi>Sire</hi> excepted, they go pretty far towards
Kingſhip; for do but look into the Provinces
remote from Court, as <hi>Brittany</hi> for example,
take notice of the Attendance, the Vaſſals, the
Officers, the Employments, Service, Ceremony
and State, of a Lord that Lives retir'd from
Court, is conſtant to his own Houſe, and that
has been bred up amongſt his own Tenants and
Servants; and obſerve withal, the flight of his
Imagination, there is nothing more Royal;
He hears talk of his Maſter once a Year, as of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:100899:249"/>
a King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi> without taking any
further notice of him, than ſome remote Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
his Secretary keeps in ſome Muſty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
And, to ſpeak the truth, our Laws
are eaſie enough, ſo eaſie, that a Gentlman
of <hi>France</hi> ſcarce feels the weight of Soveraignty
pinch his Shoulders above Twice in his Life.
Real and effectual Subjection, only concerns
ſuch amongſt us, as voluntarily thruſt their

Wealth and Honours by ſuch Services: For a

of ſeveral Nations, better ways of exteriour

to be very requiſite in a State) enow, without

Theſe great Bellied Doublets, that make

Locks of Hair: This fooliſh Cuſtom of Kiſſing,

only due to Princes: And that a Gentleman

ill conſequence, and 'tis enough to inform us
that the whole Fabrick is Crazy and Totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we ſee the rough-caſt of our Walls

nothing of more peſtiferous conſequence to
his City, than to give Young-Men the liberty
of introducing any change in their Habits,
Geſtures, Dances, Songs, and Exerciſes, from
one form to another; ſhifting from this to
that, Hunting after Novelties, and applauding
the Inventors; by which means Manners are
corrupted, and the old Inſtitutions come to be
nauſeated and deſpiſed. In all things ſaving
only in thoſe that are evil, a change is to be
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:100899:252"/>
fear'd; even the change of Seaſons, Winds,
Viands, and Humours. And no Laws are in
their true credit, but ſuch to which God has
given ſo long a continuance, that no one knows
their beginning, or that there ever was any
other.</p>

I have taken notice, as of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
thing of ſome great Men, who in the
higheſt Enterpriſes, and greateſt Dangers,
have detain'd themſelves in ſo ſettled and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
a Calm, as not at all to hinder their uſual
Gayety, or break their Sleep. <hi>Alexander</hi> the

Battle betwixt him and <hi>Darius,</hi> ſlept ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:100899:253"/>
and ſo long in the Morning, that
<hi>Barmenio</hi> was forc'd to enter his Chamber, and
coming to his Bed-ſide to call him ſeveral times
by his Name, the time to go to Fight compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him ſo to do. The Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put on a reſolution to Kill himſelf the
ſame night, after having ſettled his Domeſtick
affairs, divided his Money amongſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and ſet a good edge upon a Sword he
had made choice of for the purpoſe, and now
ſtaying only to be ſatisfied whether all his

this Emperour has in its circumſtances paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelling
that of the great <hi>Cato,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
this before related: For <hi>Cato</hi> being
ready to diſpatch himſelf, whilſt he only ſtaid
his hand in expectation of the return of a

whether the <hi>Senators</hi> he had ſent away, were
put out from the Port of <hi>Utica,</hi> he fell into ſo

Room; and he whom he had ſent to the Port,
having awak'd him to let him know, that the
Tempeſtuous weather had hindred the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>

another meſſenger, and compoſing himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Bed, ſettled again to ſleep, and
did ſo, till by the return of the laſt meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he had certain intelligence they were

with <hi>Alexander</hi> too, in that great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Storm that threatned him by the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:100899:253"/>
of the Tribune <hi>Metellus,</hi> who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to publiſh a Decree for the calling in of
<hi>Pompey</hi> with his Army into the City, at the

that ſtoutly oppos'd by <hi>Cato,</hi> ſo that very
ſharp language and bitter menaces paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them in the Senate about that affair;
but it was the next day in the Fore-Noon,
that the controverſie was to be decided;
where <hi>Metellus,</hi> beſides the favour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> (at that time of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Faction) was to appear accompanied with a
Rabble of Slaves and Fencers; and <hi>Cato</hi> only
fortified with his own Courage and Conſtancy;
ſo that his Relations, Domeſticks, and ſeveral
vertuous People of his Friends were in great
apprehenſions for him. And to that Degree,
that ſome there were, who paſt over the
whole Night without Sleep, Eating, or
Drinking, for the manifeſt danger they ſaw
him running into; of which his Wife and
Siſters did nothing but Weep, and torment
themſelves in his Houſe; whereas he, on the
contrary, Comforted every one, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Supp'd after his uſual manner, went to
Bed, and ſlept profoundly till Morning, that
one of his fellow <hi>Tribunes</hi> rouz'd him to go to
the encounter. The knowledge we have of
the greatneſs of this Mans Courage by the reſt
of his Life, may warrant us ſecurely to judge,
that his indifference proceeded from a Soul ſo
much elevated above ſuch accidents, that he
diſdain'd to let it take any more hold of his
Fancy, than any other ordinary adventure.
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:100899:254"/>
In the Naval Engagement, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> won
of <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> juſt as they were
to begin the Fight he was ſo faſt aſleep, that
his Friends were compell'd to wake him to
give the Signal of Battel: And this was it
that gave <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> afterwards occaſion
to reproach him, that he had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
ſo much as with open Eyes, to behold the
order of his own Squadrons, and not to have
dar'd to preſent himſelf before the Souldiers,
till firſt <hi>Agrippa</hi> had brought him news of the

young <hi>Marius,</hi> who did much worſe (for the
day of the laſt Battel, againſt <hi>Sylla,</hi> after he
had order'd his Army, given the word and
Signal of Battel, he laid him down under the
Shade of a Tree to repoſe himſelf, and fell ſo
faſt aſleep, that the Rout, and Fight of his
Men could hardly awake him, having ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Fight) he is ſaid to have been at
that time ſo extreamly ſpent, and worn out
with Labour and want of Sleep, that Nature
could hold out no longer. Now upon what
has been ſaid, the Phyſicians may determine,
whether ſleep be ſo neceſſary that our lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it: for we read that King <hi>Perſeus</hi>
of <hi>Macedon</hi> being Priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> was wak'd
to Death; but <hi>Pliny</hi> inſtances ſuch as have
lived long without ſleep. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſpeaks of
Nations, where the Men ſleep and wake by half
years: And they who write the Life of the
Wiſe <hi>Epimenides,</hi> affirm that he ſlept ſeven

            <head type="sub">Of the Battel of Dreux.</head>
            <p>OUR Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> is remarkable for
ſeveral extraordinary accidents: But
ſuch as have no great kindneſs for the Duke
of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> nor do much favour his reputation,
are willing to have him thought to blame,
and that his making a Halt and delaying time
with his Forces he Commanded, whilſt the
Conſtable who was General of the Army
was Rack'd through and through with the
Enemies Artillery, his Battalion Routed, and
himſelf taken Priſoner; is not to be excus'd:
And that he had much better have ran the
hazard of charging the Enemy in the Flank,
than ſtaying for the advantage of falling in
upon the Rear, to ſuffer ſo great and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a loſs. But, beſides what the event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
who will conſider it without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or prejudice, will eaſily be induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that the aim and deſign not of a Captain
only, but of every Private Souldier ought to
look at the Victory in general; and that no
particular occurrences, how nearly ſoever they
may concern his own intereſt, ſhould divert
him from that purſuit. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with <hi>Machanidas,</hi> having ſent before
a good ſtrong party of his Archers, to begin
the Skirmiſh, which were by the Enemy Rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and purſu'd; who purſuing them, and
puſhing on the Fortune of their Arms in the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:100899:255"/>
heat of Victory; and in that purſuit paſſing by
the Battalion where <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was, though
his Souldiers were impatient to fall on, yet he
was better temper'd, and did not think fit to
ſtir from his poſt, nor to preſent himſelf to
the Enemy to relieve his Men, but having
ſuffer'd them to be chas'd about the Field, and
Cut in pieces before his Face, then charged in
upon their Battallion of Foot, when he ſaw
them left Naked by their Horſe; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that they were <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> yet
taking them in the nick, when thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſecure of the victory, they began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
their Ranks, he did his buſineſs with
great facility, and then put himſelf in purſuit
of <hi>Machanidas.</hi> Which caſe is very like that
of <hi>Monſieur de Guiſe:</hi> In that Bloody Battel
betwixt <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> which <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi>
who was preſent at it reports to be
the rudeſt and moſt Blood that he had ever
ſeen, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> wav'd the advantage that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
preſented him, to let the <hi>Baeotians</hi> Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
paſs by, and then to Charge them in the
Rear, how certain ſoever he made himſelf of
the Victory, judging it would rather be an
effect of Conduct than Valour, to proceed
that way: And therefore, to ſhew his proweſs,
rather choſe with a wonderful ardour of
Courage to charge them in the Front; but
he was well beaten, and wounded for his pains,
and conſtrain'd at laſt to diſengage himſelf, and
to take the courſe he had at firſt neglected;
opening his Battalion to give way to this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> fury, and being paſt by,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:100899:255"/>
taking notice that they march'd in diſorder,
like men that thought themſelves out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he then purſu'd, and charg'd them in
their Flanks and Rear; yet could not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
as to bring it to ſo general a Rout, but that
they leiſurely retreated, ſtill Facing about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, till they were retired into ſafety.</p>

            <p>WHat variety of Herbs ſoever are ſhuffled
together in the Diſh, yet the whole
Maſs is ſwallow'd up in one name of a Sallet.
In like manner, under the conſideration of
Names, I will make a hodge-podge of differ'ng
Articles. Every Nation has certain Names,
that I know not why, are taken in no good
ſenſe, as with us, <hi>John, William,</hi> and <hi>Benoiſt.</hi>
In the Genealogy of Princes, alſo there ſeems
to be certain Names fatally affected, as the
<hi>Ptolemies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Henry's</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
the <hi>Charles</hi>'s of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Baldwins</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dert,</hi>
and the <hi>Williams</hi> of our Ancient <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi>
from whence, 'tis ſaid, the Name of
<hi>Guyenne</hi> has its derivation; which would ſeem
far fetch'd, were there not as rude derivations
in <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf. 'Tis a very frivolous thing
in it ſelf, but nevertheleſs worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
for the ſtrangeneſs of it, which is writ
by an Eye-witneſs; that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:100899:256"/>
making a great Feaſt in <hi>France,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Nobility and Gentry, was ſo great,
that being, for Sports ſake, divided into
Troops, according to their Names, in the
firſt Troop, which conſiſted of <hi>Williams,</hi>
there were found an Hundred and Ten Knights
ſitting at the Table of that Name, without
reckoning the ordinary Gentlemen, and their
Servants. It is as pleaſant to diſtinguiſh the
Tables by the Names of the Gueſts, as it
was in the Emperour <hi>Geta,</hi> to diſtinguiſh the
ſeveral Courſes of his Meat, by the firſt Letters
of the Ments themſelves, where thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with B, were ſerv'd up together, as
Brawn, Beef, Bream, Buſtards and Becca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficos,
and ſo of others. Now there is a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it is a good thing to have a good
Name, that is to ſay, Credit, and a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
But beſides this, it is really convenient,
to have ſuch a Name as is eaſie of pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and eaſie to be remembred; by reaſon,
that Kings, and other great Perſons, do by
that means the more eaſily know, and the
more hardly forget us; and indeed, of our
own Servants, we more frequently call and
employ thoſe, whoſe Names are moſt ready
upon the Tongue. I my ſelf have ſeen <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second, when he could not for his heart
hit of a Gentlemans Name of our Country of
<hi>Gaſcony;</hi> and moreover was fain to call one of
the Queen's Maids of Honour, by the general
Name of her Family, her own being ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to pronounce or remember. And <hi>Socrates</hi>
thinks it worthy a Fathers Care, to give fine
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:100899:256"/>
Names to his Children. 'Tis ſaid, that the
Foundation of <hi>Noſtre Dame la Grande,</hi> at
<hi>Poictiers,</hi> took its original from hence. That
a Debauch'd Young Fellow formerly Living
in that place, having got to him a Whore,
and at her firſt coming in, asking her Name,
and being anſwer'd, that it was <hi>Mary,</hi> he
felt himſelf ſo ſuddenly darted through with
the Awe of Religion, and the Reverence to
that Sacred Name of the Bleſſed Virgin,
that he not only immediately put his Lewd
Miſtreſs away from him, but became a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Man, and ſo continued the remainder
of his Life: And that in conſideration of
this Miracle, there was Erected upon the
place, where this Young Mans Houſe ſtood,
firſt a Chappel Dedicated to our Lady, and
afterwards the Church that we now ſee
ſtanding there. This Auricular Reproof
wrought upon the Conſcience, and that right
into the Soul. This that follows, inſinuated
it ſelf meerly by the ſenſe. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in company with ſome wild Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and perceiving that, heated with the
Feaſt, they complotted to go Violate an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Houſe, commanded the Singing Wench
to alter her Wanton Airs; and by a Solemn,
Grave and Spondaick Muſick, gently enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and laid aſleep their Ardour. Will not
Poſterity ſay, that our Modern Reformation
has been wonderfully exact, in having not
only ſcuffled with, and overcome Errors and
Vices, and fill'd the World with Devotion.
Humility, Obedience, Peace, and all ſorts of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:100899:257"/>
Vertue; but to have proceeded ſo far, as to
quarrel with the Ancient Baptiſmal Names of
<hi>Charles, Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> to fill the World
with <hi>Methuſalems, Ezekiels,</hi> and <hi>Malachies,</hi> of
a more Scriptural ſound? A Gentleman, a
Neighbour of mine, a great Admirer of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and who was always preferring the
Excellency of preceeding Times, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with this preſent Age of ours, did not
(amongſt the reſt) forget to Magnifie the
Lofty and Magnificent ſound of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Names of thoſe Days, <hi>Don Grumedar,
Quadregan, Angeſilan,</hi> &amp;c. which but to hear
Nam'd, he perceiv'd to be other kind of Men,
than <hi>Pierre, Guillot</hi> and <hi>Michel.</hi> I am mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd with <hi>Jaques Amiot,</hi> for leaving
throughout a whole <hi>French</hi> Oration, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Names entire, without varying and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting
them, to give them a <hi>French</hi> terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It ſeem'd a little harſh and rough at firſt:
But already Cuſtom, by the Authority of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
(whom he took for his Example) has
overcome that Novelty. I have often wiſh'd,
that ſuch as write Chronicle Hiſtories in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
would leave our Names as they find them,
and as they are, and ought to be, for in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Vaudemont, Vallemontances,</hi> and Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing
Names, to make them ſuit better with
the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> we know not where we
are, and with the perſons of the Men, loſe
the benefit of the Story. To conclude, 'tis a
ſcurvy Cuſtom, and of very ill conſequence,
that we have in our Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> to
call every one by the Name of his Mannor, or
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:100899:257"/>
Signeury, and the thing in the World that
does the moſt prejudice, and confound Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Deſcents. A Younger Brother of a
good Family, having a Mannor left him by his
Father, by the Name of which he has been
known and honour'd, cannot handſomely
leave it; Ten Years after his Deceaſe, it falls
into the hand of a ſtranger, who does the
ſame: Do but judge whereabouts we ſhall be,
concerning the knowledge of theſe Men. We
need look no further for Examples, than our
own Royal Family, where every Partage cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares
a new Sir-name, whilſt in the mean time
the Original of the Family is totally loſt.
There is ſo great liberty taken in theſe Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I have not in my time ſeen any one
advanc'd by Fortune to any extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
who has not preſently had Genealogick
Titles added to him, new, and unknown to his
Father, and who has not been inoculated into
ſome illuſtrious Stem; and by good Luck, the
obſcureſt Families, are the moſt proper for Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification.
How many Gentlemen have we in
<hi>France,</hi> who, by their own talk, are of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Extraction? More I think, than who will
confeſs they are not. Was it not a pleaſant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of a Friend of mine? There were a great
many Gentlemen aſſembled together, about
the diſpute of one Lord of a Mannor, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
which other had in truth, ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
of Titles and Alliances, above the
ordinary Scheme of Gentry. Upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of this Priority of Place, every one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up for himſelf, to make himſelf equal to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:100899:258"/>
him, alledging one one Extraction, another
another, one the near reſemblance of Name,
another of Arms, another an old worm-eaten
Patent, and the leaſt of them, Great-Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
to ſome Foreign King. When they
came to ſit down to dinner, my Friend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of taking his place amongſt them, retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with moſt profound Congees, entreated
the Company to excuſe him, for having hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Liv'd with them at the ſawcy rate of a
Companion: but being now better inform'd
of their Quality, he would begin to pay them
the Reſpect due to their Birth and Grandeur,
and that it would ill become him to ſit down
among ſo many Princes; and ended the Farce
with a Thouſand Reproaches. Let us in God's
Name ſatisfie our ſelves with what our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were contented, and with what we are:
We are great enough, if we rightly underſtand
how to maintain it: Let us not diſown the
Fortune and Condition of our Anceſtors and
lay aſide theſe ridiculous pretences, that can
never be wanting to any one that has the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to alledge them. Arms have no
more Security, than Sir-names. I bear <hi>Azure
powdered with Trefoiles, Or, with a Lyons Paw
of the ſame armed gules in Feſſe.</hi> What Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to continue particularly in my Houſe and
Name? A Son-in-Law will tranſport it into
another Family; or ſome paltry Purchaſer
will make them his firſt Arms; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherein there is more change and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
But this conſideration leads me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
into another ſubject. Let us pry a little
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:100899:258"/>
narrowly into, and in God's name examine
upon what foundation we erect this Glory and
Reputation, for which the World is turn'd
topſy turvy: Wherein do we place this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
that we hunt after with ſo great fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy,
and through ſo many impediments,
and ſo much trouble? It is in concluſion, <hi>Peter</hi>
or <hi>William</hi> that carries it, takes it into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and whom it only concerns. O what
a valiant faculty is hope, that in a mortal
ſubject, and in a moment makes nothing of
uſurping infinity and immenſity, and of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
her Maſters Indigence at her pleaſure
with all things he can imagine, or deſire! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has given us this paſſion for a pretty toy
to play withal. And this <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>William,</hi>
what is it but a ſound when all is done? or
three or four daſhes with a Pen, ſo eaſie to be
varied, that I would fain know to whom is
to be attributed the glory of ſo many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to <hi>Gueſquin,</hi> to <hi>Gleſquin,</hi> or to <hi>Gueaquin?</hi>
and yet there would be ſomething of greater
moment in the caſe, than in <hi>Lucian,</hi> that <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>

the Game is new to begin, and that is not to
be call'd a Victory, that puts not an end to the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:100899:261"/>
War. In the encounter where <hi>Caeſar</hi> had the

<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Souldiers, that he had been

and afterwards claw'd him away in

the contrary, that it is the effect of a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and inſatiate Spirit, not to know how
to bound, and reſtrain its ardour: that it is
to abuſe the favours of God to exceed the

to throw a Mans ſelf into danger, after a

            <p>This was it that made <hi>Pharax</hi> withhold the
King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> who had won a Battle of
the <hi>Matineans,</hi> from going to Charge a
Thouſand <hi>Argians,</hi> who were eſcap'd in an
entire Body from the defeat; but rather let
them ſteal off at liberty, that he might not

<hi>Clodomire</hi> King of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> after
his Victory purſuing <hi>Gondemar,</hi> King of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
beaten, and making off as faſt as he
could for ſafety, compell'd him to face about,
and make head, wherein his obſtinacy depriv'd
him of the fruit of his Conqueſt, for he there
loſt his Life.</p>
            <p>In like manner, if a Man were to choſe,
whether he would have his Souldiers <hi>Ainquant,</hi>
and richly accoutred with Damaskt Arms, or
arm'd only for neceſſary defence; this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would ſtep in, in favour of the firſt (of
which Opinion was <hi>Sertorius, Philopoemen, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Caeſar,</hi> and others) that it is to a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
an enflaming of Courage, and a ſpur to
Glory, to ſee himſelf brave, and withal an
imitation to be more obſtinate in Fight, having
his Arms, which are in a manner his Eſtate,
and whole Inheritance to defend, which is the
reaſon (ſays <hi>Xenophon</hi>) why thoſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
carried there Wives, Concubines, with their
choiceſt Jewels, and greateſt Wealth along
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:100899:262"/>
with them to the Wars. But then theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
would be as ready to ſtand up for
the other ſide, that a General ought rather to
render his Men careleſs and deſperate, than to
encreaſe their ſolicitude of preſerving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
That by this means they will be in a
double fear of hazarding their perſons; as it
will be a double temptation to the Enemy, to
fight with greater Reſolution, where ſo great
booty and ſo rich ſpoils are to be obtain'd:
And this very thing has been obſerv'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, notably to encourage the <hi>Romans</hi>
againſt the <hi>Samnites. Antiochus</hi> ſhewing <hi>Hannibal</hi>
the Army he had raiſed wonderfully ſplendid,
and Rich in all ſorts of Equipage, askt him, if
the <hi>Romans</hi> would be ſatisfied with that Army?
Satisfied? replied the other, yes doubtleſs
were their Avarice never ſo great. <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
not only forbad his Souldiers all manner of
Bravery in their Equipage, but moreover to
ſtrip their Conquer'd Enemies, becauſe he
would (as he ſaid) that Poverty, and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
ſhould ſhine with the reſt of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
            <p>At Sieges, and elſewhere, where occaſion
draws us near to the Enemy, we willingly ſuffer
our Men to Brave, Rate, and Affront the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with all ſorts of injurious Language; and
not without ſome colour of reaſon: For it is
of no little conſequence, to take from them
all hopes of Mercy, and Compoſition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
to them, that there is no fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be expected from an Enemy, they have
incens'd to that degree, nor other Remedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:100899:262"/>
but in the victory. And yet <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
found himſelf deceiv'd in this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
for having to do with <hi>Otho,</hi> weaker
in the valour of his Souldiers, long unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to war, and effeminated with the
delights of the City; he ſo nettled them at
laſt with injurious Language, reproaching them
with Cowardize, and the regret of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes,
and entertainments they had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at <hi>Rome,</hi> that by this means he inſpir'd
them with ſuch reſolution, as no exhortation
had had the power to have done; and himſelf
made them fall upon him, with whom their
own Captains before could by no means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
And indeed when they are Injuries that
touch to the quick, it may very well fall out,
that he who went but ill-favour'dly to work in
the behalf of his Prince, will fall to't with
another ſort of Mettle, when the quarrel is
his own.</p>
            <p>To conſider of how great importance is the
preſervation of the General of an Army, and
that the Univerſal aim of an Enemy is levell'd
directly at the head, upon which all the others
depend; the advice ſeems to admit of no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
which we know has been taken by ſo
many great Captains of changing their habit,
and diſguiſing their perſons upon the point of
going to engage. Nevertheleſs the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
a Man by ſo doing runs into, is not leſs
than that he thinks to avoid: For the Captain
by this means being conceal'd from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his own Men, the Courage they ſhould
derive from his Preſence and Example, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:100899:263"/>
by degrees to cool and to decay; and not
ſeeing the wonted<note n="*" place="margin">As at the Battle of <hi>Ivry,</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Henry the Great.</hi>
               </note> Marks, and Enſigns of

Dead, or that, deſpairing of the buſineſs,
he is gone to ſhift for himſelf; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhews us that both theſe ways have been
both ſucceſsful, and otherwiſe. What beſell
<hi>Pyrrbus</hi> in the Battel he fought againſt the
Conſul <hi>Levinus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> will ſerve us to both
purpoſes: For though by ſhrouding his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
under the Arms of <hi>Demogacles,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him wear his own, he undoubtedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
his own Life, yet by that very means
he was withal very near running into the other
miſchief of loſing the Battel. <hi>Alexander,
Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> lov'd to make themſelves
known in a Battel, by Rich Furnitures, and
Arms of a particular Luſtre and Colour: <hi>Agis,
Ageſilaus,</hi> and that great <hi>Gilippus</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
us'd to Fight obſcurely Armed, and
without any imperial attendance, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other overſights <hi>Pompey</hi> is charg'd
withal, at the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for making his Army ſtand ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Enemies Charge; by reaſon that
(I ſhall here ſteal <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s own words,
that are better than mine) he by ſo doing,
depriv'd himſelf of the violent impreſſion,
the motion of running adds to the firſt ſhock
of Arms, and hindred the juſtle of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants
(who were wont to give great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity,
and fury to the firſt Encounter; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when this came to ruſh in with their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:100899:263"/>
Vigour, their Courages increaſing by the
Shouts and the Career) rendering the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Animoſity, and Ardour, as a Man may ſay,
more reſerv'd, and cold. This is what he
ſays: But if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had come by the worſe,
why might it not as well have been urg'd by
another, that, on the contrary the ſtrongeſt,
and moſt ſteady poſture of Fighting, is that
wherein a Man ſtands planted firm without
motion; and that who makes a halt upon
their march, cloſing up, and reſerving their
force within themſelves for the puſh of the
buſineſs, have a great advantage againſt thoſe
who are diſordered, and who have already
ſpent half their breath in running on precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
to the charge? Beſides, that an Army
being a Body made up of ſo many individual
Members, it is impoſſible for it to move in this
fury with ſo exact a motion, as not to break
the order of Battel, and that the beſt of Foot
are not engag'd, before their Fellows can come
in to relieve them. In that unnatural Battel
betwixt the two <hi>Perſian</hi> Brothers, the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian
Clearchus,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Greeks</hi>
of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s party, led them on ſoftly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
precipitation, to the Charge; but coming
within fifty paces hurried them on full ſpeed,
hoping in ſo ſhort a Career, both to look to
their order, to husband their breath, and at
the ſame time to give an advantage of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and impreſſion both to their perſons,
and their miſſile Arms: Others have regulated
this queſtion in charging thus; if your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
come running upon you, ſtand firm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:100899:264"/>
him; if he ſtand to receive you, run full
drive upon him.</p>
            <p>In the Expedition of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth into <hi>Provence,</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> was put
to chooſe either to go meet him in <hi>Italy,</hi> or to
expect him in his own Dominions; wherein
though he very well conſidered of how great
advantage it was, to preſerve his own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
entire, and clear from the troubles, and
inconveniences of the war, to the end that
being unexhauſted of her ſtores, it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
ſupply Men, and Money at need, that
the neceſſity of War requires at every turn to
ſpoil, and lay waſte the Country before them,
which cannot very well be done upon ones
own; to which may be added that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people do not ſo eaſily digeſt ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
by thoſe of their own party, as from an
Enemy, ſo that Seditions and Commotions
might by ſuch means be kindled amongſt us;
that the Licence of Pillage and Plunder (which
are not to be tolerated at home) is a great
eaſe and refreſhment againſt the fatigues, and
ſufferings of War; and that he who has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proſpect of gain, than his bare pay, will
hardly be kept from running home, being but
two ſteps from his Wife, and his own Houſe:
That he who lays the Cloth, is ever at the
charge of the Feaſt: That there is more Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
in aſſaulting than defending, and that
the ſhock of a Battels loſs in our own Bowels,
is ſo violent as to endanger the disjointing of
the whole Body, there being no paſſion ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
as that of fear; that is ſo eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:100899:264"/>
or that ſo ſuddenly diffuſes its Poiſon;
and that the Cities that ſhould hear the Rattle
of this Tempeſt, that ſhould take in their
Captains, and Souldiers yet trembling and out
of breath, would be in danger in this heat and
hurry, to precipitate themſelves upon ſome
untoward reſolution: Notwithſtanding all
this, ſo it was, that he choſe to recall the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he had beyond the Mountains, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Enemy to come to him. For he might
on the other ſide imagine, that being at home
and amongſt his Friends he could not fail of
plenty of all manner of conveniences; the
Rivers, and Paſſes he had at his Devotion,
would bring him in both Proviſions and Money
in all ſecurity, and without the trouble of
Convoy; that he ſhould find his ſubjects by ſo
much the more affectionate to him, by how
much their danger was more near and preſſing;
that having ſo many Cities and ſtops to ſecure
him, it would be in his power to give the Law
of Battel at his own opportunity and beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and if it pleas'd him to delay the
time, that under covert, and at his own eaſe,
he might ſee his Enemy founder, and defeat
himſelf with the difficulties he was certain to
encounter, being engag'd in an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where before, behind, and on every ſide
War would be made upon him; no means to

loſing a Battle, no poſſible means of ſaving
the remains. Neither is there want of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in both theſe caſes. <hi>Scipio</hi> thought it
much better to go attack his Enemies Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
in <hi>Africk,</hi> than to ſtay at home to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his own, and to Fight him in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
it ſucceeded well with him: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> in the ſame War ruin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
by abandoning the Conqueſt of a ſtrange
Country, to go defend his own. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
having left the Enemy in their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,

King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> found her favourable
to him, when he went over into <hi>Africk,</hi> and
left the War at home. By which Examples,
and divers others, we are wont to conclude,
and with ſome reaſon, that events, eſpecially
in War, do for the moſt part depend upon
Fortune, who will not be govern'd by, nor
ſubmit unto humane prudence; according to
the Poet.

to help their Riders, ſo as to run upon any

that they do more harm to their Friends than

that they had the moſt ready Horſes of any

'Tis ſaid, both of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other excellent Qualities they were
Maſters of, they were both excellent Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and particularly of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that in his
Youth, being Mounted on the bare Back,

an extraordinary manner: For every

had a head enclining to the ſhape of a Bull,
that he would ſuffer himſelf to be Mounted
and Govern'd by none but his Maſter, and that
he was ſo Honour'd after his Death, as to have
a City erected to his Name. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had alſo
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:100899:267"/>
another, who had Fore-feet like the Hands of
a Man, his Hoof being divided in the form

by any but <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf; who after
his Death dedicated his Statue to the Goddeſs
<hi>Venus.</hi> I do not willingly alight when I am
once on Horſe-back; for it is the place where,
whether well, or ſick, I find my ſelf moſt a
eaſe. <hi>Plato</hi> recommends it for health, as alſo
<hi>Pliny</hi> ſays it is good for the Stomach, and
the Joints. We read in <hi>Xenophon</hi> a Law, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
any one who was Maſter of a Horſe to
Travel on Foot. <hi>Trogus</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> ſay,
That the <hi>Parthians</hi> were wont to perform all
Offices and Ceremonies, not only in War,
but alſo all Affairs, whether publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
make Bargains, conferr, entertain, take
the Air, and all on Horſe-back; and that the
greateſt diſtinction betwixt Free-men and
Slaves amongſt them, was, that the one rode
on Horſe-back, and the other went on Foot:
An Inſtitution of which, King <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the
founder. There are ſeveral Examples in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, (and <hi>Suetonius</hi> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
obſerves it of <hi>Caeſar</hi>) of Captains,
who in preſſing occaſions Commanded their
Cavalry to alight, both by that means to take
from them all hopes of Flight, as alſo for the
advantage they hop'd for in this ſort of Fight.
<hi>Quo haud dubie ſuperat</hi> Romanus. Wherein

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:100899:267"/>
Arms and Horſes: And therefore it is that we
ſo often meet in <hi>Caeſar:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caeſars Com.</note> 
               <hi>Arma proferri, jumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

the Arms to be produc'd, the Horſes brought
out, and Hoſtages to be given. The <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> to this Day, ſuffers not a Chriſtian, or
a <hi>Jew,</hi> to keep a Horſe of his own, throughout
his Empire. Our Anceſtors, at the time they
had War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in all their greateſt
Engagements, and pitch'd Battels, fought for
the moſt part on Foot, that they might have
nothing but their own Force, Courage and
Conſtancy, to truſt to, in a Quarrel of ſo
great Concern, as Life and Honour. You
ſtake (whatever <hi>Chryſantes</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſays
to the contrary,) your Valour, and your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
upon that of your Horſe, his Wound or
Death brings your Perſon into the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
his Fear or Fury ſhall make you reputed
Raſh or Cowardly; if he have an ill Mouth,
or will not anſwer to the Spur, your Honour
muſt anſwer it: And therefore I do not think
it ſtrange, that thoſe Battels I ſpoke of before,
were more firm and furious, than thoſe that
are Fought on Horſe-back.

ſhould adviſe to chooſe them of the ſhorteſt
ſort, and ſuch of which we are able to give the

in a Sword he holds in his Hand, than
in a Bullet he diſcharges out of a Piſtol,
wherein there muſt be a concurrence of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
executions, to make it perform its office,
the Powder, the Stone, and the Wheel, if
any of which fail, it at leſt endangers your
Fortune: A Man ſtrikes much ſurer than the
Air directs him.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:100899:268"/>
I look upon it as a Weapon of very little exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and hope we ſhall one day lay it aſide.
That miſſile Weapon which the <hi>Italians</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made uſe of both with Fire and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
was much more terrible: They called a
certain kind of <hi>Javeline</hi> Armed at the point
with an Iron three foot long, that it might
pierce through and through an Armed Man,
<hi>Phalarica,</hi> which they ſometimes in Field-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
darted by hand: ſometimes from ſeveral
ſorts of Engines for the defence of beleagured
places: The ſhaft whereof being roul'd round
with Flax, Wax, Rozin, Oyl, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
matter, took Fire in its flight, and
lighting upon the Body of a Man, or his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guet,
took away all the uſe of Arms and
Limbs. And yet coming to cloſe fight, I
ſhould think they ſhould alſo endamage the
Aſſailant, and that the Camp being as it were
planted with theſe Flaming <hi>Truncheons,</hi> ſhould
produce a common inconvenience to the

and his Noſe thruſt out. King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> he
who firſt inſtituted the Order <hi>des Chevaliers
de la Bande,</hi> or <hi>de l' Eſcherpe</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> amongſt
other rules of the Order gave them this, That
they ſhould never ride Mule or Mulet, upon
penalty of a Mark of Silver; which I had
lately out of <hi>Guevara</hi>'s Letters, which whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave them the title of Golden Epiſtles, had
another kind of opinion of them than I have,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:100899:270"/>
and perhaps ſaw more in them than I do. The

to a Gentleman to ride one of theſe

as they are nearer advanc'd to the perſon of
<hi>Preſter John,</hi> do affect to be mounted upon
large Mules, for the greater dignity and grari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
<hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi>
were fain to keep their Horſes fetter'd in the
Stable, they were ſo fierce and vicious: and
that it requir'd ſo much time to looſe and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
them, that to avoid any diſorder this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
preparation might bring upon them,
in caſe of ſurprize, they never ſat down in their
Camp, till it was firſt well fortified with Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Rampiers. His <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was ſo
great a Maſter in all manner of Horſe Service,
kept his Horſes to their ordinary, and never
ſuffer'd them to have any thing to eat till firſt
they had earn'd it by the ſweat of ſome kind of
exerciſe. The <hi>Scythians</hi> when in the Field, and

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:100899:271"/>

(of which every one may eaſily carry

how to feed upon the Bloud of their Horſes,
as well as the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> and ſalt
it for their uſe. Theſe new diſcover'd people
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt landed
amongſt them, had ſo great an opinion both
of the Men and Horſes, that they look'd upon
the firſt as Gods, and the other Animals eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
above their nature. Inſomuch that after
they were ſubdu'd, coming to ſue for Peace,
and to bring them Gold and Proviſions, they
fail'd not to preſent of the ſame to the Horſes,
with the ſame kind of harangue to them, they
had made to the other; interpreting their
neighing for a language of Truce and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
In theſe nearer <hi>Indies,</hi> to ride upon an
Elephant was the firſt place of Honour, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to ride in a Coach with four Horſes, the
third to ride upon a Camel, and the laſt to be
carried, or drawn by own Horſe only. Some
one of our late Writers tells us, that he has
been in a Country in thoſe parts, where they
ride upon Oxen with Pads, Stirrups, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
and very much at their eaſe. <hi>Quintas
Fabius Maximus Rutilianus</hi> in a Battel with
the <hi>Samnites</hi> ſeeing his Horſe, after three or
four Charges, had fail'd of breaking into the
Enemies battalion, took his courſe, to make
them unbridle all their Horſes, ſo that having
nothing to check their Career, they might
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:100899:271"/>
through Weapons and Men, open the way to
his foot,<note place="margin">Liv. l. 40.</note> who by that means gave them a bloudy
defeat. The ſame command was given by <hi>Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus</hi> againſt the <hi>Celtiberians: Id cum
majore vi equorum facietis, ſi effroenatos in hoſtes
equos immittatis: quod ſaepe Romanos equites cum
laude feciſſe memoriae proditum eſt. Detractiſque
froenis his ultro citreque cum magna ſtrage hoſtium,
infractis omnibus haſtis, tranſcurrerunt.</hi> You
will do your buſineſs with greater advantage
of your Horſes ſtrength, if you ſpur them
anbridled upon the Enemy, as it is recorded
the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe to their great Glory have
often done. And their Bits being pull'd off
without breaking a Launce, to have charg'd
through and through, with greater Slaughter
of the Enemy: The Duke of <hi>Muſcovie</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
oblig'd to pay this reverence to the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> that when they ſent any one Embaſſy
to him, he went out to meet them on foot,
and preſented them with a Mazer, or Goblet
of Mares Milk (a beverage of greateſt eſteem
amongſt them) and ſo great, that if in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a drop fell by chance upon the Horſes
Main, they thought themſelves indiſpenſably
bound to lick it off with their Tongue: The
Army that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had ſent into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> was
overwhelm'd with ſo dreadful a Tempeſt of
Snow, that to ſhelter, and preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from ſtarving, many ript up, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowell'd
their Horſes, to creep into their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and enjoy the benefit of that Vital heat.
<hi>Bajazet,</hi> after that furious Battel wherein he
was overthrown by <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> was in a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:100899:272"/>
way of ſecuring his own perſon by the
fleetneſs of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Mare he had under him,
had he not been conſtrain'd to let her drink
her fill at the ford of a River in his way,
which render'd her ſo heavy and indiſpos'd,
that he was afterwards eaſily overtaken by
thoſe that purſu'd him: They ſay indeed that
to let a Horſe ſtale takes him off his mettle,
but I ſhould rather have thought that drinking
would have refreſht her, and reviv'd her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
<hi>Croeſus</hi> marching his Army through cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
furrs near <hi>Sardis,</hi> met with an infinite
number of Serpents, which the Horſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with great appetite, and which <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>
ſays was a prodigy of ominous portent
to his Affairs. We call a Horſe <hi>Cheval entier,</hi>
that has his Main, Ears, and other parts entire,
and no other will paſs muſter. The <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
having defeated the <hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
returning triumphant from the victory into
the City of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> amongſt other inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
caus'd all the Horſes they had taken to
be ſhorn, and led in triumph. <hi>Alexander</hi>
fought with a Nation call'd <hi>Daae;</hi> a people
whoſe Diſcipline it was to march two and
two together, Arm'd on Horſe-back to the
War, and being in Fight one always alighted,
and ſo they fought one while on Horſe-back
and another on Foot, one after another by
turns. I do not think that for graceful riding,
any Nation in the World excells the <hi>French;</hi>
though a good Horſeman, according to our
way of ſpeaking, ſeems rather to reſpect the
Courage of the Man than his Horſemanſhip
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:100899:272"/>
and addreſs in riding. Of all that ever I ſaw
the moſt knowing in that Art, that had the
beſt ſeat, and the beſt method in breaking
Horſes, was <hi>Monſieur de Carnevalet</hi> who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: I have ſeen
a Man ride with both his feet upon the Saddle,
take off his Saddle, and at his return take it
up again, refit, and remount it, riding all the
while full ſpeed: having Gallopt over a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
make at it very good ſhoots, backwards
with his Bow, take up any thing from the
ground, ſetting one foot down and the other
in the Stirrup; with twenty other Apes-tricks,
which he got his living by. There has been
ſeen in my time at <hi>Constantinople</hi> two Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Horſe, who in the height of his ſpeed
would throw themſelves off, and into the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
again by turn, and one who Bridled and
Saddled his Horſe with nothing but his Teeth.
Another who betwixt two Horſes, one foot
upon one Saddle, and another upon the other,
carrying another upon his Shoulders; would
ride full career, the other ſtanding bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
upon him, making very good ſhoots
with his Bow. Several who would ride full
ſpeed with their heels upwards, and their
Hands upon the Saddle betwixt ſeveral <hi>Scymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
with the points upward fixt in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
When I was a Boy, the Prince of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi>
riding a rough Horſe at <hi>Naples</hi> to all
his Airs, held Reals under his Knees and Toes;
as if they had been nail'd there, to ſhew the

that degree of indiſcretion, as to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be impos'd upon by authority of the
preſent Uſance, as every Month to alter their
Opinion, if Cuſtom ſo require, and that they
ſhould ſo vary their judgment in their own

Belly-pieces of their Doublets up as high as

were in their proper place: Some Years after
they were ſlipt down between their Thighs,
and then they could laugh at the former faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

now in uſe, makes them abſolutely condemn
the other two, with ſo great indignation, and
ſo univerſal contempt, that a Man would think,
there was a certain kind of Madneſs crept in

that our change of Faſhions is ſo prompt

            <p>THE Judgment is an Utenſil proper for
all ſubjects, and will have an Oar in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing: Which is the reaſon, that in theſe
Eſſays I take hold of all occaſions. Where,
though it happen to be a ſubject I do not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well underſtand, I try however, ſounding
it at a diſtance, and finding it too deep for
my ſtature, I keep me on the firm ſhoar: And
this knowledge that a Man can proceed no
further, is one effect of its Vertue, even in
the moſt inconſidering ſort of Men. One
while in an idle and frivolous ſubject, I try to
find out matter whereof to compoſe a Body,
and then to prop, and ſupport it. Another
while I employ it in a noble ſubject, one that
has been toſt and tumbled by a Thouſand
Hands, wherein a Man can hardly poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
any thing of his own, the way being
ſo beaten on every ſide, that he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
walk in the ſteps of another. In ſuch a
caſe, 'tis the work of the Judgment to take
the way that ſeems beſt, and of a Thouſand
Paths, to determine that this or that, was the
beſt choſen. I leave the choice of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Fortune, and take that ſhe firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
me; they are all alike to me, I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to go through any of them; for I never
ſee all of any thing: Neither do they who ſo
largely promiſe to ſhew it others. Of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:100899:278"/>
Members and Faces that every thing has,
I take one, one while to look it over only, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
while to ripple up the Skin, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to pinch it to the Bones: I give a Stab,
not ſo wide, but as deep as I can; and am
for the moſt part, tempted to take it in hand
by ſome abſolute gracefulneſs I diſcover in it.
Did I know my ſelf leſs, I might p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rhaps ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to handle ſomething or other to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and to be deceiv'd in my own inability,
but ſprinkling here one word, and there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Patterns cut from ſeveral Pieces, and
ſcatter'd without deſign, and without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
my ſelf too far, I am not reſponſible
for them, or oblig'd to keep cloſe to my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
without varying at my own liberty and
pleaſure, and giving up my ſelf to doubt and

Ignorance. All Motion diſcovers us.
The very ſame Soul of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that made it
ſelf ſo Conſpicuous in Marſhalling and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> was alſo ſeen
as Solicitous and Buſie in the ſofter Affairs of
Love. A man makes a Judgment of a Horſe,
not only by ſeeing his Menage in his Airs, but
by his very walk, nay, and by ſeeing him
ſtand in the Stable. Amongſt the Functions
of the Soul, there are ſome of a lower and
meaner Form, who does not ſee her in thoſe
Inferiour Offices, as well as thoſe of Nobler
Note, never fully diſcover her; and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
ſhe is beſt diſcover'd, where ſhe
moves her own natural pace. The winds of
Paſſions take moſt hold of her in her higheſt
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:100899:278"/>
flights; and, the rather, by reaſon that ſhe
wholly applys her ſelf to, and exerciſes her
whole Vertue upon every particular ſubject,
and never handles more than one thing at a
time, and that not according to it, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her ſelf. Things in reſpect to
themſelves, have peradventure their Weight,
Meaſures and Conditions; but when we once
take them into us, the Soul forms them as ſhe
pleaſes. Death is Terrible to <hi>Cicero,</hi> Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Beauty, and their contraries, do all ſtrip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

new Robe, and of another Faſhion, from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſtinct Soul, and of what Colour, Brown,
Bright, Green, Dark; and Quality, Sharp,
Sweet, Deep, or ſuperficial, as beſt pleaſes
them, for they are not yet agreed upon any
common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Standard of Forms, Rules, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
evey one is a Queen in her own
Dominions. Let us therefore no more excuſe
our ſelves upon the External Qualities of
things, it belongs to us to give our ſelves an
account of them. Our good or ill, has no
other dependance but on our ſelves. 'Tis
there that our Offerings and our Vows are due,
and not to Fortune: She has no power over
our Manners, on the contrary, they draw,
and make her follow in their Train, and caſt
her in their own Mould. Why ſhould not I

Game? I hate and avoid it, becauſe it is not
Play enough, that it is too grave and ſerious
a Diverſion, and I am aſham'd to lay out as

Eſtabliſh truth, but to ſeek it: I ſubmit them
to the better Judgments of thoſe, whoſe

Thoughts and Opinions. Let what I here
ſet down meet with Correction or Applauſe,
it ſhall be of equal welcome and utility to me,
my ſelf before hand condemning it for Abſurd
and Impious, if any thing ſhall be found
through Ignorance or Inadvertency, couch'd
in this Rhapſody contrary to the Reſolutions
and Preſcriptions of the <hi>Roman Cotholick

            <p>I know not, if, or no, I am deceiv'd; but
ſince by a particular favour of the Divine
Bounty, a certain Form of Prayer has been
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:100899:290"/>
preſcrib'd and dictated to us, Word by Word,
from the Mouth of God himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ever
been of Opinion, that we ought to have it in
more frequent uſe, than we yet have, and if I
were worthy to adviſe, at the ſitting down
to, and riſing from our Tables, at our riſing,
and going to Bed, and in every particular
Action, wherein Prayer is requir'd, I would
that Chriſtians always make uſe of the Lord's
Prayer, if not alone, yet at leaſt always. The
Church may lengthen, or alter Prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the neceſſity of our Inſtruction, for
I know very well, that it is always the ſame
in ſubſtance, and the ſame thing: But yet
ſuch a preference ought to be given to that
Prayer, that the People ſhould have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in their Mouths; for it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that all neceſſary Petitions are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in it, and that it is infinitely p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for all Occaſions. 'Tis the only Prayer I uſe
in all Places and Conditions, and what I ſtill
repeat inſtead of changing; whence it alſo
happens, that I have no other by Heart, but
that only. It juſt now comes into my Mind,
from whence we ſhould derive that Errour of
having recourſe to God in all our Deſigns and
Enterpriſes, to call him to our Aſſiſtance in all
ſorts of Affairs, and in all Places where our
Weakneſs ſtands in need of ſupport without
conſidering whether the occaſion be juſt, or
otherwiſe, and to Invoke his Name and Power,
in what Eſtate ſoever we are, or Action we
are engag'd in, how Vicious ſoever: He is
indeed our ſole and only Protector, and can
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:100899:290"/>
do all things for us: But though he is pleas'd
to Honour us with his Paternal Care, he is
not withſtanding, as Juſt, as he is Good and
Mighty, and does ofter exerciſe his Juſtice,
than his Power, and favours us according to
that, and not according to our Petitions. <hi>Plato</hi>
in his Laws, makes Three ſorts of Belief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the Gods; That there is none;
That they concern not themſelves about Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs; and that they never reject or
deny any thing to our Vows, Offerings and
Sacrifices. The firſt of theſe Errours (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Opinion,) did never continue
rooted in any Man, from his Infancy to his
Old Age, the other two he confeſſes, Men
might be Obſtinate in. God's Juſtice and his
Power are inſeparable, and therefore in vain
we Invoke his Power in an Unjuſt Cauſe: We
are to have our Souls pure and clean, at that
Moment at leaſt, wherein we Pray to him,
and purified from all Vicious Paſſions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we ourſelves preſent him the Rods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to Chaſtiſe us. Inſtead of repairing any
thing we have done amiſs, we double the
Wickedneſs and the Offence, whilſt we offer
to him, to whom we are to ſue for Pardon,
an Affection full of Irreverence and Hatred.
Which makes me not very apt to applaud
thoſe whom I obſerve to be ſo frequent on
their Knees, if the Actions neareſt of Kin to
Prayer, do not give me ſome Evidence of
Reformation.</p>

is continually working upon nothing
but Impurity, which he knows to be ſo Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Almighty God, what can he ſay, when
he comes to ſpeak to him? He Reforms, but
immediately falls into a Relapſe. If the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Divine Juſtice, and the Preſence
of his Maker, did as he pretends, Strike and
Chaſtiſe his Soul, how ſhort ſoever the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
might be, the very fear of offending
that Infinite Majeſty, would ſo often preſent
it ſelf to his imagination, that he would ſoon
ſee himſelf Maſter of thoſe Vices, that are
moſt Natural and Habitual in him. But what
ſhall we ſay of thoſe, who ſettle their whole
courſe of Life, upon the Profit and Emolument
of Sins, which they know to be Mortal? How
many Trades of Vocations have we admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to that he had in his Heart, only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Credit, and the Honour of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
how could his Courage ſuffer ſo
Infamous a Confeſſion? What can Men ſay
to the Divine Juſtice upon this ſubject?
Their Repentance conſiſting in a viſible and
manifeſt Reformation and Reſtitution, they
loſe the colour of alledging it both to God
and Man. Are they ſo Impudent, as to ſue
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:100899:292"/>
for Remiſſion, without Satisfaction, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Penitency, or Remorſe? I look upon
theſe as in the ſame condition with the firſt:
But the Obſtinacy is not there ſo eaſie to be
overcome. This contrariety and volubility of
Opinion, ſo ſudden and violent as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
is a kind of Miracle to me. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
us with the ſtate of an indigeſtible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety,
and doubtfulneſs of Mind. It ſeem'd to
me a Fantaſtick and Ridiculous Imagination in
thoſe, who theſe late Years paſt, were wont
to Reproach every Man they knew to be of
any extraordinary Parts, and made profeſſion of
the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> that it was but
outwardly, maintaining moreover, to do him
Honour for ſooth, that whatever he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the contrary, he could not but in his
Heart, be of their Reform'd Opinion. An
untoward Diſeaſe, that a Man ſhould be ſo
Rivetted to his own Belief, as to fanſie, that
others cannot believe otherwiſe, than as he
does: and yet worſe in this, that they ſhould
entertain ſo Vicious an Opinion of ſuch parts
as to think any Man ſo Qualified, ſhould preferr
any preſent advantage of Fortune, before the
promiſes of Eternal Life, and the means of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Damnation. They may believe me: Could
any thing have tempted my Youth, the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the danger and difficulties in the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
had not been the leaſt Motives.</p>
            <p>It is not without very good Reaſon, in my
Opinion, that the Church Interdicts the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous,
Indiſcreet and Irreverent uſe of the
Holy and Divine <hi>Pſalms,</hi> with which the Holy
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:100899:292"/>
Ghoſt Inſpir'd King <hi>David.</hi> We ought not
to mix God in our Actions, but with the
higheſt Reverence and Caution. That Poeſie
is too Sacred, to be put to no other uſe,
than to exerciſe the Lungs, and to delight our
Ears. It ought to come from the Soul, and
not from the Tongue. It is not fit that a
Prentice in his Shop, amongſt his vain and
frivolous Thoughts, ſhould be permitted to
paſs away his time, and divert himſelf, with
ſuch Sacred things. Neither is it decent to
ſee the Holy Bible, the Rule of our Worſhip
and Belief, tumbled up and down a Hall, or
a Kitchin. They were formerly Myſteries,
but are now become Sports and Recreations.
'Tis a Book too Serious, and too Venerable,
to be curſorily or ſlightly turn'd over. The
Reading of the Scripture ought to be a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould always add this Devout Preface, <hi>Surſum
Corda,</hi> preparing even the Body to ſo humble
and compos'd a Geſture and Countenance, as
ſhall evidence their Veneration and Attention.
Neither is it a Book for every one to fiſt, but
the Study of Select Men ſet apart for that
purpoſe, and whom Almighty God has been
pleas'd to call to that Office, and Sacred
Function: The Wicked and Ignorant,
Blemiſh and Deprave it. 'Tis not a Story to
tell, but a Hiſtory to fear and adore. Are
not they then pleaſant Men, who think they
have render'd this fit for the Peoples handling,
by Tranſlating it into the Vulgar Tongue?

to ſay further, that by coming ſo near to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
a little, they are much wider of the

and wholly depending upon the Expoſition
of other Qualified Perſons, was more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſalutiferous, than this vain and verbal
knowledge, which has only prov'd the Nurſe
of Temerity and Preſumption. And I do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe, that the liberty every one has
taken, to diſperſe the Sacred Writ into ſo
many Idioms, carries with it a great deal
more of Danger, than Utility. The <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Mahometans,</hi> and almoſt all others, have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpous'd
and Reverence the Language wherein
their Laws and Myſteries were firſt conceiv'd,
and have expreſly, and not without colour of
reaſon, forbid the averſion or alteration of them,
into any other. Are we aſſur'd, that in <hi>Biſcay,</hi>
and in <hi>Brittany,</hi> there are enow competent
Judges of this affair, to Eſtabliſh this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into their own Language? Why, the
Univerſal Church has not a more difficult and
ſolemn Judgment to make. One of our <hi>Greek</hi>
Hiſtorians does juſtly accuſe the Age he Liv'd
in, for that the Secrets of Chriſtian Religion
were diſperſt into the Hands of every Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
to Expound and Argue upon, according
to his own Fancy; and that we ought to be
much aſham'd, we who by God's eſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
enjoy the pureſt Myſteries of Piety, to
ſuffer them to be: Prophan'd by the ignorant

of Princes, upon Theological accounts, are
not Arm'd with Zeal, but Fury; that Zeal
ſprings from the Divine Wiſdom and Juſtice,
and governs it ſelf with Prudence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but degenerates into Hatred and Envy,
producing Tares and Nettles, inſtead of Corn
and Wine, when conducted by Humane Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And it was truly ſaid of another, who
adviſing the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and told him,
that Diſputes did not ſo much Rock the

Contentions, and Logical Diſputations, were
to be avoided, and Men abſolutely to Acquieſs

to be Reproach'd, that I go out of the

that to be a mature and competent Age,
conſidering how few arrive unto it, and ſuch,

privileg'd from the infinite number of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
to which we are by natural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

to do. What an Idle Conceit it is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to Die of a decay of Strength, which
is the laſt of effects of the extreameſt Age,
and to propoſe to our ſelves no ſhorter
leaſe of Life than that, conſidering it is a
kind of Death of all others the moſt rare, and
very hardly ſeen? We call that only a
Natural Death, as if it were contrary to

Let us no more flatter our ſelves

which is Common and Univerſal
To Die of Old Age, is a Death rare, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and ſingular, and therefore ſo
much leſs Natural, than the others: 'Tis
the laſt and extreameſt ſort of Dying:
And the more remote, the leſs to be hop'd

a fault in our very Laws, to maintain this
Errour, That a Man is not capable of

have much ado to manage his Life ſo long.

that both our Vacancy and Employment,

our Souls are Adult at Twenty, ſuch

            <p>Sometimes the Body firſt ſubmits to Age,
ſometimes the Soul, and I have ſeen enow,
who have got a Weakneſs in their Brains,
before either in their Hams, or Stomach:
And by how much the more, it is a Diſeaſe
of no great pain to the infected Party, and
of obſcure Symptoms, ſo much greater the
danger is. And for this reaſon it is, that I
complain of our Laws, not that they keep
us too long to our Work, but that they
ſet us to work too late. For the Frailty
of Life conſider'd, and to how many Natural
and Accidental Rubs it is Obnoxious and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd:
Birth, though Noble, ought not to
ſhare ſo large a Vacancy, and ſo tedious a
