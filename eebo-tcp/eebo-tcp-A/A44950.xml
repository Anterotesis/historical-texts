            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHoſoever reads the following Diſcourſe, will ſee, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, that it was not made for the Preſs; but it having had the ſame hard fortune, that many have now adayes, to be generally condemn'd without being known, it was judg'd convenient it ſhould ſhew it ſelf in Print; to the end, that thoſe who think and ſpeak Ill of it, may ſee what it is they Blame. For my part, as I do not know its Crime, ſo I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to Defend it; therefore I deliver it up to the judgement of the Reader, without any thing, but its own
<pb facs="tcp:56194:3"/>
Innocency, to protect it againſt a Cenſure; only one favour I beg at his hands, which is, that he would not preſently upon ſight of the Text (as many have done at the Hearing it) cry out, without proceeding any further, <hi>Here muſt needs be a Bloody Sermon;</hi> for this is tacitely, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Word of GOD, as being the principle of ill Doctrine; or to ſay, that the Preacher has Quoted it to a Malicious purpoſe. The former of which, would be a Blaſphemy; the latter, a raſh Judgement. Therefore let him read it over firſt, and then let him freely Condemn whatſoever he finds Amiſs.</p>
            <p>Now, in confidence that no Immorality will be found in it, I intreat thoſe that find themſelves deceiv'd in the Opinion they have had of it, to reflect, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the ſame Popular Report, that has Misinform'd them in This, does alſo Abuſe
<pb facs="tcp:56194:3"/>
them in a matter of greater Importance; and make them condemn a <hi>Religion,</hi> which would be their <hi>Salvation,</hi> if they <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it.</p>
            <p>To avoid this Inconvenience, they would do well to follow the advice of the Apoſtle, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>4. 5. Do not judge before the time;</hi> i. e. Before your ſelf have examin'd and ſeen what you condemn: If this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel were follow'd, I confide, that, by God's Grace, we ſhould ſoon be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited here in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and in Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the next Life. Which is the Hearty wiſh of, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>IN my former Catechiſmes I explicated to you, as well as I could, the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miſteries of our Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Trinity of Almighty God; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Paſſion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. I call theſe the principal Miſteries of our Faith; and that you may underſtand why, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56194:5"/>
muſt deſire you to reflect, that there be two things in this life which it mainly concerns a man to know, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt end whether he is going, where all his deſires are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, where he is to reſt for ever: And the way or means to attain to it. Our end is God, in him we are to find our eternal repoſe; and out of him, there is no true repoſe: Our hearts were made for him, and they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at quiet, ſaith St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> till they reſt in him.</p>
            <p>The means to attain to this end, is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, as he ſaith himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> i. e. the Way by my Example, the Truth by my Doctrine, and the Life by my Grace. <hi>No body comes to the Father (i. e.</hi> to the beatifical viſion of God in Heaven) <hi>but by me: i. e.</hi> by imitating my Life and Converſation, by obſerving my Doctrine and Commandements, and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that Grace which I purchaſed at the price of my Blood.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon why theſe are called the principal miſteries of our Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56194:5"/>
theſe two conſiſteth our whole Happineſs; the one being Happineſs it ſelf, the other the Way to it; he that knows theſe two Miſteries, as he ought, knows enough, tho' he knows nothing elſe; becauſe he knows all that is requiſite to make him Happy: and he that knows not theſe, knows nothing; tho' he knoweth all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; tho' he knows all Philoſophy, tho' he knows how to heap together Mountains of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, tho' he knows how to Conquer Kingdoms: becauſe he doth not know, that which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him to know, <hi>i. e.</hi> wherein conſiſts his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wellfare.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian ſhould have alwayes two things in his mind, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Jeſus Chriſt: God in whom, and Jeſus Chriſt by whom he is to be Happy; God who is his end, and Chriſt who is his way. The knowledg and due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe two Points, is the ſource of life everlaſting, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>This is life everlaſting, that they know thee the only true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> On the contrary, the want of this knowledg; or, which is the ſame, the want of a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon it, is the cauſe of perdition to all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56194:6"/>
thoſe that periſh. Travellers muſt needs loſe themſelves, that neither know their end, nor their way. Theſe two Miſteries do contain, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Creed, whether we regard the importance of the matter, or the number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; for of the Twelve, as I told you before, theſe are Eight. Therefore at preſent we will put an end to the declaration of the Creed, and paſs to another part of the Chriſtian Doctrine: but firſt, I have one thing to do, and that ſhall fill up the time we have left for this days en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; It is to tell you, how we may keep a perpetual memory of theſe two great Miſteries, which it ſo much imports us never to forget: It is by making the Sign of the Croſs; a thing ſo much practiſed by Catholicks, and with ſo much reaſon, as, by Gods help, I will make appear preſently: For the ſign of the Croſs, is a ſhort abridgment of all that we are taught in the Symbole of the Apoſtles concerning the Unity and Trinity, with the Incarnation &amp; Death of God the Son. Obſerve a little, and you ſhall ſee how, When I make the ſign of the Croſs, I put my hand firſt to my head, and ſay, In the name of the Father; then under the breaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, And of the Son; then to the right and left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56194:6"/>
ſhoulder, ſaying, And of the Holy Ghoſt. Firſt I ſay ſingularly, <hi>In the name;</hi> that is to ſay, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority: Then I ſay plurally, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> by which I ſignify that all Three have but one Name; that is, Power and Authority, and conſequently one Eſſence and Divine Nature; here is Unity and Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now, the figure of the Croſs does repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Death of our Saviour, who died up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; but becauſe it was impoſſible for God to dye but in mortal fleſh, therefore this Sign, by a neceſſary conſequence, doth repreſent his Manhood or Incarnation, together with his Death. And by this you may ſee, that the Sign of the Croſs, which does ſo ſcandalize the world, is nothing but a profeſſion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in a Trinity, and a Crucified Redeemer. 'Tis a ſign by which we diſcern our ſelves from <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who pretend to believe in one God as well as we; but neither believe a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons, nor the Incarnation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Give me leave to detain you a little longer upon this Subject; Firſt, to tell you the Reaſons why we make ſo much uſe of the Sign of the Croſs: In the ſecond place, I will ſay what diſpoſition of mind is required, to the end
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56194:7"/>
it may be beneficiall to thoſe that make it. But to begin with due order, let us begg the aſſiſtance of him that died on the Croſs, by her interceſſion of whom he took that Fleſh in which he ſuffered for us, <hi>Ave Maria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fides a nobis exigit duplex officium, cordis, &amp; linguae: i. e.</hi> faith, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> lays two obligations upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> one of the Heart, and another of the Tongue: the duty of the Heart, is to Believe; that of the Tongue, is to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: this latter is as neceſſary as the former, <hi>Nequae enim ſalui eſſe poſſumus, niſi fidem ore profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teamur, quam corde gerimus: i. e.</hi> we cannot be ſaved, ſaith the ſame holy Doctor, unleſs we profeſs with our mouth, what we believe in our hearts. This doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. c. <hi>Corde credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad juſtitiam, ore autem confeſſio fit ad ſalutem: i. e.</hi> to obtain true juſtice, we muſt firſt believe in our hearts, for faith, as we are taught by the Council of Trent, is the begining of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the root and foundation of all virtue and good life; without which, as the Apoſtle tells us in <hi>Heb.</hi> c. 11. it is impoſſible to do any thing pleaſing to God, or to be admitted into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56194:7"/>
of his Elect Children. But this is not enough: to attain Eternal Salvation, faith muſt flow from the heart to the mouth, <hi>Ore confeſſio fit ad ſalutem, i. e.</hi> whoever will be ſaved, muſt be ready to make an open Profeſſion of his Faith before men, whenſoever a juſt cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
            <p>There be two things in this matter moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; firſt, that it is never lawfull to betray the true Faith, either by a direct denial, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing any thing contrary to it. <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies me before men,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I will deny him before my Father who is in Heaven.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it thus, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me and my words, the Son of man will be aſhamed of him, when he comes in his Majeſty, and of his Father, and the Majeſty of the Angels,</hi> c. 9. v. 26. The other thing is, that ſometimes, under pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſowned by Chriſt at the latter day, we are obliged to manifeſt our Faith to the world: I ſaid <hi>ſometimes, viz.</hi> when Charity exacts it, and Prudence tells us it ought to be done: at other times 'tis lawfull to conceal our Faith by ſilence; but never with a denial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56194:8"/>
Now this profeſſion of Faith, may be made two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either by Words, or by Signs; 'tis not the Tongue alone we ſpeak with; we ſpeak by the cloaths we wear, by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we keep, by the Places we haunt; we ſpeak ſometimes by ſilence it ſelf. I know what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion you are of by the Aſſemblies you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as well as if you made a profeſſion of it with your Mouth: I know what Maſter you belong to by the Livery you wear, tho' you ſpeak not a word: Now to come to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Sign of the Croſs is the Livery of Jeſus Chriſt; I know by this Sign, that a man believes in one God and Three Perſons; the ſecond of which, was Nailed to a Croſs, as well as by the plaineſt words that can be ſpoken with a Tongue: when I ſee a man Sign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Croſs, I know he is neither Jew, nor Turk, nor Heathen; I know he is a Chriſtian, tho he ſayes nothing to me: for he would not make that Sign, unleſs he believed what no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel will believe, <hi>viz.</hi> One God, who is Three Perſons; the ſecond of which, was made Man, and Crucified for us. I ſay it over again, that for a man to make the Sign of the Croſs, and to ſay I am a Chriſtian, is the ſame thing.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56194:8"/>
And now you have one Reaſon of this Catholick practice, <hi>viz.</hi> of making the Sign of the Croſs, It is as I ſaid before, a profeſſion of our Faith. 'tis the Livery by which we ſhew our ſelves to be the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt; it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing mark by which we diſcriminate our ſelves from all ſorts of unbelievers. Now I will give you another Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39. v. 5. <hi>Whoſe hope is in the Name of the Lord, i. e.</hi> who puts all his confidence in God, who expects no happineſs but from him; neither in this world, nor in the next; who hopes for no ſucceſs in his affairs, but from his aſſiſting hand: and this hope he grounds in the Merits of Chriſt, <hi>by whom,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>We have acceſs to the Father;</hi> and without whom, there is no acceſs to him, nor any poſſibility of obtaining any favour of him: for a token of this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence grounded in Chriſt, we make the Sign of the Croſs before every thing we do: we make it when we lye down to ſleep; hoping, that for the merits of him that died upon it, God will protect us that night from the Prince of darkneſs, and from all <hi>nocturnal</hi> fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. we make
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56194:9"/>
it when we riſe again, begging by the ſame means to be preſerv'd that day from all evil, and that all may proſper that we undertake for the honour of God; we make it before Prayer, to teſtify that we expect not to be heard but by him that was Crucified for us; we make uſe of it in the moſt holy Sacrifice of the Maſs; in all our Sacraments, in the Benedictions of Water, of Candles, of Bread, &amp;c. becauſe we believe, that all Bleſſings and Conſecrations receive their force and efficacy from the Death and Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour. In fine, we make no Oblation to the eternal Father, but what we ſign with the Croſs; knowing that he accepts no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and receives no Requeſt, unleſs it be ſtamped with the Seal of his only beloved Son. This was the Cuſtom of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> an Author that lived not long after our Saviours Aſcention into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doth teſtify, did; to ſpeak in his Phraſe, <hi>wear out their Foreheads,</hi> by making the ſign of the Croſs at their going out, at their coming in again; at putting on their Cloaths, at the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Hands, and the lighting of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles; at their going to Bed; in a word, at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever action they imployed themſelves in, <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56194:9"/>
nos converſatio exercet.</hi> This is the ſecond Reaſon of our reſpect to the ſign of the Croſs; it is a tacit invocation of the moſt bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the Merits of our Crucified Redeemer: It is to teſtify, that we believe that no favour can be obtained of God, but by him, and for him.</p>
            <p>Before I give you a Third Reaſon, I muſt put you in mind, that Almighty God, as he is a moſt liberal Giver, ſo is alſo a ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Thanks: we may ſee this by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Old Teſtament: He never did them any notable Favour, but he commanded a Monument to be Erected to preſerve the memory of it, and to tranſmit to Poſterity the Obligation of giving Thanks for it; for Example, he freed them out of Captivity, by Killing every Firſt-born of the Egyptians in one night; for a memorial of this benefit, he commanded them to keep a ſolemn Feaſt called the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> and to mark the Poſts of their Doors with the Blood of the Lamb; to the end, their Children might learn, That the deſtroying Angel, when he killed every firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in the houſes of the Egyptians, <hi>paſſed</hi> over
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56194:10"/>
the houſes of the Hebrews without doing Them any harm, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 27. He fed them in the Deſert with a Bread from Heaven, called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> for a remembrance of this, he would have a <hi>Gomer, i. e.</hi> a certain meaſure to be filled with it, and to be kept in the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that future Ages <hi>might know the Bread with which he had nouriſhed them in the Wilderneſs, Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 32. He made them a Paſſage thro' the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> as he had done before thro' the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> That this might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in ſubſequent times, he bid them take twelve Stones out of the bottom of the dry Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and place them upon the Bank; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wards, Fathers might tell their Children why theſe Stones were laid there; and ſo make them know their obligation, of thanking Almighty God for the favour done them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. In fine, all their Feſtival-days, all their Ceremonies and Sacrifices, were ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of their delivery out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and bringing them into the Land of Promiſe. Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 20, &amp;c. The ſame duty of thankſgiving, he exacts of Chriſtians, with ſo much more reaſon, as 'tis a greater favour, to be delivered out of Hell fire, than out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56194:10"/>
and to be brought to the Kingdom of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> than to <hi>Paleſtine:</hi> and therefore we have our Monuments, to put us in mind of our Redemption as well as they; our <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> our <hi>Goodfriday,</hi> our <hi>Eaſter,</hi> our <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> our <hi>Whitſontide;</hi> all the Feaſts of the Year are to put us in mind of ſome benefit received from God; the moſt dreadful Sacrifice it ſelf, what is it, but a Memorial of his Death and Paſſion? <hi>Do this in remembrance of me, Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 19. Now amongſt other induſtries we make uſe of to keep up the memory of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, One, and that a very proper one, is the Sign of the Croſs; the Croſs is a Monument of Chriſts Victory over the Devil; a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Love towards Mankind, and a Sign of our delivery from the thraldom of Sin: by the Croſs, ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> he broke down the gates of Hell, and loos'd the Souls of the Juſt that were impriſon'd there; he unlockt Heaven, and made us a free paſſage in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by the Croſs, he reconciled God to Man, and reſtored Man to the fellowſhip of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: by the Croſs, ſaith the ſame holy Doctor, death was turned into a ſleep; and that which was the deſtruction of life, is made an entry
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56194:11"/>
into life Eternal; that which was the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, is become the Crown of Martyrs. When we look upon the Heavens, we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the greatneſs of him that made them: and when we make the Sign of the Croſs, we call to mind the Goodneſs of him that dyed upon it. God Almighty in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. commanded the Jews to have his Laws and Ceremonies before their eyes continually; to meditate upon them day and night, in their houſes, and in the high-ways; at their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to ſleep, and at their riſing again: becauſe, as 'tis there ſaid, they were memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of their delivery from Bondage: the Croſs is a memorial of our delivery out of a worſe Bondage than that of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and from a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Yoak than that of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> therefore with greater reaſon, we ought to think of it day and night; at home and abroad, at our lying down, and at our riſing up again. To this end the antient Chriſtians, as St <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, did erect Croſſes in all places, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Churches, in the Markets, in the Towns, in the Fields, in the High-wayes, and upon the tops of Mountains; that whereſoever they went, whereſoever they turned themſelves, they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56194:11"/>
might have before them, the ſign of Gods Love, and their own Redemption. And here is the Third Reaſon for the Sign of the Croſs; it is to put us in mind of the Victory Chriſt gain'd over the Devil, and of our own delivery out of Hell-fire.</p>
            <p>One Argument more, and I have done: St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians, c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. ſaith, That our Saviour Crucified, did carry the Devil in triumph, and made him a ſpectacle to God and his Angels. 'Tis a remark of <hi>Origen</hi> upon this place, that as Chriſt was Crucified viſibly, ſo the Devil was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified inviſibly: Our Lord, by ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be Crucified, you know, did deprive himſelf of the uſe of his Arms for a time; ſo the Devil, by the Croſs, loſt the uſe of his Arms, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his power over mankind for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and therefore was Crucified inviſibly more than Chriſt was viſibly. For this cauſe he is afraid of the Croſs, as a Malefactor is afraid of the Gallows; or as a Dog is afraid of a Stick with which he hath been beaten: <hi>Metuunt illud ſignum, in quo Salvator, aëris expolians poteſtates, eas fecit oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentui;</hi> the infernal Spirits, ſaith St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56194:12"/>
his life written by St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> fear that Sign, by which our Saviour triumphed over them, and made them the ſcorn of Heaven and Earth. Thoſe two great terrours of the Devils, <hi>Anthony &amp; Hillarion,</hi> as we read in their Authentique Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries written by St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> aboveſaid; and St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> did alwayes make uſe of the Sign of the Croſs as the moſt efficacious Weapon againſt them. Nay, which is wonderful, it hath not this force only upon the Foreheads of Saints, but ſometimes alſo, (if ſo pleaſing God for the clearer demonſtration of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it) when it is made uſe of even by wicked men. We read in the Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory written by <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis,</hi> that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate, ſo called, becauſe he revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Faith he had been brought up in, and attempted by a ſacrilegious vanity to waſh out of his Soul the indelible Character of Baptiſme, by waſhing his body in the blood of Heathen Sacrifices: we read (I ſay) that this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wicked man, by making the Sign of the Croſs, tho' inconſideratly, and by force of a cuſtom he had been inured to in the time of his Chriſtanity, did put to flight thoſe wicked ſpirits which had cauſed to be raiſed by Art-Magick,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56194:12"/>
to learn of them the ſucceſs of his future affairs. In virtue of this Sign appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman and firſt Chriſtian-Emperour, was made Victorious over all his Enemies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>In this thou ſhalt Overcome.</hi> And now you have the Fourth and laſt Argument for the Uſe of the Croſs; 'Tis the Terrour of the Devils, 'tis our Protection againſt them; by this all their attempts are made ineffectual; at the ſight of this they run away.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, thoſe that will not make uſe of it, thoſe that bear no reſpect to it, not even for his ſake that Redeemed us by it, how they diſarm themſelves, and lay themſelves open to be wounded by their ghoſtly enemies, may be gathered out of thoſe words of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> which I have taken for my Text. This Prophet ſaw in a Viſion, ſix men enter into the Temple, each of them with an inſtrument of Death in his Hand; to thoſe Command was given, to go through the City, and to Kill without Mercy, and without diſtinction of Age, Condition or Sex; all they met with, excepting only thoſe, whom another Man, ſent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56194:13"/>
before to that purpoſe, had marked with the <hi>Tau</hi> upon their Foreheads. Such another Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was Revealed to St. <hi>John Apocalyps</hi> 7. in which he ſaw four Angels, with power to execute the Divine Juſtice upon all that had not the Sign of the Living GOD. What is meant by <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Tau, and what by the Sign of the Living God in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> I have not authority to define: But certain it is, Firſt, that both the one and the other ſhall be a Mark of Diſtinction between the Elect and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate at the great diſcerning Day. Secondly, 'tis no leſs certain, that the Holy Fathers do take them both for the Sign of the Croſs; and Reaſon perſwades into this belief; otherwiſe I think no reaſon can be given, why this Sign ſhould have the name of <hi>Tau;</hi> a letter which at that time the Prophet writ, did repreſent the Croſs, as our Capital <hi>T</hi> doth at preſent: And what Sign peculiar to the Living GOD beſides the ſign of the Croſs, and why it ſhould be upon the Foreheads of thoſe that are to be Saved by it, unleſs it be a Croſs, I think no body can determine. Hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That all that are found Markt with the Croſs at the great Day, ſhall be under the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56194:13"/>
protection of Almighty GOD. But thoſe that are found without it, Shall they be abandoned to the fury of the Sword? Shall they be left a prey to the Devils? God forbid, that Souls Redeemed by Chriſt, ſhould be left a prey to them! But now I muſt deſire you not to miſtake me: I do not ſay, that the bare Sign of the Croſs, ſeparated from Faith, and other Pious diſpoſitions of the mind, ſhall be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to any body in the day of Revenge: And therefore, to perform what I promiſed in the Second place; I muſt tell you what diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind is requiſite, to the end the Sign of the Croſs may prove Beneficial to thoſe that make Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. blaming the Jews for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much confidence in the outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of their fleſh, as if it were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſave them without the obſervation of the Commandements: tells them, 'tis not the external Circumciſion of the body that makes them children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the inward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the mind, <hi>i. e.</hi> cutting away all vitious affections from their Souls. The ſame I ſay in our caſe; the outward ſign of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56194:14"/>
Croſs upon our foreheads, does not make us Chriſtians, <hi>i. e.</hi> Children of God, and Heirs of Heaven; but the inward ſign of the Croſs in our Souls. No body, as a learned Father antiently ſaid, obtains any favour of God, by making the ſign of the Croſs upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with his hand, unleſs at the ſame time he make it inwardly in his heart, by Faith. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ibid.</hi> is a profitable thing if you obſerve the Commandements; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Circumciſion is no better than Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. So the Croſs upon the forehead is good, if it be joyned with a Croſs in the heart; if not, we are but Heathens under the mark of Chriſtanity. But what is it you will ſay, to make the ſign of the Croſs in our hearts? It is to have in our hearts the virtues which Chriſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon the Croſs; of which the outward Croſs is a ſign, and without which that outward ſign can benefit nothing at all. For example ſake: The ſign of the Croſs is a ſign of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; a ſign of humility in Chriſt that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, and a ſign of humility in thoſe that make it; now, as I ſaid, it will benefit us nothing to carry the ſign of humility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, if we have a proud heart within. 'Tis
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56194:14"/>
a ſign of Patience; it will do us no good to have the ſign of Patience upon our foreheads, whilſt our minds are full of Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. It is a ſign of Charity; What will it avail us under the mark of Mercy and Love, to have a heart repleniſhed with Hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour, and void of pitty and compaſſion towards the Poor? 'Tis a ſign of Suffering; To what purpoſe ſhould we make profeſſion of Suffering, whilſt we welter in Pleaſures? 'Tis a ſign of Victory; we ſhould be aſhamed to wear the Lawrel, having never yet fought againſt ſin, and being yet fettered with the Chains of the Devil. In fine, all mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſign of the Croſs, all coming to Maſs, all ſaying of Prayers, and hearing of Sermons, all outward ſigns of Chriſtianity, are but lyes, and do but make us Hypocrites, unleſs we have inwardly the Virtues we profeſs outwardly by theſe ſignes.</p>
            <p>But to weary your patience no longer, I will collect into a ſhort ſum, all I have ſaid, that every one may carry ſomething away. I have given Four Reaſons why we make the ſign of the Croſs; Firſt, becauſe it is a profeſſion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56194:15"/>
in one God, who is Three Perſons, and in our Redeemer who dyed for us upon a Croſs: 'Tis the Badg of a Chriſtian, and the Livery of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore we muſt not deſpiſe it now, for fear he deſpiſe us another day. It is a tacit invocation of the moſt bleſſed Trinity by the Merits of Chriſt. 'Tis the Seal of God the Son: We muſt mark all our actions with it, leſt for want of it they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Eternal Father. It is a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Chriſts conqueſt, and our redemption: let us carry it about us, that we do not fall into oblivion of ſo great a benefit, and by oblivion incurr the crime of ingratitude. Fourthly, 'tis an Armor of defence that will ſhield us againſt all the ſtrokes of our Ghoſtly enemies; if we caſt it away, we expoſe our ſelves to their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wounds. Finally, whilſt we carry the mark of Chriſtian upon our foreheads, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have Chriſtian Virtues in our hearts.</p>
