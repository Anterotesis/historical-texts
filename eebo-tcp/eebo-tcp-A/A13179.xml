         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in this learning: the
meanes that call vs away
from so good a labour are
mentioned, and the maner
how to auoid these meanes
is with all expressed. To
make an entrance into this
so solemne a subiect; I was
sometime since occasioned
by the treatable visitation
and most Christian ende of
that verie woorshipfull
knight sir <hi>Robert South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
whose approued ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in this Commonwelth,
and good reputation in his
Countrie, is well knowne
vnto manie: but of whose
true heart to God-warde,
<pb facs="tcp:3394:18"/>
both in the time of his life,
&amp; at the time of his death,
my selfe can truly relate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others. If there be (as
without doubt there is) a
dutie which wee owe vnto
the faithfull departed, and
a good remembrance to bee
had of those happie soules;
then might I not omit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende
mention of him,
whose portion I trust assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
is with God. Looke
what a mournefull minde
during the time of this his
so Christian visitation,
could at times consider of,
and obserue in priuate, I
haue beene since by speciall
motiues drawn on, to make
<pb facs="tcp:3394:18"/>
that poore labour publike,
as a discourse proper vnto
the time. For although a
consideration of our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from this world bee a
subiect not vnfitting all
ages, yet seeing we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into those dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
manye liue as if they
should neuer die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and die, as
if with death al were done;
and when they come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this world they are so
farre to seeke in a right
disposing themselues to
God, as if they seldome or
neuer entrod into any ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
consideration of the
same. Necessarie are those
manie treatises which tend
<pb facs="tcp:3394:19"/>
to the amendment of life,
but because vpon our last
conflict dependeth our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
victorie, against the
professed enemie of our
soules, the well behauing
our selues in this combate,
must needes of all other be
most necessarie. To guide
the ship along the seas, it is
no doubt a good skill, but at
the verie entrance into the
hauen, then to auoide the
daungerous rockes, and to
cast anchor in a safe roade,
is the chiefest skil of all. To
run the race in good order
is the part of a stout cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion;
but so to run towards
the end of his race that hee
<pb facs="tcp:3394:19"/>
may obtaine the crowne, is
the verie perfection of all
his paines. Then a good life
what more Christian like,
but after that passed to die
in the faith and feare of
God, what more diuine?
To order aright the vpshot
of our owne time, and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
from this world, what
more behouefull if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
our selues? but in
these occasions to bee also
helpfull vnto others, what
more charitable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the communion of
Saints, and that common
ioy we receyue in the good
of all? Wee are charged to
let men liue loselie, and
<pb facs="tcp:3394:20"/>
most vnchristianlie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this worlde, to leade
their liues, and to goe out
of their liues without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
what men doe, is one
thing, what wee wish were
done, is another. God
knowes, and many can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
how often, howe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
wee call vpon this

we learne to die in the

we take felicity, wee should not

euils in the life of man, is a
carelesse neglecte of Gods woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
One of the greatest causes
of this neglect, is the forgetfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

who stole away the hartes of the

That which wee call life,
is a kinde of death, because it
makes vs to die: but that which
we count death, is in the sequcle
a very life: for that indeede it
makes vs to liue. There is a
death, which some call mortall
sinne, and this is the death of the
Soule, which death wee should
all feare. There is also a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
feare of the other death,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3394:70"/>
which is profitable to withdraw
vs from the allurements of euill.
But so to feare it, as if it were
the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of
all our beeing, we neede not, wee
ought not. When the Apostle

<hi>Adam,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had well

In like manner, when
wee call to minde the state of
innocency, wherein GOD
made all thinges for man, and
man for himselfe, (in that
wonderfull excellency) placed
him in Paradise, a Garden of
all delightes, subiect neither to

For the second consideration,

keepe them religiously minded,
for we know not whether wee
shall euer keepe them any more.
When wee make our humble
repentance to God, wee had
neede doe it sincerely in deede:
<hi>Sathan</hi> hee is busie, because his
time is short, and therefore his
wrath is the fiercer. But wee
remembring the continuance
of time, should vse all diligence,
and therefore our care should
be the greater to preuent the
subtile Serpent. The Church
doth pray, and that in most
Christian manner too, that the
faithfull may be deliuered from
suddaine death. And surely
great cause hath the sober
Christians man to desire rather
leysurely to yeelde himselfe
to God, then to bee taken in a

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3394:90"/>
men. To haue a good departure
out of the worlde, may bee a
good mans prayer, and to close
vp the course of life, with a
treatable dissolution, is that
faire Christian ende wee may
all beg at the handes of God.

But the Wise man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the seruants of God,
who passed through the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

                  <hi>their bodies are buried in peace,
but their name liueth for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
For such is the power of
vertue, as it makes men, not
onely honoured when they are
aliue, but also when they are
dead, and it is wont to take
them out of their graues, and
cause them to liue in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

their names registred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
with the Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
These stood euermore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Esai,</hi> as the raging waxes

First remembring it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

we come into a vale of misery,
in the other we depart from it,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3394:116"/>
departing in the farth of him,
by whom we looke for a better

being the way for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so high a reward, we may
steppe forth with confidence in
his mercy, who now calleth vs
by death to the participation
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same. Why on Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

cause to grudge or complaine?
How much lesse cause haue wee
to shew any part of vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that God shoulde take
home this departing soule, the
worke of his owne hands, the

But the losse of friends cannot
be but grieuous vnto flesh and

Christian mourning with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,

this Christian sorrow, yet to

other great differences
whereby Gods children are

that they are the children of
peace. <hi>Saul</hi> that had an euill

had a good spirit, had a spirite
of peace. Amongst the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of the

combersome thoughtes are
wont much to molest y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worlds
followers. The graces y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flow
from Gods spirit are resembled
often vnto riuers and pleasant
waters. These riuers abide
not on the higher mountaines,
but haue their course through
the lowest vallies. It is want<note place="margin">Want of humilitie the cause of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet life.</note>
of humilitie that makes men so
far from a peaceable state and

God (saith <hi>S. Iames</hi>) God will

draw neere vnto vs. The most
honourable state of life, is to
serue him: all our inferior, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleasures or profits, for a
time like some small cloudes
passe to and fro, and are at last
dissolued into nothing. So we
haue as much water as will<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20. 21.</note>

vnquiet or troublesome life, is
their life who haue not knowne
the way of peace, &amp; may also fear<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 17.</note>

liue religiously and peaceablie

and to passe their time in that
peaceable course, which true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion

well disposed for their euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

for necessity is faine sometimes
to staire vpon the earth, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
for the most part
soaring in the aire, where she
tunes many a quiet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

necessities sake onely, our cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
are sometimes on
thinges here beneath: but our
chiefe delight should be higher,
where is quiet, and peace of
conscience; where no distracting
thoughts, which are wont to
disturbe the louers of this
world, do not come neere them:
they are risen with Christ, and
therefore seeke the things that
are aboue where Christ sitteth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3394:193"/>
at the right hand of God. The
deuout mans life therefore is
angelicall, whose bodie wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

hath beene before shewed) are
aboue in heauen. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
case to see how apt men
are to debates and quarrels, at
the least offences; sometimes
rather taken then giuen, their
stomacks are aloft: they swel
in malice, their heartes are so
big; nothing will qualifie them,

and yet for all that wee make

neuer thinke of our owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,

forgo the treasures of heauen
for very bables, things of smal

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3394:195"/>
as they are comming to
them, not as they are going
from them, when they are
woont to leaue trouble behind.
It were to be wished, that men
would once withdrawe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from vnnecessary cares &amp;
desires, in seeking too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie
the vaine riches and
pleasures of this worlde, which
are so much in request as they
are. In so doing might they not
passe ouer the dayes of their
pilgrimage more peaceablie,
more religiouslie? They might,
young men from the childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
in fearing God: old men
now departing the worlde by
giuing good examples vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
all considering the state
and condition of life it selfe,
which is but as a flower. First
it buddeth, then comes the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and flowrishing, a little
after it withereth, and is gone.
Wherefore man (saith one) may
bee well greeted with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
salutation. From childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3394:196"/>
to thirtie, the greeting
is, you are welcome. From
thirtie to fiftie, the greeting is,
you are in a good day. From
that time afterwarde, Then
God giue you a good departure.
Nowe therefore gentlie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
this iourney, to passe
from childehoode to youth,
from youth to strength, from
strength to olde age, from
olde age to death: as certaine
