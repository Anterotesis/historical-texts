            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſion of his ſinnes. Becauſe it is a dutie ſo much neglected, I wil vſe ſome arguments to incite and perſwade you to the practiſe of it. In the firſt place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it is not man but GOD which commandeth vs to make this ſearch.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> For the whole Scripture (whereof this ſentence is a part) is giuen by inſpiration from God, and the holy men of God, (whereof this Prophet was not the laſt, nor yet the leaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 12.</note> He is the onely law-giuer, that is onely able to ſaue and deſtroy. He exhorteth vs to ſearch our waies:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11832:10"/>
therefore as we reſpect his grace, &amp; feare his anger, as we would not be reputed &amp; regarded as diſloyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, diſobedient children, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and refractary ſeruants, let vs in al humility of heart, and ſincerity of ſoule and conſcience ſubmit and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Secondly, wee ſhal not know our waies, what they are, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they lead, vnleſſe we take ſome paines in ſearching of them out. A Prince cannot know the ſtate of his kingdom, a phiſitian cannot diſcern the conſtitution and habit of a mans body, without ſome good &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſearch and inquiſition: ſo no man can iudge of the condition and ſtate of his ſoule and body, &amp; know the caſe and quality of the kingdom of his heart, except by ſearching he doe labour to attaine thereunto. He that knoweth not his waies, cannot examine them: how then ſhall he be able to reuert and turne from them if they be not good? On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, our ſearching of them is a very good furtherance &amp; preparatiue to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11832:10"/>
our triall of them, and turning from them; like the needle, which prepares a way for the threed, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. For as a man perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be wounded or any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, is moued to ſeeke about for a remedie: euen ſo when a ſinner by ranſacking his life and heart, findeth out his ſpirituall wounds and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hee is by the grace of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared &amp; prouoked to ſeeke for cure, and to be deliuered of his grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he that intends to build, will ſearch the foundation, whether the ground be ſound or ſandy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſt or falſe. Saluation is a faire and goodly building. Now he that builds it vpon ignorant conceits, &amp; blind preſumptions, deceiueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and diſhonoureth his Sauiour: therefore it is good for a man to ſearch himſelfe, &amp; lay a firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; the toppe will fare the better for the bottome. If the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke bee not ſtable, the building cannot ſtand: and where there is no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11832:11"/>
ſure ſearching, there can be no ſure working. Moreour, he that deſireth a plentifull Crop, muſt view his ſeed, and ſearch it for Chaffe, Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell, and other noxious and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſeeds: ſo he, that deſireth to be fruitfull in good works, muſt ſearch himſelfe for the ſeeds of ſin, which ingendreth nothing but ſtinking weedes.</p>
            <p>A diſcreete and faithfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will ſearch his kingdome, for treacherous, rebellious, and other pernitious perſons; ſpecially if hee haue had certaine intelligence of them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 6</note> ſo wee that are made Kings and ſpirituall Magiſtrates by Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould ſearch all the corners of our kingdome for our ſins, which lurke within vs like traitors, and are ready to pull the crowne from our heades, and ſnatch the ſcepter out of our hands, yea and blowe vp the whole Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſoules. God hath giuen a man reaſon to be as a Prince to rule him, it being ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the line of his Lawe: the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
<pb facs="tcp:11832:11"/>
faculties of the ſoule, be the Peeres or Nobles: the ſenſes are the guard and attendants: the outward part are as the Commons: and our Sins, &amp; ſinfull Affections, are trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, rebells, and as factious and infectious perſons, which diſturbe the peace of the Common-wealth, and being deſperate and irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable enimies vnto the State, doe ſtriue to diſmount the Prince from her Throne, and vtterly to ruinate and ſubuert the kingdome, which God by his holy ſpirit hath begun to plant within vs. Wherefore like politique and faithfull Princes, it behoueth vs to make ſearch in all the parts of our kingdomes, and as it were with Hoe and Crie to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our enemies, that by ſearc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eceiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as they haue deſerued.</p>
            <p>Finally, the ſearching of our waies is a meanes to preuent the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For when men will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11832:12"/>
not ſearch themſelues, then God ſearcheth them out by croſſes and afflictions. When men forget to ſearch their waies, then God doth oftentimes put them in minde of this dutie by his rods, and leadeth them (as it were) by the lip. When men run headlong on an end in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and wretched courſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinking of their way, hee doth ſometimes thruſt them forward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſperate and irrecouerable caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties &amp; calamities, yea many times to the loſſe of their deareſt liues: as the diuell did violently driue the the Gadarens ſwine into the ſea.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 13</note> Sometimes hee thruſts them into the mire of affliction, and maketh them to ſtumble and fall vpon ſome ſtone in their way, or pricketh their feete with the thorne of ſome ſharp and grieuous croſſe, and ſo puts them in minde of their way, and teacheth them to think of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly courſes. When men ſuffer Sathan to ride them, as the Aſſe did <hi>Balaam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. <hi>22.</hi>
               </note> and to abuſe them to Gods
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11832:12"/>
diſhonour, then God dooth often cauſe his Angell (as I may ſpeake) to ſtand in their way with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſword of aduerſitie, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth their enormious proceedings. Therefore it is a point of chriſtian wiſedome, and wiſe chriſtianitie, to cal our ſelues in time to a reckning, and to make a mature and faithfull inquiſition and diſquiſition of all our waies. <hi>Search your ſelues</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zephany</hi>) <hi>euen ſearch you,</hi>

If a king knew certainly that there were traytours in all the quarters of his kingdome, which plotted his death and the deſtruction of his Kingdome, hee would bee very wary how or where he walked, and he would be as induſtrious in ſearching out his enemies.

all meanes poſsible to finde them out. Verily (beloued) we are peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with enemies. Our waies are many, our workes are many, and not one of all theſe, no not the beſt, but it is polluted with ſome ſinne or other. So many ſinnes as a man hath, ſo many enemies he hath to the ſaluation of his ſoule:<note place="margin">

No pardon, no peace: no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie, no pardon: no repentance, no remiſſion. And doe we thinke to repent of our waies before wee know them?

Hee that would know the cauſe why his corne thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, why his vines flouriſh not, and why his trees proſper not, muſt ſearch diligently for weedes, for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous branches, and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11832:21"/>
So he that would know, why hee groweth not in grace, and thriueth not in knowledge: why he doth either goe backward, as the ſhadow did in the diall of <hi>Ahaz,</hi>

Therefore (beloued) as wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the grounds of our harts ſhould bee fertill, the vine of Gods graces ſhould ſpread, and the tree of our ſoules ſhould flouriſh: as wee deſire the peace of conſcience, and that we ſhould returne to God, and God to vs, let vs with all fidelitie, ſearch and finde out our waies. For though it be no cauſe to worke it, no merit to deſerue it, yet is it by the bleſsing of God, a notable furtherance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; euen the firſt ſtone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſpirituall building, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11832:22"/>
the firſt ſtep to the true conuerſion of our hearts and mindes vnto God. And this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt branch of the Prophets exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſecond followeth. <hi>And trie our waies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. <hi>3.</hi>

Whence I conclude, that wee ought to the vtmoſt examine and proue all our waies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether they be foule or faire, right or wrong. And here I will firſt ſhewe why wee ought to make this triall, and then by what. For the firſt; this triall is a meanes of thankfulneſſe. For if after ſerious examination, wee doe finde them good, we ſhall be ſtirred vp to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the name of God, for directing our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11832:22"/>
A ſeruant or child cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his maiſters, and his father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> leuitie, that with patience doth bear his offences, and forbeare to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, as he hath tranſgreſſed. So we, that are the ſonnes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the Lord, cannot (if there bee but one graine of grace within vs) but extoll his loue and long-ſuffring towards vs, in bearing with our ſinnes, and ſparing of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, farre otherwiſe, then by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our waies, we finde that wee could either merit or expect. And as the man, that conſidereth by day what daungers hee did eſcape by darke, is occaſioned to giue thankes to God for preſeruing of him: ſo when we ſhall duly conſider, how near we were to the pit of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of our ſinnes, and yet how fauourable God hath bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs (euen then when we could not ſee to walke aright) as that hee did not confound vs in our waies, wee are occaſioned and prouoked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to glorifie the name of God for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11832:23"/>
moderating his iuſtice towards vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the true triall of our waies will be a meanes to further our ſeeking of God, and his grace. For when a man after triall percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his tickle eſtate by ſinne, hee is prepared (if not prouoked) to ſeeke out for ſafe deliuerance. As a man perceiuing the danger of his diſeaſe ſeeketh to the skilfull Phiſitian for a remedie: ſo when a man by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and faithfull ſearching and examination of his waies, ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his defectes, and the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſes of his ſoule, hee is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſeeke to Chriſt the only true Phiſitian of our ſoules for cure. And as the ſwallow perceiuing her ſelfe almoſt blinde, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeketh out the hearbe <hi>Celan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> and the Hart feeling himſelfe ſhot with arrow, doth (as ſome ſay) by &amp; by run to the hearb <hi>Ditany,</hi> or <hi>Dictandor</hi>: ſo when a man findes himſelfe by trial almoſt blind with ſinne, and his ſoule ſtricken with the dartes of iniquitie, he is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11832:23"/>
(if not perſwaded) to ſeeke out to Chriſt our <hi>Celandine,</hi> our <hi>Dictan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> yea our <hi>Panacaea,</hi> which healeth all our ſpirituall maladies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; the Plethory of pride, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Conſumption of enuy, the Dropſie of Couetouſneſſe, the Phrenſie of anger, the Crampe of fearefulneſſe, the Lethargie of forgetfulneſſe, the Apoplexy of a dead and flinty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Furthermore, as the King of ſome countrey, ſeeing the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his enemies, both forrein and domeſticall, and perceiuing his inabilitie to withſtand or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them (as it were) conſtrained to ſeeke for helpe to his neighbors abroad: ſo when the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man by trying of his heart and waies, ſhall perceiue his enemies to be both mighty and many, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnſufficient to conquer and ſubdue them, he is mooued to ſeeke abroad to his neighbour and elder brother Chriſt Ieſus, that ſo by the vertue of his death, and operation of his ſpirite, they may bee quelled
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11832:24"/>
and ſubdued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this triall is a meanes to prepare a man for the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; returning from finne. Alſo the phiſitian by one receit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a way for an other: and as the Carpenter or Ioyner by one of his tooles procureth a way for an other: ſo the Phiſitian of our ſoules, and the great Carpenter of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all building, by cauſing vs to proue our waies, prepareth vs to redreſſe them, and fitteth vs for further workes. The traueller perceiuing himſelfe to be out of his right way, doth preſently bethinke with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, how hee may come into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: ſo we that are trauellers and wayfaring men, perceiuing by true triall, that wee are not in our right way, are therevpon forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, and moued to goe backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine or ſearch it out. When a bird perceiues the daunger of the ſnare or net, ſhe ſeekes to flye away: ſo when the childe of God ſeeth what damage hee is like to ſuſtaine by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11832:24"/>
reaſon of his ſinfull courſes, which hee hath found out by faithfull exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and what a net of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he is like to haue caſt ouer him, hee dooth ſeeke to ſcape and get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God hath two fannes: the one of his lawe, the other of his iudgements. God hath two fires: one of his worde, an other of his wrath. Hee that would not be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the fan of his iudgements, muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee that trieth his waies, whether they bee good or euill, is very like to eſcape all danger: whereas he that ploddeth on, and neuer regardeth them, is like to ſtumble on the ſtones of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp; fall vpon the ſtakes of Gods indignation, which are euery where laid and ſet in thoſe waies, which are not ſtrait and good.<note place="margin">

It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now to ſhew by what wee ought to make our triall. For if a man meaſure with a wrong wand, and weigh with falſe weights, or a deceitfull ballance, hee ſhall delude himſelfe, and make but bad worke. If thou wouldeſt try thy waies by humane learning, it cannot truly tell thee what the nature and deſert of ſinne is in all reſpects: yea it maketh that ſometimes a vertue, which God eſteemeth but a vice. Secondly, if a man will bee tried by his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vndoubtedly (if they weare the cogniſance of the world, and bee of her ſtamping) they will perſwade him his ſtate is good, and that hee is a right good companion, though his caſe in deed be very vile and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11832:26"/>
malecontent and froward male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours, cannot away with triall; therefore if it be iudge, it will neuer be condemned.

For the world is blind, and her iudgement is corrupt and partiall: her ſcoales are falſe, and her weights vnequall. Whence it is, that vertue oftentimes walkes on foote vpon the ground, when vice dooth ride vpon the horſe, and is reiected when that is receiued. Yea wee ſee the world like an Alcumiſt, hath made a vice of vertue, &amp; turned vice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11832:26"/>
into a vertue; ſo as that the profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue, is reputed ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and derided of the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe can be no competent iudge. Sixtly, if wee will try our eſtate by the Diuell, <hi>Who is a lyar,</hi>

And this <hi>Lullabee</hi> hee ſingeth vſually to the witch, till ſhe come to the ſtake, and to the carnall man, till hee come to his graue, and ſo rockes them faſt a ſleepe in the cradle of ſenſuall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

            <p>Some againe will not make this triall; like many men that haue run long &amp; much on the ſcore, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to heare of a reckoning.

Finally, ſome will indeede trie their waies, but not throughly, onely coldly and ouerly: and ſome will trie one way, but not an other: ſome, but not all.

            <p>

Wouldeſt thou know the condition of thy waies? then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them with the met-wand of his word, and examine them by the old and auncient way of the faithfull Patrairkes and Prophets, chalked out in the ſacred ſcriptures.

enormities and iniuries, and for the ſuppreſsing of irregular and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons: ſo we hold this Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our ſoules, for the arraigning, enditing, examining, iudging and condemning of our ſinnes, that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto ſinne, we may liue vnto God with peace of conſcience, and tranquilitie of minde. Secondly, if we doe onely ſearch and examine our waies, and proceed no further, we ſhal make our ſelues more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, &amp; encreaſe our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>Thirdly, it is a very abſurd and diſorderly courſe, for any man to take a noble mans liuery, and to weare his recogniſance, and yet in the meane time to ſerue his enemie.

ſhall wee enter into his houſe, and eate his meate, and in the meane while, ſerue our loſtes and fulfill the fancie of our fleſh, which is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to God and godlineſſe?

            <p>Sixtly, though God haue pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the ſinnes of his children by his decree, promiſe, and merits of his ſonne: yet he doth not actually apply this pardon to their faith and feeling, till they do turne vnto him.
