         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON ſight of this notable piece of Confidence, or rather Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this Abuſive Fellow does preſent his Reader withal, I thought, that both Doctor <hi>Chamberlin</hi> and his Project, as well as the Author of that Paper, whom he calls Pamphleteer, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to be overthrown and confounded at once, with unanſwerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and thoſe quoted out of the Doctor's own Books too, ay and the Paper examined by every Paragraph! Moſt certainly there is a full ſtop put to all the Doctors Proceedings now, and he muſt never dare to trouble Mankind any more with his projects: For our moſt diſcerning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66467:3"/>
Scribler conceiting that he hath found out, that the Author of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per neither underſtood the Doctors or Mr. <hi>Briſcoes</hi> Propoſals, or does wilfully deſign to miſlead his Reader; and knowing, that Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> is better emploied in Publiſhing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He therefore <hi>intends to take upon him the task, to ſhew how notoriouſly the Author hath proſtituted his reputation, by publiſhing moſt palpable abſurdities, and no leſs notorious untruths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by your good have Mr. Impudence, I ſhall tell you, that on farther ſcrutiny, I ſhall make it appear, that you are not able to perform the task you have undertaken; but that this task is moſt palpably too hard for your ſlender abilities. I cannot tell whether you have done this with the connivance of Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> or altogether of your own head, for that you ſay, he is better emploied in publiſhing a Second Edition of his moſt Ingenious Book; (with moſt incomparable additions) ſuch I warrant ye, as the like were never ſeen, heard, or underſtood before; becauſe ſaith he, our Pamphleteer himſelf is forced to confeſs it to be ſuch; there's a clincher for yenow that's unanſwerable. Well Sir, I'le venture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the meaning of it, tho' it be without the Author's leave, and thus it is.</p>
            <p>The excellency of this Book, for which it is ſo commended, doth not conſiſt in the Twenty ſeveral Propoſals as he imagines, becauſe they are all much worſe and more perplexing to conſider, than the Doctors; but in the management of the Arguments againſt the preſent Bank and Lotteries, which are ſuch deſtructive ways of raiſing Money; all which hath been already hinted at in the Doctors, and others Anſwers to Books Written for the ſaid Bank, which he hath more copiouſly handled in his own Book, and therefore it was called Ingenious, and may be applied to the Doctor's Propoſal, as well as to Mr. <hi>Briſcoes:</hi> For beſides, the Doctor hath Written, though not Publiſhed, a compleat Book, being a large Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript on this Subject, and it may be without exception equal to Mr. <hi>Briſcoes,</hi> and therein hath fully Anſwered all Objections, and likewiſe hath made ſeveral Propoſals of greater and leſſer value, all which Mr. <hi>Briſcoe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> hath not only ſeen, but hath had ſome of them in his Poſſeſſion for two Months together, and therefore knew the better how to frame his own by it. For before Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> was brought acquainted with the Dr. by Mr. <hi>Salisbury</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prime,</hi> he was altogether Ignorant, and wholly unacquainted with this project, or any thing like it; but was inſtructed by the Dr. therein, becauſe he was recommended as a Man, that might be ſerviceable, after which time he accompanied the Dr. to a meeting of ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Noblemen, Gentlemen and Merchants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66467:3"/>But Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> always was ſo crafty, as to diſwade the Dr. from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing any thing in Print, leſt the World, ſaid he, ſhould be too much enlightned; and likewiſe he diſcouraged the Doctor from making appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to my Lord <hi>Rumny,</hi> or the Court, for that he was confidently aſſured, they would never encourage any thing of this kind; and yet at the ſame time was underhand, without acquainting the Doctor therewith, Printing this Book, and hath Dedicated it to the King, yet privy to all the Dr's. proceedings, and joined with him in a Propoſal, which he undertook to bring to paſs.</p>
            <p>Pray now, but behold what a Snake the Doctor hath cheriſhed in his boſom all this while! But what could otherwiſe be expected of a Stock-Jobber. I can tell you juſt ſuch another ſtory of two Men, who may be named <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> You muſt know then, that <hi>R.</hi> was an honeſt worthy Gentleman, who communicated to <hi>B.</hi> a notable ſharper, (tho' unknown to be ſuch to <hi>R.</hi> till after tryal) a propoſal, which might be advantagious, for which they muſt get a Patent: <hi>B</hi> approves of it, and promiſeth all his aſſiſtance, on which with ſome others, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they agree to take out a Patent, but a little after, <hi>R.</hi> went out of Town on his own buſineſs; <hi>B.</hi> in the mean time gets the Patent to be engroſſed, and the while <hi>R.</hi> unlook'd for returns, and by chance ſees this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent engroſſing; preſently takes it in his hand to read; the principal Clark, or Maſter of the Office ſeeing that, ſays to <hi>R.</hi> O Lord Sir, we had a particular charge from <hi>B.</hi> that you of all Men ſhould not have a ſight of it, and ſo goes to take it out of <hi>R</hi>'s. hand; Nay ſays <hi>R.</hi> if you have a mind to go to Cuffs for it, withal my Heart; but I am reſolved to read it now I have it; which he did, and ſaw that his name was no where mentioned, though he was and ought to have been the principal perſon concerned therein. And then <hi>R.</hi> having an Intereſt in the Court, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately procured a ſtop to be put to it, and ſome other things of the like nature have been practiced by the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> Now the Doctor was not altogether ſo wary it ſeems. Next I ſhall proceed with Mr. Impudence by Paragraph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paragraph Firſt,</hi> I allow Mr. Impudence hath quoted the Doctor right, but pray obſerve what a notable Remark he hath made on the <hi>Pamphleteers diſingenuity, or forgetfulneſs in giving an account of only how</hi> 8000 l. <hi>of the Doctor's</hi> 10000 l. <hi>is to be diſpoſed of, but ſays not a word of the</hi> 2000 l. <hi>the Doctor hath reſerved to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66467:4"/>And what of all this now? What occaſion was there of mentioning of it in that place? When as it hath been told in the Doctor's Printed Propoſal already, and the Paper being but a ſhort Abſtract; the Author of it would have been altogether as impertinent as your Worſhip, if he ſhould have repeated any thing more of it in that place, than might ſerve his purpoſe. <hi>But of this Mr. Impudence ſhall ſay ſomething more of it preſently.</hi> It may be ſo, and I believe to as little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For his <hi>Second Paragraph,</hi> It is alſo very right quoted, wherein Mr. <hi>Briſcoe offers that the like current Credit be raiſed on Gentlemens Eſtates of</hi> 100 l. per Annum, <hi>engaged to pay</hi> 10 l. per Annum <hi>for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Remark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I find Mr. Pamphleteer, that you underſtand not that Mr.</hi> Briſcoe <hi>propoſes; for whoſoever peruſes his</hi> 16, 17, 18, 22, 23 <hi>Propoſals will find almoſt Twenty ſeveral Propoſals or Terms for raiſing Money</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſals, I believe are like ſome fruitful Bitches, that carry half a dozen Whelps in their Bellies at once; and we may as well ſay of Mr. <hi>Briſcoes</hi> Propoſals, as of <hi>Hudibras</hi> his Tropes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>No ſooner he his Mouth did ope,</l>
               <l>But preſently out flew a Trope.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I ſuppoſe if his Book be more carefully peruſed, you may find Propoſal in every line, or at leaſt a great many more then may appear at firſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I can't tell whether the Doctor hath ſo many Propoſals ready cut and dry'd by him, tho' any Man may judge his Proposal may be varied many ways; but this I know, that this one Propoſal alone of the Doctors, is worth much more than all <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s numerous company of Propoſals, and let him invent as many more as ever he can to boot.</p>
            <p>Farther he goes on, <hi>And this</hi> for ever, <hi>is no more then, that he who takes up Bills of Credit upon his Eſtate, muſt pay</hi> 10 l. per Cent, per Annum <hi>for ever, till the principal be paid, and that</hi> for ever <hi>may be in Twelve Months, if he pays in his Money at the Years end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> ought to have ſaid, till the Principal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt be paid in, as in the Caſe of Mortgages, that are redeemable, and not have uſed theſe words <hi>for ever,</hi> which were improper in that place; but Sir, Muſt it follow then, that the Author muſt be blamed for his want of underſtanding, when Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> did not uſe proper and intelligible expreſſions? For you allow the Author hath rightly quoted him, by your Repetition, and Explanation of Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66467:4"/>Paragraph the Third, <hi>But as this is a far leſs encouragement to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder then the Doctors; ſo there is much more care and trouble to ſettle Eſtates according to</hi> Mr. Briſcoes <hi>Rules.</hi> Remark, <hi>Prithee Mr. Pamphleteer do not you pretend to paſs your judgment of what is more or leſs incouraging, you have acquitted your ſelf ſo ill in this Paper, that no body will give a white Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for your Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Mr. Impudence, wherein does it appear, that the Pamphleteer hath ſo ill acquitted himſelf; is it only becauſe you ſay ſo, for we have none but your lying expreſſion for it, for hitherto in all theſe Three Paragraphs you have not made it appear, that he hath either miſlead his Reader, or ſhewed any Ignorance, or proſtituted his Reputation, or publiſhed moſt palpable abſurdities, or notorious untruths as you at firſt engaged to ſhow; but hath acquitted himſelf very well with true quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: And what follows?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhy Mr.</hi> Briſcoes <hi>propoſals lie before the Parliament, and they are more capable of judging then ten thouſand ſuch little ſcriblers as you are.</hi>

            <p>That's much you will make ſo free a Confeſſion Mr. Impudence, ſtill here is neither abſurdity, nor untruth in all this. But here now comes the Kill-Cow at laſt, and the principal matter, that deſtroys the Doctors project. Says he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the ſame Eſtate might yield the Freeholder</hi> 96000 l. <hi>if ſettled for the payment of</hi> 100 l. per Annum, <hi>for 1000 Years; for if once, you come to exceed your Fund, and to ſay the</hi> 2000 l. <hi>Fund is a ſecurity for</hi> 10000 l. <hi>you may as well add another nought to it; and ſay, it may be a ſecurity for</hi> 100000 l. <hi>As to the parallel it is unintelligible nonſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66467:5"/>There's for you now Doctor in plain terms, and unleſs you can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle this Riddle, and explain this great Myſtery, or take this great ſtumbling-block out of the way, your propoſal is loſt for ever. But what doth Mr. Impudence make of the Committee at the ſame time, that paſt their approbation of it to the Houſe, that it was both profitable and practicable? O! but this is an Objection, that he hath found out ſince.</p>
            <p>Very well Sir, ſince the caſe is ſo, I will undertake in both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and the Doctors place to Anſwer and Explain this mighty difficulty (though I doubt not but the Doctor is able much better to do it himſelf, if he ſhall think it worth his while to take notice of ſuch a feeble Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion as you are) and make you appear as Ignorant, and abſurd a fellow, and as great a lyar, as you would falſly repreſent both the Doctor and the Author to the World.</p>
            <p>For neither the Doctor, nor the Author do any where affirm that 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Fund or Value in Land is a Security for 10000 <hi>l.</hi> as you ſay they do; for though an Eſtate of 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> by this moſt excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, does raiſe the value of 6000 <hi>l.</hi> to the Subſcriber, yet it does not follow, that the Doctor ſays it is worth it to ſell at the Market-price, or is a Fund ſufficient for ſo much, if he had, you would certainly have quoted the Page: But this Mr. Impudence and Mr. Ignorance too, is your own falſe Notion, that you would fix upon the Doctor to render his Propoſal ineffectual; as more plainly you tell us in the laſt Page, <hi>That the Doctor propoſes four Millions,</hi> meaning for himſelf, <hi>for ever, which is as much as the</hi> 200000 l. per Annum <hi>Land propoſed by the Doctor, for the ſecurity of the whole two Millions is worth, ſo that the Fund for the whole Sixteen Millions is in</hi> Nubibus. <hi>For in plain terms the Doctor hath made no proviſion for that.</hi> And farther a little lower, <hi>In the Third point we agree, only as I have ſaid, I cannot come up to the Doctors Notion to make</hi> 2000 l. <hi>value in Land, to be a ſecurity for</hi> 10000 l.</p>
            <p>No, nor the Doctor neither, as you have told the ſtory. But for that I hear ſeveral Men, who being not rightly informed of the Doctors Propoſal, are apt to be drawn to an ill opinion thereof, by means of ſuch as your Blockheads Idle ſuggeſtions: Therefore to undeceive them, I ſhall lay down the Doctor's words in his own Propoſal, which are theſe,</p>
            <p>That any perſon, that hath an Eſtate of 150 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame for the payment of 100 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for 100 Years, until the Sum of 200000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> be compleated; that on every ſuch Rent of 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> the Doctor by order of the Commiſſioners ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66467:5"/>
Iſſue out Tickets to the value of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and no more, whereof 4000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhall be to the Subſcriber, and 2000 <hi>l.</hi> to ſome publick Joint-ſtock, but the profit thereof to the Subſcriber, and the reſt to other uſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In all this, the Doctor ſays not a word, that the Rent of 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year is worth, or a ſufficient Fund for 10000 <hi>l.</hi> but what he propoſeth is, that an Eſtate of 150 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, together with the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock in Trade, is a ſufficient ſecurity for the payment of a Rent of 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year to the Commiſſioners, which does not amount to that great Sum of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> till an Hundred Years be expired; and this he might have added withal, that this ſaid ſecurity does every Year grow ſtronger, as the Rent is conſtantly paid in; for when 99 Years are paſt, there will remain but one Year more, and ſuppoſing the Rent to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paid, there will then be put 100 <hi>l.</hi> due, yet the ſaid 150 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Land together with the ſaid 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, is all ſtill tyed to make good the payment of the ſaid remaining 100 <hi>l.</hi> but then I know you are in haſte to reply, How comes 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to be raiſed and lent on this 150 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Land? For no Man will lend above 1500 <hi>l.</hi> at moſt on ſuch an Eſtate, and 2000 <hi>l.</hi> is the uſual price for an 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. This is the Myſtery, which is thus eaſily to be made plain.</p>
            <p>The 10000 <hi>l.</hi> is not to be borrowed at Intereſt of any private Perſon, or publick Society; for then the Parliament muſt pay at leaſt 8 <hi>l. per Cent,</hi> it being a tryed Caſe the laſt Seſſions, when they borrowed 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> of a company of Men, who would not depoſit the Money without 8 <hi>l. per Cent,</hi> and a farther contract, to be made a company of Bankers with privileges to give out Bills, that might be of advantage enough to make their Money and Bills together yield above 30 <hi>l per Cent</hi> at leaſt; and incommode all the reſt of the Nation to the ruine of many: But all this Money is to be raiſed out of a Mint, wherein Braſs Tickets of 5 <hi>l.</hi> Value are to be formed, for which no Intereſt is to be paid; and the project, like a Mine, is able to ſupport its own Coſts and Charges; theſe Tickets when confirmed by an Act of Parliament, and ſecured by Land as aforeſaid, are and will be full as uſeful to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, as if we had diſcovered a Gold or Silver Mine.</p>
            <p>Now the Value of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in theſe Tickets are to be made, and lent to the Subſcribers, and other uſes as aforeſaid, and to be repaid, but not all at once with Intereſt, as in the caſe of all other common Mortgages, where the Creditor can call in both Principal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt when he pleaſes, but to be an Hundred Years in paying at an Hundred Pound a Year only, which in the end makes up Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66467:6"/>
Pound; ſo that if any Subſcriber is behind in his Rent but one Year, you ſeize the Rents of his Eſtate, of 150 <hi>l.</hi> and the profits of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in Stock, and that certainly will quickly pay that Years Rent of an Hundred Pound, and then all is free again till another Years Rent be behind: So that the difference only conſiſts in the manner of repaying it, which makes the Hundred and Fifty Pound a Year a good Security.</p>
            <p>Thus after the ſame manner, if you have an Inn, Rented at Eighty Pound, and a Ground at Twenty Pound, in all an Hundred Pound a Year, and the Tenant hath a Leaſe for Ten Years, which at the end of the term in all will amount to 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and perhaps all the Goods in the Houſe are not worth above Sixty Pound, when this Tenants Leaſe begins, will you ſay, that this is a good Security for a Thouſand Pound, or that this Man is to pay you a Thouſand Pound? No ſure; but rather he being an honeſt careful and obliging Man, he is good Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for a Rent of an Hundred Pound a Year in that Inn.</p>
            <p>For in ſuch an Eſtate any Landlord will truſt an Induſtrious Careful fellow with ſo much, tho' he be poor, when he will be unwilling to truſt him with an Hundred Pound in Ready Money, and thus the Poor Man may pay a Thouſand Pound by that time the Ten Years are expired; The caſe being truly thus: Then I ſay, That an Hundred and Fifty Pound a Year, whoſe Purchaſe is Three Thouſand Pound, with the Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound Stock, is a very large Security for Ten Thouſand Pound to be repaid at an Hundred Pound a Year, without other Intereſt: And thus it may be a Security for Ninety Six thouſand as he ſays, though being a moſt prodigious Dance he could not comprehend the manner of it.</p>
            <p>This point then, I hope, is ſufficiently cleared, and you Mr. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proved moſt notoriouſly guilty of Evil ſpeaking, lying, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring. Now if the Doctor had propoſed to raiſe a Thouſand Years Purchaſe, on an Hundred Pound a Year, then the Sum would have been ſo great, that but few Subſcribers could have the benefit of it, whereas by ſuch a number of Years as an Hundred, there is room enough for all the Members of the Houſe of Commons if they pleaſe, and Fifteen Hundred Men more to Subſcribe, to raiſe ſuch a Sum as Twenty Millions, out of which they may pay their Debts, and diſcharge their encumberances; beſides a ſupply of Four Millions to carry on the War, and Royal Fiſhery, which <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s Propoſals ſay nothing of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66467:6"/>But to return to Mr. Impudence again, who after he hath declared himſelf a conceited lump of Ignorance, ſays, <hi>He is willing to paſs by the unintelligible Nonſence, and Remarks the leaving out of the Doctor's Two Thouſand Pound reſerved for himſelf;</hi> which he begrutcheth the Doctor very much, of which more anon.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>Says by the Doctor's Propoſal, the engaged Eſtate will be, after an Hundred Years, diſcharged from this encumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and free for the like ſettlement, which being engaged for ever by Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s can admit of no further improvement, and 'tis much better to raiſe Ten Thouſand Pound on the ſame Eſtate, than Two Thouſand Pound.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remark,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s Propoſals, Eighteen and Twenty Third, an Eſtate by his Method may be ſettled Five or Ten times over, for and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Why, Mr. Impudence, I pray you tell me now the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mortgaging an Hundred Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> for Ten Thouſand Pound to be repaid as <hi>per</hi> Doctor's Propoſal, and Mortgaging of it for Twenty Years, and then pay it off, and ſo for another Twenty Years, till an Hundred Years be compleated, diſcharging the ſaid Mortgage every Twenty Years, according to <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s Propoſal? Will not there be more than the value of Ten Thouſand Pound paid in Principle, Intereſt and Charges by that time? And is not a greater Sum abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more ſerviceable, than a Sum that's leſs by a Fifth part? For you your ſelf confeſs it when you ſay a little after, <hi>you are ſure it is better for the Nation to have an Hundred Thouſand Pound raiſed upon an Eſtate, than Ten Thouſand Pound, as is ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. Impudence proceeds. <hi>And with ſubmiſſion it is nonſence, I tell you again to raiſe Ten Thouſand Pound on Two Thouſand Pound Fund, and thoſe you would have take your Braſs Tickets will ſay the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my certain knowledge, Mr. Impudence, that's another great lye of yours, for that there are very many of them do know and ſay to the contrary, and for thoſe that do not, I hope they will better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, when they have read thus far; Eſpecially when they ſhall obſerve, that neither this Mr. Blockhead, nor his great Maſter Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> from whom he hath his Inſtructions, doth make any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a Fund of Land ſettled for the payment of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound preſently, as they underſtand it, and Ten Thouſand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66467:7"/>
Pound to be an Hundred Years in paying, as the Doctor propoſeth. Every body knows, that according to the Market-price in <hi>England,</hi> Land is reckoned at Twenty Years Purchaſe, and then Ten Thouſand Pounds buys Five Hundred Pound a Year; and if lent on a Mortgage, they will expect a Thouſand Pound a Year to be tyed for Security, and yet reſerve a liberty to call it all in, whenever they pleaſe, and therefore it's eſteemed as Ready Money.</p>
            <p>Now ſince both the Blockhead, and Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> go about to confound the Doctor's Propoſal with this falſe Notion, that Ten Thouſand Pound in preſent Money, and Ten Thouſand Pound that is an Hundred Years in paying, is equally the ſame thing, and of the ſame value, for ſo they moſt Fallaciouſly repreſent it, I would therefore ask both the Blockhead and Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> this one queſtion; Suppoſe they had Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound to diſpoſe of, and here are two offers made them, one of Five Hundred Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be ſold for ſuch a Sum, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Hundred and Fifty Pound a Year to be Mortgaged for a Hundred and Fifty Years, the profits whereof does amount to Twenty Two Thouſand Five Hundred Pound at the end of the ſaid term, and as ſo much Ready Money according to their Notion, is to be valued, Which of theſe two offers will they let go their Ten Thouſand Pound for? No doubt they would think it an hard bargain, if they were forced to take the Hundred and Fifty Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> for their Money; though according to their own way of reckoning it will raiſe 22500 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing is very remarkable in all that write againſt the Doctor's Propoſal, that they love dearly to repeat the ſame thing over and over again, as in one <hi>Jerry Squirt</hi>'s Pamphlet, and others, as if they were all of the ſame <hi>Welſh</hi> Strain.</p>
            <p>So here again he hints at the ſaid Two Thouſand Pound reſerved by the Doctor, though he mentioned it a Second time juſt before the Fifth Paragraph; which at laſt ſerves his purpoſe no more, than if he had only knock'd his heels againſt the ground.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Sixth Paragraph,</hi> I have not Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s Book to peruſe, for it ſeems he did not ſend any to the Doctor, or his Friends; and they are not to be had at the Bookſellers, ſo cannot reply to it: But dare engage the Author will ſtand by, and make good what he has Written, notwithſtanding in the cloſe of his Remark Mr. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſays;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66467:7"/>
               <hi>And if this be not as I aſſert, I will give the whole World leave to account me as Impertinent, Prevaricating, and Falſifying a Scribler, as our Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer hath ſhewed himſelf to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very well Mr. Impudence! And the World may with very good Reaſon call you by theſe Names, and with many more, and worſe Epithites, and yet do you no manner of wrong or injury in the leaſt; for by your Scribble, you ſhould have but little value for your Credit, or rather no Credit to ſave.</p>
            <p>He that Steals, or Picks a Pocket, may as well ſay, if it can be proved upon him, He will give the World leave to call him Rogue, and Thief; that being no more than the Title of his Profeſſion, will not hurt him at all.</p>
            <p>And pray Sir, What matter is it, what the World ſays of ſuch a ſorry Fellow as you, that hath no Name and leſs Senſe? If you had ſhewed any Wit, it might have attoned for your Rudeneſs, but Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Railing can hardly deſerve a Pardon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paragraph the Seventh,</hi> Both this Paragraph, and the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, is particularly about the Doctor's reward for his Propoſal: The deſign of the Paper, I find to be in an eſpecial manner to leſſen and deſtroy the Doctors Propoſal, that by ſuch a method they may the better advance, and promote Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s Multitude of little Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, which he hath filled his Book with all, in hopes, that ſome one or other of them may probably take, like an Adventurer at Lotteries, who put in Five Thouſand Pound, in hopes of one Prize, though it fell out they were all Blanks, and I believe his will prove no better: But if either of them does take, then let him alone to benefit himſelf by it, though he ſays nothing of his reward there; for all that knows Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> do well underſtand that he does not uſe to concern himſelf in any private or publick affair, eſpecially thoſe of the publick, without he can tell which way to get a large recompence for his pains.</p>
            <p>Now ſince they have endeavoured to expoſe the Doctor's Propoſal of a Land Fund, to be both Nonſenſical and Inſufficient, I believe I have cleared that to full ſatisfaction: So that it appears the fault lies in their want of Brains and Underſtanding, which hath brought forth both this Libel and <hi>Briſcoes</hi> Book, for otherwiſe Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> could have no occaſion to Print ſo many leſſer ſilly Propoſals as he hath, wherein he hath entrenched as well on Mr. <hi>William Killegrew</hi>'s Propoſal off <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome time ago to the Parliament, as on the Doctors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66467:8"/>I come now to ſhew one other little deſign of theirs, which hath no other end at all, unleſs it be to let the World know, that the Doctor hath carved out too large a Portion for himſelf, which alone hath a Fund as they ſay, and for the reſt he hath provided no Fund, but what is <hi>in Nubibus;</hi> at which Mr. Impudence is much diſturbed, as appears by his ſo frequent repetitions, and ſo much ſcribble at laſt together about it: Notwithſtanding all which I have plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, there is provided a full and ſafe Security for it all, here on <hi>Terra Firma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the Doctor hath carved out ſuch a good round Sum as Four Millions, yet it is not all for himſelf, for Mr. Impudence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that he is to pay out of it the Lord Keeper, Maſter of Rolls, and Judges, to be at the charge of making all the Tickets, pay all other Officers, and Offices diſperſt up and down in every County, and after all theſe are paid, what think you may remain to the Doctor at laſt, you ſhould have caſt up that too, as well as <hi>Briſcoes</hi> charges.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Doctor had a Million of Money left him, What is any Man the worſe for it? That you have taken ſuch repeated notices of it, Does any Man loſe by it, or is cheated out of his right, or wronged any manner of way? Or rather will not every Subſcriber (though the Doctor be ſo largely paid out of it) increaſe his Eſtate to above double the value, and gain much more by his Propoſal, then he can or will by any of the beſt of <hi>Briſcoes</hi> Propoſals take which you will? And he have a great many, that are ſpick and ſpan new, an whole Ware-Houſe full of them, ſo that you may go in, and take your choice of all ſorts and ſizes, and of all manner of Prizes; but thoſe of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort hath ſeveral more in them, and they are marked, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Twenty Two and Twenty three Propoſals; 'tis very ſtrange to me if the Houſe of Commons be not quickly cloied with all this cluſter of Propoſals, eſpecially if they are brought in the Spaeker's ſight, he may be apt to call out to Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> in the ſame manner as was once ſpoken to a much Nobler Perſon at the Seſſions of the Poets.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66467:8"/>
               <l>Put up your Trumpery good Noble Marquiſs,</l>
               <l>And provide him ſome Straw in a Room that dark is.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If the Doctor had contrived a project ſo much for the benefit of the Nation, and had left himſelf out, or forgot himſelf in, then you might have had much more cauſe to put him in the Dark Room, after he had been at ſo great Expences of time and Money: And why it ſhould not be as much commendable in him, to provide well for himſelf and Family, as his Propoſal will do for the Nation in general, if Enacted by Parliament; or why he ſhould not be allowed to pay himſelf, when every Treaſurer, or Man in Office doth the ſame, and that honeſtly too, I cannot tell. But this Impudent Booby does not know what he would be at.</p>
            <p>Oh but he ſaith, that the very Commiſſioners themſelves, as the Lord Keeper, Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt all come to him for their Salleries: And what if they do? What are they worſe for it? Why may not they go to him, as well as to any of the Under Officers of the Exchequer? I ſuppoſe they will not ſtand much on that, who they go to; ſo as they can receive their Money whenever they go, or ſend for it. For therein lies the ſtreſs of the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But after all, though the Doctor has laid down ſuch a Method in his Propoſal for himſelf to be Mr. Workman, and to have the payment of the Salleries, (as I think he hath moſt right to the management of it, that is the Inventor) yet it does not follow, that the Parliament are obliged and tyed to follow his Rules, any more than they are to do, as Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi> does propoſe, or to raiſe no more or leſs Money than Twenty Millions; but it is left to their diſcretion to alter what they pleaſe, to make who they will Treaſurer, and to give the Doctor ſomething or nothing in conſideration of his Propoſal: However it was convenient and neceſſary, that ſome ſort of a method ſhould be laid before them, Or elſe how ſhould they know what to do with any Propoſal?</p>
            <p>Well then, ſince both the Doctors, and <hi>Briſcoe's</hi> Propoſals are before the Houſe, you may ask a Parliament Man, in Caſe he were, or were not in Debt, which he would rather chuſe, the Doctors that will ſupply him with 6000 <hi>l.</hi> or Mr. <hi>Briſcoes</hi> that can raiſe but 2000 <hi>l.</hi> on the ſame Eſtate of 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to ſerve his occaſions?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, when Mr. Impudence comes to the laſt Page, there is but little beſide a Repetition of what hath been ſaid before, and not worth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66467:9"/>
a reading; only this is to be obſerved of him, that <hi>Billingsgate</hi> can hardly match his in ill Language. As for Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> by what hath been ſaid, I think, his behaviour does really deſerve a reproof, which I ſhall give him in a Latin Sentence. <hi>Sat poenae eſt meruiſſe poenam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for Mr. Impudence, it is well for him, that he conceals his Name, for otherwiſe, there is no Gentleman that knew him, but what would judge him fit to be Kick'd out of all Civil Company for a <hi>Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I was ſending this to the Preſs, there was given to me another of Mr. Impudence's Lybels, which he hath Re-printed, with an impudent Preamble on the top of it; by which, I perceive that Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> and the Blockhead are great Cronies; and ſo may they always be, for they are only fit for one anothers Company. And whereas he ſaith, He will take care, that Mr. <hi>Briſcoes,</hi> and the Doctor's Books ſhall both lye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the publick Coffee-Houſes, to the view of all Perſons, that ſo they may ſee by the compariſon, that the Doctor is not that Man of Senſe, he would have the World believe him to be. I deſire he will be pleaſed to let this Paper likewiſe lie there a long with them, that ſo they may the better judge of the matter, when they have read what all Parties have ſaid: And whether he hath not Cauſe enough to be aſhamed, if there be any ſuch thing as ſhame in him, which is much to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And though he threatens another parcel of Nonſenſe in a Second Impreſſion, yet perhaps he may alter his mind, after he hath peruſed this Paper, wherein the Caſe is laid ſo plain, that it's hoped the Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Dunce may be convinced that there is no fear of the Doctor's running his head againſt a Poſt; but rather, that this Blockhead being ſo void of Senſe, and therefore ſo much reſembling a Poſt, may run his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctor, with deſign to overthrow his Perſon, as well as his Propoſal.</p>
