            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <unclear>CASE OF the</unclear> Hudſons-Bay-Company.</head>
            <p>THE Kings of <hi>England,</hi> by Right of Diſcovery, and premier Occupancy, for above 100 Years ſince, have the ſole Rightful Title and Soveraignty of all the <hi>Seas, Lakes, Bays, Rivers, Creeks, &amp;c.</hi> as well as the <hi>Countries, Confines</hi> and <hi>Territories</hi> within the Entrance of the <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Hudſon;</hi> and that the ſame was never Navigated but by <hi>Engliſh Ships</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Subjects,</hi> till the late Encroachments of the <hi>French,</hi> many Years ſince the Incorporation of this <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Navigation was diſcovered ſo long ſince, yet no Trade was Eſtabliſhed with the Native <hi>Indians</hi> till about Twenty Years paſt, when ſeveral Perſons of Quality, and others, having made ſome private Voyages, and finding that a conſiderable Trade for <hi>Beavor,</hi> and other <hi>Furrs,</hi> might be ſetled with the Savage <hi>Indians,</hi> His late Majeſty King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, was pleaſed by His Letters Patents bearing date the Second of <hi>May,</hi> 1670. to Incorporate the Adventurers; and in purſuance of the aforeſaid Inherent Right in the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did by His <hi>Royal Charter</hi> make a Free Grant to his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert, Chriſtopher</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Craven,</hi> and others His Subjects and their Succeſſors for ever, of all thoſe <hi>Seas, Straits, Bays, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Lakes</hi> and <hi>Creeks</hi> in whatſoever Latitude, from the Entrance of the <hi>Straits,</hi> commonly called <hi>Hudſons Straits;</hi> together with all the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Territories</hi> upon the <hi>Countries, Coaſts</hi> and <hi>Confines,</hi> and that the ſame ſhould be reckoned and reputed as one of His Majeſties Plantations and Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Ruperts Land.</hi> And did further Make and Conſtitute the ſaid <hi>Company</hi> and their Succeſſors, the True and Abſolute <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Proprietors</hi> thereof, to hold in free and common Soccage, as of His Mannor of <hi>East-Greenwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> reſerving an Acknowledgment or Rent for the ſame to His Majeſty, His Heirs and Succeſſors; and Granting to the ſaid <hi>Company</hi> the ſole Trade thereof with Prohibition to all others from Trading within their Limits, without their Licenſe, upon Forfeiture of Ship and Goods ſo offending, which hath alſo by Proclamation been publiſhed and made known: By which Inherent Right of Dominion and Propriety in His Majeſty to the Country and Places, it is humbly conceived His Majeſties ſaid Grant doth extreamly differ from His Charters to the <hi>Eaſt-India-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> or the <hi>African-Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Company</hi> ſince their Incorporation have Erected Forts, Setled ſeveral Factories, Built Ships, Imployed many Seamen, and conſiderably Exported the Manufacturies of this Nation; and in the courſe of their Trade for ſo many Years, have not only actually loſt Thirteen Ships, but been at above Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds Charge: Which makes it evident that nothing but a <hi>Company</hi> and a <hi>Joynt Stock</hi> could have laid the Foundation of ſo conſiderable a Trade amongſt <hi>Infidels,</hi> and have been able to ſupport ſo great a Charge, and ſo many incident Loſſes which naturally attend that Voyage.</p>
            <p>In particular, this <hi>Company</hi> hath ſuffered more by the <hi>French</hi> than any <hi>Company</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> having even in time of Peace committed many Outrages againſt them, taken their Ships at Sea, Invaded their Factories by I and, Robbed them of their Goods, Burnt their Houſes, Murdered ſeveral of Their Majeſties Subjects, and carried others Priſoners to <hi>Quebeck:</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> have had the Inſolence not only to juſtifie thoſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Invaſions, but (according to the Method of that Nation to Encroach upon all the World) have pretended a Right to <hi>Hudſons-Bay,</hi> and by a ſtrange Confidence againſt all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſcoveries of almoſt Two Hundred Years ſince, and all Maps that ever were extant, to make it a Dependence upon <hi>Canada,</hi> and to give out that in a ſhort time they would not only have that, but <hi>New York</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> too: But this <hi>Company</hi> will undertake to make out, That the Crown of <hi>France</hi> hath no Right to <hi>Canada</hi> it ſelf, but that it, and ſome other Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were not only many Years in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poſſeſſion, but that it is unjuſtly detained by the <hi>French,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Terms and Conditions (according to the Faith of that Nation) never performed to this Day.</p>
            <p>Some particular Men of our own Nation alſo, who have diſturbed this <hi>Company</hi> in their Trade, and diſputed the Powers of their <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Charter,</hi> have never attained any Benefit to themſelves, but either given Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>French,</hi> or periſhed in the Voyage, which is extream hazardous through the Mountains of Ice which muſt be paſſed; as about Eighteen Months ſince the <hi>Companies</hi> Ships ſailing in <hi>Hudſons-Bay,</hi> met an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship Interloping there, and in diſtreſs in the Ice juſt ready to ſink, the <hi>Companies</hi> Ship ſeaſonably (by GOD's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) ſaved all the Mens Lives, and the Ship ſunk immediately. Nor is the <hi>Beavor</hi> Trade to be Maintained or improved by a ſingle or ſudden Voyage of any Undertaker, but by the publick Charge of Fortified Forts and Eſtabliſhed Factories to abide there, with a conſtant Correſpondency with the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they may be aſſured where ſetled Factories are, to reſort to at the time of Year, to Trade with for their <hi>Beavor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Extraordinary Loſſes ſuſtained from the <hi>French,</hi> and incurred by the Natural Hazard of the Voyage to and from ſuch a <hi>Climate,</hi> is the more largely inſiſted upon, to Demonſtrate that this Trade (which Twenty Years ago was not one Penny Benefit to this Kingdom, and is now above Twenty Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Advantage) could never have been well begun, nor effectually proſecuted, but by a <hi>Company</hi> in a <hi>Joynt Stock;</hi> and all the Undertakings by ſingle Perſons, (who would have regarded their ſeveral and diſtinct Intereſts) muſt have been rendred fruitleſs, through the many Diſaſters and Loſſes which would have befallen moſt of them, if not all, it being impracticable to raiſe any conſiderable Trade in a remote Country, amongſt Savage <hi>Indians,</hi> without Forts and Factories erected and ſetled amongſt them, and furniſhed with ſtore of all Trading Goods for their conſtant ſupply; and more eſpecially againſt thoſe Potent Rivals the <hi>French,</hi> who manage that particular Trade of <hi>Beavor</hi> under the Counſels of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> to whom it is Granted by the <hi>French King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which is humbly ſubmitted to this Honourable Houſe.</p>
