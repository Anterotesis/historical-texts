         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to the obiection of neglect.</note> WHereas it is obiected, that from the eighth of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> we neuer ſet vp light-houſes at <hi>Winterton</hi> vntill this time: we anſwer, it is true. The reaſon is, that vntill now, there was neuer cauſe, neither in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>gements of our ſelues, nor of the Maſters of ſhipping, trading that coaſt. About 2 or 3 miles from <hi>Winterton,</hi> 13 or 14 yeares ſince, we built 2 light-houſes, and layd 2 booyes at a place called <hi>Caſtor:</hi> at which time we ſounded all thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, but found no cauſe why to ſet vp, or lay out any ſea-marke, either for day or night at <hi>Winterton.</hi> Some 10 yeares ſince, or thereabouts, we made 2 other light-houſes at <hi>Lowſtoffe:</hi> at which time we likewiſe ſounded all thoſe channels on that coaſt, but found no cauſe for any ſea-marke at <hi>Winterton:</hi> ſo good was the channell there, that we thought it not needfull; neither was it held neceſſary by others. Some 6 yeares ſince, or thereabouts, we ſent ſix of the chiefeſt of our Corporation, with ketches or boates to ſound all thoſe channels vpon that coaſt; and to erect, and lay out ſuch and ſo many ſea-markes, as to them ſhould ſeeme good: yet found no cauſe to ſet vp any light-houſe at <hi>Winterton.</hi> But now ſome 4 yeares ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, in one Winter the ſands altered, and the channell grew dangerous: and preſently after, fell a wracke of 5 or 6 ſhips: yet not ſo much by the alteration of the channell, as by a great ſtorme or tempeſt, that happened by night: which ouer-ruled the skill and cunning of the Pilots, to the loſſe of the foreſaid ſhips: yet were not all the ſhips loſt which were in this ſtorme, and in the company of thoſe loſt ſhips: for the whole number of ſhips was 35 or 40, of which onely fiue or ſixe were loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">That we ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a light-houſe, as ſoon as was cauſe; and that <hi>10</hi> or <hi>11</hi> months before the Patentee.</note>Preſently vpon this, we made preparation, (which was ſeconded by a generall petition from all the owners and Maſters of ſhips trading <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and that North coaſt) and began to build our Tower-light in March, and finiſhed it in Iune fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; which coſt vs 600 pounds; and kept our lights from Iune to Aprill following, without any collection towards the charge. By which time the Patentee obtained his patent (dated the xviij of Febr. 1617.) by vertue whereof we were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put out our lights: which we did. And afterwards the Patentee broke open the doore of our tower-light, and kept his light in it, vntill his owne ſtructures were erected.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The charge of the Patentees ſtructures.</note>Whereas it is auerred and deliuered, that the Patentee hath bene at 25 or 30 hundred pounds vpon the charge of his ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, or houſes built at <hi>Winterton:</hi> we anſwer, that the like ſtructures or houſes may be built for 150 pounds, or thereabouts. And for the ſurplus of charges, we profeſſe, not to vnderſtand it, neither do we thinke that the Patentee can giue an account thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His yearely charge.</note>For the monethly or yearely charges of keeping the ſaid lights; we anſwer: that it is about 11 or 12 pounds a moneth, which is 130 pounds, or thereabouts, a yeare.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His yearely receipts.</note>Towards this his charge in erecting, and for his maintenance of theſe lights, 3 yeares or thereabouts he hath receiued the collection of 2 pence vpon euery chaldron of coales: which amounteth yearely to the ſumme of 14 or 15 hundred pounds; beſides the collection of one pennie vpon the tunne of all other ſhips trading that coaſt:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>40</hi> pence for <hi>6</hi> pence.</note> which (being 40 pence vpon euery 20 chaldron) is neere ſeuen times ſo much as the voluntary contribution (of 6 pence vpon euery 20 chaldron) accepted by the <hi>Trinitie-houſe,</hi> for maintenance of their lights.</p>
            <p>Now it reſteth to anſwer to the difference, betweene the Patentee, and the Maſters of the <hi>Trinitie-houſe,</hi> in point of qualitie, and care, for well keeping of the ſaid lights.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees vnfitnes.</note> Of the Patentee, we will ſay but this: he is no ſea-man. In the nature of ſea-markes, ſands, channels, tides, &amp;c. he neither doth, nor can poſſibly vnderſtand.</p>

               <note place="margin">Qualitie, fit to keepe ſea-markes.</note> For the Maſters of the <hi>Trinitie-houſe,</hi> in point of qualitie, who can iuſtly except againſt vs? Are we not ſea-men, bred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from our childhood, in the knowledge of marine affaires: of nauigable channels, ſands, ebbing, flowing, and ſetting of tides: in the knowledge of ſetting out of ſea-markes, whether for day or night? is not this knowledge within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our element, and of ours onely? Are we not at home, when we are in our ſhips, ſurging in thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and on the ſeas? who will or can diſpute or reaſon with vs in this element? it is proper to vs, improper to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

If all theſe weightie motiues be not of force, to ſettle more care in vs, then in any other, for the well keeping of ſea-markes, let vs ſuffer, and be hanged at the gates of the Kings Court, for example to others.</p>

The examination whereof, by vertue of two ſeuerall references from the King, came to full hearing, before the right honorable Lords, at the Councell boord; who, by two ſeuerall orders (as by the ſaid orders at large may appeare) conferred, and confirmed the whole, and ſole keeping of all ſea-markes, vpon our Corporation. After this, the Patentee got a third reference to Sir <hi>Henrie Yelverton,</hi> then Attorney generall: he takes into his conſideration, the legall point onely, (not medling with the point of conuenience) and finding the want of a negatiue in the ſtatute, certified that the Patentee, by allowance from the King, might do it, as well as we. VVhereupon he obtained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties grant, and enioyes the benefit: to the great griefe and diſcouragement of all Merchants, owners, and Maſters of ſhips trading thoſe Northerne coaſts.</p>
