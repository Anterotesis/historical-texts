         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the presenting You with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are divers years past, since
the Reverend, Learned, and
Pious Author of the following
Discourses, fell a sleep in the
Lord, and is gone to receive
the fruit of his Labours, from
the chief Shepherd of the Sheep: Yet we have
in his Memory a lasting proof of the Truth of
that Word, <hi>Pro. 10. 7. The memory of the Just is
Blessed</hi> And that of <hi>Psalm 112 6‚ÄîThe Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous
shall be in everlasting Remembrance:</hi>
Their memory is Precious and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
For I can truly say, though I have
heard many, of high and low Degree speak
of Master <hi>Fergusson,</hi> I never heard any make
mention of him but with Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
As a Man of great Piety and Learning,
and Eminent for Prudence and Moderation.
And I am confident, there will be no need of
<pb facs="tcp:61451:6"/>
Epistles of Recommendation, for any of his
Works, to any who either knew Himself, or
have perused his Judicious and Pious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
published already, on the Epistles to
the <hi>Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians</hi>
and <hi>Thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>alonians.</hi> Nor am I so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,
as to imagine my Testimony
could raise the Esteem of any thing done by
so Famous and Worthy a Man: But being his
Mediate Successor to the Parish of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi>
where he did for many years Labour in the
Work of the Gospel; and being desired by
his Son of the same Name, I could not deny
to express the esteem I have for his Memory,
Though I had not the Advantage of knowing
him while he lived.</p>
            <p>I am informed the following Discourses,
were the subject of Divers <hi>Sermons,</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that People, in a time when there was
much need of Warning; It was after that
through a <hi>Boundless Tolleration,</hi> a deludge
of Errors had broken in upon <hi>England,</hi> and
the <hi>Sectarian Army</hi> having Subdued <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and dispersed themselves in all the Parts
of it, Corrupt Men and Seducers among
Them, did endeavour to pervert the People
<pb facs="tcp:61451:6"/>
from the Truth: Then it was (<hi>anno</hi> 1652.)
When this worthy Author, as a Faithful
Watchman, gave to his Flock Warning of the
Danger; And that they might be rooted and
grounded in the Truth, did represent to them
the necessity of a sound and well-informed
Judgement, in order to Holiness and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and for that end did excite and direct
them to <hi>Try the Spirits;</hi> and afterw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>rd<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for
their further Instruction and establishment in
the Truth, took notice of some particular <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
by which they seem'd to be in greatest
hazard at that time; and did in a plain and
convincing way, Refute the <hi>Errors,</hi> and
Confirm the Truth, making alwayes some
Practical Improvement of what he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>Although the Reverend Author was known
to be a great Master of School-learning, and
was invited to be <hi>Professor of Divinity</hi> in the
Famous University of <hi>Glasgow</hi> (which yet he
humbly refused) yet he did not calculate these
Discourses for the School or Court; But being
to speak to a Countrey Congregation, wherein
were many Common People (for whom they
seem to have been intirely designed, since the
<pb facs="tcp:61451:7"/>
Author could never be induced to Publish them
in his own time) He had such a sense of the holy
Apostles example 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 18, 19. that he
choosed to speak to the edification of the
meanest; and he had a peculiar faculty of
making things intricate, plain and easie to be
understood. And I am confident that those
who are not for pleasing their fancy with fine
notions, or their ear with jingling-words, but
desire to have their judgement informed, and
their conscience satisfied, will find here that
which will be very edifying: For his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is, That Controversies be clearly stated;
And with great perspicuity and solidity doth
he confirm the Truth by Scripture and Reason,
and confute the contrary Error; and all this
without bitterness or wrath, but with such
calmness and moderation of Spirit, wherein he
did excell; So that (as I am informed) divers
of the <hi>English</hi> Army, though of a contrary
Judgement, did resort to hear him; I know
not what effects his Teaching of these Truths
had on Them, but by the Blessing of God,
these of his own Flock were so established in
the Truth, that not one of them was seduced
from it. And I cannot but record it to the
<pb facs="tcp:61451:7"/>
praise of God and commendation of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and for the encouragement of any
who may be invited to be their Pastor, when I,
to their and my grief, am to be separated from
them, to a more difficult Post; I say, I cannot
but record it, that as that Congregation of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winning,</hi>
hath since the Reformation, been
blest with eminent learned and pious Men, Mr
<hi>Glasford.</hi> Mr <hi>Bailie,</hi> Mr <hi>Fergusson</hi> and Mr
<hi>Rogirs;</hi> So they have by the Blessing of God
on their labours, been kept not only Sound in
the Faith, but United among themselves, when
others have been wofully Divided: And they
have alwayes shewed a great love to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and all the Ordinances of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi>
and the Ministers thereof: And I pray <hi>That
their fruit may abound more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If some Expressions Concerning the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi> Men,
seem severe; It would be remembred, that the
Author doth not speak against Persons, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Things; And in a time when many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
followed that Division about Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and the Debate was hot about it,
and fear that it should have taken place in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But considering the Zeal these of <hi>New-England</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61451:8"/>
have discovered against <hi>Error,</hi> and
their United way of acting in <hi>Association</hi> and
<hi>Synods,</hi> when they think there is need, and
the love that hath been in time of Common
Tryal, and the Late Essay which hath been
made for an <hi>Accomodation,</hi> betwixt <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and Them in <hi>England;</hi> I suppose if our
Reverend Author had lived until this time, he
would have concluded, the Difference may be

            <p>I do not know of any particular design of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
these Discourses now, when they have
been kept hid for fourty years, but that the
Author's Son having long delay'd and declin'd
to Publish them, though frequently and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
advis'd to do it by many, he was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
that some would publish the Imperfect
Notes received from His mouth, in the time of
Hearing, which being incorrect, might not
only prejudge the Authors name, but the
Truth, and others Edification. If these (as
is hoped they will) be acceptable and useful,
what yet remains unprinted of these Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
may see the Light in due time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61451:8"/>
There are here subjoyned <hi>Four Sermons</hi>
of the Reverend Author, which the Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and others hope may be found of good use,
and may make way for the communicating
more of his Pious and Judicious Sermons,
which are longed for by them who knew Him,
or his other Works.</p>
            <p>It had surely been of great advantage to the
Church, had it pleased God to have spared
this judicious and pious Author till now, and
that he had published more of his Works in his
own time: But seing our infinitely wise and
good God hath disposed otherwise, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to submit: But if by this, or any other
of his Works, God get Glory, and the Church
be edified; The Publisher will rejoice and
bless God, as having attained his end. And
if the Reader peruse his Works with the same
Spirit wherewith they seem to be spoken
and written, I am confident he will not fail of
profit.</p>
            <p>Now that the Spirit of Truth and Holiness,
would lead Thee and all His people, into all
Truth, and help them to edify one another
in love, and that He would bless His Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
with Truth and Peace, and send out many

                  <q>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the
Spirits whether they are of God.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Body of this Epistle, as we shew'd
when first we entred upon the handling
of it, runs upon <hi>three</hi> Heads: The <hi>first</hi>
is upon Marks whereby to discern real
Grace, <hi>to wit,</hi> who had it, and who not. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61451:12"/>
                  <hi>second</hi> runs upon Exhortations to several Duties of
Sanctification; chiefly, Love to the Brethren, that
Christians would Love them that Love God, Love
Grace wherever they saw it. The <hi>third</hi> Head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it runs is, Exhortations to Constancy, in avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Truth against Error.</p>
               <p>In this fourth Chapter there are two of these Heads,
according to which we may take up the Chapter in
two parts. In the First, There is an Exhortation
to stand by Truth, and to beware of those who would
seduce People from it: And that to <hi>ver.</hi> 7. In the
second part, There is a renewing of the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
<hi>To Love the Brethren:</hi> And a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, by a number of new Arguments, to the
end: Both which have been handled already, and
yet the Apostle returns again to them, because Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
against Error cannot be enough inculcate,
and therefore he reiterats them again and again.</p>
               <p>In the first part of this Chapter, There is, 1. An
Exhortation. 2. There are Arguments to enforce
the Exhortation. The Exhortation is set down in
the former part of the first verse, <hi>Believe not every
Spirit,</hi> that is, lend not an Ear to every point of
Doctrine covered over with a fair Name, but bring
every Doctrine to the Touch-stone. There are two
Things considerable in this Exhortation: First, There
is the compellation he gives them, a warm and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Stile, <hi>Beloved;</hi> And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the
Exhortation it self: And in it there are two Things.
1. What they should not do. And 2. What they
should do. For the <hi>First,</hi> What they should not do.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61451:12"/>
                  <hi>Believe not every Spirit.</hi> Some take the Spirit here
for Preacher, <hi>Believe not every Preacher.</hi> And some
for Doctrine, <hi>Believe not every Doctrine:</hi> But both
may well be joyned together thus, <hi>Believe not every
Preacher who pretends the Spirit for his Doctrine.</hi> For
the <hi>second,</hi> What they should do; It is to <hi>Try the
Spirits whether they are of God.</hi> He bids them not
cast at all Doctrines, because there are some Errors
vented for Truths, as the natural Heart is ready to
do: But, he Exhorts, that they would bring every
Spirit to the right Touch stone. Thus much for
opening up the words.</p>
               <p>We intend (if the Lord give us liberty) to speak
somewhat largely on this Verse of those Doctrines
or Errors which are most like to trouble our Church;
therefore we shall raise some Doctrines before hand,
which may make way for what we intend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct. I.</hi> The First is, from the Apostles dehort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Believers from false Doctrine, by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Hence observe, That Christians would by
all means eschew any thing that may tend to seduce
them from the pure Truths of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
that they would beware of Error, Heresy,
and any thing of that sort: Hence there are so many
Exhortations in Scripture, to stand by the Truth,
to be rooted in the Faith, and to eschew contrary
Error: So it is a Duty lying on Christians, to be
guarding and watching against Error, or what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> The Reason is, because Errour is a Sin, and
a very dangerous one. We shall shew the danger of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61451:13"/>
it in three Things: I. It is dangerous, because of
the desert of it; It is Damnable. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 1. False
Prophets are spoken of there as those who <hi>bring in
damnable Heresies,</hi> that is highly, condemnable:
We shall afterwads show in what respect Heresies
are Damnable. 2. Errours are dangerous Sins, because
they steal subtily in upon People, and people do too
readily relish them: So there are many whose nature
abhorres gross Sins against the second Table, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and such like; and yet the Devil gets them
hooked, by this sin of <hi>Error:</hi> Nature is born with
a cry against gross Sins committed against the second
Table, and so naturally there is some kind of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in People at them; but it is not so in the sins of
<hi>Error: Sathan</hi> can transform himself into an Angel of
Light, and plead Conscience, whereas he intends to
bear down <hi>Truth:</hi> So the sins of Error are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
because subtile. 3. They are dangerous in
this respect, that as they creep easily in; So
when once they are in, it's hard to get them shut to
the door again: And that because deluded Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
pleads for them. People tainted with <hi>Error</hi>
think themselves right, and therefore whatever is
brought against them, Conscience casts at all as
wrong. Now in other Sins, <hi>to wit,</hi> such as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Second Table, altho Affection plead for
them, yet usually Peoples Light does witness against
them: And so in this respect, it is more hard to
get a sin of <hi>Error</hi> thrust out, where it is once root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than the sin of <hi>Prophanity</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This Doctrine may serve to fit you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61451:13"/>
the following <hi>Doctrines</hi> (which if the Lord
will, we are to speak of) tending to the Refutation
of divers <hi>Errors. Error</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> is a subtile
temtation, the temtation of the time, a dangerous
temptation; because it hath now many advantages
to plead for it. Now if the Lord shall bless the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourses, they may prove an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: And what we have now said, shew's how
great need ye have to guard against it: It is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sin, and so ye had need to be armed against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct. II.</hi> Again, a general Doctrine arriseth from
the connexion of this Chapter with the preceeding;
In the preceeding, the Apostle hath been all alongs
stirring up Christians to Sanctification of Life, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew
Prophanity, here he subjoyns an Exhortation
to cleave to the <hi>Truth.</hi> Which gives us this Obeserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That an Orthodox Judgement, or a right O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
in the matters of <hi>Truth</hi> is as much to be studied
as Sanctification of Life, and the contrary of them both
is equally to be eschewed: That is to say, a Child
of God is bound to guard himself, and to watch
as much against <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> in the matter of
Opinion, as against Prophanity and gross Sins in the
matter of Practise. We had need to clear this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is a conceit in People, whereby they are
ready to think, that for the matter of Opinion, it
makes not much what men be, many that have <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
may have Grace, Grace and <hi>Error,</hi> say they, are
consistent: And so if men live well it matters not
much what be their Opinion. We grant indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Error</hi> does not destroy Grace, and Grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61451:14"/>
with some Errors, yet every Error does in so
much weaken the work of Grace within a man. And
<hi>secondly,</hi> Error is consistent with Grace as other dam-Sins
are; as <hi>David's</hi> Adultery was consistent with
Grace. And that is the point to be proven, That
Error in the matter of Doctrine is as much to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
by the Child of God, as gross Sins in the
matter of their Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> We shall bring several things to clear this
Truth to you, and the first is this; Scripture doth
equally discharge both: It is as much in guarding
against Error as Prophanity. So <hi>in</hi> Hebr. 13, 9. <hi>Be
not carried about with divers and strange Doctrines: For
it is a good thing that the Heart be established with Grace:</hi>
and in Coloss. 2. 8. <hi>Bewar lest any man spoil you
through Philosophy</hi>‚ÄîWe need not insist to multiply
Scriptures to this purpose; any that are acquaint with
Scripture (especially the Epistles of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
will find Exhortations against Error to be as
pressing as against any sin else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> as Scripture discharges both alike, <hi>so it</hi>
aggravates the sin of Error as much as the sin of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity.
There is nothing almost that Scripture
brings to aggravate gross sins against the second
Table, but it uses the same to aggravate Error: In
the Epistle to the <hi>Gallat. 5. 19. Adultery, Fornication
Lasciviousness,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> are called <hi>the works of the Flesh:</hi>
An odious name: But in <hi>ver. 20. Heresy</hi> gets the
same name also, and is rekoned up amongst the
works of the Flesh. So in the Epistle to the Coloss.
2, 18. a superstitious mind is called, <hi>a fleshly mind.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61451:14"/>
Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary
humility. And worshiping of Angels, intruding into those
things which he hath not seen, vainly puft up by his fleshly
mind.</hi> And both get one name. Thus in 1 <hi>Peter. 2, 11.
If fleshly lusts</hi> be aggravated from this that <hi>they fight
against the Soul,</hi> they are soul destroying sins: So He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
and Error are branded with a worse name in
the 2 Peter 2. 1‚Äî<hi>who privily bring in damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi>
Heresy is damnable a soul destroying sin, not
for this respect only that they deserve Damnation;
For the meanest sin of Infirmity is damnable that
way, in it self it merits damnation: therefore this
Scripture must mean somewhat more when it calls
Heresy damnable, than to rank it amongst our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
infirmities: Neither are they called damnable
in that sense as if the Soul guilty of Heresy could not
be saved; For many Hereticks have repented unto
Salvation: But they are called damnable sins, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gross sins are called damnable; that is to say
justly and highly Condemnable. They are damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
because they marr the work of Grace, they marr
the thriving of Grace, the lively acts of Grace; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery, (so long as he lay under
it) did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> 3 There is a third Reason to prove this point
and it is this; Stability of the heart in Grace, and stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the mind in Truth, stand and fall together: So
that upon the mind's wavering in the matters of
Truth, the heart will begin to waver in the matter
of Grace also: Prophanity followeth upon Error,
Error received and imbraced oftentimes endeth in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61451:15"/>
Prophanity at the last: And therefore it should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
be watched against with Prophanity it self.
Now to make what we have said appear <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Error</hi> in the matter of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Prophanity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Holiness of Life, usually go along together:
Ye would first look to Experience, Experience
makes this good, that <hi>Error</hi> for the most part ends
in a prophane Godless Life; Scripture experience
clears it, So the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> descrives these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
he speaks of to be vile Livers: And later than
Scripture Experience makes this good also, That
<hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Prophanity,</hi> for the most part, follow
hard upon the heels one of another: It's true <hi>Sathan</hi>
ensnares People at the first to <hi>Error,</hi> by a pretence of
leading them to a more strick way than others:
But the thing he is aiming at is still more loosness.
Ye need not seek a more clear proof than what ye
see before your Eyes: Did ever ye see a more God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
company of men than divers of those Hereticks
amongst us, who were first drawn on to <hi>Error,</hi> by
a pretence of walking after a more strict way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
than others? They could not joyn in worship
with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (many in their Churches were
so prophane as they pretended) but would gather
Churches of their own, and would Joyn with none
but those that had evident signs of Grace; and so came
of it. They would be stricter than God would have
them, and therefore many of them have turn'd so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably
loose And so Experience aboundantly clears
that <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Prophanity</hi> do follow hard one upon
another; But we shall clear it also from Scripture:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61451:15"/>
And our first proof is from those Scriptures holding
forth That <hi>Error</hi> in the matter of <hi>Doctrine</hi> hath
usually its rise from some unmortifyed Lust within
which makes way for such an Error <hi>So Rom: 16, 17.
18.‚ÄîI beseech yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>, Brethren, mark them which cause
divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye
have learned; and avoid them.</hi> Now from whence come
these divisions contrary to the right Doctrine? <hi>v. 18
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,
but their own Belly: and by good words and fair Speach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
deceive the hearts of the simple.</hi> Unmortified cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
within bloweth wind in their sails, so the
root of <hi>Korah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram's</hi> Error whereby
they laboured to bear down Magistracy and Ministry
was an unmortified root of pride within them;
They had a fair pretext for it, a pretext of Liberty;
Are not all the Lords People Holy? And may they
not rule as well as yee? A fair pretext indeed! but
the root was pride: They could not endure to be
ruled over, and so they will rule themselves: Thus
when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> makes separation from the Church of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> he hath a fair pretext for this 1 <hi>King. 12,
28‚ÄîIt is too much</hi> (saith he) <hi>for you to go up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
There is the pretext; but the root of
the matter was a lust within, stirring him up
to secure to himself the enjoyment of that which was
not his own; and this Ambition breeds fear, that
if they go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to worship, his power
would quickly turn to nothing. So <hi>ver. 27. If this
People go up to do Sacrifice in the house of the Lord at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>then shall the heart of this People turn again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61451:16"/>
to their Lord, even unto</hi> Rehoboam <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>and
they shall kill me.</hi> There is the matter, a desire of
Reigning was the cause of his Idolatry and Schism,
an unmortified lust within was the root and rise of
his Error. And <hi>secondly</hi> Scripture holds out, That
as Error is the Daughter of Prophanity, so it is the
Mother of prophanity; as it rises from Prophanity, so
it tends to more Prophanity, Christs words import
this <hi>John 8. 31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which
believed on him; if ye continue in my word then are ye
my Disciples indeed,</hi> If ye adhere and keep closs to
the Truth, then shall ye attain to walk as my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
And it imports on the other hand, That if
ye drink in Error, ye shall not be my Disciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
And so, as Prophanity is the Mother of Error;
So it is also the Daughter of Error, This serves to
clear the point. That a Child of God should as much
watch and guard against Error, as he should do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
other gross Sins or prophanity of Life.</p>
               <p>For Use, This Doctrine serves for reproof first to
those who would have <hi>Tolleration</hi> of all Opinions
in the Matter of Religion, and no coercive mean to
curb Error: And that because, say they, it may
curb Piety. Which followes no more than that the
suppressing of Fornication will curb Piety, the one is
as dangerous as the other, and God's People may fall
in the one as well as the other; and therefore the
one should be as well curbed as the other<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Nay I
may say that that which is called <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>
is the most capital Sin in a Kingdom: It is all one as
if a King would proclaim liberty, to Drink, to Swear,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61451:16"/>
to Whore, and to Steal; for both are alike evil,
and where the one is, commonly the other is also:
and therefore to proclaim liberty to the one is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
liberty to the other. We think there is no
heart zealous of Gods Glory, but should abhorre such
a thought as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse 2. Secondly,</hi> the Doctrine reproves those
who think Opinions are free; Many reason thus,
If ye lead an Holy Life it matters not what be your
Opinion, whether for Presbytery, Independency,
Arminianism, Prelacy, or Popery, your Soul is in
no hazard, if ye be kept from gross Out breakings;
but this Doctrine showes, this sort of Reasoning to
be a gross mistake: For, besides that Error speaks
an unmortified root in the Heart. Heresie and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in themselves are damnable, and are reckoned
up among those Sins which debar from the Kingdom
of Heaven, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. verse 21. Hereticks as well as
Murderers are excluded, and therefore Folks would
not jest and play with matters of Religion, so as not
to care what side they be on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this Doctrine gives another use, as
ye would eschew Prophanity of Life; so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of Errors against the Truth: For the
one of those, ends in the other. Grant the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
pretend to much of strictness, the upshot or
Issue of it is still to Prophanity; and therefore
ye would advise well when tentations to Error
are presented, before ye drink in any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Truths received, if ye would not have it read
in the looseness of your Life afterward. Many whose
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61451:17"/>
Lives were very strict, when they began first to
change their Way, were in a short time led by their
new Light to a Prophane Godless Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse 4. Fourthly,</hi> Seeing <hi>Errors</hi> have their rise
from some unmortified root within; therefore as ye
would be keeped free from <hi>Error,</hi> subdue Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
within. We are ready to think that Godless
Men, will stand out best against <hi>Error;</hi> But it will
prove otherwise; unmortified Lusts, of any other
thing, will prove the greatest Friends to <hi>Error,</hi> such
as a Lust of Pride to be Eminent; of Covetousness, to
get your Arms full of the World run as it will, a
Lust of Laziness in Duties that will make you drink
in that <hi>Error</hi> that casts at all Duties as needless: So,
for an Antidote against the works of the Flesh,
(whereof Heresie is one, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. verse 21.) The
Crucifying of the Lusts of the Flesh is brought as
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct. III.</hi> We come to the words themselves, and
and therein is to be considered, <hi>first,</hi> the Stile, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi>
A warm and kindly compellation. The point
we are to raise is, from comparing the Stile with
the Matter which the Apostle is about: He is to
warn them to beware of <hi>Error,</hi> and yet he gives them
a loving Stile, <hi>Beloved believe,</hi> &amp;c. And it gives us
this Doctrine, That as at all times, so chiefly when
there is danger of spreading of <hi>Error,</hi> there is most
need that Love should be entertained betwixt Pastor
and People. So we find <hi>Paul</hi> labours to bear in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on Peoples Affections, especially in <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. ver
10. and 11. <hi>Ye observe Dayes and Months,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61451:17"/>
afraid of you, lest I have bestowed on you Labour in vain.</hi>
There he reproves them for their <hi>Error,</hi> And in the
12 verse he bears in on their Affection, <hi>Brethren, I
beseech you be as I am, for I am as ye are, ye have not
injured me at all.</hi> And so in the 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. v.
16. Through the whole Epistle he hath been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against their Error, and all along he bears in on
their Affection, especially in the place cited. <hi>And
I will very gladly spend, and be spent for you, though the
more abundantly I loved you, the less I be loved,</hi> &amp;c.
Abundance of places shew his practice to have been
this way.</p>
               <p>The Reason is, <hi>First,</hi> because when People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to differ, they are ready to cast at these who
differ from them, chiefly, those who would curb
them: For there is still a Spirit of Pride with <hi>Error,</hi>
it cannot endure to be contradicted, or, the least
thing to be spoken to its own prejudice if not all
the more warily, it will foam and rage, and if it
cannot bear down the contrary Truth, yet it will
labour to bear down him that speaks it. So Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
are called <hi>Murmurers, Complainers,</hi> Jude <hi>verse</hi> 16.
So a Minister in reproving Error. would guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this danger, lest he do more hurt than profit,
and all the Issue of his pains be to work a prejudice
against himself.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Argument will be the more
strong, considering the evil that comes by prejudice.
There is nothing that makes people run faster head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into Error, than prejudice against Faithful
Pastors. Therefore this hath been the Devil's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61451:18"/>
First, To bear down the Ministry, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people first cast at one, then at another, and so
at all; that their Ears being once stoped with prejudice
at what Ministers say, their Ear may be boared to
let in any Error that the Devil or his Instruments
pleaseth to vent: Therefore a Minister would make
it his Study so to behave himself, that there be no
ground of prejudice given by him, but that all his
Carriage may savour of a Resolution to entertain
Love.</p>
               <p>Now because our fear is that Error may spread,
and that (if the Lord give us leave) we intend from
this Verse to speak to the most infecting Errors: We
shall solve this Question, What a Minister is to do for
entertaining Love: For clearing of this, we shall
first shew what he is not to do, He is not to be silent
at Error, for fear of Irritating and losing Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
That were not Love, considering what is said
of the nature of Error: It is all one as if we would
not reprove a loose Liver for fear of angring him.
Secondly, Neither is he to speak against them in a
Cold-rife manner, as if it were a thing indifferent,
whether they return to a right Judgement or not:
No, He must (as he would be faithful to God)
aggravate the evil of Error to the utmost, declare
its hazard, denounce what Scripture pronounceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, whether it anger them or not; Better anger
and loose them, than anger God.</p>
               <p>What then must he do? Answer, As in other
sins he must first reprove them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. ver. 17.
And secondly so reprove, as it may argue Love to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61451:18"/>
the person reproved, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 23. Only there would
be this difference betwixt reproving of Error and
other sins, Other sins may be inveighed against
without pains to convince the person reproved that
such are sins, Nature is born with a cry against such;
But Error hath an erring Conscience to stand up in its
behalf; therefore the most of a Ministers work would
be in convincing from the Word, that the thing he
holdeth is Error: Otherwise, to inveigh against
what he holdeth, without this, will harden him
more, he will look on it as the Man's passion, and
that he hath nothing to say from Scripture or Reason
against what he holdeth.</p>
               <p>2. In dealing with erring persons, there would be
a difference put betwixt Seducers, and those who
are seduced: Those who are rooted in Error, and
those who are only Doubters, so <hi>Jude</hi> verse 23.</p>
               <p>For Use, Ye may see from this what a great
Task Ministers have, and how great need of help
there is from people to Ministers in Erring times.
In some respect it is harder to deal with one Man
tainted with Error, than with twice so many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Livers: A prophane Mans Conscience must
readily say the same that we say, and so, keep us
at Reverence: But an erring Mans Conscience speaks
against us, takes us to Err, and so readily cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
us, and yet we must speak, venturing in Gods
strength: But there is need so to speak, least in
speaking we loose more then we gain.</p>
               <p>The next thing that followes is, the Exhortation,
<hi>Believe not every Spirit:</hi> That is, do not credit every
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61451:19"/>
Doctrine that hath a fair pretence, Or every
Preacher that pretends the Name of the Spirit: From
this we learn, That the Spirit of Error began very
early to trouble the Church, in the primitive times
when the Apostles were yet living, there were even
then some who contradicted them to their very face;
so the averrers of Circumcision, Justification by
workes, denyers of the resurrection. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> 1. The Reason is first, because the Spirit of
<hi>Error</hi> is shameless, it will affront the most convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evidences; for it is natures Brood, and credit is so
engaged in it, that it trampleth upon all that
would bear it under, if an Apostle were speaking a
<hi>Sectarian</hi> Spirit would out-dare him: It is an affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and malapert Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord saw it fitting, that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages of the Church his People should be tryed by
erring Spirits, and therefore, he would have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times troubled with them also, that we might
be the less troubled; seeing that even the Apostles
themselves were not fre'd from such like perplexity,
as to have to doe with Spirits of Error. But there is
an other Reason why the Lord suffers his Church, both
in former times, and in latter times, to be troubled
with the Spirit of <hi>Error,</hi> set down in the 1 <hi>Corinth:
11. verse 19. For there must be also Heresies amongst
you, that they which are approved, may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
among you.</hi> There must be Heresies, there is <hi>a
must be</hi> put upon it: Now this is not an absolute <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi>
but a necessity or a <hi>must be</hi> upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Gods most wise decree, to permit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61451:19"/>
wise decree, to permit and suffer those things for
most wise ends; and the end for which he permitts
them to be, is <hi>First,</hi> for the tryal of Persons, and
<hi>secondly,</hi> for the tryal of <hi>Truth. First,</hi> for the tryal
of Persons, this End is set down in the verse cited <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi>
and <hi>Hereticks</hi> must be, <hi>that they which are aprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
may be made manifest among you.</hi> The Spirit of
Heresie let loose, hath a discovering efficacy with it,
it discovers who are of a humble frame of Spirit, and
who are Proud, Lofty, Conceity, and of a Selfish
spirit: It discovers who are light, weak, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried away with any thing, <hi>unstable minds,</hi> as
the Apostle speaks; and who are more solid, and
Ballanced with the Spirit of Sobriety, and solid Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that is from above. It discovers these who
have put a price on <hi>Truth,</hi> that they will <hi>buy it,</hi> but
will on no termes <hi>sell it,</hi> and also discovers those
who have put no price upon it, or that will suffer
little for it. That is the first end why Hereticks
must be, to discover Persons and try them. And
<hi>secondly,</hi> Hereticks, in the Lords wise Providence,
tend to the tryal of <hi>Truths,</hi> and the making of them
brighter and clearer, they scoure <hi>Truths,</hi> (so to speak)
so that the disputs of Hereticks, and venting of
<hi>Error,</hi> make <hi>Truth</hi> the brighter. The more debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is betwixt these two, <hi>Error</hi> grows the blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and <hi>Truth</hi> the clearer. When the Lord hath a
mind to have a <hi>Truth</hi> cleared and rooted in his
Peoples Spirits, He does in his Infinite Wisdom
take this way, a strange way indeed and yet making
much for the purpose: He will let some <hi>Error</hi> arise
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61451:20"/>
to oppose the <hi>Truth,</hi> through occasion whereof more
light breaks out to the clearing of the <hi>Truth.</hi> These
are Reasons why <hi>Hereticks must be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The use is, seeing the Spirit of <hi>Error</hi> began
so early to trouble the Church in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time,
that were guided with an infallible Spirit, then ye
are not to wonder that <hi>Error</hi> should trouble the
Church now when there are not such infallible
lights as these: The Spirit of <hi>Error</hi> is a bold darring
Spirit it will dare to contradict God Himself, and
find out some shift, to cast at that which God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sayeth: As may be seen <hi>Gen:</hi> 3. The Lord said
<hi>The day thou eatest thereof thou shalt die:</hi> And <hi>Sathan</hi>
contradicts it, <hi>thou shalt not surely die.</hi> And so no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
there be such impudence seen in the Spirit of
<hi>Error</hi> now, as to cast at any thing which Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
say, seeing <hi>Satan</hi> still Acts the Instruments of
<hi>Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2 But <hi>secondly,</hi> from this Doctrine learn not
to quarrell with Gods most Holy and wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in that he suffers so many <hi>Errors</hi> to be. We
are ready to think that if God had that care of his
Church, Covenant and Cause, as men would think
he had, he would not suffer such Effronted Spirits,
and such Blasphemous Hereticks to prevail, and to
outdare his <hi>Truth:</hi> But that is to quarrel the Lords
providence and without a ground: He whose fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
is in <hi>Zion</hi> can make all the tryals of the time that
arise from <hi>Error</hi> to contribute much for the clearing
of <hi>Truth;</hi> by this means he will rouse up his People
to study <hi>Truth,</hi> to understand it better, to search out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61451:20"/>
grounds for it, and that is one advantage; only ye
would know also, that these times will be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times, they will discover many a corrupt heart,
many unstable hearts and light heads, many proud
Spirits, and many that have Lusts lurking within
them: So that many will choose that Religion that
will gratify their Lusts most; For, there is not an
<hi>Error</hi> that <hi>Sathan</hi> hatches, but there is one Lust or
other within People that speaks for it; and there is
nothing more ready to make People take in <hi>Error,</hi>
than their harbouring of unmortified Lusts. So in. 2
<hi>Timoth: Cap:</hi> 3. The Apostle speaking of those who
should be caried away with false Teachers says in
the 6. v. <hi>For of this sort are they which creep into houses,
and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away
with diverse Lusts:</hi> Unmortified Lusts are as fuel to
make the fire of Zeal for <hi>Error</hi> to burn very hot in
Peoples bosom, and so <hi>Error</hi> will try People this
way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct:</hi> V. Next observe he sayes <hi>Believe not every
Spirit,</hi> that is, believe not every Doctrine that hath
the name of the Spirit, and fair pretences put upon
it, as if they were the Doctrines of the Spirit of God,
believe them not. From this we learn. That the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Errors</hi> go out oftentimes under fairest names, and
are backed with most specious pretences, what Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<hi>Errors</hi> than these spoken of here, <hi>The denying
of the Son of God:</hi> And yet what fairer Names than
the <hi>Spirit?</hi> What fairer pretences than that they are
<hi>Doctrines taught by the Spirit of God?</hi> We will find
this of all <hi>Errors</hi> spoken of in Scripture, for the most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61451:21"/>
part, <hi>Cora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram's</hi> Error whereby
they rose up against the Magistracy of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
Preist-hood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> hath a fair pretence for it. <hi>Ye
take too much upon you Moses and Aaron, are not all the
Lords People Holy.</hi> And <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Error, his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in setting up the Calf at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> hath
a fair pretence 1 <hi>Kings 12. It is too fair for you</hi> &amp;c.
The Peoples ease, and the publick good is the thing he
pretends though his design was far otherwise: And
so these that urged Justification by works, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the way of free Grace, and being justified by
Faith, they had their fair pretences: O! say they,
to cast off Workes from Justification, will make
People secure wee may sin that Grace may abound;
very taking pretences all of them, and as taking as
any that Error is now covered over with. The Reason
of the Doctrine is from the cause for which the
Tempter presents Error under fair colours, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences, which is this; That he may make
the Error the more taking: For these are the baits
he puts on the hook that he may deceive and catch
the simple.</p>
               <p>Therefore for use of this Doctrine, ye would
not be deceived with fair pretences, or ravishing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
expressions, that Error may be fairded over with:
See what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sayes to this purpose 2
<hi>Thess:</hi> cap. 2, v. 2. Where speaking against an Error, <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeches
them by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, That
they be not soon shaken in mind, or troubled, neither by
Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
day of Christ is at hand.</hi> It supposes that the spreaders
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61451:21"/>
of that Error had all these three pretences. <hi>First<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
they pretended the Spirit, that it was a Doctrine
taught them by the Spirit of God, accompanied by
his presence in their Spirits with more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
flashes, and raptures, and In-bearings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Light. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they had the word or
Scripture to alledge for it. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they picked
somewhat out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Letters for them, so would
they say: In speaking against us he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
These are fair pretences; and yet, sayes <hi>Paul,
be not shaken in mind with them.</hi> So, say I, ye would
guard your self against the fair pretences which Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
may have, and look not only to the out side, but
to the inside of them, and then ye will find most
bitter Serpents Lurking under fairest flowers.</p>
               <p>As for example, The Mother of all Error <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
hath a fair pretence for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that good men
may Err, and so in suppressing Error ye may suppress
Piety: A fair pretence, but it hath afoul end. For
by this meanes Blasphemers, Denyers of God and
Jesus Christ, must have Liberty to vent their damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Errors, if so be that they can but pretend
Conscience, and so stable roome must be given in
Christs Church, to every unclean beast that ever was
hatched in Hell. The <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors again have
a fair pretence, O say they, Christ hath become sin
for us, and therefore it is taken off from us, so we
are not bound to repent for it, for to say that we
are to repent were to take the burthen off from
Christs Back, and to put it on our own: These are
specious words without solidity, but they contradict
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61451:22"/>
Scripture Truths where they are narrowly looked to:
<hi>Peter</hi> was a justified Person, and yet when Christ
looked on him He weeped bitterly: <hi>Davids</hi> sin was
pardoned, and Christ had taken the burthen of it,
and yet <hi>David</hi> was to Repent of it, and to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for it, and so the Lord tells him that <hi>the
sword should not depart from his house because he had
made the Enemies of the Lord to Blasphem;</hi> and yet sin
was not laid upon <hi>David</hi> to satisfy divine Justice for
it: Only he must get on the fingers to make him
more warry, and to scar all Justified Persons in
time coming from doing the like. We might so
run through all the Errors of the time, as that of
<hi>Independency,</hi> whereby power is denyed to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
O, say they, to put power in Presbytries and
make them receive Appeals from Congregations, it
is to Tyrannize over particular Flocks; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
say they, nothing is better than that every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
have compleat power within themselves,
and be left to their own guiding, not being count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to any Judicatory above them, but only to
Christ: This seems a specious Bait for such as
would have liberty, but when it is duly pondered, it
will be found most contrary to Truth: For by this
means, if a particular Flock should Err, and if one
should suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>er wrong at the hands of a particular Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
there is no remedy to repair the oppressed
man, and to bring the Erring Congregation to a
right mind: and how far this is derogatory to Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s
Christ who was perfect in all his house, any man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61451:22"/>
may judge: We might run through more of them,
But because we have a mind to refute these Errors
by themselves, we shall insist no further here, having
said enough to clear the point, that the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Errors may be born in under the fairest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
and therefore ye would not take all to be
Gold that glisters, take not all for Truth that is deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up with a bundle of brave, high, ravishing expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 6 We proceed, <hi>Believe not every Spirit,</hi> sayes he;
He speaks not this in vain. It supposes he saw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
in them to believe: The point of Doctrine
that ariseth from it is, That when foul Error is holden
out under fair Names, and backed with fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
There is a danger lest people drink them in
and believe them; for <hi>John</hi> saw that hazard, and
therefore gives them a Watch-word: So in the 16
of the <hi>Rom.</hi> ver. 18. <hi>For they that are such serve not our
Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Belly, and by good
words and fair Speeches deceive the hearts of the simple:</hi>
Their baits hook'd the simple, before they were
aware. We need no further proof of this, than the
Example of our neighbour Church in <hi>England;</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
which could not have been named, but People
would have loathed at them: such as the <hi>Arminian</hi>
Error against free Grace; &amp;c. Yet being decked
with the name of new light they are greedily drunk
in by too too many,</p>
               <p>Wee shall give some Reasons to make you sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of this hazard: How great danger there is,
when Error is in spreading, that People be taken
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61451:23"/>
off their feet with it: We shall point at <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi>
things that speaks this hazard: And the <hi>first</hi> is, the
proneness of our nature to Drink in Untruths: We
see this in <hi>Eva,</hi> for Error is natures brood: And,
as we said, Error is the copy of some Lust, and
therefore it soon infects: Truth again, it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us, no party for it in our hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is harder to make us take with it; there
must be <hi>word upon word, and precept upon precept;</hi> we
drink in Truth slowly and after much pains taken
upon us, we are hut to begin to learn it; but the
Spirit of a man is quick to take up Error: Ye will
find men more able in a short time to debate for
Error, than in a long time to debate for Truth, I
would seek no greater presumption that such a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
is an Error than this, that as soon as it is set on
fire, it runs through great numbers, and sets their
Spirits on edge for it, we are not so hot for Truth,
it is not our nature to be so taken with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason.</hi> 2 Then there is a <hi>Second</hi> thing that speaks
this hazard, and it is, the shallowness of Peoples
apprehension, together with their foolish hast before
they try; From the shallowness of many it is, that
they cannot put a difference betwixt a fair pretence,
and a foul Error that is hid under it, and from the hast
of Peoples Spirit it is that they ingage suddainly
with any thing having the colour of Truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once ingaged they are still the more and more
involved: These two laid together are another
thing to point out this hazard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. We may add a <hi>Third,</hi> and this is desire
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61451:23"/>
of Novelty in People spoken of in 2 <hi>Timoth:</hi> Chap:
4, v. 3‚Äî<hi>after their own Lusts shall they heap to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
teachers, having itching ears. And they shall turn
away,</hi> &amp;c. Where by the way observe, that Lust
within is the cause of drinking in Error from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
But the thing we mark, is, That they have an
itching ear lusting after new things, and this comes
from their little practising of old Truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> 4 There is a <hi>Fourth</hi> Reason, and it is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of baits and pretences that is put upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Errors, according to Peoples several humors: So
subtile is <hi>Sathan</hi> that he puts a bait on for every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit;
there are some that are Piously strict and are
enclined so to be, both towards themselves and
others, and he hath a bait to catch those, to wit,
a pretence of strickness which the Error of <hi>Separation</hi>
is covered with, for this Error alloweth Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with none but these that have a real evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Grace in them: It is a way think they to
shame natural Men. Again there be some whose
humor is for looseness, he puts on a bait to gratify this
humor also, let them believe in Christ and let them
live as they like, sayes the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Peoples several humors, there is a bait put
on by the Devil upon Error: Now when these baits
and Peoples humors agree, it is like powder and fire,
presently they kindle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5 There is a <hi>fifth</hi> thing which speaks this
hazard, and it is this; The Lord, that Error may
be a tryal, in his holy Justice lets out more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
parts and abilities, on spreaders of Error,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61451:24"/>
and on the Spirits of People when they are taken
with it: The Lord for a Judgement to themselves,
and for a tryal unto others, gives them as we speak,
a cast of their craft, he elevates them above their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Sphere, or what is their ordinary way: And this
we speak not without Scripture, It is said of false Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Teachers <hi>they shall come with l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing signs and
wonders;</hi> And there is a <hi>Spirit of Error</hi> which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells
shall accompany Error, <hi>Be not soon shaken in
mind neither by Spirit nor by word,</hi> &amp;c. In that place
that we already cited 2 <hi>Thess:</hi> 2, 2. When we
look on all these things we hope we have made
out the point: <hi>viz.</hi> that foulest Errors even when
they are colloured with fairest pretences, there is a
danger, lest People drink them in.</p>
               <p>The use of the point is, If there be this hazard
then ye would be afraid of your selves, it is said,
<hi>The Righteous fear alwayes.</hi> I would seek no clearer
mark of any person that is like to be taken in the
snare, than that they think themselves so stout and
stedfast that no Error will gain upon them: and I
would think it an evidence very good, when people
are afraid of themselves, and do humble themselves,
in the sense of their own weakness, and are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ daily to bear them through, <hi>For Blessed
is he that feareth alwayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only remember that this fear would be of the
right Stamp: And for clearing this, we shall point at
three or four things, wherein this holy fear does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
specially with Reference to Error. <hi>First</hi> where
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>his fear is, There will be a labouring to root Truth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61451:24"/>
in the heart: Ye know, when People are affraid of
losing any thing, that they will labour by all meanes
to be sure of it: A man that hath this <hi>Holy fear</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself, lest he be ensnared with Error will stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to gett Truth rooted in the heart. <hi>Prov:</hi> 2. 16.
The Spirit of God speaketh of <hi>hiding of understanding,
putting it in the secret place of the heart.</hi> A <hi>second</hi> thing
accompanying this fear, is a forecasting what Truth
may cost you; there would be a fore-casting of this,
and a taking an Essay of the Cross before hand, and
this for fear lest that to eschew suffering ye quite the
Truth, if the tryall come on you unexpectedly;
<hi>Paul</hi> while he is exhorting the Disciples to stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
informs them <hi>That through much tribulation we
must enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Acts 14. 22. Then
there is a <hi>third</hi> thing accompanying this <hi>Holy fear,</hi>
and that is, a fear to venture on Temptations to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
except there be a Providence putting to it, of
necessity; and this fear rises from the Sense of our
own weakness to engage with, or stand the shock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Temptations, this is implyed in that directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gives 2 <hi>Timoth:</hi> 3, 5. At
the end of the verse‚Äî<hi>From such turn away v, 6. For of
this sort are they which creep into houses</hi>‚Äî: When a man
is sensible of his own weakness, the fear of his being
ensnared will keep him from walking among snares.
A <hi>fourth</hi> thing accompanying this <hi>Holy fear</hi> is, that
tho ye find these Truths ye have had once sealed to
your Spirits begin to be questioned, and that ye are
not able to answer what is brought against them, and
so perchance your Judgment may incline to think,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61451:25"/>
that what ye thought once to be Truth is now Error;
Yet where this <hi>Holy fear</hi> is, ye will rather suspect
your own want of knowledge to discern, than any
way suspect the Truth to be untruth; and it will
make you at least abstain from venturing even on
that which your light points out for the time.</p>
               <p>Now by these ye may know what is the Fearless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that makes People to be in danger, and it is this,
when it makes thee so inconcerned that thou never
Labours to get Truth brought lower than thy head:
when thou never casts an account what Truth may
stand thee; when thou art so confident of thy own
wit and knowledge, that thou will venture uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to dispute with <hi>Sectarian Spirits;</hi> or when any
thing is born in as Truth contrary to what thou
hast maintained, as a Truth before, and contrary to
thy Covenant engagment, thou grippes presently
to it without once suspecting that thy own shallow
understanding may be deceived. This, I say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> speaks
a fearlesness that borders neigh unto Error,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct:</hi> VII. The Doctrine that followeth next
from these words <hi>Believe not every Spirit,</hi> is, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
the Servants of God are not to clap Peoples
heads, or indulge them in this inclination of theirs to
Error, they are not to humor them in it; but on
all hazards they are to testify against it: Therefore,
sayes <hi>John, Believe not every Spirit,</hi> So also the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> does very sharply inveigh against People, when
they are beginning to tamper with Error: And lest
People should say <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were Apostles, and
knew what was Error and what was Truth, being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61451:25"/>
guided by an infallible Spirit, and that therefore
they might stoutly testify against Error; but for
other ordinary Ministers, they may err as well as
other People, and so it is ill reasoned from what
the Apostles did to what Ministers may now do:
Therefore to clear this we shall give a place where
<hi>Paul</hi> bindes it as Duty on every ordinary Minister to
to testify against Error. In the <hi>Acts</hi> ch: 20. v. 28.
<hi>Therefore take heed unto your selves, and to all the flock,
over the which the Holy Ghost, hath made you overseers,</hi>
&amp;c. And in the 29. <hi>Verse</hi> he gives an instance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were to take heed to the flock, <hi>For I know
this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter
in among you, not sparing the Flock.</hi> verse 30. <hi>Also of
your own selves shall men arise, &amp;c.</hi> So it is a duty ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on all ordinary Preachers, to watch over their
People, lest they be seduced with Error, and that
because <hi>First</hi> of that which we spoke of before, that
Error in the point of Truth should be as much es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed
by People as other particular sins; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ministers are bound to guard People against it.
And <hi>secondly,</hi> Truth is a precious Jewel and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a special manner, they ought to contend for
it. And <hi>Thirdly</hi> the Souls of People ought to be
pretious to Ministers, and therefore Ministers ought
to watch over them, they ought to guard them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Error; because, as other sins, so Error is a
damnable Soul-destroying sin. And therefore as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
love Truth and Souls committed to them, so
they must watch over the People, and guard them
against Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61451:26"/>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> I. This show's the great task lying upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
at every time, but chiefly in an Erring time:
we spoke somewhat of this before how difficult it is
for a man to meddle with reproving of Error, more
difficile than to reprove Prophanity; because a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Man's Conscience is convinced of the evil of
his way; and therefore however he may be displeased
with free Preaching against his sin, yet his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
clears the Minister; and thus he keeps him, at
least, at some reverence: But it is not so in a Soul
taken with Error, the misinformed Conscience speaks
for it, and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>fore whatever is spoken against him,
he casts at it as Error and untruth; and readily the
man that speaketh it may lose respect for his pains,
and yet we see the Word of God binds it on Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to speak against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it be so that Ministers be
bound to reprove Error and testify against it; then
the People are bound to take the word of reproof
from them: we mean not that they should be so
bound as what Ministers say should be the <hi>Bible,</hi>
but this much we say, That People should presume
as much on them as another, to ask Councel from
them as much as from another; and to respect them
as much as any other: And that for these Reasons,
<hi>First,</hi> because the publick Minister hath a promise
which private men have not, at least not such an
ample grant, as it is <hi>Matth: 28. 19. Goe ye therefore
and teach all nations, &amp;c‚Äîand lo, I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
even unto the end of the World.</hi> It doth not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
them indeed from Erring themselves; but the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61451:26"/>
promise, is there more largly given to them than to
others. And <hi>Secondly</hi> Ministers as called watch men
have the charge of Peoples Souls: God hath charged
them with them, which he hath not charged others
with: there is not a charge of Peoples Souls, laid
on private men by way of office; every one is bound
indeed by way of Charity, to take a care of the Souls
of others, contrair to that of <hi>Cain, am I my brothers
keeper.</hi> But beside this tye of Charity lying on sent
Ministers, there is a tye by vertue of a particular
charge; So that place <hi>Act: 20. Take heed to the flock
over which the Holy Ghost, hath made you overseers.</hi> He
hath given them a special Charge, and so they are
charged in a special way with Peoples Souls. Then
there is a <hi>Third</hi> Reason, it is <hi>Sathan</hi>'s Method to
bring in Error on People by casting in prejudices
betwixt them and sent Ministers, which we have
cleared sometimes from Scripture, and so it should
be watched against, lest <hi>Sathans</hi> subtility prevail
so far as to bring People to dis-respect their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
for if that be once gained he hath prevailed very
much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct:</hi> VIII. Now further, he sayes, <hi>Believe no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
every Spirit.</hi> But bring them to the tryal. Doe not
cast at all <hi>but try the Spirits,</hi> Hence take this Doctrine:
It is not Gods way, that People because, there are
differences about Religion, should therefore believe
no Religion, that is not Gods way. So <hi>Matth:</hi> 16.
we see the Apostles practise, Christ sayes unto
them, <hi>whom say they that I am? Say they, some say tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>or one of the Prophets. But whom say ye that I am?</hi> They
do not Answer, <hi>we know not what to say, there are
so many different sayings about thee,</hi> but say they, <hi>Thou
art Christ the son of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> So People are not to cast at all Religion
because there are differences about it; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>First,</hi> that were to give way to the Devils plot;
His design in raising up Error about Religion is, to
make People <hi>Atheists,</hi> so as not to care for any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and so when the use which thou makest of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions, is that thou wilt believe none, Thou
fulfillest the Devils design. <hi>Secondly,</hi> thou makes use
of Gods Providence to thy destruction. The Lords
Providence in raising up Error is, to make men seek
more after the knowledge of the Truth: And when
thou makest that use of it, to cast at all Religion,
thou mockest the Holy Counsel of God to thy own
ruin.</p>
               <p>The Use then of the Doctrine is, to reprove those
of this stamp; to wit, Prophane Atheistical men
that make no differences about Religion but this:
Let Church-men once agree among themselves
what's right, and what's wrong; untill then, the
back of our hand to altogether; that is a wofull way.</p>
               <p>Indeed there may be a doubt proposed here <hi>viz.</hi>
What else shall poor ignorant People do about diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Religion, but to lay aside the care of all,
when they see every party have their own Reasons
stronger than these poor People can Answer; I <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
there are some directions grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which if we walk by, may bring us to a safe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61451:28"/>
shore, amidst these rocks of contrary Opinions; And
the <hi>first</hi> is this, that for Differences that concern not
Peoples practice, I would not have People trouble
themselves much with them; as for example, Our late
unhappy Differences about <hi>the publick Resolutions;</hi> the
Lord hath taken the occasion of them away; so I would
not have any troubling themselves much about them:
Whatever Differences in matters of practice fall in, it
seems to be a safe rule, that when the occasion of such
Practices are removed, all Contention about them
should be laid aside. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Differences
wherein Peoples practice is concerned, take these Rules:
<hi>First,</hi> For these that are uncontraverted Truths make
Conscience of the practice of them, which will help to
the knowledge of other things; this rule Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrives,
<hi>John</hi> 7. 17. sayes he, <hi>If any man do his will, he
shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> &amp;c. There
is something that thy Conscience is clear of to be
Duty, and although the Differences of Opinion might
be some excuse to make thee keep off from these
things about which there is difference, yet how art
thou excused for neglect of these things which thou
art convinced to be Duty, as <hi>Prayer, Reading the Word,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We would know, whatever be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinions about matters of Religion, yet there is
but one true way; and the knowledge of this one way
may be attained to, by those who seek humbly after it:
At least, if thou be judging thy self, and as a damned
Bankrupt or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>vour by Nature, be closing with Christ,
and drawing Grace from him to make thee Holy<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
Thou wilt attain to the knowledge of as much of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61451:29"/>
these things debated, as will take thee home to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
A <hi>Third</hi> Direction is, That ye should beware of
calling in question any of these Truths that once have
been Sealed into your Spirits by the Spirit from the
Word of God, 2 <hi>John</hi> ver 8. <hi>Look to your selves that
we lose not those things which we have wrought,</hi> The
point of Truth that People have got thus Sealed to
their Conscience, should not readily be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
A <hi>Fourth</hi> Direction is this, That in seeking
out Truth under Differences, we should beware of
Loftyness of Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32 it is said <hi>The Spirits of
the Prophets are subject to the Prophets,</hi> How much more
ought the Spirits of private persons to be subject to
the voice of Christs Ambassadors speaking in his
Courts. This is not as if we would make Ministers
Sayings the Peoples Rule to walk by: But this much
will follow that in a constitute Church where Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
is Exercised, there should be that Humility in
People, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>n doubts arise concerning any point
of received Truth within the Church, they should
offer their Judgement, and the Reason of it to the
Prophets and Christs Courts to be tryed, before they
lay down any new Opinion as a solid Truth: That
much is contained under this, <hi>The Spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are subject to the Prophets,</hi> if it mean any thing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct:</hi> IX. Now we proceed. The next thing that
we come to, is, what People should do, <hi>Try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
and the Rule of Tryal is, <hi>whether they are of God.</hi>
The <hi>first</hi> point we learn is, that how fair soever the
pretence be, that our Doctrine is colloured with, it
should not be taken upon Trust: but the Spirits must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61451:29"/>
be <hi>Tryed.</hi> Such we see was the practice of the
<hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>reans,</hi> and they are commended for it, they would
not take the Apostles Doctrine on trust. <hi>Act: 17.
11. These were more noble than those in</hi> Thessalonica,
<hi>in that they received the word with all readiness of mind
and searched the Scriptures dayly whither those things
were so.</hi> They would not take the Apostles Doctrine
on trust: and this is a command given by <hi>Paul</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Thess:</hi> 1 Epistle ch: 5. v. 21. <hi>Prove all
things</hi> after he had said, <hi>despise not Prophecyings,</hi> So
that Doctrines should be brought to a Tryal, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be their fair pretences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas:</hi> The Reasons are <hi>first:</hi> because foulest Errors
may be coloured over with fairest pretences. And
<hi>Secondly</hi> the Scripture sayes, <hi>all men are Lyars;</hi> that
is to say, all men may Err, and therefore words
cannot be the Ground of Divine Faith; for Faith
must have an infallible ground as <hi>Ephes: 2. 20. And
are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> the word Preached by them, and dictated
by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This Doctrine reproves <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> that
will have nothing Tryed, that comes from the
Church; but all taken upon trust, hence is it that
many swallow such Monsters of Absurdities, as the
Errors of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> Purgatory, Merite, Mals,
and such like, for which they have no other ground,
but because their Church sayes so; But this Doctrine
holdeth out another duty that who ever heareth
any Doctrine proponed by one or other, they are
bound to pass their Judgment on it, <hi>Try the Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61451:30"/>
Now that we may walk betwixt extreams, the
<hi>Papists</hi> on the one hand, who set up Tyranny, and
these <hi>Sectaries</hi> on the other hand, who set up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
we would know there is a twofold Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be passed on <hi>Doctrine:</hi> Publick Judgement,
and Private Judgement: Publick Judgement again,
is either, peremptorily absolute, or limited. A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
peremptory Judgement is, That which binds the
Conscience to obey simply that which is spoken, and
none have this Judgement, but God himself. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
There is a publick Judgement which is limited, and
this is a publick declaring and holding out that
which is found to be God's mind in his word, which
does not bind absolutely, but in so far as it agrees
with the Word; and this Judgement belongs to
publick Church Judicatories met together in Christs
Name: They are like the Lyon-Herauld set forth
to proclaim the Royal Acts, if he proclaim that
which is contained in the principal Acts, it binds;
but if he add any thing of his own, it binds not.
Next, there is a private Judgement of Discretion,
and this belongs to every Christian: every man in
relation to his own practice, is bound to pass Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on what is held out to him by others, that if
it be right, he may embrace it, but if wrong, he
may reject it; but his private Judgement is not
binding to others. Now this private Judgement,
or this Judgement of Discretion is necessary, because
all men may Err; Councils may Err, Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Error will not excuse private
Christians to follow them in their Error: sayes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61451:30"/>
Christ, <hi>When the Blind leads the Blind both falls into
the Ditch.</hi> And therefore there must be a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Discretion in private persons to try what
they hear.</p>
               <p>And this much for guarding against the <hi>Popish</hi>
Tyranny; but least this Doctrine be abused to cast
at all publick Church Judicatories, we shall next
speak somewhat to guard against <hi>Sectarian</hi> Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>First,</hi> Although publick Church Judicatories
have not Power to bind Consciences; yet when men
are in a doubt concerning a point of Truth, their
Judgement ought to have more weight than the
Judgement of private Men: And that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are more Gifts exercised together, but
mainly because there is a promise annexed to the
Commission given by Christ to publick Church Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories,
<hi>Matth. 18. 20. Where two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in my Name, there am I in the midst of
them.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> From this it followes, that
there would be a kind of loathness to differ from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church Judicatories; a man's grounds would be
well examined, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>st if differing from these Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
they also differ from <hi>Truth.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
when they differ they are to bear them at Reverence,
although in such a point they should Err, yet for their
Authority, they are to be Reverenced: This much is
granted by us to Church Judicatories, but no further,
They are not to be made the Rule of our Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. It reproves those who are Lazie, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure the trouble of trying what they hear,
but take things on trust, and have no more but such
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61451:31"/>
a mans Authority, he is of that Way and Opinion,
and therefore they are Fire and Flint, Tooth and
Nail for it, as much as if they had the Word of
God for it: We have seen much of this in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Differences that have fallen out in our time,
which I have no pleasure to speak much of, and
therefore we proceed to another Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> X. The next thing then that we observe is
from what he sayes, <hi>Try,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whether they be of God;</hi>
that is the Tryal: The Doctrine is this, That the
right <hi>tryal</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, <hi>To try whether they be of
God</hi> or not, and this point puts us to give Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it shall be known what Doctrine is of God, and
what Doctrine is not of God; and here we shall
speak to two things. <hi>First,</hi> We shall show what are
the marks that necessarly infer a Doctrine to be of
God. And <hi>secondly</hi> we shall speak of other things that
do not infer necessarly a Doctrine to be of God, but
for the most part follow upon such a Doctrine.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> That which makes Doctrine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to be of God, is, if it be according to the
rule of the Word. So when the <hi>Bereans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. The rule they went by in the
tryal of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, is the Scripture: And this
is <hi>Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi>'s rule, chap. 8. ver. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the
Testimony,</hi> &amp;c. He would have all Doctrines tryed by
the Word of God: So the <hi>Word</hi> is the rule, and that
Doctrine which has the <hi>Word</hi> for it, is of God; and
whatever Doctrine has not the <hi>Word</hi> for it, is not of
God: All Spirits, even the Spirit of God himself,
must be tryed that way: And that because the Word
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61451:31"/>
is a perfect rule: I give only two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to clear the perfection of this rule. <hi>First,</hi> The
heavy Plagues pronounced against those who add to
this rule: The <hi>Word</hi> is so perfect, that if an Angel
should come and pretend a purer Rule, <hi>Let him be</hi>
(sayes <hi>Paul) Anathema, Gal.</hi> 1. 8. There is another
place which proves the perfection of this rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this point in hand, 2 <hi>Timoth. 3. 16, 17. All
Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for Instruction
in righteousness. That the Man of God may be perfect,</hi> &amp;c.
So there is as much in the word of God, as may
make the man of God perfect: And this in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Instruction, <hi>It is profitable for
Doctrine and Instruction,</hi> It will make a man perfect
in that, as well as in reproof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse,</hi> This reproves, <hi>First</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> they cast
by the rule of the <hi>Word,</hi> and will have their <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and their <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>es Decrees</hi> to be the rule. But of
this enough already in the preceeding Doctrine. In
the <hi>second</hi> place, it reproves the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
reprove the Word, they will have a higher tryal
and rule to examine by; and it is the inbearing of
Gods Spirit, say they, He is the Spirit of Truth, and
can he bear in a Lye: But, say we, how know
they the Spirit of the Devil by the Spirit of God,
except they bring it to the Word. So the Word is
the Rule, yea and the last Rule.</p>
               <p>But here is a doubt which we shall speak to. This
is a very hard task, may some say, for poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
People to try Doctrines by the <hi>Word;</hi> the <hi>Word</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61451:32"/>
it self is obscure, and every one pretends the <hi>Word,</hi>
all Parties will say that they have the <hi>Word,</hi> and so
it is hard for us to know what is of God, and what
not, if we have no other rule but the Word: I
answer it is very true, there are very few <hi>Sectaries</hi>
who will not pretend the <hi>Word:</hi> And yet it does not
follow that ye may cast by the Word. But <hi>Secondly,</hi>
we say, although the <hi>Word</hi> be in some places ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and although Men of Opinions as contrary
to the Word as Light is to Darkness, may
every one of them wrest the <hi>Word,</hi> yet there is
as much of the <hi>Word</hi> clear, if it be rightly studied,
as will make a man know what is right, and what
is wrong. Hence that Epithet given to the <hi>Word,
The word of the Lora is a Lamp to direct thy Paths.</hi>
The <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord is not unfitly compared to a
Sea, wherein Elephants, <hi>i. e.</hi> men of greatest parts and
Learning may swime, and readily lose their fect,
how great soever their parts be, if they rely upon
them. And yet it may be compared to a shallow
calm running Stream, wherein Lambs, that is, men of
mean Gifts, may wade, and find out Gods mind in it, if
they be humble and take Gods way for searching of it.</p>
               <p>But say ye, what is that way of God wherein
people may hope, so as not to miscarry in the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Gods mind in his Word. In answer to this,
we shall give several Directions. <hi>First,</hi> A man that
would not mistake Gods mind in his Word, should
be a diligent Reader of it, <hi>Acts 17. 11.‚Äîand searched
the Scriptures daily,</hi> &amp;c. it was their daily task. And
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Reading of the Word should have Prayer
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61451:32"/>
going alongs with it, <hi>Prov: 2. 3. Yea if thou cryest after
knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding,</hi>
ver. 4. <hi>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her
as for hid treasures: Then,</hi> &amp;c. this crying and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is certainly in Prayer, as well as in other means.
When people joyn Prayer with the Reading of the
Word, they will more readily attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods mind, Than a man that takes no
more with him but his own natural parts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
The word should be read with Meditation, <hi>Psal: 1.
2.‚Äîin his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> And
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> with Self-denial. <hi>Prov. 3. 5. Trust in the Lord
with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
We should go to the Word with a deep sense
on us of our own Ignorance to seek Light from it.</p>
               <p>There are several other directions how People
may be led to get the meaning of the word; we
shall speak of some. <hi>First,</hi> Obscure places being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with these that are more clear, will be clear
also: There are some places obscure, but the
Lord hath been so Graciously condescending in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
the Scriptures that there are other places to
make them clear: So there is an obscure place: <hi>we
are not under the Law but under Grace</hi> which at first
seems to sound as if People needed not to take heed
to the Law; But there is another place, that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shows how we are not under the Law <hi>There is
no condemnation to them that are in Christ.</hi> They are
freed from the condemning power of the Law, but
not from the directions of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in obscure
and dark places of Scripture on which men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61451:33"/>
to their several Conceptions, would Father
several senses, the meaning that agrees most with
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>nalogy of Faith should be taken: this is that
which <hi>Paul</hi> calls the forme of wholsom words. So
there is a place controverted <hi>he laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
of us all,</hi> Says the <hi>Antinomians</hi> all our sins were
laid on Christ, and so do what we will, we are not
bound to seek pardon or mourn for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>em; for our
sins are laid on him, and so we have none: Now
this gloss is contrary to the whole current of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which holds out that believers have sin in
them, a body of Death. 1 <hi>John 1, 8. If we say we have no
sin we deceive our selves and the Truth is not in us.</hi> It
holdeth out believers at their best condition as
Mourning for sin, and praying for the pardon of sin
<hi>Rom. 7. Psalm</hi> 25. 11. So that this <hi>Antinomian</hi> sense
cannot be right, because it is contrar to the whole
current of Scripture; and therefore the laying of our
iniquities on him, must be the guilt and punishment
of our iniquity, and not the being of sin it self,
<hi>which was bound upon Christ:</hi> So another place the
promoters of <hi>Tolleration</hi> pleads from, is that in <hi>Phil.
3,</hi> 15. that Counsel that <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Let us therefore,
as many as be perfect, be thus minded, And if in
any thing ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal
even this unto you:</hi> say they, there is <hi>Tolleration</hi>
whatever be Peoples differences, let them walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Light; we say again, that what
<hi>Paul</hi> sayes of mutual forbearance must not be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all Errors; but it must only be applyed to these
that were Errors of infirmitie; As <hi>Rom:</hi> 15. 1. we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61451:33"/>
                  <hi>then that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please our selves.</hi> And that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
meaning cannot be right, because it is contrair
to the current of many other Scriptures, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Hereticks to be Excommunicat. <hi>An Heretick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the first and second admonition reject.</hi> and not so
much as <hi>bid them God speed:</hi> So this is another way
to know the meaning of the Scripture. And this
much now for directions to help you in the study of
Gods word, that you may attain to know Gods
mind in it; and so to know whether <hi>a Doctrine be
of God or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We thought to have spoken of these other
marks which do not infer necessarly a Doctrine
to be of God, but for the most part do follow on
such a Doctrine; but the time being now ended, I
shall only name them: <hi>First,</hi> That Doctrine which
is of God will have Holiness following upon it: And
so that Doctrine of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> that tends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity
of life cannot be of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that
Doctrine that is of God tends to exalt Christ. <hi>John</hi>
16. 15. Speaking of the Spirit of Truth, he sayeth,‚Äî
<hi>he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you.</hi> And so
that Doctrine of the <hi>Papists,</hi> I mean their Doctrine
of <hi>Merit,</hi> is not of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Doctrine
which is of God humbles men, as Error doth fill
men with pride: Thus those <hi>Sectaries</hi> that are spoken
of in <hi>Jude</hi> are called <hi>Lofty;</hi> and so the Doctrine of
<hi>Separation</hi> is not of God, because whatever be the
pretence of strickness that it caries along with it,
there is an over-weaning conceit of the Man's self
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61451:34"/>
and undervaluing of others, that cleaves to this Error
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> it maketh People orderly in standing
for it: So is it said of Christ <hi>His voice is not heard
in the streets.</hi> Now these marks as we have said do but
usually follow, for because of the corruptions of men
even the Doctrines that are of God may want these
properties, and the Doctrines that are not of God
may have a shew of them; and therefore the first
mark to wit, the word, is the adequate Rule, So
that all Doctrines ought to be brought to it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the shew any Doctrine hath, whether of
Holiness, exalting Christ and free Grace, whatever
shew it have of Humility and orderly carriage, in
those who profess it in their avowing of it: Yet if
it be not according to this Rule, (<hi>viz.</hi> the word of
God) it is not of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct:</hi> XI. We come now to our main design, to
wit the Refutation of some of the most dangerous
Errors of the Times. The ground of what we are to
speak to this purpose is taken from the following
Doctrine, which is evidently imported in the words;
to wit, That there are many Doctrines pretending to
the Spirit, which yet being brought to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
will be found not <hi>to be of God.</hi> For while he
bids us try <hi>the Spirits whither they be of God,</hi> He evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
insinuates that there are some Spirits which
being brought to the tryal will be sound faulty, and
not to be of God. I shall, God willing, give instances
of this, and accordingly make it out upon the most
taking, dangerous, and most Erronious Doctrines
of the Times, particularly upon those following:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61451:34"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Tolleration. Secondly,</hi> the
Doctrine of <hi>Erastianism. Thirdly</hi> the Doctrine of
<hi>Independency. Fourthly,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Separation.
Fifthly,</hi> the Doctrine of the ordinary Preaching by

And <hi>Lastly</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Anabaptism:</hi> In all which
we shall with the Lords assistance make it appear
here, that however they pretend to be Doctrines

they are not so warranted, in a word we shall show
they are <hi>not of God.</hi>

               <head>A BRIEF
REFUTATION
OF THE
ERROR
OF
Tolleration.</head>
               <p>WE shall begin with the Error of <hi>Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
of all Opinions in the matter of
Religion, a Doctrine that is much cryed
up among <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and a Doctrine that is very tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
what (thinks People) if they get leave to
serve God according to their own Conscience, they
need not trouble themselves what others do. Our
purpose is to show that this Doctrine, though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Spirit, is not of God: and for this end
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61451:36"/>
we have read these places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whereupon we are to ground
the most of what is to be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Error.<note n="*" place="margin">The Author did in the beginning of his Sermon read several Texts of Scripture.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I begin to refute this Error of <hi>Tolleration First,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the <hi>Sectaries</hi> main refuge, it is their <hi>Holy of
Holys</hi> wherein they shelter themselves in their gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Errors: what, say they, it is our Conscience and
who dare meddle with Conscience but the God of
Conscience. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we think it needfull to begin
with it; <hi>First,</hi> because of all other Errors it is the
most dangerous and damnable, in so far as other
Errors do only evert these particular Truths of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to which they are contrary; but by this one
Error (this Monster of <hi>Tolleration</hi>) way is made
to evert all the Truths contained in Scripture, and
to the setting up all Errors contrary to every Jote of
Truth: and in the mean time there shall be no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on earth to hinder it, or take order with it,</p>
               <p>In prosecuting of this, we shall follow this Method
<hi>First,</hi> we shall clear the state of the question <hi>Secondly,</hi>
we shall bring our Arguments for confirming the
Truth, and vindicate them from the Adversaries
exceptions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall bring forth their
Arguments, and shall refute them from Scripture
and Reason. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We shall apply the
whole to some practical use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For the state of the question, what a
thing this <hi>Tolleration</hi> is that we Labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute:
There is a two-fold <hi>Tolleration</hi> of Error:
There is a <hi>Church Tolleration</hi> and a <hi>State Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61451:36"/>
A <hi>Church Tolleration</hi> is, That whereby it is
pleaded that Error and Heresy should have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to be vented and go free even from Church
Censure; such as suspension from the Sacraments or
Excommunication. There are but few <hi>Sectaries</hi> of
any note that plead for <hi>Tolleration</hi> in this Latitude,
and that because the Scripture is so plain against it.
<hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>An Heretick after the first and second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
reject.</hi> Therefore they are content that
Church-censures such as Excommunication be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Hereticks, providing, <hi>First,</hi> that they be free
from Civil censure. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
be inflicted for no Error, but for these
that are contrary to fundamental points of Truth,
or as some say contrary to the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Upon these and no other will they have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
to strike.</p>
               <p>Though this be not the main question which we
are to insist upon: Yet we shall lay down some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
contrary to their Doctrine, even in this
point. And <hi>First,</hi> we do not see what reason can
be brought to exeem Hereticks from civil Censure;
but the same may be brought to exeem them from
Church Censures also; If Conscience, as they say,
be free from the one, what reason but it should be
free from the other also? And if fear of civil Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against those who Err do as they say enforce the
Conscience, and make People Hypocrites; we see
not but the fear of Church Censures may do the same:
Or if, notwithstanding of Church Censures, the
Conscience is not forced, the Service not constrained,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61451:37"/>
which they grant, then notwithstanding of Civil
Censure it is not forced, or the Service constrained
either: And so from their own grounds this vast
<hi>Tolleration</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> falls to the ground. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We
cannot assent to that which they affirm, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
is not to be inflicted for any Error;
but these which are contrary to fundamental points
of Religion; and that because Christ gives us a rule
upon what faults Excommunication should strick;
<hi>to wit,</hi> on every scandalous Fault done against a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the Church wherein the Offender persists
obstinate, and will not be reclaimed: So <hi>Matth. 18.
17. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
Church, but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him
be unto thee as an heathen man and a Pubican.</hi> That
is, Excommunicate him. Now, for what faults
he is to be Excommunicate, they are set down v. 15.
Moreover, <hi>if thy brother shall trespass against thee</hi> &amp;c.
So it is a scandalous Trespass wherein the offender
does persist and remain obstinate, on which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Christ's Rule, Excommunication should
strick: Now sure it is, there are many Errors not
contrary to fundamental Truths: such as many
points of <hi>Arminianism, Antinomianism</hi> &amp;c. which
yet persisted in are Scandalous both to particular
Christians and the Church; and therefore according
to Christs Rule, Excommunication should strick upon
other Errors than those contrary to the fundamental
Points of Religion, which is contrary to their asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither can we assent that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
should strick on no other Errors but those
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61451:37"/>
contrary to the light of Nature, and that not only
because of what is presently said, that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
should strick against every scandalous Sin
done against a Brother, or the Church wherein the
offender does persist and remain obstinate; but also
according to that Rule whereby they maintain that
Excommunication should strick on no other Error,
but these that are contrary to the very Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
it would follow that the publisher of these
Errors following (or the like against fundamental
Truths) should not be censured: <hi>to wit,</hi> That the
Scriptures are not the word of God. That <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> was an Impostor, a Deceiver: That we are not
justified by free Grace; say according to that rule,
such Hereticks should not be censured, no not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastically;
because these Errors are not against
Natures Light, but Scripture Light only; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Light teacheth not the Truths which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to these Errors. This much for Church <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi>
but, as said is, concerning this is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Contraversy.</p>
               <p>The main question then is, concerning State <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration.</hi>
Concerning which some do affirm. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Church may do in Inflicting Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
on Hereticks, Maintainers of Heterodox Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
Yet, say they, no civil Punishment, such as
Death, Imprisonment, Mulcts, or Fines, should be
inflicted on any Error or Blasphem whatsoever;
providing the Maintainers of them carry themselves
peaceably, do not trouble the State, or do evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Commonwealth in civil Things: We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61451:38"/>
on the contrary do hold, That it is the Duty
of the Civil Magistrate to suppress Error, Heresie,
and every sin against the First Table, as well as it
is his Duty to suppress Adultery, Fornication, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and other sins against the second Table: And
that he is not only bound to suppress Errors and
Blasphemies, that are contrary to fundamental
Truths, or the Light of Nature; but all Error contrary
to other points of Truth.</p>
               <p>Now for clearing the State of this Question, and
freeing it from some odious Imputations that may
be cast upon it: Before we come to Arguments we
shall lay down these Assertions: <hi>First,</hi> We do not
say that the Magistrate is bound to punish Hereticks
at the first step; Pains should first be taken to inform
them, the Judgement of the Church is Antecedent,
and their Labour is to convince Gainsayers: So this
must go before the Magistrates Duty, they must be
found Obstinate before the Magistrate medle with
them, or punish them Civilly; Especially if their
Errors be not horrid Blasphemies against God and
Natures Light, in such the Magistrate is not bound
to give so much Forbearance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We do not
say that all Errors and Heresies are to get alike pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
but according to the degrees of the guilt
that is in them, even as it is in sins committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Second Table: Murder is a more hainous
Fault than Fornication, and therefore the Magistrate
is bound to punish it more highly. Even so is it in
Sins done against the First Table; Blasphemies done
against God, or a denying of the true God, is a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61451:38"/>
higher Sin than Worshiping of the true God after
a false manner; and therefore the Magistrate is
bound to punish it more severely. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As we
do not say, that every Error and Heresie is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the like punishment; so neither do we say
that every one that maintains the same Error is to be
alike punished, for there are some that are Seducers,
or Drawers on of others to Error, Disturbers of the
Peace of the Church, Ring-leaders; there are others
again that are only seduced and drawn away to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and these last, although they should not be
<hi>Tollerate,</hi> yet the power of the Magistrate is to be
exercised more sparingly towards them. So <hi>Secondly,</hi>
There are some rooted in Error, confirmed in it,
who will not hear Instruction: There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are but weak, and are seeking Light,
whose way evidenceth them to be Conscientious,
only for the time they are Ignorant, and in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
seeking after Light; and these last, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
as all other Christians, is to bear much with,
according to <hi>Rom. 15. 1. We then that are strong, ought
to bear the Infirmities of the weak,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now this being said to clear the question, we come
to Arguments to make out this Truth, <hi>to wit,</hi> That
the Magistrate is bound to suppress and punish Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
Heresie, and other sins against the First Table,
as well as he is bound to punish Adultery, Theft,
and other sins against the Second Table.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First Argument</hi> we bring is, from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven
practice of Kings and Magistrates under the
Old Testament, from which we form an Argument
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61451:39"/>
thus: If it was the approven practice of Kings and
and Magistrates under the Old Testament to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Error, Heresie and Blasphemy, then Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
under the New Testament are bound to do
the like: But, so it is that it was the approven
practice of Kings and Magistrates under the Old
Testament to suppress Error, Heresie and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and other sins against the first Table: Therefore,
Magistrates under the New Testament are bound to
do the like: For confirming of this Argument there
are two things to be made out: <hi>First,</hi> That it was the
practice of the Magistrate under the Old Testament
to suppress Error and Heresie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was
their practice, so their practice herein is approven of
God, otherwise it were not binding unto others; for
Kings and Magistrates did several things wherein
they were not approven, and so not binding unto
us now: The first thing then we are to clear is, that
this was the practice of Magistrates under the Old
Testament: And we shall begin <hi>First</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
practice, <hi>Genes. 18. 19. For I know him, that he will
command his Children, and his Houshold after him, and
they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do Iustice and
Iudgement,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> with <hi>Jacob</hi> who was a
Magistrate in his own Family: And we shall see him
employing his Power to suppress false Religion. In
the 35 of <hi>Gen.</hi> vers. 2. <hi>Then</hi> Jacob <hi>said unto his
Houshold, and to all that were with him, put away the
strange Gods that are among you, and be clean, and
change your Garments.</hi> And in the 4 verse, <hi>And they
gave unto</hi> Jacob <hi>all the strange Gods which were in their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61451:39"/>
Hands, and all their Ear-rings which were in their Ears,
and</hi> Jacob <hi>hid them under the Oak which was by</hi> Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem.
The <hi>Third</hi> practice which we shall observe,
is that of <hi>Asa</hi> in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. vers. 2. <hi>And</hi> Asa <hi>did
that which was good and Right in the Eyes of the Lord
his God.</hi> verse 3. <hi>For he took away the Altars of the
strange Gods, and the high places, and broke down the
Images, and cut down the Groves.</hi> Verse 4. <hi>And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
Judah <hi>to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and
to do the Law and the Commandment.</hi> And in the
5 Verse <hi>Also he took away out of the Cities</hi> of Judah, <hi>the
High-places and the Images,</hi> &amp;c. And we shall find it
in chap. 15. vers. 12, 13. <hi>And they entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to seek the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That whosoever would
not seek the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>should be put to death,
whether small or great, whether man or woman.</hi> And
in the 16. <hi>v.</hi> he employes his power in this point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his own Mother <hi>Maachah. And also concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Maachah <hi>the Mother of</hi> Asa <hi>the King, he removed
her from being Queen, because she had made an Idol,
in a Grove: and</hi> Asa <hi>cut down her Idol, and stamped it,
and burnt it at the brook</hi> Kidron. The <hi>Fourth</hi> practice
shall be of King <hi>Manasseth.</hi> 2 Chron: 33, 15. (ye
would mark such places for ye may have need of
them) <hi>And he took away the strange Gods, and the Idol
out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars that he had
built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<hi>and cast them out of the City.</hi> v. 16‚ÄîAnd
<hi>commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to serve the Lord God of</hi> Israel.
The last practice that we shall name is, that of <hi>Josiah</hi>
2 Chron: 34. v. 31, 32, 33. <hi>And the King stood in his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61451:40"/>
place, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk
after the Lord.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he caused all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Benjamen, <hi>to stand to it.</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And</hi> Josiah <hi>took away all the Abominations out of all the
countries, that pertained to the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and
made all that were present in</hi> Israel <hi>to serve, even to serve
the Lord their God;</hi> Let this suffice to make out the
first point, That such were the practices of Kings
and Magistrates under the Old Testament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be cleared is, That as these
were their practices; so they were approven practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And this is clear; <hi>First</hi> from Gods approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to them in that place before cited, 2 <hi>Chron.
14. 23. Asa</hi> gets a Testimony, <hi>That He did that which
was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.</hi> And
wherefore? <hi>For he took away the Altars of the strange
Gods, and the high Places, and broke down the Images,</hi> &amp;c.
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> We find that <hi>Jehu,</hi> although he was
Hypocritical, was rewarded of God, for suppressing
of False Worship: In 2 <hi>Kings 10. 30. And the Lord
said unto</hi> Jehu, <hi>because thou hast done well in executing
that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the
House of</hi> Ahab, <hi>according to all that was in mine heart,
thy Children of the fourth Generation, shall sit on the
throne of</hi> Israel. We might bring several other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
that these their practices were approven of
God, but what is already said may suffice.</p>
               <p>The patrons of <hi>Tolleration</hi> bring several exceptions
to weaken the strengh of this Argument, which we
shall propone in as full strength as they come to our
hand; and take them off: And the <hi>First</hi> exception
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61451:40"/>
is this, say they, The practice of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Testament cannot be binding to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats
under the New, because they were Typical
Kings, and the actions they did were Typical of
somewhat to be done by Christ, and so not binding
to us. To this we reply. <hi>First,</hi> That however this our
hold concerning the practices of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi>
and <hi>Israel</hi> after they entered <hi>Canaan</hi> who were Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Kings (as they say) of this Typical Land, that
they could not be binding to Magistrats now; yet
we find it was the practice of <hi>Jacob</hi> before the
the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> was erected, and so what he
did was not done by him as a Type of Christ, but a
moral duty; and he was approven in it; we find
also when heathen Kings came to the Knowledge of
God, they employed their power this way and were
approven in so doing; and surely they will not call
Heathen Kings Types of Christ: We shall give one
instance of this in the seventh chap: of <hi>Ezra</hi> v. 26.
There a decree comes out from <hi>Atraxerxes</hi> a heathen
King. <hi>Whosoever will not do the Law of thy God, and
the Law of the King, let Judgment be executed speedily
upon him, whither it be unto Death, or to Banishment
or to confiscation of Goods,</hi> &amp;c. Now lest it should be
said this was a rash Act, and so not binding: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is something in the Text equivalent to
God's Approbation of it; to wit, <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Blessing
the Lord that he had made such an Act Verse 27.
But we give a <hi>Second</hi> Answer, to the Objection:
Although it were granted that all the King's of <hi>Israel</hi>
were Types of Christ, as we do not grant it in all,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61451:41"/>
especially in those who were wicked and Godless
men, it does not follow that what they did in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
false Doctrine, they Acted therein as Types
of Christ: And if so, then it does not follow, that it
is not binding now; except they will say that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was done by any who were Types of Christ
in no wayes binding unto others; and if so they
may as well argue, that what Magistrates under the
Old Testament did in punishing sins against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, such as Adultery, Murder, were done
by them as they were Types of Christ; and so not
binding to Magistrates now: Yea, upon the same
ground they may infer that <hi>Davids</hi> Prayers and Tears
for sin were no copy for us to follow; why these
were Acts of one who was a Type of Christ. Yea
by the same Reason, they may reject the whole
Scripture of the Old Testament, as not binding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, because forsooth, it was written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and such as were Types of Christ, and so
not binding to us. Thus we see what absurdity the
giving way to such an exception will draw unto, and
therefore it is to be rejected.</p>
               <p>But their <hi>Second</hi> Exception seems more plausible
and it is this, say they, The practice of the Kings
of <hi>Israel</hi> doth not argue up fully to that which we
do hold, because their practice did not strike on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Error against Truth, but only Idolatry; and
not all Idolaters, but those that made Apostacy and
served false Gods; and not all of those, but these on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that seduced and drew away others to serve the
false God. Now it does not follow from their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61451:41"/>
of Idolaters, who worshiped a false God;
that therefore Magistrates are bound to punish Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
worshipping the true God though in a false
way, This is the strength of their exception; to
which we reply. <hi>First,</hi> That though it were true
which they say that the practice of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi>
did extend but to Idolaters, and those that seduced
and drew away others to serve false Gods, yet it does
not follow but it may be binding to Magistrates now
to punish Hereticks worshipping a true God in a
false way, and that because of this rule necessarly
to be admitted in expounding of Scripture, that
when the command of God does strick against any
one sin most usual in the time, by rule of proportion,
it stricks against all sins of that kind, As in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Command there is nothing expresly forbidden
but the <hi>Worshipping of God by graven Images;</hi> and that
because the worshipping of God by Images was the
sin most in use at that time; yet under graven is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
all wayes of worshipping of God invented by
men; and so although it were true that the practice
of Godly Kings did strick but against Idolatry, yet by
rule of proportion all sins of that kind should be
suppressed: To which add, that when the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of any sins by divine Law is to be punished by
death, common equity will infer, that lesser degrees
of sin are to be punished by a lesser punishment at
least. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to what they say, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
did only punish Idolatry under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We Answer that it is false, they did punish
other Errors also, and such as would be thought
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61451:42"/>
light of now; and this we shall instance in several
particulars. <hi>First,</hi> They punished will worship in
serving the true God, and this we see by comparing
two places of Scripture: The first is the 2 <hi>Kings 23,
8,</hi> 9. Speaking of <hi>Josiah, And he brought all the
Priests out of the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and defiled the high
places, where the Priests had burnt incense:</hi> So he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
his Power against the high places, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of their way of worship. The other
place of Scripture to be compared with, is the 2
<hi>Chrov:</hi> 33. 17. (Which tells us the nature of their
high places) <hi>Nevertheless, the People did sacrifice still
in the high places, yet unto the Lord their God only.</hi> So
that this worshipping on the high places, was
not that kind of Idolatry whereby a false God was
worshipped; but a way of their own, whereby they
worshipped the true God, and yet <hi>Josiah</hi> suppress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
even this kind of false worship. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we
find that Magistrates did employ their power for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of the breakers of the Sabbath day, and
and punishing those that Married strange wives,
which yet were not Idolaters and Apostats from the
true God; a noble example whereof is in <hi>Nehemiah
13.</hi> from verse 15, to 21. There is a large Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
what pains he took to reform the People to keep
the Sabbath day, therefore in the 21. v. <hi>Then I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
against them, and said unto them, why lodged ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the wall? If ye do so again I will lay hands on you.</hi>
He threatens to employ the Civil power for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of that Error, and this is not Idolatry.
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> we find that the Magistrates employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61451:42"/>
their power generally, for suppressing any Error
that was contrary to any Article of the Covenant:
So where we read in the 2 <hi>Chron: 34. 31, 32. And
the King stood in his place, and made a covenant before
the Lord</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. <hi>And he caused all that were present
in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Benjamin <hi>to stand to it.</hi> And the
heads of the Covenant are not only against those
who were Seducers, but also against those that
were seduced: So we find it in <hi>Exodus</hi> 32, v.
20. In that Idolatry of worshipping the Golden
Calf, when <hi>Moses</hi> came down from the mount in
his zeal to the Glory of God, he not only punished
<hi>Aaron,</hi> but also the People: and more than this, he
Armes the <hi>Levits,</hi> as the avengers of God's Justice,
and proclaims that every man should avenge the
Lord upon his very Brother: Thus we have made out
in the first Argument taken from the practice of the
Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and have vindicated it by
Scripture from their exceptions brought against it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument shall yet be grounded on
the Old Testament, and it is taken from the many
commands and precepts, that are given in Scripture
to Godly Kings and Magistrates and others to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Blasphemers, False Prophets and Idolaters, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
Sabbath Breakers, and Seducers, from
whence we form this Argument: That whatever
was commanded to be done by Magistrates under the
Old Testament as a part of their duty, this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
under the New Testament are oblidged to as
a part of their duty also: But Magistrates were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
under the Old Testament to suppress Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61451:43"/>
Blasphemy, and Heresy and that they were to
do as a part of their duty as Magistrates: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a duty lying on Magistrates under the New.
The thing we have to prove is, that this was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
given to Magistrates under the Old Testament
and that as a part of their duty as Magistrates. And
for this look over these places of Scripture Exod.
22. 20. <hi>He that sacrificeth unto any God, save unto the
Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</hi> There is a
command given to the Magistrates. And so in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
24, 15. <hi>And thou shalt speak unto the Children of</hi>
Israel, <hi>saying, Whosoever curseth his God, shall bear his
sin.</hi> v. 16. <hi>And he that Blasphemeth the name of the
Lord, he shall surely be put to death.</hi> So in the 13. of
Deut: 1. <hi>If there arise among you a Prophet, or dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder.</hi> &amp;c.
Through the whole Chapter there are Commands
given to the Magistrate to punish false worship. We
shall only add another, and that is taken from the
fourth Command, where a charge is laid on the
Magistrate as well as the Master of a Family to make
use of his power for keeping of the Sabbath, and to
see to the keeping of it by others also. <hi>Thou shalt
do no manner of work, thou, nor they son, nor they daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
‚ÄîThis Command is given to the Magistrate as
well as to the Master of the Family, as appears from
those things. <hi>First,</hi> By vertue of this Command
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Magistrate of God's People, did make
use of his power to punish Sabbath Breakers in that
place we cited in <hi>Nehemiah 13. 21. Secondly,</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from this that the Gates spoken of their, <hi>Nor
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61451:43"/>
any thing that is within thy Gates,</hi> is a term which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
not to a single Family, but a whole City, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the circuit of a whole Kingdom: of the word
[<hi>Gates</hi>] is taken in Scripture Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>: 22. 17‚Äî<hi>and
thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies:</hi> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as in that respect, therefore he speaks to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
no Master of a Family having such large
power. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The power there spoken of,
is to be extended to Strangers: now the chief care of
Stangers did belong to the Magistrate, and not to the
Master of a Family, therefore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
extends this power of his to the Strangers that
came to buy and sell on the Sabbath day, <hi>Nehem:</hi> 13, 20</p>
               <p>The Adversary brings several exceptions against
this Argument which we shall propone and take off.
The <hi>First</hi> Exception is, say they, Those were Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Laws, and so now are expired with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
<hi>Answer,</hi> This is a common refuge
to <hi>Sectaries</hi> where any practice is brought from the
Old Testament against them, presently they cast at
it upon this account as not binding to us under the
New: Therefore we shall speak so much the more
unto this point: By a judicial Law is meaned a Civil
Law, so the force of their Argument is this: The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law of one Kingdom is not binding to another, but
these were Civil Lawes belonging to that Kingdom;
Therefore, they are not binding to us. To this we
Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That they cannot say this of all the
Laws instanced, particularly of that Law of the
fourth Command: It is a Moral Law binding to all,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> we Answer, the rest of these Laws are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61451:44"/>
Moral and binding to all Magistrates, yea and that
for these Reasons: Because <hi>First, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
and other Magistrates that were among the
<hi>Jews</hi> did practice these Laws even before the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Law was given out by <hi>Moses;</hi> and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved
to be Moral. Yea Heathen Kings that were
not under the Judicial Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as not being
Members of their Commonwealth, when they came
to the knowledge of God, they made use of their
Power to suppress Idolatry, which certainly was
through vertue of the Moral Law, commanding
them so to do: Not the Judicial Law, that they were
not under. A <hi>Third</hi> Answer we give, that though
what is said were true. <hi>viz.</hi> That these Laws were
Judicial: Yet it does not follow that they are not
now binding to Magistrates. To understand this,
there were two things in their Judicial Laws, as in
our Civil Laws. Yet, there was somewhat that
concerned the Kingdom in particular as that Law,
that <hi>Servants should be freed from their service at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years end.</hi> And the Law of inheritance to be
keept within the Tribe, and this part of the Law
did fall with their Common-wealth. But their was
another thing in their Judicial Laws, and that is
somewhat of Common Equity belonging unto all,
such as Laws for punishing sins done against the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law; and in this far the Judicial Law is binding
to us: because there is not a syllable in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for abrogating of it, and so must bind, being
given by God. And Jesus Christ and his Apostles
Reason from this Judicial Law; as in 1 <hi>Corinth: 9. 9.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61451:44"/>
It is written in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle
the mouth of the Ox that treade thout the corn:</hi> And in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places: so is it in the Civil Laws in other
Kingdoms: as for example, That Witches should
be punished by death, and burnt to Ashes, is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Now there is somewhat there
of Common Equity, to wit, that they should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by death; but the particular way of putting
them to death, to wit, whither by strangling drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp;c. or the burning of their Bodies to Ashes,
is not of Common Equity: Other Kingdoms may
use another way of Execution, as pleaseth them best.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Second</hi> Exception they bring against
this Argument, say they: If their Laws were bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us, then they would be binding according
to all their circumstances: and if so, then all
persons, whole Cities, yea beasts behoved to be sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to death: For so is the Command <hi>Deutro:</hi> 13.
Now say they, what Massacring would this be. To
take off this exception, we Answer: There are two
things in a <hi>Law,</hi> there is <hi>first,</hi> The substance of the
<hi>Law, Secondly,</hi> The Circumstances of it: Now a
<hi>Law</hi> may hold according to the main substance, and
yet not according to these circumstances: We shall
clear it in an Example, The Law of Hospitality binds
all nations as to the substance of the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by it, but there were some circumstances
joyned with this Law, according to the nature of the
people to whom it was given; such as the washing of
feet, and kisses of Charity; and according to these it is
not binding; And so that command, That false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61451:45"/>
should be punished, is substantial and binding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all; but that it should so be punished as to put Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Women, Beasts, young and old to death, was
suited according unto the temper of that People
unto whom it was given, being so naturally prone
to Idolatry, and therefore were by more fearful pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
to be scarred from it, and so in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is not binding unto others. We may add where
this Law is repeated, as <hi>Exod: 22. 18. Deutr: 17. 2.
5.</hi> and <hi>Cap:</hi> 18. 20. It is only repeated in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it, and the way and manner is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> we find that <hi>Jacob</hi> and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
who were before the Law did not Execute
it according to thir Circumstances; Yea and the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Magistrates as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Josiah Ezod:</hi> 31. and
2 <hi>King</hi> 23, Did not tye themselves precisely to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Law according to all these Circumstances;
And so it remaines that though these Circumstances
do not bind the Magistrate yet the Law according to
its substance is yet binding.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Third</hi> Exception they bring, say they,
the Magistrate under the Old Testament had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule whereby he might know what was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
and what not, to wit his consulting the
Lord <hi>by Vrim and Thummim.</hi> But the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
under the New Testament have not this infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Rule, and so it does not follow from the duty
of Magistrates under the Old Testament, that the
same should be done by the Magistrates under the
New. To which we Answer, This exception
suppones <hi>First,</hi> That Magistrates under the New
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61451:45"/>
Testament may punish those whom they know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be Hereticks, and surely there are sundry
Hereticks of this kind, which he may know as well
as if he had consulted with <hi>Vrim and Thummim. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
this exception of theirs doth suppone, that
the Magistrate under the New Testament hath no
way left him how to come to know infallibly what
is Heresy, what not, which is false; he hath the word
of God, his Spirit speaking by it, which is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
than that of the Priests getting their Answer
from <hi>Vrim and Tummim:</hi> For it might be doubted
whither the Priest had taken up the Answer right
or not; or if he was Faithful in giving it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he had received it. Yea <hi>Peter</hi> sayes the word
is more sure than any voice from Heaven, 2 <hi>Peter 1.
Thirdly,</hi> This exception does suppone that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
under the Old Testament took this course of
consulting with <hi>Vrim and Thummim,</hi> for knowing
who was Hereticks, Idolaters, and who not: But
this is false<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it was only the written Word which they
consulted with, for knowing what was Heresy, what
not <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>: 8. 20. To the Law, and to the Testimony,</hi> &amp;c.
And for the application of the rule to persons, that
they might know who were the Hereticks, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read that they consulted <hi>Vrim and Thummim,</hi> but
used a judicial Process against the person challenged,
and proved the Fact by Witnesses: So <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 4.
There must be a scandal of Idolatry upon the man
challenged, <hi>And if it be told thee, and thou hast heard
of it, and enquired diligently,</hi> &amp;c. And it must be
proved on him by Witnesses, verse 6. <hi>As the mouth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61451:46"/>
of two Witnesses, or three Witnesses, shall he that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Death, he put to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They except <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in the Infancy and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the Church God Typed out things Spiritual
by things Earthly, and so those Punishments were
Types of Spiritual Censures, Excommunication and
Hell, and therefore are not now to be put in practice:
We answer <hi>First,</hi> Excommunication and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were things present to the Jewish Church, and so
they had no Types of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is to
turn Scripture to Allegories, and by this same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we may cast at punishments of Sins against the
Second Table, as being Types of Spiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
Hell and Damnation, and there is as much
ground for affirming the one as the other. This
much for Arguments from the Old Testament.</p>
               <p>We shall next hint at some Arguments from the
New Testament. <hi>First,</hi> If so be that it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
for Magistrates to meddle with men in matters
of Religion, then certainly Jesus Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should have used this legal Defence, when the
Magistrate called them before him to answer about
their Doctrine, They would have said, ye have no
place to challenge us for our profession, for matters of
Opinion are free; but we do not hear that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
the Judge, or used any such Defence, for sure
Christ and his Apostles would have left no lawful
mean unessayed.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>second</hi> Argument taken from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.
Where speaking of the Civil Magistrate the Apostle
sayeth, <hi>For he is the Minister of God to thee far good, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61451:46"/>
if thou do that which is evil be afraid,</hi> There is set down
the object of the Magistrates Power and the extent of
it, and it is set down indefinitly, <hi>upon him that doth
evil.</hi> And therefore if Hereticks, Maintainers of
falle Worship, be doers of evil, they fall under the
Magistrates Power. Now that spreaders of Heresie
are doers of evil, we did prove in the second Doctrine
raised from this Verse, where we shew that Heresy
and Error was as much to be eschewed, as Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and other Sins against the Second Table; and the
Magistrate as Magistrate should put forth his zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them as much; and all the places command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
zeal against Error (which are not few) in the
New Testament proves this, for they bind every
one according to his place; the Minister according
to his place, and the Magistrate according to his.</p>
               <p>There is one Exception they make much of against
this Argument, and it is this; say they, By doers
of evil, cannot be meaned these that are taken with
Error and Heresy, and other Sins against the First
Table: And that because the evil that is here spoken
of, is the evil that is mentioned in the beginning
of the Verse, <hi>But if thou do that which is evil be afraid,</hi>
It is an evil, say they, that any that were guilty of it
had need to be afraid of the Magistrate because of
it, and so it is not meaned the evil of Error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
against Christian Truths: For the Magistrate
here spoken of, is the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor and Senate,
who themselves were Enemies to Christian Religion,
and so none needed to be afraid of them for spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Errors, but rather for mantaining Truths; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61451:47"/>
therefore the doers of evil here meaned, must be
the controveeners of the Emperors Civil Laws, and
not Hereticks and such like. For Answer, This
exception is grounded on a wrong supposition; for
by the Magistrate is here meaned, not only the
<hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate, but all Magistrates in general do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Duty as they ought. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate to speak here
what is the Duty of all Magistrates; and it is clear
from several Circumstances of the Text: We shall
mark one of them from the first words of the Text,
<hi>For he is the Minister of God to thee,</hi> Now sure it is,
this must be meaned of Magistrates in general, and
not astricted only to the <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate; he not
being the Minister of God unto every one who was
to make use of this Scripture. There is another Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of the Text, proving this in the 3 V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>rse,
<hi>For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works.</hi> Now sure
this must be expounded of the Office of Magistracy
in general, and of that which Magistrates should
be, and not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrate, who then
was well known to be a Terror unto many good
Works, not only unto Christian, but also unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertues.</p>
               <p>We shall give you only another Argument shortly
taken from that Prophecy, <hi>Revel:</hi> 17. 16. A Prophecy
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>at the Civil Magistrate shall bring down the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
and that Error of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, as a most
acceptable work to God: And so the Magistrates
Hand is not bound up from punishing Error and
Heresy against the First Table, no more than from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61451:47"/>
punishing other Sins done against the Second Table.
And this much for our Arguments brought in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Truth.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> place, we promised to bring forth
some of their Arguments and solve them; Herein
we need not spend much time for this being Truth,
there can be nothing said against it, which is Truth:
Yet there being some nimble Spirits to propone Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which every one cannot answer; we shall
stay a little on this <hi>Third</hi> point also.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing they object is this: If so be that it
were the Magistrates Duty to punish Error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
then Jesus Christ would have reproved the Jews
for <hi>Tollerating</hi> the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Saduces:</hi> But so it is
he never reproves the Jews for so doing: Nothing
of that kind is recorded by any of the Evangelists.</p>
               <p>To this we Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Christ did not reprove the Jews, because
it is not written: For <hi>John</hi> sayes <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 30. He did
speak many things which are not written; so it
follows not. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> we say, although it be
granted that Christ did not reprove them, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not that their neglect was not a Sin. For <hi>First,</hi> by
that reason we might say that the Mgistrate should
not punish Theft, because Christ speaks nothing of
the punishment of it in the New Testament: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> reproveth he the Church for not Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them, and yet it followeth not but that they
ought to be Censured that way. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God
had revealed his Will before. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It
would have been for no purpose to have stired up
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61451:48"/>
the Magistrate to this Duty then, for the <hi>Sectarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
themselves had the Power that was of it. And
<hi>Lastly,</hi> the Jews at this time had not the Power of
Civil Punishment in their Hands, but the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and so it was not in their Power to punish.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Second</hi> Objection which they bring from
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s words in the Epistle to the <hi>Philipp:
3.</hi> 15. where speaking of Differences among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
he sayes, <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
God shall reveal even this unto you.</hi> Say they, we
see what was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgement, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Differences, there should be Heart Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Uniting; and therefore the Magistrate
should not be stired up to Censure those who Err.
To this we Answer, <hi>Paul</hi> speaks nothing there of <hi>State
Toll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ration;</hi> for then the Civil Powers were not for
Christ, but of <hi>Church Toll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ration</hi> in respect of that meek<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness
and tenderness which Christs Servants should
have in inflicting of Church Censures, for fear of
breaking Love: <hi>Secondly,</hi> He commandeth not all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
to be thus <hi>Tollerated;</hi> for so he should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
himself in another place, where he sayes, <hi>An
Heretick after the first and second admonition reject.</hi>
And <hi>Thirdly, Paul</hi> limits that <hi>Tolleration</hi> that he
would have here; and that in two things. <hi>First,</hi> As
to the time, how long, <hi>God shall reveal even this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> He supposes the persons dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from them should walk with them in things
wherein they differ not, according to the same rule,
and so make no separation. Now it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61451:48"/>
that those who remained Obstinate in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
should be still <hi>Tollerated,</hi> and that the Censure of
the Church should not strick on them at all; chiefly
if it be such an Error as causes Rents and Schisms,
for he sayes, <hi>Take heed to those that cause Divisions and
Offences, and avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Third</hi> Objection is, That this is contrary to
the way the Apostles took with those that Erred,
their way was to watch against them that Erred,
<hi>Acts 20. 29. For I know this, that after my departing
shall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not sparing the
Flock.</hi> Verse 31. <hi>Therefore watch</hi>‚ÄîThat which
the Apostle commands is, to watch against them.
And in <hi>Rom. 16. 17. Now I beseech you, Brethren,
mark them which cause Divisions and Offences‚Äîand
avoid them.</hi> And in the 2 <hi>Timoth:</hi> 2. 24. it is said,
<hi>And the Servant of the Lord must not strive; but be
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.</hi> Now, say
they, this is a far other way than to stir up the Civil
Magistrate against those who differ from us, This
Savors not of the meek Spirit of Christ. I answer,
It is the Duty of Ministers to watch against Error,
and that is one mean for suppressing of Error and
Heresy; but one mean destroyes not another: it
does not follow that this which is in controversy is
not another mean also, neither is it contrary to that
meekness commanded to wait on them, more than
to deliver to <hi>Satan,</hi> or to Curse, and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Apostates, with that great Curse called, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
Maranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22. They may as well
say, It is contrary to Christs meek Spirit to establish the

Sword in the Hands of the Christian Magistrate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Rom:</hi> 13. 4. For punishing Sins against the
Second Table, and so under this pretence, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Murderers, Seducers, Thieves, and all should go
free unpunished. But they do far mistake the Meekness
of Jesus Christ, Christs Meekness is not to let people
live in their Sin, to let vile Hereticks trample on
Truth, destroying Souls: And in the mean time
binding up the Hand of the Magistrate, that he dare
not hinder it; this were a disrespect to Truth, and
cruelty to poor Souls in danger to be carried away;
which our Lord was very tender of.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Fourth</hi> Objection from <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24.
Taken from the Parable of the <hi>Tares;</hi> where the
Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a man that
sowed Wheat, and the wicked one comes and sowes
his <hi>Tares</hi> among it, and both is bidden let grow till
the Harvest. Now, say they, by these <hi>Tares</hi> is mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hereticks; therefore they should not be plucked
up by the Sword of the Civil Magistrate. We <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
If they astrict the Word <hi>Tares</hi> to Hereticks, in
this sense, That the Sword of the Civil Magistrate
should not be used against them; by the same reason
they may say, that they should not be disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
for that is a plucking up of them also. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
We answer, That by the <hi>Tares</hi> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
here to be suffered let grow up to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
is no more meaned Hereticks than other
Scandalous Livers: And this we shall make out
from Christs exponding the Parable, Verse 41‚Äî<hi>And
they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61451:49"/>
Now Hereticks are not all things that offend, other
scandalous Livers offend also. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the <hi>Tares</hi>
is meaned, <hi>Them that do Iniquity,</hi> vers. 41. Now
others besides Hereticks are such. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If
by the <hi>Tares</hi> were here meaned Hereticks, then by
the [<hi>Wheat</hi>] are meaned only the Orthodox, and so
every man that is Orthodox should‚Äî<hi>Shine forth
as the Sun in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> vers. 43 But
there are many who are Orthodox<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> who yet are
evil Livers, and so will never go to Heaven. And
therefore by the [<hi>Wheat</hi>] must only be meaned the
truly Regenerate; and so by the [<hi>Tares<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi>] must not
only be meaned Hereticks, but all other Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</p>
               <p>And further, By this it would follow that Hereticks
should not be Excommunicate, for that is a rooting
out. But what can be meaned by the <hi>Tares</hi> then:
for whatever be meaned by them, it will follow that
by this Parable <hi>Verse</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> they should be tollerated;
and to say that all vile scandalous Persons should be
tollerated, is more absurd than that only Hereticks
should be tollerated. Answer, If we narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Christs exposition of the Parable, we will find
that part where he bids, <hi>Let both grow together until
the Harvest,</hi> is not exponed, although he expone the
rest, which doubtless he would not have omitted, if it
had been his mind that we should have built any
Doctrine of this kind on it; therefore we say this is
not Christs meaning, that he would have all men
(how Godless and Scandalous soever) let alone; for
that were contrary to other places of Scripture:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61451:50"/>
But that Christ is to show that when all pains are
taken by Christs Officers for purging the Church, yet
there will be alwayes some Hypocrites in it, and it is
Christs mind, though he hath given order to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
scandalous Offenders, yet that his Servants
should not press after such a separation of the precious
from the vile, as to have all the Weeds and wicked
in heart to be cast out; lest when they gather out
the Graceless <hi>Tares,</hi> they should root out also the
Gracious [<hi>Wheat</hi>] with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. There is a <hi>Fifth</hi> Objection from <hi>Luk: 9.
54:</hi> Where Christ reproves <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire to come down from Heaven to consume the
<hi>Samaritans;</hi> and from this they argue: That when
People refuse Christ in his Person, much less when
they oppose him in his Doctrine, it is not his mind
that they should be punished, but admonished and
waited on: But before we Answer they must prove
the Quarrel was for Religion. Now this cannot be
made out for the Reason why <hi>James</hi> would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ire
coming down from Heaven, was, because of an
Act of Inhumanity in denying lodging to Christ;
and that because of the great envy and hatred betwixt
these two people the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans.</hi> The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
Answer we give is, although the Quarrel had
been for Religion, yet it makes not against this
Doctrine; because they were wholly Idolaters, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ignorant of the Gospel; and our Doctrine is
not that when a Nation is lying in Idolatry, that
the first thing that should be done is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
sword to slay them, or to seek fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61451:50"/>
to consume them: We say it is utterly unlawful
to goe with fire and sword to force the <hi>Indians</hi> to
embrace the Christian Faith; only they should be
taught, instructed and restrained from spreading
Blasphemies, reproaching the Son of God &amp;c. Our
Question is whether or not a People that are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the visible Church, that have bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Covenant to adhere to the Christian Truths,
whether or not when they fall away from Truth
to damnable Error, the Magistrate may make them
stand to their Covenant, as <hi>Josiah</hi> did 2 <hi>Chron: 34.
31. And he caused all that were present, to stand
to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6. The <hi>Sixth</hi> Objection is this; say they,
If Magistrates may punish Error and Heresy, then
he may force the Conscience; for what they hold, is
as they profess, according to the light of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
Now to force the Conscience is a fearful sin,
who dare meddle with Conscience but the God of
Conscience. Answer: This Argument seems plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
but for Answer to it we say, Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be forced properly, Only we say that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may punish for, or restrain sin in such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
motions as come from an evil informed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and if this be a sinful forcing of the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
then it were a sin to punish those who from
Conscience killed the Apostles <hi>John 16, 2.‚Äîthe
time cometh, that whosoever Killeth you, will think that
he doeth God Service.</hi> Yet we hope none will say
the punishment of such would be a sinful forcing of
the Conscience; so it were a sinful thing to punish
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61451:51"/>
those who made their Children to pass through the
fire unto <hi>Molech,</hi> under the name of Conscience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
These and many other absurdities would follow on
this Tenet of theirs, that none ought to be punished
for any thing they do following the indytments of a
deluded Conscience. What have there not been,
and yet are, Hereticks who pretend Conscience for
the vilest villanies of the World? The <hi>Jesuits</hi> pretend
Conscience for stobbing Kings and Magistrates. The
<hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>cks</hi> to have Wives common. And ancient
Hereticks hath made it a point of Conscience
to practice Adultery, and some present He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
to Marry their Sisters, so that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>igher in
Blood the Persons Married are, the Marriage is to
them the more spiritual, and a number of such like
villanies. Now will any think it a sinful forcing of
Conscience to punish such, whatever they tatle of
Conscience. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> To what they say, for
the Magistrate to punish men for Error, is a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of men for Conscience. To this we Answer:
Then it should follow that God commanded sin to
the Godly Magistrates under the Old Testament, for
it is clear they had a command to punish men for
Idolatry. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if this be a persecuting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
then it is a persecuting of Conscience to
Preach against Error, to refute it by good Reason.
To make this Consequence clear, know as there is a
Persecution with the hand, so with the Tongue,
and it is the bitterest Persecution that is, called job
5. 21<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>The scourge of the Tongue.</hi> And the mocking of
Christ was one of the fearfullest Persecutions he met
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61451:51"/>
with <hi>he trusted in God</hi> &amp;c. And so according to this
Doctrine it were unlawful to Preach against them
&amp;c. Why? For it is a sin to persecute them for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience.
But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> our Answer is; It is not the
hurt inferred that makes sinful Persecution, but it is
the cause for which the punishment is inflicted.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Seventh</hi> Objection they bring against
this Truth, and it is this, say they, If Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
were bound to punish Error and Heresy, it
would lay a tye on Magistrate; to know what
is Truth, and what is Error; Now, say they,
there are many intricate Questions about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Error and Truth, which the Generality of
Magistrates are ignorant of, and therefore say they
according to this Doctrine, we put power in the
hand of the Magistrate whereby he may punish those
that profess the Truth, if the Magistrate mistake,
and take Truth for Error. A dangerous Doctrine,
If Magistrates turn ignorant or corrupt. This seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
plausible: But we shall Answer to it. If this
Argument hold strong then it would follow that the
Civil Magistrate hath no power to punish sins against
the second Table; for there are a number of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Questions even about these, as in some cases of
Murther, Incest, matters of false Witness: And the
Lord sayeth <hi>Deut. 17. 8. If there arise a matter too hard
for thee in Judgement, between blood and blood, between
plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, &amp;c.</hi> Which
suppones there are many doubtful questions even
about things Civil which the generality are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of: and so it may fall out they may punish the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61451:52"/>
honest man for the knave; and yet this doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the ordinance of Magistracy, neither doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that he hath no power to punish for Civil crimes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> they may argue as well against what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to Masters of Families, That he receive not
an Heretick within his house 2 <hi>John v.</hi> 10. and 2 <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth:
3, 6. For of this sort are they which creep into
houses,</hi> &amp;c. Rom: 16. 17, 18. <hi>Now I beseech you
Brethren mark them which cause divisions‚Äîand avoid
them. &amp;c.</hi> By all which he supposeth certainly they
have some knowledge to judge who are Hereticks
and who not; else how could they elchew them;
and so they may argue as well against these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
as against this Doctrine: For may they say,
this is to put it on Masters of Families to know who
are Hereticks, who not, to know what is Truth
and what not, and this the generality of Masters of
Families are ignorant of; and so a power put on
them to barr the door on honest men, in stead of
an Heretick: Now when they free these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
from these consequences we shall free this
Doctrine from them also. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither the
word nor this Doctrine putteth a power on Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to punish Truth, their power is only to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Error: They may indeed so abuse their power,
but it followeth not that therefore they have no
power to punish Error: no more than because that
a Godless Magistrate as <hi>Nero</hi> was, may abuse his
power to oppress, Murther honest Citizens, and do
other Acts of Injustice against the second Table;
that therefore the Magistrate hath no power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61451:52"/>
Theeves, Robbers, Murderers, because either
through mistake or wickedness, he may abuse it to
punish innocent Men; whatever remedy is left for the
Magistrates abusing of his power under the one, the
same is left under the other, as insome cases suffering,
in others resisting.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Eighth</hi> Objection they have against this
Truth, say they, we make the mean unproportionate
to the end, no outward force can convert a man and
br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ng him to Christ, it makes men but Hypocrites,
the blast of the Kings horn or outlawry can make
no man a member of Christs body, that must be
done willingly, not by compulsion, and this were
to cudgell People out of their opinions. To this
we Answer, That our Doctrine doth not hold forth
that the power of the Magistrate is any mean to
convert Souls: Only this it doth hold forth that the
power of the Magistrate is a mean to restrain men
from doing sinful Acts against Christ; as <hi>Asa</hi> made
use of his Civil Power to keep down Idolatry,
it puts People indeed on the profession of outward
Obedience, and to this it is very proportioned. And
therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though the blast of the Kings
horn cannot make a Member of Christs invisible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by working Grace; Yet it may be a mean in
its own kind for making a Member of the Church
visible, by with-holding from sinful Acts, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them on Acts of outward Obedience. A <hi>Third</hi>
Answer we give, That the power of the Magistrate
doth not make men Hypocrites of it self, but
through the corruption of Man's heart, who makes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61451:53"/>
himself an Hypocrite. The end of this ordinance,
what it is in it self is set down in <hi>Deut: 13. 11. And
all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
such wickedness as this is, among you.</hi> That is the end,
that they being moved by their Example, should
abstain from such like worke: but that they do this
Hypocritically, is from their corrupt nature, who
fears him more who can kill the Body, than him
who after he hath killed the Body can cast both Soul
and Body into Hell. We Answer lastly if this were
a good Argument why a Magistrate should not make
use of his power to punish for false Doctrine because
throw occasion thereof many turn Hypocrites: then
say we, It should follow that the Magistrate should
not make use of his power to punish Incests, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Murders, Thefts &amp;c. because it is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of many Hypocrites, who abstain more from
such, for the fear of punishment, than for the fear
of God; yea according to this Doctrine it should
follow, That the Preaching of the word should be
unlawful, because through the occasion of it many
turn Hypocrites under it.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Ninth</hi> Objection they have against this
Truth, and it is this, say they, By this power we
give to the Magistrate to punish Error and Heresy,
we give him the Power of Church Judicatories, to
judge of Doctrines, Error and Heresy. In Answer to
this we shall speak more fully in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>
Doctrine, only for the present this giving Power to
the Magistrate to punish Error and Heresy, gives him
not a publick Judgement to discern, what is Error,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61451:53"/>
and what not, as a Judge in Church matters; but
only a Judgement of Discretion in relation to his own
Act: As for Example, when the Lord gives Power
to Masters of Families, not to let Hereticks come
into their House, it is not a putting the Power of
Church Judicatories in their Hands.</p>
               <p>IV. The last thing we promised to speak to you
of, was to give you some use of this: And the <hi>First</hi> is,
to reprove those who think Opinions are free, and
that none ought to be punished for such, We grant
as we said that there would be a difference amongst
Errors, some more damnable, some less; and so to
be less punished: and there is a difference to be put
amongst persons, some are seduced, some whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is Seared, some venting their Darkness, some
seeking Light: In such there should be a difference
observed. Again the Magistrate is to deal one way
with a Community, another way with some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
before it come to such an hight. And <hi>Lastly,</hi>
He is to deal otherwise with Errors that cannot be
mantained without troubling the Peace of the
Church and State, and those that break not Love,
nor strike not at any material point of Truth; the
<hi>last</hi> happily may be Tollerate, if the Maintaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s of
them do not evidence contempt: But not so the <hi>first.</hi>
These and such like Distinctions may be to qualify
this Power; but to deny it altogether, is the most
damnable Doctrine that ever was vented, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
cannot take a shorter course to undoe Religion,
and there can be no heart zealous for God but he
must loath it; and therefore look so on it: Think
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61451:54"/>
not, what is that to you what others do, if ye get
leave to serve God your self: Is that all your zeal for
God, that if ye get leave to serve him, ye care not
that all beside you Spit on his Face, and serve the
Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Hence see what an Account those Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
have to make, who make no use of their
Power this way for God, if they get their own Houses
built, cares not for his, if Rebellion against themselves
be curbed, cares not for the curbing of Rebellion
against God. This was the Sin of the Parliament
of <hi>England,</hi> though they entred into a Covenant with
the most high God, That they would suppress Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Heresy, they never employed their Power
that way; and that because they durst not for angring
of their Army, and therefore God hath suffered
their Army to overturn them, and set themselves
and whom they please in their place; And now they
by their practice give <hi>Tollerat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>on</hi> to all; and this is
the way to strengthen them. I say in the Name of
the Lord, if they repent not, it shall be the way to
ruine them, A people Swearing in their low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to root out Heresy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God blessing them
from that day; and within a few years carrying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as if they had Sworn to do the contrary, to
suffer all, encourage all, invite all the Devils in Hell
to vent what Blasphemies they please; and for their
encouragement to give them Surety that no Power
in <hi>Brittain</hi> shall hinder them, Was there ever such
an affront done to God? Think ye that he will sit
with it? No, if he should make the one half aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61451:54"/>
of a broken Covenant against the other, He will
not. It is noted of <hi>Asa, 2 Chron.</hi> 14. 5. Gods way,
to keep Magistrates sure, and their Kingdoms quiet,
is to be zealous against false Worship: No, but (say
they the way is not to anger Hereticks, they are
the surest Pillars of our Commonwealth, but woe to,
and will be to, that Common-wealth that is builded
on such Pillars. And if <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any party in it,
joyn with them on these terms, our woe is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He is a jealous God chiefly in the matter of
his Service, as is clear from the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> use is, If this be an Ordinance of God
to put Power in the Magistrates hand to punish Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
it should make you scar at Error and labour to
be grounded in the Truth: For we see Error is a sin
that God hates, and it is a sin that God will have
the Magistrate to punish, and so a sin that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
will punish if the Magistrate do neglect it. It is
natural to men to think, If they can live a good Life,
it is the less matter what be their Opinion; but the
Lord Judges not so; for as he will have other sins
punished by the Magistrate, so he will have these
punished also. And such as he usually punisheth
himself, by fearful Plagues, when the Magistrate
neglecteth his Duty, in punishing other sins, so doth
he in those. We might speak much from History
of fearful Judgements sent immediatly by God upon
Hereticks, but we shall here close.</p>

this also in some other of the
most Dangerous Errors of the Times; We shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>first</hi> with these Errors which are about the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church;</hi> and that because the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61451:55"/>

for if once the Government be brangled or shaken
the wild Boar of the Wilderness cometh in easily and
corrupteth the Doctrine: therefore it is that the
Devils main design hath been against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church to blast and storm this Wall on
all Hands.</p>
                  <p>The summe of what we have to say in this
is, to make out these four points: <hi>First,</hi> That
there is a Government appointed by Christ in his
Church distinct from the Civil Government. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
We shall show that this Government is not
in the hands of the Civil Magistrate, but in the
hands of Christs own officers, which he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Governing his house, By inflicting of Church
Censures, enacting of Church canons, so as they
are not to act by derived power from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and Appeals are not to be made from them
to the Magistrate. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we shall endeavour to
prove, That this power of Church Government is
not in the hands of private Christians, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the Faithful: but in the hand of Christs
own Officers, Ministers and Elders. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> We
shall endeavour to prove that this Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not in the hand of particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
or particular Elderships, Independently
from other Judicatories above them: but that this
power is given to them, so as they must be subject
to Superior Judicatories. In which propositions we
will meet with these Errors that are most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
opposite to Church Government at this time.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61451:56"/>
The <hi>First</hi> two propositions are contrary to the
Doctrine of <hi>Erastians,</hi> and the last two are contrary
to the Doctrine of <hi>Independents</hi> (as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
designed) <hi>First,</hi> we shall engage with <hi>Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi>
and our Scope in this shall be as in the former,
to show that however it pretend to the Spirit, yet
when it is brought to the tryal it will be found <hi>not
to be of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine or Error hath its name from the
prime Author of it called <hi>Erastus,</hi> a Doctor of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
who upon some discontent did first vent it:
to wit, That Ministers should only meddle with
Preaching; but should have no power to meet in
Church Judicatories, Sessions, Presbyteries, or such
like, nor should they punish Scandalous sins with
Church Censures, Such as Suspension or Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
But that all power whatsoever in a
Nation, both in Church and State, should be in
the hand of the Civil Magistrate. This Doctrine
so soon as it was vented, did get, and does yet get
many followers, chiefly among state Divines, and
Christians that know more of wordly policy
than Christian simplicity, so that in a short time
if God prevent it not, it is like to swallow up all
other Controversies about Church Government, so
plausible and pleasing it is to the powers of the
World, who cannot well endure to have Christ Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besides them. <hi>Psalm: 2. 3. Let us break their
bands assunder, and cast away their cords from us.</hi> Both
<hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi> do aggree in this Error, to
take the power of Discipline out of the Churches
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61451:56"/>
hand's. The spiritual power of Church Censures
in the hands of Christs officers, is an eye sore to both
of them.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer to the point, There are two
heads of this <hi>Erastian</hi> Doctrine which we shall labour
to refute. The <hi>First,</hi> is most gross, whereby they
affirm, That there is no particular Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
set down in Scripture; In a word, that there
is no Government in the Church by divine right;
but that this Government is left in the hands of the
Civil Magistrate, whether to erect any Government
at all in the Church, or not: or if he please to erect
one, That he may establish That Government which
suits best the well-being of the Civil state: So
that according to this Doctrine the Civil Magistrate
may establish <hi>Episcopacy</hi> this year, the next year he
may establish <hi>Presbytry,</hi> and the third year he may
cast both and establish <hi>Independency;</hi> And if he like,
He may find out a Government different from any
of these, and establish it. The <hi>Second Erastian</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
is this, whereby they affirm whatever Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be in the Church (whether grounded in
Scripture or not) that according to Scripture it
is in the hands of the Civil Magistrate and that he is
the chief fountain of Church Government.</p>
                  <p>In opposition to the first Error we lay down this
Conclusion, which (God willing) we shall make
good, <hi>That Jesus Christ the King and head of his Church
hath established a particular form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in his word, which to alter is not in the power of
any State whatsoever.</hi> He hath set down a way for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61451:57"/>
punishing Scandals, for inflicting Church Censures,
Enacting Church canons; And hath not left this
in the Arbitriment of Kings or Parliaments to set
down any Government they please. In prosecuting
which point we shall follow that Method we keeped
in refuting the Doctrine of <hi>Tolleration.</hi> We shall
<hi>First</hi> clear the State of the Question. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We
shall bring Arguments to confirm the Truth. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
We shall Answer these Arguments the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
brings against the Truth: And so we shall apply
all to Use.</p>
                  <p>I. And <hi>First,</hi> for clearing the State of the Question,
take thir two assertions: <hi>First,</hi> we do not affirm that
all the Circumstantials of Church Government is set
down expresly in the word; But only <hi>first,</hi> That all
the substantial parts of Church Government have a
warrand in the word and are therein so fixed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
as they are unalterable by any State what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Circumstantials
that relate to this Government; we say, they are set
down under general Rules, sufficient for the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them: <hi>such as, let all things be done in order
and to edification.</hi> Our <hi>Second</hi> Assertion is, we are not
to enter here to show, what is the particular kind of
Government that is appointed in the word, and
what things falls under the power of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and in what relation they are to handle
them, what are the nature of these Censures, and how
in all these things they differ from the Civil power:
It would take long time to clear these. The thing
we aim at is only, this general: <hi>That Jesus Christ the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61451:57"/>
King of his Church and Lord of his House hath set down
in his word a particular way for Governing of his house
distinct from the Civil, which is not in the power of any
State to alter.</hi> We proceed now to Arguments for
comfirming this Truth.</p>
                  <p>II. The first Argument is this, If so be that under
the Old Testament, there was a particular form of
Church Government different from the Civil, set
down in the word; then there must be also the like
set down under the New; but<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> so it is that there
was a particular way set down under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Governing the Church: Therefore, there
must be the like set down under the new. For
making out this Argument, there are <hi>two</hi> things
we have to clear. The <hi>First</hi> is, That there was
such a Government as this under the Old Testament
warranted by the word. The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be
cleared, is, that therefore and upon the same Reason
there must be also the like under the New. For
proving of the <hi>First,</hi> that there was a particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church different from the Gvern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the state under the Old Testament, We
shall clear two things. <hi>First,</hi> That they had Church
Judicatories different from the Civil Judicatories;
And to prove this we shall cite two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The <hi>First</hi> is, in 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 19. 8, 9, 10. Ye
may read the place at leasure; but there are these
things in it proving that there was a Church Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
distinct from the Civil. <hi>First,</hi> We see that
there is a Judicatory made up of the Church-men
of the Levits and Priests, in verse 8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61451:58"/>
see that the things they judged of were spiritual
matters distinguished from Civil things by calling the
the first sort, <hi>The matters of the Lord,</hi> And the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>Matters of the King,</hi> v. 11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We see
that in this Judicatory a Church-man was Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
in the 11 verse <hi>And behold</hi> Amariah <hi>the chief
Priest is over you.</hi> And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We see that the
sentence of the Court was Execute by Church-men
in the end of the 11 vers‚Äî<hi>Also the</hi> Levits <hi>shall be
officers before you.</hi> All which being laid together,
makes out clearly that under the Old Testament
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>re was a Church Judicatory different from the
Civil. The Second place is in <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> 26. 8. 9. 10
Where we have these things to make out the present
point. <hi>First,</hi> We see that there were two Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
in the 8 v. There is a Judicatory of the
Priests and Prophets condemning <hi>Jeremiah</hi> as a false
Prophet: again in the 10. and 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>. v. We see there
is a Civil Judicatory made up of States-men <hi>When
the Princes of</hi> Judah <hi>hard these things, then they came
up from the Kings house</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. So it is plain they
had a Church Judicatory for Church matters, as
well as a Civil Judicatory for Civil matters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing that we are to speak to in order
to the proving of the first point, to wit, That
there was a Government of the Church different
from that of the State among the <hi>Jews,</hi> is this, that
as they had Church Judicatories different from the
Civil, so they had also Church Censures different
from Civil punishments, as we have amongst us. And
<hi>First,</hi> publick confession of Scandalous sins was in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61451:58"/>
use among them, we shall clear it from one place of
Scripture Ezra 10. 10. 11. <hi>And</hi> Ezra <hi>the Priest stood up,</hi>
and said unto them, <hi>Ye have transgressed‚ÄîNow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make confession unto the Lord God of your Fathers,</hi>
&amp;c. There is confession of sin appointed for a fault
that was Scandalous to wit, their <hi>Marrying with strange
Wives.</hi> Now this confession was not only private
to God, nor on a Fast day, but a personal publick
acknowledgment, after particular Examination of
all one by one. And we gather this from the 13. v.
where it is said‚Äî<hi>Neither is this a work of one day or
two</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. And in the 16. v. <hi>Three moneths was
spent on the business,</hi> so that this was a personal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
given by every one of them, after the
Examination of their guilt, as we do in our Church
Judicatories. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Besides this publick Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had the Censure of suspending Scandalous
men from the Ordinances, as we do suspend from
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; we will find
this in <hi>David</hi> his appointing of the offices of the
Priests. Among the rest it is recorded of <hi>Jehoiadah
2 Chron.</hi> 23. v, 19. <hi>And he set the porters at the gates
of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in
any thing should enter in.</hi> They were suspended from
the Ordinances because of their uncleaness, And for
the neglect of this the Priest's are reproved in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
22 v, 26. <hi>Her Priests have violated my Law, and
have prophaned my Holy things: they have put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the unclean and clean neither between the
Holy and prophane.</hi> They let all come rushing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to the Ordinances: And for this they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61451:59"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They had among them the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Excommunication, which is set down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Cutting off from among the People.</hi> And
in the new Testament it is expressed by the name of
<hi>casting out of the Synagogue,</hi> which certainly was
Excommunication. It is a Ridiculous alledgence that
they say, by <hi>cutting off,</hi> was meaned the inflicting of
Temporal death by the sword of the Magistrate; for
the uncircumcised Man-child, he that had touched a
dead Body and did not wash after it, were to be
cut off; now who would think that such were to be
put to death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be made out is, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there must be a Church Government under the
New Testament, seing it was so under the Old; and
the Reason is, because no necessity can be alleadged
for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>hurch Government then, but the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
is now. Is not the Church a mixed multitude
now, as well as then? is there not as great need
to separate betwixt the precious and the vile now,
as then? Is not the Church now a feild of Wheat and
Tares as well as then? Is there not need to keep
the Ordinances pure now, as then, by the fence of
Government? Is there not need now to suppress
sin as well as then? Is not Christ perfect in all his
House as well as <hi>Moses?</hi> Yea, in a word there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be alleadged for a necessity to have a Church
Government under the Old Testament, but the same
may be brought to prove the necessity of it under
the New.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument we bring to prove this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61451:59"/>
point is taken from the native end of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which is spiritual, to wit‚Äî<hi>For the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Body of Christ:</hi> Ephes: 4. 12. <hi>To gain the
Soul of our offended Brother to Repentence</hi> Matth: 18. 15.
It is‚Äî<hi>that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus. 1 Corinth.</hi> 5, 5. So the end of the Church
Government is a spiritual end, and therefore it must
have a Divine Original: Church Government whose
end is spiritual can be no humane Ordinance, for
such produceth no supernatural effects; therefore
it must have a higher warrand for it than that of the
Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Third</hi> Argument is taken from this, that all
the substantials of Church Government are set down
expresly in Scripture, from which we make this
Argument: That Government whose substantial
parts are all set down expresly in Scripture, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
hath no power to alter it, or put an other
in its place; but so it is that all the substantial parts
of Church Government are set down expresly in
Scripture: Therefore, the Magistrate hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to alter it. The thing we have to make out in
this Argument is this, That all the substantials of
Church Government are set down in Scripture;
And to clear this we shall reckon up <hi>five</hi> things. <hi>First</hi>
That Church officers have their warrand from
Scripture <hi>Thess: 5 12. 1 Tim: 5. 17. Let the Elders
that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they who labour in the word and Doctrine.</hi> There
is a Ruler, or an officer with power to rule, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in Gods house. What they say, That by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61451:60"/>
                     <hi>Ruling</hi> there is meaned <hi>Preaching,</hi> because Ministers
guide People by Preaching, is a frivolous Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that because of what is in the end of the Verse‚Äî
<hi>especially they who labour in the word and Doctrine.</hi>
So labouring, in the word and Doctrine, is one
thing, and <hi>Ruling</hi> is another thing, and not one and
the same, as their Exception affirmeth. But we shall
find a more clear place for it in <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey
them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves</hi>
There are Officers established with power to Rule,
and the People are commanded to submit and give
Obedience to them, and so there are Rulers, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
established in Gods Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The
Courts and Judicatories of the Church have a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
in Gods word; and for this see <hi>Matth: 18. 17,
18. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
Church‚ÄîVerily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind
on Earth shall be bound in Heaven</hi>‚ÄîThe Adversaries
are so shamless that they say, by the <hi>Church</hi> is here
meaned, the Civil Magistrate, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
should be made to them: But it is sure the
Civil Magistrate is not here meaned. And to prove
it, The Judicatory here meaned is that whereof the
Apostles should be Members, and therefore in v, 16.
It is said <hi>whatever ye</hi> [to wit the Apostles] <hi>shall bind
on earth</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. Now sure it is Jesus Christ gives no
power to his Ministers to sit in Civil Courts, and to
judge of Civil business. The <hi>third</hi> substantial of
Church Government that hath warrand in the word
is, the subordination of lesser Judicatories to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61451:60"/>
and this is warranted in <hi>Act:</hi> 15, 2. Where <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> come up from <hi>Antioch,</hi> to a General
Council at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (because the controversie in
hand could not be ended at <hi>Antioch</hi>) where there is
a Court with power, They determine the Question,
Censure the <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> giving them the name of
Lyars v. 24. The <hi>Fourth</hi> substantial of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
set down in Scripture is, the order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in relation to Censure. 1. By private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
Then more pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ick <hi>Matth:</hi> 18. 15. The
<hi>fifth</hi> thing is, The nature and kind of thir Censures,
which are not bodily, as taking<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> way the life; but
spiritual, to wit, Admonitions, reproofs, Casting
out of the Church, <hi>Matth: 18 17‚ÄîLet him he unto
thee as an Heathen and a Publican.</hi> Now from all this,
It evidently appears that Christ hath set down all
the Substantials of Church Government in his word:
And seeing he hath done so, what man dare alter
it, taking any prudential way for the good of the
Church at his pleasure: Yea there is a charge given
to preserve all these inviolable till Christs coming;
1 <hi>Tim: 5. 21. I charge thee before God, and the Lord
Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these
things, without preferring one before another, doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by partiality.</hi> So that which Christ hath set
down concerning the Government of his house is
unalterable by any person whatsomever, till the
coming of Jesus Christ. So much for the third
Argument.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Fourth</hi> and it shall be our last, which is
this, If so be that Christ hath left his House without
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61451:61"/>
any particular Government, only referring it to the
Civil State, to appoint what Government they please<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
it would reflect much on the wisdome of Jesus
Christ; For the Church visible is his Kingdom,
his House, his Vinyard<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> his Garden; And shall we
say that he hath appointed no Laws to Govern no
Courts to guide this Kingdom, but left it to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, to appoint by whom and how it
pleaseth him best: A King of Clay would not do so
with his Kingdom, much less he who is the King
of Glory. This for the Arguments to confirm the
Truth, we shall in the next place Answer their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>III. The <hi>First</hi> is (say they) from 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3, 16. The
word of God is able to make a man perfect; and
therefore there is no need of Government. We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
This same Argument may as well strick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Magistracy. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> We say (which
we made already appear) That the Government of
the Church is grounded on the Word; Hence their
Argument proveth not, because the Government of
the Church is a part of the Word, and is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it; and so it is not an adding to it: But if they
say the bare Preaching of the word is enough; We
Answer, Not to detract any thing from the word
Preached, which is the mean appointed by God to
save Souls, yet the Exercise of Dicipline is necessary
also. It is necessary (we say) for <hi>Three</hi> Reasons. 1.
To keep the Ordinances of God from being polluted
by the rushing foreward of Dogs, and Scandalous
Persons. All the Preaching that can be, to bid
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61451:61"/>
Scandalous men keep back, will not do. Then 2.
It is necessary for keeping the Church from being
infected by the contagion of Scandalous men. Hence
sayeth the Apostle <hi>Paul, a little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump:</hi> Therefore put the incestous man from
among you. 3. It is necessary for the good of the
Soul that is censured: So in the 2 <hi>Thess: 3. 14‚Äî
note that man, and have no company with him, that he
may be ashamed.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. 5. Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
serveth for <hi>the Destruction of the Flesh,</hi> that is,
To tame and mortify its Lusts: And so although the
word be only the necessary mean for the converting
of Souls, yet it doth not follow that the Government
of the Church should not be exercised, to wit, that the
word may work the better.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Objection is this, That all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we have to establish a Church Government
by Divine right are taken from the Churches pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in the Apostles time, and commands given
them; but it does not follow that what was then,
should be a rule now; and they give this as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the difference; because the Magistrate was
then a Pagan, and so would not meddle with these
things; but the case is now otherwise when the
Magistrate is turned Christian. We Answer <hi>First,</hi>
By this it is granted, that Church Government was an
institution of Christ, at least in the primitive times,
Now sure it is that every thing instituted by Christ
layeth on a perpetual obligation, except Christ in his
word hath set a period, that it should be only so long:
So if this Argument of theirs have any force, they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61451:62"/>
must show from Scripture that Christ hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this period for Church Government, so as it
should be only in force under an Idolatrous Pagan
Magistrate: And that the Power of it should cease
under the Christian Magistrate: But no place of
Gods word can be given for the proof of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>is; But
on the contrary a Command is given, That which
Christ delivered to the Apostles, 1 <hi>Timoth. 6. 14
Should be keeped to his second coming,</hi> And therefore it
remains a perpetual Ordinance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That if this were true, then the Case of the
Church should be worse under the Christian than the
Pagan Magistrate; If so be that under the one, they
have an Intrinsecal Power to purge and keep his
Church free from Scandals, but not under the other,
would not this be hard. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We Answer,
That the reasons for which the Church did exercise
Government, in the primitive times, were taken
from common Equity, and so are binding to the
Church at all times. We find this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. Where
a command is given to exercise Discipline by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
of the Incestuous person: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
given are, <hi>First,</hi> The good of the Mans Soul
<hi>verse 5. Secondly,</hi> The good of the Church to be
keeped from Infection, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. Now the Church is
bound to see to these at all times.</p>
                  <p>We come to the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing, which is a word of
<hi>Vse:</hi> And it serves 1. To reprove those who think
debates about the Government of the Church useless
and of no value: To what purpose is it (say they)
what be the Government, and who governs, if sin
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61451:62"/>
be punished, and the Word Preached. I answer'
it is of much moment: For, from what is said it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Church Government is an Ordinance of
God, a part of his word, and they who evert it, or
gives way to the everting of it, give way to evert a
part of the Word of God; yea to the bringing
down of the Government of Christs own House. It
is a point of Truth that concerns no less than the
Royal Diadem of Christ, and all who have got good
of Truth are bound to stand for it; yea it is more
than an ordinary Truth: The question is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and the Civil Magistrate to appoint what Laws,

is a point relating to his Kingdom, a Doctrine to
be avowed, and a point of Truth worth the Sustering

in it, yea it is a point of Truth that hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
beyond other Truths, That Christ hath suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it himself in his own person, for it's clear that
this was the only point he was accused on by <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Use, If so be that Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is an Ordinance of God, then those intrusted
with it, such as Ministers and Elders, would discharge
it as Service to God, so as to be countable to him;

                  <p>A <hi>Third Vse</hi> of this point is, That seeing Church

Magistrate.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Second</hi> Head of <hi>Erastian</hi> Doctrine, which
we are to prove not to be of God, is, That
whereby they affirm, That all the Power
of Church Government is in the Hands of the Civil
Magistrate. And here there are some differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves: some giving him all Power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
all Church Ordinances, and this as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
without a Call from the Church; and so to
Preach and to Administrate the Sacraments: Others
again content themselves to ascribe to him only a
Power of Jurisdiction to make Church Laws, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
Church Censures. And herein they also differ,
some puting this Power wholly in the Hand of the
Magistrate: Others conjunctly with the Ministers;
a third placeth it in him as the fountain, and in
Church-men but as his Deputes; so that they are to
act by vertue of a Commission from him, and meddle
only with these things that he gives them Warrand
for, and so to meddle with them as to be lyable
to an Appeal to him as the supream Judge in all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61451:64"/>
Church matters. We contrary to all these shall make
out this following Assertion: To wit, <hi>That the Civil
Magistrate as a Magistrate hath no Power either to Preach,
or Administrate the Sacraments, nor yet to make Church
Laws, or inflict Church Censures, either by himself or
others as his Deputes; but all this power doth belong wholly
to Church Officers, Ministers, and Elders: Which power
they are to execute without Dependency on the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate;
so that they are not lyable to Appeals to his
Court<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> neither hath he Power to rescind the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In following out of this point, we shall go on as
in the former, we shall <hi>First</hi> clear the state of the
question. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall bring Arguments for
the Truth, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall bring their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against the Truth, and refute them. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
We shall apply the whole to some use.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> For clearing the State of the Question take
this assertion; that however we do not give the Civil
Magistrate Power of Church Discipline, or the power
of governing the Church, yet we give him much
Power about Church matters. Our Divines follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word of God, give the Christian Magistrate
a threefold Power about Church matters. 1. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
protecting Power. 2, A ruling Power. And
3. a Punishing Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> They give him a Defending Power, and
that is grounded on that Promise made to the
Church in <hi>Isa. 49. 23. And Kings shall be thy Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. By this Power the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is to do <hi>three</hi> things. 1. By his Power he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61451:64"/>
is to encourage, countenance, and advance by his
Authority and example the publick exercise of all
Gods Ordinances; and so defend the Church in her
Liberties that are given to her by Christ: This was
the practice of those Godly Kings under the Old
Testament: So did <hi>Asa, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. to verse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>8. and
<hi>Jehoshaphat. 2 Chron.</hi> 1. 8, 9. 10, 11. And other
Godly Kings. They encouraged others in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; they countenanced them, and by their
Authority and example allured others to the practice
of Godliness; which I ower Christian Magistrates have
yet. 2. By this Power they are to provide the Church
with all external Necessaries; as publick convenient
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>aces of meeting for Gods Worship, and publick
Mantainance for the Church Officers,<hi>&amp;c</hi> This we
see was <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s practice 2 <hi>Chron. 31. 4. Moreover,
he commanded the People that dwelt in</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to give
the portion of the Priests, and the Levites, that they
might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord.</hi> And it was
<hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ah</hi>'s practice 2 <hi>Chron. 34. He repaired the House of
the Lord,</hi> The publick place of Gods Worship. 3.
By this defending Power of the Christian Magistrate,
he is to remove all outward Impediments lying in
the way of God's Worship, such as Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Idolatry, Heresy, and Blaspemy, as we did
prove at length in the former Controversy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We give to the Christian Magistrate a
Ruling Power about Church matters: By this Power
1. He may convocate Church Judicatories, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to meet, and to enact Canons, and to
make rules for Governing the Church; although
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61451:65"/>
he cannot make Church Laws himself: So pious
Magistrates under the Old Testament did call Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
as <hi>David 1 Chron.</hi> 23 2. And he <hi>gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the Princes of</hi> Israel, <hi>with the Priests and Levites.</hi>
2. By this Power the Christian Magistrate is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the acts of the Church Judicatories, and to give
the force of a Civil Law: Only herein we differ
from the Papists, They say the Magistrate should do
this blindly, he is only (say they) the Churches Echo
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ay <hi>Amen</hi> to what they conclude: But we say the
Magistrate is not to do this blindly, we allow to him
a judgement of Discretion to try whether what they
conclude be right or not, and accordingly he is to
add his Authority or not; and yet this makes him
not a Judge in Church matters, but only a Judge of
his own Actions. 3. By this Power the Magistrate
is to take Inspection of the Carriage of Church
Judicatories, so that all things be rightly managed
by them; so as if they should conclude a point of
Injustice, though he may not rescind their Act him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
yet he may command them to resume the
the matter, take it to their second Thoughts, give
Reasons to the contrair, exhort them to their Duties
from time to time, until the matter be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:
Only it is still the Church Judicatory that
must rescind their own Act. By this ruling Power
the Magistrate may do much: When the Church is
corrupt he may reform it: That is, when Church
Judicatories are all wrong, that they will do nothing
for his upstirring, In this case the Magistrate may
lay the Church Judicatory aside, and do that himself
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61451:65"/>
which they should do: His Power in this case is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
he may reform by his own Power, as
Godly <hi>Josiah</hi> did 2 <hi>King</hi> 23. And as <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Jehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat.</hi>
At such a time Magistrates may do much
this way: But extraordinary Cases are not to be
made ordinary Rules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We give to the Magistrate a <hi>Coactive</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
power about Church-matters, and by this
power we affirm that all the persons of Church-men,
and their goods are lyable to the Civil Magistrate in
things Civil: According to that, <hi>Let every soul be
subject to the higher powers</hi> (contrary to what the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
teach) so that if a Church-man should commit
a Civil crime, the Magistrate by his own power
may punish him; as <hi>Solomon</hi> did <hi>Abiathar.</hi> 2. By
this coactive punishing power he may see to the
Observation of Divine and Church Laws, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those that are contemners of them by Civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.
There are several examples of this; as
that of <hi>Josiah He made all the People stand to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
Now, by all that is said ye may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that <hi>We give to Caesar that which is</hi> Caesars;
although we give him not what is <hi>Gods:</hi> We give
him much power about the Church, but not the
power of Governing the Church. We shall clear
this by a <hi>simile,</hi> how the Magistrate may have much
power about Church-matters; although not power
of Governing the Church: Ye know the Civil
Magistrate, or Church Sessions, have much power
about matters belonging to husband and wife, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Children, so as to censure and punish them
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61451:66"/>
for their unnatural carriage towards each other, and
to see every one do duty to another; and yet neither
the Civil Magistrate nor Church Session hath Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rital
or Husbandly power over the Wife, or Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
power over the Children so as they might chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the same duties from them, to be done to
themselves, which the Wife oweth to her Husband,
or the Children to the Parents; the Husband and
Parents only have that power: So it is here, The
Magistrate hath much power about Church matters,
but he hath no Church-power properly so called;
that belongeth only to Christs own officers. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
For clearing of the question take this Assertion,
what we deny to the Christian Magistrate in the
power of Governing the Church, we deny it to
him only as a Magistrate; for so we laid it down in
the conclusion to be proved, <hi>A Magistrate as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
hath no power in Governing the Church,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if a Christian Magistrate be chosen an Elder, he
hath power of Church Government, being joyned
with the rest: Only we say as a Magistrate he hath
no power to Govern the Church.</p>
                  <p>II. We come to the <hi>Second</hi> thing which is our
Arguments to confirm the Truth, And the <hi>first</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is this That Jesus Christ hath given no
warrand to the Civil Magistrate for the Government
of his Church, and therefore he hath no right to it. 1,
We say, that Christ in his word hath given no warr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
to the Magistrate for Governing his Church: And
this will appear from all these places where mention
is made of any warrand given to any, of Church
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61451:66"/>
Government; There is no word of the Christian
Magistrate in any of them, only mention is made of
Apostles, Ministers and Elders: so in <hi>Matth:</hi> 16. 19.
The power of Governing the Church <hi>to bind and
loose</hi> is given to <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the rest of the
Apostles, but no word of the Civil Magistrate. And
<hi>Matth:</hi> 18. 17. the power of Excommunication is
given to the Church <hi>and if he shall neglect to hear them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> be</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. The Church of Ministers and Elders
hath the power, but no word of the Civil Magistrate
<hi>And</hi> so in <hi>Timoth:</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> the scope of which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
is to instruct Ministers concerning the right
way of Governing the Church, what is spoken there,
is spoken to them and to Ministers succeeding to
them, but there is no mention of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
And therefore we may conclude he hath no
right from Jesus Christ for Governing the Church:
And what he would challenge of that kind is but an
usurpation and intruding unto that, to which he hath
no right.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>second</hi> Argument is, If the power of the
Church Government belong to a Magistrate as a
Magistrate, then it belongeth to every Magistrate
but this were absurd. We say, if the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the Church did belong to a Magistrate as a
Magistrate<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> then it should belong to every Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
for whatever belongs to one as such, belongs
to all such. Now this hath many absurdities fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
on it; For by this Rule Heathen Magistrates
might have power of Church Government, and be
Church Governours, which were absurd; For they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61451:67"/>
are not Church Members. Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> Women
might be Church Governours, for they may be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
in some cases, and yet they may not speak
in the Church. Yea <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Children not come to age might have the
power of Church Government, for they may be
Magistrates, when Magistracy goeth by succession;
Now Children cannot have the power of Church
Government for that power is not to be Exercised
by deputies, but by the persons themselves who are
intrusted with it.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Argument to confirm the Truth is this,
That Magistrates as Magistrates are not Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
And therefore they have no power to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Church. The consequence is clear, for
if Magistrates have power to Govern the Church,
then they must be Church Officers, if any thing
make a man a Church Officer, then power to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the Church will do it, for State Government
and State Officers are <hi>Relata,</hi> and have a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
one to another, and so must Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Church Officers have a mutual Relation
one to another: But in the next place it is evident,
That a Magistrate as a Magistrate is no Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
and that because among all that roll, set down
in the word of God, wherein Christ reckons up his
Officers, there is no mention made of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
<hi>Ephes:</hi> 4. There is a roll verse 11. <hi>And
he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
and some Pastors, and teachers.</hi> But no word
of the Civil Magistrate: and in <hi>Rom:</hi> 12, 6, 7. There
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61451:67"/>
is an other roll of Church officers, but no word of
of the Civil Magistrate‚Äî<hi>whether prophecy, let us
prophecy according to the proportion of Faith: Or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
let us wait on our Ministering: or he that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
on teaching:</hi> &amp;c. But neither in this place or any
other is there any mention of the Civil Magistrate:
Only some of our Adversaries mutter somewhat
of 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12. 28. That by <hi>Governments</hi> there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
is meaned the Christian Magistrate, but it
is easily refuted, for the text speaketh evidently of
such Governours, as the Church had at that time;
<hi>And God hath set some in the Church</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. Now the
Church at that time had no Christian Magistrate, nor
for above 200 years after. So by <hi>Governments</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be meaned the Christian Magistrate but the
Ruling Elder, who is often spoken of in other
places.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument to prove this point is, That
the Church did enjoy full power of Government
within her self, and accordingly did exercise it,
near 300 years, before any Magistrate was a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and so the Church hath this power within her
self yet. For the first part of the Argument, it is
evident if we consider: <hi>First,</hi> That which is not
controverted, to wit, that in the space of 300 years
after Christ, there was not a Magistrate a Christian:
If we consider, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all this time the
Church had full power of Church Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her self; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> sayes to <hi>Timothy 1
Tim: 4. 14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which
was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61451:68"/>
hands of the Presbytery.</hi> So they had power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Power also to dispence Censures, as Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
1 <hi>Cor: 5. 4, 5‚ÄîWhen ye are gathered
together‚ÄîTo deliver such a one unto</hi> Satan, <hi>for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. And they had power to
relax from Excommunication: So 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2, 6.
Where <hi>Paul</hi> commands to relax the Excommunicate
man from that Sentence, <hi>Sufficient to such a man is this
punishment, which was inflicted of many.</hi> v. 7. <hi>So that
contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
They had Synods meeting together, making
binding Canons to guide the Church. <hi>Act:</hi> 15. The
Synod of Apostles, Elders, and Brethren meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
determine a controversie, and Censure those
who had troubled the Church. Thus the first part
of the Argument is made out, to wit, That the
Church did enjoy full power of Discipline within
her self long before any Magistrate became Christian,
And therefore it followes that this power is yet in
the Churches hand, and not in the Magistrates. And
that because if the Church at that time had right
to dispence this power, as undoubtedly she had, then
they must make it appear how Christ took this
right from her and transferred it to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
which they cannot do.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>fifth</hi> Argument is to obviate that which they
say, That Ministers are but the Magistrates deputes:
From which we argue thus: If Church Officers in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
Censures be the Magistrates deputs, then
whatever the Church Judicatory does the Magistrate
may do it also, for none can delegate more right to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61451:68"/>
ther than what he hath himself: And so by this it
should follow that the Magistrate might ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
himself by imposition of hands, he might Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate;
And if he may do this, by consequence
he might also Preach, Administrate the Sacraments
&amp;c. For what right can be pretended to the one,
which may not be extended to the other; and so
there should be no need of Pastors and Teachers, but
the Magistrate might do all.</p>
                  <p>Our last Argument is taken from the distinction
which the Scripture holdeth out betwixt Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
and Civil power, Scripture condemneth
Church-mens usurping the Civil power, and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
usurping the Church power: Church men are
forbidden to judge or meddle with Civil things by
Christ himself <hi>Luk:</hi> 12. 13, 14. 22 25. And so the
Civil Magistrate may not meddle with Church pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
either: There are two Kings we read of to be
heavily punished for their Transgression in this kind;
<hi>Saul,</hi> for offering a Burnt-offering 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 13. 13.
And <hi>Vzziah,</hi> for burning Incense 2 <hi>Chorn.</hi> 26. 19.
He would go in and burn Incense; And therefore
the Lord smites him with leprosie. And surely Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would say, if it be a sin for Church Officers to
Exercise the Civil Government, then it is a sin for
the Civil Magistrate to take to himself the only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
power of Church Government, and ingross
it wholy to himself.</p>
                  <p>III. We come to the <hi>Third</hi> thing we promised to
speak to, And that was the answering of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
Arguments. The first Argument they bring
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61451:69"/>
against this Truth is, That Godly Magistrates under
the Old Testament had the power of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
And therefore so should Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
have it under the New. Wee Answer,
That their Argument proves nothing, except they
also prove, that what power of Church Government
Magistrates had then, they had it as Magistrates:
For we grant indeed what did belong to Magistrates
as Magistrates under the Old Testament, does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Magistrates under the New; But it may
not be granted, that that which belonged to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
then under other respects, doth belong to
Magistrates yet. For clearing of this, It is to be
observed that there were many Magistrates extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
men under the Old Testament. So <hi>Moses</hi>
gives out Laws and Ordinances for ordering the
Church; But we find in <hi>Deut: 18. 15. Moses</hi> was a
great Prophet and a Type of Christ. <hi>The Lord thy
God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of
thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall
hearken.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> appointed the office of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
that divided their courses; But <hi>David</hi> was a
Prophet 2. <hi>Chron: 8, 14. And he appointed according
to the order of</hi> David <hi>his father, the courses of the
Priests to their service:</hi> Thus in another place it is
shown how <hi>David</hi> did this at the direction of other
Prophets, 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 25. And he set the Levites in
the House of the Lord with Cymbals, with Psalters, and
with Harps, according to the Commandment of</hi> David, <hi>and
of</hi> Gad <hi>the Kings seer, and</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet:</hi> For
so was the Commandment of the Lord by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61451:69"/>
And so from these and such like practices
they can no more infer the Power of the Magistrate
now in Church matters, than we may infer the
Power of Church-men in Civil-matters from the
example of Church-men under the Old-Testament:
For Church-men did meddle with Civil-Matters in
extraordinary Cases: As <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
the State: And <hi>Samuel,</hi> in cutting <hi>Agag</hi> in
pieces. <hi>Elisha</hi> in Anointing <hi>Jehu</hi> to be King: And
<hi>Jeho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ada</hi> the Priest, in causing kill <hi>Attaliah</hi> the Us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urper,
and making <hi>Joash</hi> King. All which we grant
were extraordinary Acts, and so cannot be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rule for Church-men to have such Power in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
things now: And so must they grant concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these extraordinary practices of Civil Judges, in
medling sometimes with Church matters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument they use is this, If so be
that Magistrates were set over Church Officers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Appeals from them, it would make them afraid
to go beyond their Duty: But if they have none
above them, there is danger of their Ambition and
abusing of Discipline. To which we answer, <hi>First,</hi>
Ministers are Men indeed, and as other men, are
ready to abuse their Power; But if the danger of
abusing Power be a good Argument to take Power
from them, then there should be no Power in the
Hands of any: For what kind of Men are there to
be found, who are not in danger to abuse their
Power, and so all must be left in Confusion. We
give a <hi>second</hi> answer, That the same Argument may
be used against the abuse of Preaching the Word,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61451:70"/>
and administrating the Sacraments, For the danger
is as great; and yet the <hi>Erasitans</hi> (the most part of
them at least) will not say that the Magistrate, for
preventing of this abuse, may step into the Pulpit
himself and Preach better, and Administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
better, There is another way to curb that
abuse; and so is it in the matter of Governing the
Church, there is danger indeed of abusing that
Power: but we say in like manner, that for that the
Magistrate may not sit down and take the Power of
Church Government himself: There are other
means left to prevent this danger: Which shall be
our <hi>Third</hi> Answer, Wherein we shall show some of
these means appointed by God for preventing the
abuse of Power in the hands of the Church-Officers:
<hi>First,</hi> There are some Remedies in the Church
Power it self, to wit, The Subordination of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories:
So that although a Congregational Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
should wrest Justice; yet there are above them
<hi>Presbyteries,</hi> and above them <hi>Synods,</hi> and above them
<hi>General Assemblies.</hi> Now it may be conceived that
an Act of Injustice will hardly get through all those,
before it be branded with some deserved mark: But
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Though all Church Officers should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
one at another, and so the Faults of Ministers
go through unpunished, yet there is some remedy
left even in the Civil Power: For although, for the
reasons foresaid, he may not take upon him the
Power of the Church Judicatory under pretence of
Righting their Abuses, no more than he may take
upon him to Preach, for preventing their abuse of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61451:70"/>
Preaching: Yet he may do several things. 1. If
Church Officers commit a civil Crime, he may curb
them by his own Authority. 2. If Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
meddle to judge in Civil things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
a mans Life or Estate, the Magistrate may
make null what they conclude and punish them for
abuse of Power; for therein they medled with what
belonged not unto them. 3. Grant the matter
be meerly Ecclesiastick wherein they abuse their
Power, yet the Magistrate may do somewhat here
also: He may command them to resume the matter,
he may compear in person and reason the matter,
and bid them see to it in the Name of the Lord, and
stir them up to judge it better, and he may go from
one Judicatory to another till he get this done: As
for example, If it be a censure wrongously inflicted;
But yet it is still the Church Judicatory that must
ranverse their own Censure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Argument they use against this Truth
is, If the Power were put in the Hands of the Civil
Magistrate, it would be a mean to decide all the
whole Controversies about Church Government,
which are managed with so much Animosity on
all hands: <hi>Prelates</hi> plead that They should have the
Power of it: <hi>Independents</hi> That particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> That Sessions, Presbyteries,
Synods, General Assemblies, should have the Power
of it, the former being Subordinate to the latter, Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to Presbyteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence ariseth all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates:
Now were not this good to take it from all,
and give it to the Magistrate. We answer. It is a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61451:71"/>
way to end the Difference, such as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to
the two Women striving about the living Child,
<hi>It shall be none of yours,</hi> A way that relished not with
the kindly Mother of the Child, 1 <hi>Kings 3. 25. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
We answer, This Argument may take with
natural Hearts who would buy Peace at any rate;
but not with those who are taught of God <hi>To buy the
Truth and not to sell it;</hi> For it holdeth out a way to end
Controversies, which is not God's: His way is to
establish what is right, and to quite what is wrong:
But this way tends to suppress both right and wrong,
such Peace-makers will not be Blessed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may borrow this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against <hi>Prelates, Independents, Erastians,</hi> and
have better right to it, and so it will run thus: If
Church Government were put in the hands of the
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> It would establish and settle all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the matter of Church Government betwixt
<hi>Prelates, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Erastians:</hi> Now if this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be good when they use it for them, it must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
good when it is used for us: But I doubt if they will
admit of such like reasoning, and so neither can we.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument they use, say they,
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> appealed to the Civil Magistrate <hi>Jerem:</hi> 26.
and so <hi>Paul Act:</hi> 25. He appeals to <hi>Caesar.</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
let that place of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cap. 26. be read, and
nothing will be found to prove that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> makes
any appeal to the Civil Judicatories: But <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Though he had appealed, yet it does not prove that
it is Lawful to appeal to the Magistrate in a Church
business; for the Sentence which the Priests had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61451:71"/>
past on <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was Civil, <hi>Thou shalt surely die,</hi> v. 8.
Now it was the Princes Duty to see to it. That
Innocent <hi>Jeremiah</hi> should not be put to Death, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by those who had no Powet to inflict such a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
As for that instance <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 10, 11. about
<hi>Paul</hi>'s appealing to <hi>Caesar,</hi> it makes nothing to these
purposes; He appeals only from <hi>Festus,</hi> an Inferior
Civil Magistrate to the Superior; And this we are
not against. But <hi>Secondly;</hi> Though <hi>Paul</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
from a Church Judicatory, yet this makes
nothing to confirm their Doctrine: For the cause
here whereabout <hi>Paul</hi> was to be judged, was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
cause, to wit, Treason against <hi>Caesar,</hi> And a thing
worthy of Death. Now we do Teach, that a Church-man
may appeal to a Civil Magistrate, when he is
questioned about his Life<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and for a Civil crime;
But hence it followeth not, That we may appeal
from a Church Judicatory, when the cause is Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
and no wayes civil.</p>
                  <p>Their last Objection is taken from 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 27.
Whereof they make much, The words are, <hi>So</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>thrust out</hi> Abiathar, <hi>from being Priest unto the Lord:</hi>
From which they argue thus: Here is a civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
inflicting a Church Censure, to wit, Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Church-man, to wit, of <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest,
Solomon <hi>thrust out</hi> Abiathar <hi>from being Priest unto the
Lord:</hi> Therefore, Christian Magistrates have Power
to Dispence Church Censures: Yet we answer, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
did nothing here but what we yeild to any
Magistrate, for a civil Magistrate may inflict a civil
Punishment on any person whatsomever for a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61451:72"/>
Crime; and so was the present case: <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s
Fault was Treason, in assisting <hi>Adonijah</hi> to the Crown
against <hi>Solomon,</hi> appointed by God to it. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
The Censure inflicted by <hi>Solomon</hi> was not a Church
Censure, but civil, to wit, Banishment to <hi>Anathoth,</hi>
as appears from <hi>verse</hi> 26. And therefore what is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in <hi>verse 27. He thrust out</hi> Abiathar <hi>from being
Priest unto the Lord,</hi> Is not the Censure directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by <hi>Solomon,</hi> but that which followed upon
his Banishment from <hi>Jerusalem, ipso facto;</hi> because
the Office of the Priests could not be exercised but
at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. In the last place it follows, That we give a
word of use from all we have said. The <hi>First</hi> use,
If so be that Jesus Christ hath appointed a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his House, as is proven, to be exercised by
his own Officers, Then know that those Magistrates
that would ingross this Power to themselves, so as
to have his Courts and Censures depending on them,
or rather taken away, and others put in their place,
do highly incroach on the Regal Power of our King
Jesus Christ. And this seemeth to be the great sin
of the Times, Atheists, prophane Men, plead for it;
as looking for more forbearance to their Lusts from
civil Powers, than from Christs own Courts. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Powers plead for it; They are not content that
Christ let Them reign, and that they let Christ reign
besides them; But they must have him thrust out of
his Throne, and made to plead at their bar; And
so no wonder Christ overturn Kingdoms and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments:
It was the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>'s fault,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61451:72"/>
They feared lest Christs Courts should have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Priviledges; Hence they would not allow
him his Priviledges: They set up indeed a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Christ's House, but it was a Lame one;
They durst not give Christs Courts their full Power,
but so as to be their Deputes: And therefore they
have dashed themselves against that corner-stone
Christ Jesus, until they are struck in pieces, Their
Fear is come upon them. What they feared from
Christs Courts, they have met with at the Hands of
their own Servants: Our Kings have still been afraid
of this, and Malignants also going under the Name
of Royalists; They thought they could not get
Their Throne secure if so be Christ got leave to
reign besides them; And this among many others
hath made their Throne shake. O that Kings would
be wise and kiss the Son, It would be their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to be faithful in what is committed unto them;
But for the Government of his House it is not in their
Charter, and so a thing that will not thrive in their
hands, their prudential Laws and Rules will do no
good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Yee would ground your self in this
Truth; It may cost you much, and though it should
stand you never so much, it is worth the avowing.
Christ himself suffered on this account (as we have
already shown) and others of his servants have
thought it their Glory to be called unto suffering for
it. <hi>Who am I</hi> (saith Master <hi>Welsh</hi>) <q>That he hath
not only called me to be a Preacher of glad things,
but also to be a sufferer for his cause and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61451:73"/>
To wittness that good confession, That
Jesus Christ is the King of Saints, and that his
Church is a most free Kingdom; Yea as free as any
Kingdom under Heaven: That she is free in her
Government from all other Jurisdiction on Earth
except only Christs: We are waiting (saith
he) with joyfulness to leave the last Testimony
of our blood for the confirmation of this Truth;
If it would please our God to be so favourable, as to
honour us with that dignity.</q> Thus He. And
who knowes how soon he may honour some of us
with that dignity: A dignity indeed to suffer for the
Royal Crown and Diadem of Our Lord Jesus.</p>

                  <head>Head I. The Power of Church Government is in the

Church-Members.</head>
                  <p>THE dayes by-past we spake against the
Doctrine of <hi>Erastianism,</hi> And shew you,
that however it had many fair pretences,
yet it is to be reckoned among those Doctrines which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61451:74"/>
                     <hi>are not of God.</hi> We are now, with the Lords as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
to speak against the Doctrine of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi>
Ye Remember when we entered on these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
about Church Government, We shew you
there were <hi>Four</hi> points of Truth which we should
Labour to make good: The <hi>first</hi> was, That
Jesus Christ the head of his Church, had appointed
in his word a way for the Governing and Ruling
of his Church, and that he had not left it to the
power of the Civil Magistrate, King or Parliament,
To establish what way of Government they please.
The <hi>second</hi> point was, That this Government of the
Church which Christ established in his word was
not in the hands of the Civil Magistrate, to be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by him. Thir two points we have made good
in our former Disputs against <hi>Erastianism.</hi> The <hi>third</hi>
point of Truth is this; That Jesus Christ the head
of the Church hath not committed the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
his Church unto the Body of Believers, To
the community of Church Members: but hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
it in the hands of his own officers, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and Elders. The <hi>Fourth</hi> point of Truth which
we promised to prove was this, That Jesus Christ the
head of the Church hath not given particular Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and Church Sessions, the Supream power of
Church Government in their hands, so as that there
should be none above them to call them to an account;
But that they are subject in the Lord to Superior
Church Judicatories; such as Presbytries, Synods,
and General Assemblies. These <hi>two</hi> last points we
are to make out in Refuting this Doctrine of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61451:74"/>
This Error of <hi>Independency</hi> above all other we may
call a fountain Error: It is the Sluce, whereby an
entrance is made to all other Errors of what sort so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
This is the Error whereby the most part of
those that hath fallen from the way of Truth these
years by past, have been first hooked; They first
turned <hi>Independents,</hi> yet rested not long there, but
proceeded from evil to worse. Our scope shall be
in this as in the former points to show, That howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it hath many fair pretences, yet when it is brought
to the Tryal, it will be found <hi>not to be of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are <hi>two</hi> main heads of this Error of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi>
opposit to the <hi>two</hi> last points of Truth,
which we promised to make out. The <hi>first</hi> is,
That whereby they affirm, That Jesus Christ has
given the power of Governing the Church unto all
those that are Members of the Church, Although
they be not Ministers or Elders: To the community
of believers as they call it. The <hi>second</hi> Head of their
Error is this, They do affirm that Jesus Christ hath
intrusted particular Congregations, Elderships, or
Church Sessions with the highest power of Church
Government on earth; so that there is no Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
above them to call them to an account. As for
the <hi>first</hi> Head of their Error which we are to speak
against at this time. Therein they have different
Opinions among themselves; some affirming that
the power of Governing the Church is given to the
Body of Church Members, the community of
Believers, without the Minister and Elders; yea
a power over them to ordain them, Censure, depose
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61451:75"/>
them, and inflict all other Church Censures: Others
give them this power conjunctly with the Church
Officers, Ministers, and Elders. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some
give only the power and Authority to Govern, to
the Church Members; But for the Exercise of that
power, they allow it to the Elders: Yet so as to
the Peoples deputs, to whom they must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
Others give the People not only the power
and Authority, but also the Exercise of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
So that the People may sit down in Church
Judicatories themselves, enact Church Canons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
Church Censures &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some give them
the Exercise of this power only in some things; as
the Excercise of the power of Jurisdiction, to make
Church Canons, and inflict Church Censures;
But not to Preach. Others give them a full Exercise
of Authority to do all.</p>
                  <p>We in opposition to all these, lay down this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
which we shall Labour to make good from
the word of God, and solid Reason; to wit, That
Jesus Christ hath not given to the Body of Church
Members, or to private Christians either the power
or Exercise of Church Government, neither in
whole nor in part, but hath intrusted it wholly to
his own Officers, Ministers, and Elders. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
this point we shall follow forth the former
Method. <hi>First,</hi> We shall clear the State of the
Question. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Bring Arguments for the Truth.
And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall propone and answer their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought against the Truth. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
We shall shall apply the whole to some use.</p>
                  <p>

I. For clearing the state of the Question, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>a
it may be known what we do grant to private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and what we deny, several distinctions would
be given. <hi>First,</hi> There is difference betwixt Church
power or Authority, and Christian priviledges: We
do grant several Christian priviledges to private
Christians, but these do not infer any Church pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or Authority of Governing the Church. As
for Example, We do grant to the People a Power
of Electing their own Officers, Ministers, or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
we grant to them a power to <hi>try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be of God. i: e:</hi> They are not to believe blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what Ministers say, but have a power to Try what
they say in Relation to their practice, To pass a
Judgment of discretion upon it, whether it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word or not. We grant these privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to the People but none of them doth infer any
Church power, which we clear in both. <hi>First,</hi> The
Peoples power in Electing their Minister, doth not
infer any power of Church Government in them,
and that because it is not the Peoples Election or their
choise that makes the Minister to be a Minister, or
gives him Authority to Exercise the Ministerial
calling; but it is the Act of Ordination, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the hands of those who are Church Officers,
that makes the man the Minister, and gives him Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
We shall find this, <hi>Acts</hi> 6, 3. where the
Peoples Election and Ordination by Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
is clearly distinguished. <hi>Wherefore Brethren,</hi>
(say the Apostles) <hi>look ye out among you seven men
of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and wisdom</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61451:76"/>
(there is the Peoples Election) <hi>whom we may appoint
over this busines,</hi> There is the Church Officers part:
Though the People look them out and choise them,
that gives them not the power of their calling untill
the Church Officers appoint and ordain them. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
The power of trying the Spirits</hi> doth not infer
any such power or Authority of Government in the
People, otherwise it should follow that the People
of <hi>Berea,</hi> who did try <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11.
And compared it with the word <hi>whetber those things
were so,</hi> had Authority over <hi>Paul,</hi> which none will
affirm.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> distinction to clear the state of the
Question is this, There is a great difference betwixt
those <hi>to whom</hi> the Authority of Governing the
Church is given, and those <hi>for whom,</hi> or for whose
good it is given: although we deny that the power
of Governing the Church is given to private Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
yet we grant it is given <hi>for them.</hi> So all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
are given for the good of Believers: As it is
<hi>Ephes: 4. 11. And he gave some Apostles, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
aud some Evangilists, and some Pastors, and
Teachers: For the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. and in
this respect 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. 21, 22. all is said to be theirs‚Äî
<hi>For all things are yours, whether</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollos <hi>or</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,
<hi>or the World, or Life, or Death, or things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or things to come, all are yours,</hi> i. e. given for their
good: But hence it will not follow, that because
Church Discipline is given <hi>for them,</hi> that therefore
they have the power of it; for in this respect <hi>Paul</hi>
is given to every particular believing Woman, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61451:76"/>
yet it does not follow that Women have <hi>Pauls</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And so the Body of the particular Church
hath not this power in their hands although the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be given for their good.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> thing for understanding the State of the
Question; We do willingly grant to private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
power to admonish, exhort in the Lord, out of
Charity: and this they may extend even to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<hi>say to</hi> Archippus <hi>take heed to thy Ministry.</hi> But
this Liberty to admonish by way of Charity, doth not
import any Church power in them over those whom
they rebuke, no more than <hi>Pauls</hi> rebuking of
<hi>Peter Gal:</hi> 2. 14. doth infer a power in <hi>Paul</hi> above
<hi>Peter.</hi> So ye see what we do grant to private
Christians; and what we deny: The sum whereof is
this. That Jesus Christ hath not given them any
power of Church Government, or the Exercise of
it, either in whole or in part, but has intrusted it
wholly to his own Officers, Ministers, and Elders.
This for clearing the state of the Question.</p>
                  <p>II. We come now to Arguments for clearing the
Truth, And the <hi>First</hi> is this, That Jesus Christ hath
given no warrand to private Christians for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his House, or for the Exercise of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore they have no right to it. The
consequence must be clear: For none has right to
play the part of a Governour in Christs Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those who have a warrand in his word for it.
Now that private Christians have no warrand in his
word for Governing the Church, either expresly,
or by good consequence, either by precept or promise,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61451:77"/>
or any thing else, it is clear from this that in several
places of the Word this power is denyed unto them:
So <hi>Rom:</hi> 10. they must not exercise the Power of
Preaching for <hi>how shall they Preach except they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>e sent.</hi>
v. 15. Now the whole communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>y of Believers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be sent, besides they have no ability to discharge
this Office, there is but one of a Thousand that can
convince gainsayers: <hi>Is apt to teach,</hi> that is; able to
cut and divide the word aright; and so they have
no power to Preach. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> From this it
will follow that they have no power to Administrate
the Sacraments, for Christ Jesus hath joyned both
these powers in one Commission, He gives no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to any to Aministrate the Sacraments, but those
to whom he gives power also to Preach <hi>Matth 28, 19.
Go ye therefore and teach all nations Baptizing them-</hi>&amp;c.
Power of Preaching, and Administrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
go together. And so seeing the one power
is denyed to them, the other must be denyed also.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> They have no power to ordain Ministers,
or to execute any other act of Church Jurisdiction,
for they have no ability to try Ministers gifts, there
is no precept commanding them to do it, there is no
practice in the New Testament proving that ever
they did it, as shall be more fully cleared in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Arguments they bring for it; And so they
have no right to Govern the Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument for the Truth is this, That
this Doctrine of theirs, whereby they give the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Governing the Church to private Christians,
doth overturn the order established by Jesus Christ
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61451:77"/>
in his House; And therefore they have no right to it:
The consequence none may doubt of; For nothing
appointed by God doth evert the order established
by himself. Now that this Doctrine of theirs,
whereby they put the power of Governing the
Church in the hands of the People, doth evert the
order appointed by Christ is clear; Because his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is, That some be watchmen, some watched over,
some Rulers, some to submit: some Governours,
some to be Governed: some Sheepherds, some the
flock: But if so be that all the Members of the
Church had the power of Governing in their hand,
then all should be overseers, watchmen, Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
and none more than another, If so be that
power to Govern should flow from this, That they
are Church Members; For all are so alike.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Argument we bring for the Truth is
this, That to whomsoever Christ Jesus hath given
warrand for Governing the Church, to those he
gives promises of sutable abilities for discharging of
that great Trust; But so it is, that Jesus Christ hath
not gifted, neither promise to gift every Christian,
nor yet requireth He answerable gifts for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from them: And therefore he hath given them
no warrand for Governing the Church. For the first
part of the Argument, that those to whom he gives
the power of Church Government he doth also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
them sufficient abilities for their Trust, is
clear, For how could it stand with the wisdom of
God to commit the great affairs of his House to
those whom he hath not qualified to that purpose;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61451:78"/>
Besides no instance can be given that ever he trusted
any with those things, but he promised them furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in some measure enabled them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
So when he sendeth forth <hi>Moses, Jeremiah, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
&amp;c. he giveth them furniture; and when he
sendeth out the Apostles he furnishes them for that
End; So John 20. 21, <hi>Then said Jesus to them again
peace be unto you as my Father sent me, even so send I
you.</hi> There is the commission given them: and upon
the back of this in v. 22. <hi>And when he had said this,
he breathed on them;</hi> &amp;c. There is the Furniture:
And so does he to Ministers whom he entrusts with
this power, He promises them Furniture, <hi>Matth;
28, 20‚Äîand lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the World.</hi> There a promise made to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and in them to the Ministers, as appears
from these following words <hi>even unto the end of the
World.</hi> And so these promises could not be fully veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Apostles, who were to die within a little,
but in Ministers their successors, to the Worlds end.
Now it is very evident he hath neither made such
promises to every particular believer, for Governing
the Church; neither doth he perform them unto
them What? Is every believer furnished with that
measure of knowledge, prudence, and wisdom,
that is required for the right managing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of Church Government? Yea, God doth not
require it of them: And so certainly it stands not
with his wisdom to have committed the power
of Church Government to all and every one of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
This for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>third</hi> Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61451:78"/>
Our <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument for the Truth is, If so be
that the power of Governing the Church belongeth
to Church Members, Then it belongeth to them
either as they are gifted for it, and chosen out for
that purpose: And if so, then we have our intent;
For then all are not Church Governours, but only
those who are gifted and chosen, And so, Church
Officers: Or it belongs to them as believers, or
Church Members, and if so, then it Belongs to all,
for every one is a Church Member as well as another,
and every one that hath Faith, is a believer as well
as another, and whatever priviledge floweth from
Faith, belongs to every believer, the meanest as
well as the greatest. So if the right of Church
Government be grounded on Faith and Grace, then
every believer, and none but believers, should have
the right of it, from whence shall follow many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities;
as that Children as well as Parents, the
simple as well as the wise; Women as well as Men,
may Preach, Administrate the Sacraments, lay on
hands in Ordaining the Ministers, sit in Sessions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
Censures, Excommunicate, and what not. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
Then none but believers should have right
to Church Government. So none hath power to
Baptise, Censure &amp;c. But they that have Grace.
And upon this People should have Reason to doubt
whether they be rightly Baptised or not, because
they know not if the Minister who Baptised them
had Grace or not; and if he wanted Grace, he had
no power of Church Government by this Doctrine;
And so no power to Baptise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61451:79"/>
We bring a <hi>Fifth</hi> Argument for the Truth, and
it is this, private Christians are in no place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
acknowledged to be Church Governours, There
are no names nor titles given to them, importing
this power to be in them, as is given to Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
1 <hi>Tim: 5. 17. Let the Elders that rule well, be
counted worthy of double honour</hi> And 1 <hi>Corinth. 12. 28.
And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. But no title of
that kind is given to private Christians; Yea they
are set down plainly under names in opposition to
Governours: As the flock to Overseers. <hi>Acts 20.
28. Take heed tberefore unto your selves and to all the
flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers.</hi>
&amp;c. Yea and are commanded to honour, obey,
submit to their Governours set over them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from them, <hi>Hebr: 13. 17. Obey them that have
the rule over you and submit your selves.</hi> &amp;c. Now it is
strange to imagine, That Christ should have intrusted
them with highest power of Government; And yet
in all the stiles he gives them, there is nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of that power, but much of their Subjection;
Surely he hath not done so with Officers, as we have
shown; And let any discover the Reason of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument for the Truth is this, If so be
that the power of Governing the Church be given
but only to some, then it does not belong to all;
but, so it is that the power of Governing the Church
is only given to some; therefore, not to all Church
Members. The first part of the Argument cannot
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61451:79"/>
be denyed; For the second, That it is only given
to some, see those proofs that limit this power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to some as <hi>Ephes: 4. 11. And he gave some Apostles
and some Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Some</hi> and therefore not all
1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12. 28. (which we cited before) <hi>and God
hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondly,
Prophets, thirdly teachers,</hi> There are but some that he
hath set for Governing his house and therefore not all
and <hi>Heb: 13, 17. Obey them that have the rule over
you, and submit your selves</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tim:</hi> 5. 17. (as is
likewise before cited) There are some then that rule,
to whom the rest ought to submit; And so all are
not Rulers.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Seventh</hi> Argument for clearing the
Truth. And it is this, That power which Jesus
Christ hath not set down rules and limits to order it
by in his word, is not of God; but he hath set down
no Rules how to direct the managing of Church
Power in the hand of Church-Members; therefore
it is not of God. The first part of our Argument,
That whatever Power is appointed of God, he hath
set down Rules how to order it, is very clear; As
we may prove by the Enumeration of lawful Powers:
He hath set down Rules how to Regulate the Power
of a King, that he play not the Tyrant; He hath
set down Rules to Regulate the Power of Masters,
Parents by: So the Power in the Hand of the Church
Officers is regulated, that they <hi>Rule with Diligence,
Rom.</hi> 12. 8. And so through the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus:</hi> But so it is that he hath set down no
Rules to order Church Government by, in the Hands
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61451:80"/>
particular Believers. For in no place of the word
will such Rules be found, <hi>Ye that are the flock govern
the Pastors and feed them, watch over the People of God,
lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> I say there are no such
directions given to private Christians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this pretended Power is <hi>not of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our last Argument for the Truth is, If so be the
Power of governing the Church doth belong to
every Church-member; then every Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is bound in Conscience to attend all Church Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories,
to wait on the deciding of all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
questions: But what inevitable confusion would
follow on this? How long time would it take to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
People about the Circumstances of things?
How tedious would it be to hear every mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the point? And what distractions would it
be to Peoples Callings? This certainly would bring
great confusion; And so such a Power as this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be from God, who is the God of Order. These
are now the Arguments for the Truth.</p>
                  <p>III. In the next place we shall answer their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought against the Truth. The <hi>first</hi> they
use is grounded on <hi>Coloss.</hi> 4. 17. A command There
is given to the Body of Believers in reference to the
Minister, <hi>Say to Archippus, Take heed to the Ministry
which thou hast received in the Lord.</hi> From this they
infer, That People have Power to Censure their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister;
And so have Church Authority. We answer,
They make much of this Argument, and yet it is
little worth: For they build their Power to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon this that they have Power (to <hi>Say</hi>) A poor
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61451:80"/>
reason. So <hi>Matth. 18. 17. Say</hi> to the Church, or <hi>tell
the Church:</hi> It is the same word that is here used;
But to infer from this that one man had Authority
over the Church, were very ridiculous. Surely if
he had commanded a judicial act of Authority, he
would have said <hi>Command and Charge Archippus</hi> with
<hi>all Authority,</hi> as in the like case he speaks to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi>
But as we shew in the state of the question,
private Christians have Power to exhort and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
one another, yea their Pastors; But this doth
not import any Power of Church-Government over
others, else women who are not permitted to speak
in the Church, should have Power of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to make Church Canons, Censure and
Ordain their Ministers; For they are bound to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
and admonish as occasion offers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. A <hi>second</hi> Argument they bring from <hi>Act.</hi> 11.
1. When <hi>Peter</hi> comes up to <hi>Jerusalem, verse</hi> 3. the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Challenge him saying, <hi>Thou wentest in to men uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
and didst eat with them,</hi> and verse 4, <hi>He begins
to clear himself to them, and rehearsed the matter from
the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. And from this they reason thus:
That the Church hath Power to call <hi>Peter</hi> to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
And therefore they have Power to Censure
for Scandals. Its answered <hi>first.</hi> Besides the People,
there were Apostles and Brethren There <hi>verse 1. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
We answer, It doth not follow because <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
purgeth himself of a Scandal unjustly laid upon
him, That therefore they had Power to Censure
him; For every Christian is bound to clear himself
to another Christian of that which he is stumbled
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61451:81"/>
within his carriage; yet one private Christian hath not
Church Power over another to Censure: So <hi>Peter</hi>
was bound to clear himself before any one of them,
and if he had done wrong, to take with it, but
that That one could not be a Church Judicatory
having Power to inflict Censure on <hi>Peter,</hi> our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posits
themselves will grant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. A <hi>Third</hi> Argument they bring against the
Truth, is from <hi>Revel. 2. 14. I have a few things against
thee, because thou hast there them that hold the Doctrine of</hi>
Balaam. The Spirit of God here is wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing to the
Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> And after he hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them for their Doctrine, he reproves them for
not exercising Discipline against these Hereticks,
to wit, <hi>Balaam, Iesabel</hi> and the <hi>Nicolattans.</hi> Now
from this they argue, The whole Church is reproved
here for not executing Discipline against these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
and therefore they had power to do it,
Otherwise they would not have been reproved for
the neglect of it: But that all were reproved, they
prove from <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and its connection with the 14.
say they, these who are commended in the 13. are
rebuked in the 14 <hi>verse, I know thy Works, and where
thou dwellest, even where Sathan's seat is,</hi> &amp;c. But so it
is, that not only the Ministers and Elders, but all the
People, dwelt where Sathan's Seat was: Therefore
they all are reproved <hi>Answer,</hi> It followeth well that
they are all reproved for one fault: But not that they
were accessory to it after one and the same way. It
was the Rulers part judicially to cast out these vile
Hereticks: It was the Peoples part to have stirred up
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61451:81"/>
the Rulers to it: Now because these were neglected on
both hands, both have their own guilt; and so both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for their respective guilt: The People are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for not Mourning to God for the tollerating
such like abominations; and their not stirring up the
Rulers to take course with them: But it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that they were reproved for not sitting down in
the Judicatory and inflicting Censures themselves,
That was the Rulers fault: And therefore we deny
that they are all rebuked for their accession to that
guilt in the same way; And we clear it thus, Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Teachers did not teach against these vile Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
Now there were Women there, and yet surely
they are not rebuked for not Preaching against them,
for They ought to be silent in the Church: So their
fault, as of all other Church Members, was of another
kind, to wit, Their not Mourning nor stirring up
the Officers: And so it followes that it was their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Mourn, stir others up to their Duty, which we
grant. But not to exercise the Power themselves,
for that is not the thing they are reproved for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Objection is grounded on <hi>Mat:
18, 17, If he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
Church: but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be
unto thee as an heathen man and a Publican.</hi> Whence
(say they) the power of Church Censure is in the
hand of the Church; but so it is Church Officers
are never called the Church; Neither can they be so
called without the Body of the People: Therefore
the power of the Church Censures is in the hand of
the Body of the People. Wee Answer, This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61451:82"/>
will make more against them than us, and
that because they grant that neither Women nor
Children have hand in Church Government, but
only professing Men: Now they shall get no place
in Scripture wherein the name of the Church is given
to the Body of the Men Assembled without Women
and Children. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We grant that the name of
the Church is very sparingly given to Officers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the People: Yet we say. 1. 'tis given them
in some places; As for Example <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 22. It is
said of <hi>Paul. When he had landed at</hi> Caesarea, <hi>and gone
up, and saluted the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Now by the Church
here certainly cannot be meaned the body of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>rs
which did amount to many thousands of People
as shall appear from <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. In its own time:
So by the Church must be meaned the Chief men
and Rulers of the Church. For <hi>Paul</hi> having so short
time to stay, he seeing them but at the by, could
not have saluted every one, man by man; and
therefore certainly, it must be the prime men of the
Church. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The name of the Church is
very usualy given to Rulers and Judges whether Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
or Civil, without the People in the Old
Testament, So <hi>Psalm 82, 1. God standeth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the mighty:</hi> The same word rendred there
<hi>Congregation</hi> is rendred the <hi>Church</hi> elsewhere; And
by the <hi>Congregation</hi> there, is meaned the <hi>Judges,</hi> and
not the People: so we find it taken for the Rulers by
comparing <hi>Exod:</hi> 20. 18. 19. with <hi>Deut: 5. 23. 2
Chron:</hi> 1. 3. Where <hi>Solomon</hi> takes up the whole
<hi>Congregation</hi> with him: And yet that <hi>Congregation</hi> is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61451:82"/>
exponed v. 2. to have been <hi>Chief-men and Rulers,</hi> so
that usualy in the Old Testament, the word (Church)
is taken from Rulers. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it must be so
taken in this place also, for in the verse following he
telleth what a Church he meaned by, v, 18, <hi>Verily</hi> I
<hi>say unto you, whatsoever yee shall bind on earth, shall be
bound in Heaven:</hi> &amp;c. Speaking to the Apostles:
So it must be the Church of Rulers who are so called,
because they represent the Church, doing her busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wherein she is concerned.</p>
                  <p>Objection <hi>Fifth,</hi> This were (say they) to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
a yoke of Tyranny over Church Members,
if power be put in the hands of Officers to make Acts
binding to them, and they to have no hand in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Acts themselves. We Answer it is no yoke
of Tyranny to instruct Officers with power to be
<hi>over the People in the Lord:</hi> To Rule them according
to his will; to make use of their power not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
but for edification. And this is all we do
teach. Its true, Church Officers may abuse their
power, but there is no power were it never so good
but coming in mans hand may be wrongly used. But
<hi>secondly,</hi> There is as great danger of Tyranny in the
<hi>Independent</hi> way, and more also, than in this; For
if the major part of the Congregation should enact
what is wrong, and press it on the fewer and better
part; would not that be Tyranny? And surely
there is as great liklyhood of this, as of what they
say, that the Eldership may press unjust Acts upon
the Congregation: And as it is as likly, so it is more
remeedless, for though a Congregation or any in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61451:83"/>
it be wronged by the Elerdership, they have a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Judicatory to complean to, according to our
Doctrine: But if the lesser part of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be wronged and Tyrannized over by the greater,
according to their Doctrine, there is no power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven to right the wrong, to call the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
party to an account: So of all Governments
under Heaven <hi>Independency</hi> is the most Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> VI. The <hi>Sixth</hi> Objection they bring against the
Truth is from <hi>Matth:</hi> 16. 19. Where Christ sayes <hi>I will
give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven: and
whatsoever shall be bound on earth</hi>‚Äî&amp;c. It is agreed on
by both sides, that by the Keys there is meaned, the
power of Governing the Church. Now from this
place they would infer that the Keys are given to the
Body of the People: we shall propone and Answer
<hi>Three</hi> of their Objections, whereby they labour to
prove this consequence: The <hi>first</hi> is this, The Keys
are given to the Church built on the Rock whereof
Christ spake in the preceeding 18, v. But sure it is,
all that are believers are built on this Rock; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the power of the Keys are given unto them.
We Answer, What they say that the power of the
Keyes are given to the Church built on the Rock,
Is said without a ground; For he doth not say <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Church built on a rock do I give the keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> But I give it <hi>to thee Peter:</hi> Sure
none needs to learn our Lord to speak; and this
change of Person is not without a Reason, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>verse,</hi> he says‚Äî<hi>upon this rock I will build my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61451:83"/>
Church.</hi> Now if Christ had meaned to have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Government in the hands of the body of the
Church, he might have as easily said <hi>unto this Church
will I give the keys</hi> &amp;c. But he says not so, but changes
the person, <hi>unto thee</hi> to wit, <hi>Peter will I give the keyes</hi>
Besides this also every believing woman is a part of
this Church built on the rock; And yet according
to their own grant, the power of the Keys is not
given unto them. The <hi>Second</hi> Argument they bring
from this place is this: The power of the Keys is
given to those whom <hi>Peter</hi> did represent: But, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did represent all believers, the body of the Church:
therefore, the power of the Keys is given unto
them. For answer to this, we deny what is affirmed,
that <hi>Peter</hi> in this place doth represent all believers, he
doth but represent the rest of the Apostles, and those
who were to succeed to the Apostes in Preaching the
word and Administrating the Sacraments: And this
we shall make good from other places of Scripture
wherein the grant of this power is renewed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed:
The first place is <hi>John 20. 21. Then said
Iesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my father hath
sent me, even so send I you,</hi> and v, 23; <hi>Whosoevers sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them,</hi> &amp;c. Where it
is clear the above mentioned grant is renewed, and
renewed to the Apostles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represent the Apostles, but all Ministers who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Apostles in Preaching the word and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrating
the Sacraments; As in plain also from
<hi>Matth:</hi> 28. 19, 20. Where ye will find these things
clear. 1. That there is a grant of power by Jesus
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61451:84"/>
Christ unto the Apostles. 2 That this grant is made
there not only to the Apostles but to these who
should succeed to them in Preaching and Baptizing
to the end of the World: For it is said‚Äî<hi>lo I am
with you alway; even unto the end of the World.</hi> And
so from this we retort the Argument on themselves,
That the power of the Keys is given to these whom
<hi>Peter</hi> did represent: But, so it is, <hi>Peter</hi> did represent
the Apostles, and Ministers who were to succeed to
them in Preaching the word &amp;c. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the power of the Keys is given unto them.
They argue <hi>Thirdly</hi> from this place that the grant of
the Keys is of as large extent as <hi>Peters</hi> confession v. 16,
<hi>Thou art Christ the son of the living God.</hi> Now this
Confession belongs to all believers, and so also must
the power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> We Answer, 1. That the
grant of the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> doth belong to all
who hold out <hi>Peters</hi> Confession, hath no ground
but their own Assertion. And 2. We say it is false,
For this Confession belongs to all faithful Women
and Children as well as men, who yet by our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posits
own concession have not the <hi>Power</hi> of the
<hi>Keys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their last Objection is taken from 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. 5.
Where the Apostle commands the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
to Excommunicate the Incestous Person <hi>To deliver
such a one unto Sathan, for the destruction of the flesh,
that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</hi>
Now, say they, this command is given unto all the
Church, because there is no exception, and therefore
not to Elders only; As also the command is as large
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61451:84"/>
as the reproof in v. 2. <hi>And ye are puffed up, and have
not rather mourned,</hi> &amp;c. Now sure it is there were
moe reproved than the Church Officers; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the command belongs to others than these. In
Answering this Argument, we shall first retort it on
themselves, For if so be the Argument hold good it
would follow that Women and Children had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Excommunication; for if the command be to
all without exception, then they are not excepted;
and if the command be given to all to whom the
reproof is given, then it is to them, for doubtless
Women and Children mourned no more than the
men: And so they should have power to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
also: Now this were absurd and against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
And so the two main pillars whereon they
build their Argument, fall to the ground; to wit,
That the command is given to all without exception;
And that it is of a like latitude with the reproof.
But <hi>Secondly,</hi> We Answer to the point, That all
who are acquaint with Scripture know that God
useth to give commands indefinitly to the whole
Church, which he will not have applyed to every
one in the Church but only to those persons to
whom, according to their respective callings, interest,
or relations, the command doth belong: We shall
make this clear from 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 14. 31. Where <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh generally to the Saints at <hi>Corinth: ye may all
Prophecy one by one,</hi> &amp;c. The command is given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly
to all, and yet sure it is not the Apostles mind
that all to whom he writs should do this, but only
they who had abilities and a Call to it; and therefore
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61451:85"/>
he sayes in the preceeding 12, chap. 29. <hi>Are all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?
are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c. So
in 1 <hi>Thess: 5. 13. And to esteem them very highly in
love for their works sake, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this be a duty
lying on all to whom the Epistle is directed, then
the Ministers had been to <hi>esteem highly</hi> to themselves
for their own works sake; For the Epistle is written
to them among the rest; now this were absurd and
so it must be intended for the People. So is it here
the command is given indefinitly to all, yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not to be done by all, but only by some, to
wit, the Church officers, and this appeareth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. He was speaking to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the same case in hand, to wit, the relaxing
of the incestous man from Excommunication, and
sayes he, <hi>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment
which was inflicted of many.</hi> Now he doth not say
<hi>Inflicted of all</hi> (as they would make the words bear) but
<hi>inflicted of many:</hi> Yea (as the learned observe) the
word (<hi>many</hi>) signifieth, The chief ones; It is the
same word that is <hi>Matth: 12. 41‚Äîa greater than</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.
So <hi>Paul</hi> explaines himself, That it was not all
but the chief Ones, to wit, the Rulers, by whom
the Censure was to be inflicted. And this now for
Answering their Objections.</p>
                  <p>IV. In the nixt place we shall come, and apply
the whole purpose to a threefold Use. And the first
is: Seeing this Error, as we have now made evident,
<hi>it is not of God:</hi> I would have you suspecting fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that a Doctrine may be coloured over with;
There is no Error that hath a fairer pretence than
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61451:85"/>
This hath: it is the liberty of the Saints, say they,
should not they judge others; A fair pretence; And
yet it is but the same that <hi>Korah Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>
had, and so we need to stumble the less at it‚Äî<hi>Ye
take too much upon you</hi> (said they) <hi>seing all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
are Holy every one of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb-16.</hi>
3.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Vse</hi> is to private Christians, that ye
would do your duty: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Content your
selves with your duty. And <hi>first</hi> do your duty,
whereof many come short. Doubtless many at the
hearing of this Doctrine will cast off all care, seeing
the care of the Church is laid on the Officers thereof
Ministers and Elders; Nay but as we shew in the
clearing of the State of the Question, although pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Governing the Church be not in the hands of
all believers, yet there is a duty lying on them to
admonish and exhort, even their Ministers, <hi>say to</hi>
Archippus <hi>take heed to thy Ministry.</hi> Yea it is a duty
lying on private Christians, that when your private
Admonition doth not the business, ye are bound
to delate it to the Church: We see this <hi>Matth:</hi> 16.
Where Christs institutes this order v, 16. 1. To
tell thy Brother privatly, and if that will not do,
bring two or three moe Witnesses with thee:
then if that do it not, tell it to the Church: so it is a
duty lying on every Church member to admonish
and rebuke, even their Ministers and Elders; to stir
them up when slack, and when that will not do, to
tell it to others. And we would charge you to
make more conscience of this duty than usually ye
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61451:86"/>
do. A second part of your duty we told you was to
try the spirits in reference to your practice, ye are not
bound to take a Doctrine on trust from Ministers,
tho Apostles, Nay not from Angels‚Äî<hi>Though we, or an
Angel from Heaven Preach any other Gospel unto you,
than that which we have Preached unto you, let him be
accursed. Galat.</hi> 1. 8. And private Christians come
short of this part of their duty also; many seeking
no other Reason of their Faith than what Ministers
Preach, it is a loose ground; For ye are commanded
to <hi>Try the Spirits.</hi> But <hi>Secondly,</hi> As ye would make
Conscience of your duty, so ye would content your
selves with your duty, ye would look on Church
Officers and reverence them; ye are not to say,
what is more in them than in our selves, may we
not be as fit as they, they may erre as well as we:
Grant it be so, yet they are Gods Ordinance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the God of order, and he who reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, reproacheth his ordinance, and breaketh
down the hedge appointed by God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third Vse</hi> is directed to Church Officers,
Those whom the Lord hath instructed with this
power, Ye would make use of it for Edification and
not for destruction, ye should so carry your selves in
your places as not to tempt the People of God to
despise your Office. When the Lords People hear
of an Elder to be a Tipler, or a Swearer, it is a
temptation to them to despise both that Elder and his
Office: Many surely in this are stumbling blocks to
People, As <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons made the People abhorr the
offering of the Lord. The Truth is, it is no great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61451:86"/>
wonder that the Government of the Church be los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weight in the minds of many, if it were but for
this one Reason, that they who are intrusted with
it do not Labour to beautify it; It is looked on by
many as a place of respect and not of Office; If a
man be Richer than his neighbour, he thinks he is
not respected if he be not an Elder; and having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the name he cares for no more: Now, is that the
way either to make People respect thy Person or
thy Office. Let me obtest and charge all of you who
have taken on this Heavenly Calling, as ye will An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
on your hazard to Jesus Christ the chief sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
that ye would study by all means so to walk in it,
as to beautify it, and that so much the more, as the
Devil is Labouring to disgrace it. And this now for
the <hi>First Head</hi> of <hi>Independency.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subsection">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61451:87"/>
                  <head>Head II. The highest Power of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not in Church-Sessions,
or Congregational El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derships.</head>
                  <p>WE come now to the <hi>Second Head,</hi> And
it is, That, for which mainly they are
called <hi>Independents:</hi> The point they
affirm is this, That every particular Church Session
or Congregational Eldership is instructed with the
highest power of Church Government on Earth, so
that there is no power in the Church above them
to call them to an account, when they go wrong,
to rescind any Act once concluded, though it were
never so unjust: They grant that a Synod of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Elders may meet to consult about matters,
but withall affirm, that they have no Ecclesiasticall
power to command in the Lord any Congregation
whatsoever: So that if a man be wronged by a Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
As for instance, if he be unjustly censured (as
it may very readily fall out) he must sit with his
wrong, there is no power to right it till Christ
come in the Clouds: Or if a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
divide, turn Hereticks, run wrong (as many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61451:87"/>
of the <hi>Independent</hi> Congregations doe) there is no
Church power to heal the breach, unless it be by
giving an advice, which they may either follow, or
not follow, as likes them best. We again grant,
That particular Elderships have a power from Jesus
Christ to Exercise Discipline in these things which
concern the Congregation in particular; But as for
other things of more publick concernment, that is
to say, Things that concern other Congregations
as well as them, these ought to be handled by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Judicatory; And that even in those things
of particular concernment, They are lyable to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
and the inspection of the Superior Judicatory;
So that wherein they shall be found wrong, partial, or
Erronious, They may be called to an account.</p>
                  <p>For shewing the fashood of this Error<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as also for
the vindicating of the Government of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that is now so much spoken against,
we shall labour to make out, with the Lords assistance
these <hi>Three</hi> Truths from the word of God. The
<hi>first</hi> it this: That, besides the power of Church
Government that Christ hath given to particular
Elderships, There is also holden forth in his word,
A plat-form or a Copy of the Government of many
Congregations by one Presbytry over them all in
common. The <hi>Second</hi> Truth that we shall make
out is this: That besides the Church Government
that Christ hath established by Presbytries, there is
also holden out in the word greater Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
to wit, Synods made up of Commissioners
from several Presbytries instructed with power of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61451:88"/>
Church Government from Christ also. And <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
We shall labour to make out this Truth, That the
inferior Judicatories are to be Subject to the Superior;
as Sessions to Presbytries, Presbytries to Synods,
Synods to General Assemblies: So that the Superior
judicatories have power over the Inferior in the
Lord, to receive Appeals from them, and complaints
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap> them, to Censure them for Miscarying in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Discipline, and to enact Church Canons
or conclusions binding to them, which Inferior Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories
are bound to obey in the Lord.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="sub-subsection">
                     <head>¬∂I. There is a Platform of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by one common Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
holden out in Scripture.</head>
                     <p>COncerning the State of this Question I only
premit this, That however we have the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name of this <hi>Presbytry</hi> whereabout we
dispute holden out in 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4. 14. Whereby I
might easily show is meaned the <hi>Presbytry</hi> we plead
for<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> yet we shall not dispute about names; Though
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61451:88"/>
the Name were not, yet it is sufficient that the Thing
be in it, And this we shall make good, to wit, That
in Scripture is holden out a pattern of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many Congregations by one common <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry.</hi>
The proof of this point we might instance
almost in all the Churches that were planted in the
Apostles time: As in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> The
Church of <hi>Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonica, Corinth,</hi>
and of <hi>Rome:</hi> We might easily make it appear that
those Churches were not single Congregations, but
Presbyterial Churches, under one common Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But in stead of spending of time in pointing
out this in all these Churches, we shall instance it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Church of Ierusalem;</hi> That by this One ye
may know what to judge of the rest. And first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
we shall labour to make out thir two things.
1. That in that one Church there were many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregations. And 2. That all these particular
Congregations made up but one Church, and was
guided by one common <hi>Presbytry,</hi> and Judicatory, set
over them all in common. Which two being made
out, the point we intend will appear evidently, to
wit, That there was here a Government set over
many Congregations in one common Judicatory;
such as our <hi>Presbytry</hi> is over all the particular Church-Sessions
in the bounds.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing we shall make out is this, That
there were moe Congregations in the Church of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> than one, and this from four grounds. <hi>First,</hi>
From the multitude of Church Members that were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61451:89"/>
in <hi>Jerusalem. Secondly,</hi> From the multitude of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
Teachers, and Elders, that were there, moe
than could get work in one single Congregation.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the diversities of Languages that were
among the People of that Church. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
From the way of their meeting and the place they
resorted to for Gods service.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>first,</hi> For the multitude of Church Members
that was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> If we compare place with place,
we will find that they amounted to many thousands,
and so behooved to be moe than one single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Take a view of some of these places
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. they are numbred to be about <hi>ane hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. there are added
unto them about <hi>three thousand Souls:</hi> and then in v.
47. There is daily Addition of moe and moe‚Äî<hi>the
Lord added unto the Church daily such as should be saved.
Act.</hi> 4. 4. We see yet a greater increase; There are
about <hi>five thousand‚Äîand the nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>ber of the men was
about five thousand,</hi> concerning which five thousand
it is necessarly to be understood that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
presently, excluding the rest of the numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
spoken of, For the last part of the <hi>verse</hi> must be
exponed according to the first part: <hi>Howbeit, many
of them which heard the word believed,</hi> Now certainly
that is meaned of others besides those that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
added; and so this <hi>five thousand</hi> must be a new
number, <hi>Fiftly,</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 14. Besides all these it
is said <hi>And believers were the more added to the Lord,
multitudes both of men and Women.</hi> And <hi>Sixtly,</hi> In
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. 7. And <hi>the word of the Lord increased, and the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61451:89"/>
number of the Disciples multiplied in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>greatly,
and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the
Faith.</hi> They multiplied, and multiplyed greatly;
And these were not only the common People, but
the leaders and <hi>Priests</hi> also, who doubtless would
bring multitudes with them by their example: Now
all these being considered, any understanding man
may easily conceive, that so many thousands, as
these would amount to, behooved to be cast in moe
Congregations than one, and could not be one single
Congregation.</p>
                     <p>Before we proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> ground of our
proof, we shall shew you first what they say against
this: There are <hi>three</hi> things mainly they object: And
the <hi>first</hi> is, That the most part of those who were
converted by the Apostles were strangers, who had
not their dwelling at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and so did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Members of that Church: And for this they
cite <hi>Act:</hi> 2. 8, 9. Where it is reckoned that among
the number of the hearers, there were Parthians, <hi>and</hi>
Medes, <hi>and</hi> Elamits, <hi>and the dwellers in</hi> Mesopotamia,
&amp;c. To this we Answer that though those men
came out of those far Countries being Godly men,
who come in Expectation of the Messias his coming,
who was then expected; yet they were dwellers in
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> for that time, and for this see <hi>Act: 2. 5.
And there were dwelling at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>Jews, devout
men, out of every nation under Heaven.</hi> So they had
taken up house and were dwelling there: And in v,
14. Where <hi>Peter</hi> began his Preaching he sayes‚Äî<hi>Ye
men of</hi> Judea, <hi>and all ye that dwell at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61451:90"/>
this known unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We answer,
dwell where they please, They were Members of
this Church at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> And this appears from
several things that are ascribed to them by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, which cannot be spoken of any but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Church: So in <hi>verse</hi> 47. it is said‚Äî
<hi>And the Lord added them unto the Church daily. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
In <hi>verse 46. They continued daily with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in the Temple, and breaking Bread from house to
house,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In <hi>verse 45. They sold their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
and gave their Goods into the Church Treasury,
for the help of the poor.</hi> And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We find in
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5. That they all joyned in choosing the
Deacons and Officers of the Church. Now sure
these are Actions that belong to none but Church-Members.
This for their First Objection.</p>
                     <p>Their second Objection is this, say they, The
Holy Ghost sayeth expresly, that they did meet all
<hi>at one place,</hi> as if it were on purpose to evince our
Argument, and that the whole multitude did come
<hi>together,</hi> As for instance <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1. it is said, <hi>They
were all with one accord in one place,</hi> and in the same
Chapter <hi>verse 46. They continuing daily with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in the Temple,</hi> &amp;c. And it is also said, <hi>Act. 6. 2.
Then the twelve called the multitude of the Disciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>verse 5. And the saying pleased the
whole multitude.</hi> Now to take off this exception
which seems to be the most plausible of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections:
First, Consider what we spoke from the
Scripture of their number, and what thousands
were in this Church: And let any reasonable man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61451:90"/>
conceive how it could be possible that all those
should meet in one place; And therefore that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in one place must be taken in another sense: It's
observed by the Learned, That the word here turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>meeting together in one place,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> doth
not always signify a meeting together in one room,
but the agreeing of the Affection and Judgement in
one thing: And for the clearing of this they cite,
<hi>Act. 4. 25, 26‚ÄîWhy did the Heathen rage, and the
People imagine vain things? The Kings of the earth stood
up, and the Rulers were gathered together against the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is the same word that is there
turned (in one place) which is here turned (gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together) and certainly no place of Scripture
will prove that <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
did all meet in one place to consult about the
Death of Christ: But only they agreed in one Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hearty Affection about it: And so the
meaning may well be taken thus, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>is other place.
But yet to speak to these places further: For <hi>Act. 2.
1. That they were all with one accord in one place,</hi> It
makes nothing against our Argument: For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was not then so great, as we shew it grew
afterwards, and so they might well meet in one
place. The same answer we give to that in <hi>verse
46. They continuing daily with one accord in the Temple.</hi>
They were not then come to the full number that
afterward they came to: So that although they
might all have continued in the Temple at that
time, yet afterwards they could not. And <hi>Secondly,</hi>
We answer; It doth not prove the point they bring
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61451:91"/>
it for, It is only mentioned They came to the
Temple to hear the Word, but not that they were
all of one Congregation, partaking of all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in one place; For it is said afterwards, <hi>They
brake Bread from House to House,</hi> meaning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper, which they did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of from House to House in their particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations:
So that place makes more against our
Opposits than against us: For the other place in <hi>Act.</hi>
6. 5. When the Apostles and Believers were come
to a greater extent, yet the Apostles call the whole
multitude to them, and it is said, <hi>The saying pleased
the whole multitude.</hi> To this we answer, by the
<hi>whole multitude</hi> cannot be meaned all before spoken
of: And therefore we say, by the <hi>whole Multitude,</hi>
is meaned a <hi>great Multitude:</hi> as in that of <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 37.
Where it is said, <hi>That the whole multitude of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of the</hi> Gadarens <hi>round about,</hi> &amp;c. It is
not to be imagined that Man and Mother-Son,
or every Individual Person came out to meet Christ,
but only a great Multitude; or otherwise the whole
multitude may be taken, for the whole multitude of
those that were present, as <hi>Luke 1. 10. And the
whole multitude of the people were praying without,</hi>
when <hi>Zacharias</hi> was offering Incense. Now this
must not be understood that all the multitude of the
People of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was there, but only of the
whole multitude that was present. This for their
second Objection.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>third</hi> Objection is this: Though it be
granted that the number of Believers was such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61451:91"/>
the persecution that fell out, <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 1. Yet
when that Persecution came, there were no more
left than might meet in a single Congregation, for
the Text faith, <hi>They were all scattered abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the region of</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>except the Apostles,</hi>
To this we answer, That if it be granted that there
were moe Congregations before this Persecution;
then it makes out the point we are to prove. But
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither do we yeild that which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That by the persecution mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1.
The multitude was brought to such a few number,
as they could make up but one Congregation; It is
said indeed, <hi>They were all scattered except the Apostles:</hi>
But by this (all) is not meaned all the Professors,
but all the Preachers, and there are several reasons
to prove it; For it is said, Saul <hi>made havock of the
Church,</hi> verse 3. Now if he had meaned that all the
Professors were scattered, where should <hi>Saul</hi> have
gotten Men and Women to hail to Prison; and
that this was done in <hi>Jerusalem, Paul</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 10. A <hi>second</hi> thing to prove that
this (<hi>all</hi>) that was scattered, was the (<hi>all</hi>) of the
Preachers and not of the Professors, is that in <hi>verse</hi> 4.
where it is said, <hi>They were scatered abroad, every
where Preaching the Word,</hi> So that it astricts the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
mainly to those who were Preachers: For
certainly the whole multitude could not have gone
to Preach the Word. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apostles
remain still at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as appears from the first <hi>verse,</hi>
Now to what end and purpose should the Apostles
have stayed there behind the rest, except there had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61451:92"/>
been several Flocks there, with whom they stayed
with the hazard of their Lives to confort them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Persecution, which had driven their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from them. But a second answer is, That however
they had been so scattered in the beginning of the
Persecution, that there was no more of them than
made up a single Congregation; yet in process of
time they so multiplyed, that they behooved to
make up many Congregations: And for this ye
may find out several places, as <hi>Act. 9. 31. They were
multiplied,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 24. speaking of <hi>Jerusalem,
The word of God grew and multiplied.</hi> But we shall
take one place for all, In <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20. where the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
relate to <hi>Paul</hi> the exception that the People had
taken at him for his going to the Gentiles‚Äî <hi>Thou
seest, Brother, how many thousands of</hi> Jews <hi>there are
which believe,</hi> &amp;c. Now the word rendered <hi>thousands</hi>
in the <hi>Greek</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> which signifies Ten
Thousands; so there were not only Thousands, but
Ten Thousands; yea, and many <hi>ten thousands</hi>
there; And so moe than could be Edified in
one single Congregation. And that these were of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is clear from <hi>verse 21. They are
informed of thee,</hi> &amp;c. And from <hi>verse 22.‚Äîthe
multitude must needs come together,</hi> &amp;c. Now this
is from the first ground of our Proof.</p>
                     <p>2. The second ground from whence we are to prove,
That there were moe Congregations in the Church
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> than one, is taken from the multitude
of Christs Officers; That there were so many that
it had been a shame for them all to wait upon one
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61451:92"/>
flock: We find the Apostles were there, as in
<hi>Act.</hi> 6. 15. about the choosing of the Deacons: We
find they were also there in <hi>Acts 15. v.</hi> 6. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Apostles we find there were other Church-Officers
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as in <hi>Acts 11. verse</hi> last. There
were Elders there, where he is speaking of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
as it appears in <hi>verse</hi> 27. Besides there were Prophets
in it, as in <hi>verse</hi> 27. of the same Chapter, <hi>And in
these aayes came Prophets from</hi> Jerusalem <hi>unto</hi> Antioch.
And it is the Judgement of several Interpreters,
that the seventy Disciples whom Christ sent out to
Preach, were still at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> And that they were
of the number of these <hi>hundred and twenty</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15. Now let any man consider if it
was likely, especially when the Harvest was so great,
That so many of the Apostles should be ordinary
Hearers of the Word, and only one but to speak;
especially when we consider, That when Christ sent
out the twelve Disciples only, he sent them not out
all together, but two by two; and so certainly a wise
man may well conclude, That there behooved to be
moe Congregations there than one, yea many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.
This is for the second ground of our
proof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> ground is taken from the multitude of
Languages that were in <hi>Jerusalem, Act. 2. 5, 8, 9. 10.
11.</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 6. Which diversity did necessitate them
to enjoy the Ordinances in divers distinct Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in their own Language; And that it might
be so, the Spirit furnished the Apostles with diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Languages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61451:93"/>
The fourth ground to prove this point is taken
from the way of their Meeting, which was not in
void capacious Rooms built for the purpose, as we
now have; for they had not then the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
for them, to allow places of meeting for the
purpose; but only in private Houses, upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Houses allowed to them by private Christians;
as <hi>Act:</hi> 2. 46. And surely it cannot be conceived that
their Houses could contain so many thousands; and
therefore of necessity they could not meet all in one
Congregation.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have made out the first point, That
there were moe Congregations than one in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
We might prove the like in the other Churches of
<hi>Ephesus, Antioch, Corinth, Rome, Thessalonica,</hi> that
there were moe Congregations than one there also:
And that from the multitude of Believers the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
speaks of, the multitude of Preachers, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Languages; But for brevities cause we pass
to the other point, which is the second thing we
have to make out, and it is this.</p>
                     <p>II. That all these Congregations in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
were under one Government, there was one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Judicatory that Ruled them all in common, As
our Presbytry is over all the Congregations within
its bounds: And for clearing of this we lay down
<hi>three</hi> things. The <hi>First</hi> is that although there were
many particular Congregations at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet they
are called but one Church: so in several places they
are called <hi>the Church, Act:</hi> 8. 1. 15. 4. &amp;c. And
by the way this refutes one of the <hi>Independent</hi> tenets,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61451:93"/>
whereby they affirm: That the name of <hi>Church</hi> is
never given under the New Testament, but to
those who meet ordinarly in one place, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of all parts of Gods Worship. But to the
Argument, For what reason could they be called
one Church? Not because they met together in one
place for the Ministration of the word, Sacraments
and Prayer; For those were dispensed to them in
their singular Congregations severally, and so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are called one Church; because they were
under one Government, one Eldership above them
to Govern them: As the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one Church, because all her Congregations are
Governed by one General Assembly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We add to the former, In this one
Church, made up of many Churches we find there
are Ruling Elders; so we find in <hi>Act:</hi> 15. 4.
and <hi>Act: 21. 15, 18. And when they were come to</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
<hi>they were received of the Church, and of the
Apostles and Elders,</hi> &amp;c. Now they are not called the
Elders of a particular flock at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but the
Elders of the Church; and therefore did meet in
one Common Judicatory. The force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be spoken against by our Opposits,
who prove their particular Elderships from the same
ground as in <hi>Act:</hi> 20. 28. mentioning of the Elders
of the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> From whence they Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus: <hi>Ephesus</hi> was a particular Congregation,
we read there were Elders in this Church, therefore
there was an Eldership who met together for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
that Church in common. They must give
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61451:94"/>
us liberty to Reason that same way thus, We find
at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was a Church made up of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches, we find Elders in this Church;
Therefore there was an Eldership who met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Governing of this Church or these Churches
in common.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to make this Argument yet stronger,
not only there are Elders in this Church, but we
find they meet together for Acts of Jurisdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the whole Church in Common. For
proof of this see <hi>Act:</hi> 11, 30. The contribution that
is gathered for supply of the Saints is sent to the
Elders: Now what the Elders should do with it,
may be gathered from a place like it <hi>Act:</hi> 4. 35. 37.
where it is said: <hi>They sold their possessions and laid
down the price at the Apostles feet. And distribution
was made unto every man, according as he had need.</hi>
So doubtless the contribution was given to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
for this end that they might have distributed
the same to the poor in the whole Church; And
so it was an Act of Government tending to the good
of the Church. Further we find this more clear <hi>Act:
21.</hi> 18. They meet together, and Judicially set
down a way to <hi>Paul</hi> for removing of a Church
Scandal, by satisfying the offended, and purifying
himself after the manner of the Jews, In v, 23. <hi>Do
therefore this,</hi> &amp;c. So we see their Elderships meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together for removing a Scandal. We find a
<hi>Third</hi> place to confirm this; <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. 4, We
shall afterward make use of the whole Chapter
to prove the power of <hi>Synods;</hi> only this much at
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61451:94"/>
present to the purpose in hand. We find the Elders
met, and make binding Acts to the Churches under
them. So we have made out the first point, That
there is a Government of many Congregations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Presbytry holden out in the Word.</p>
                     <p>The main thing our Opposits flee to at the last is
this; That granting it to be true, That there were
many Congregations in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in <hi>Act:</hi> 8. And that they had one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above them; yet that doth not infer a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>Presbytry;</hi> For they were Governed by the
Apostles; We read not of any Elders in that Church
before the Dispersion, at which time they were
brought to so few a number, that they might all
meet in one place: So that though there was one
common Government then, by Elders; It inferrs
not a Presbytry but a Congregational Eldership on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This is the sum of all that is said to this. For
Answer, They grant to us, That after the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there was a common Eldership over the Church
of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have proved that
there were moe Congregations than One there, even
after the Dispersion: And we have also proved that
they had Elders over them in common; so that
whatever was before the Dispersion, yet even from
their own concession it followeth, That there was
a Presbyterial Government in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion.
<hi>Secondly</hi> we answer, They can hardly prove
that there were no Elders in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before the
Dispersion: Its true we read not of Elders until <hi>Act.
11.</hi> But when they were first instituted, we read not.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61451:95"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We answer, That though there were not
Elders to govern them in common, yet it is enough
for us that the Apostles did govern them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
for they were also Elders: So they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
2 <hi>John</hi> ver. 1. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 1. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> As
they were Elders, so what they did in these Acts of
Government, they did it as Elders: For what they
did as Apostles is not imitable now, but what they
did in Governing the Church is imitable, such as
Ordaining of Officers, Distributing of Alms. Again,
What they did as Apostles, one of them might do it
alone; But here they do it <hi>in Collegio, Act.</hi> 6. And
reserve the Peoples part of Election to them. Now
they never met together to write Scripture; nor
sought the Peoples concurrence for any Act meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostolick; so it is clear the Church was govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them as Elders; And so the Churches even
then were under one common Eldership. And this
now for the first thing we promised to make out, to
wit, That the Scripture holdeth out a pattern of the
Government of many Congregations by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Presbytery.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="sub-subsection">
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:61451:95"/>
                     <head>¬∂ II. There is a Plat-form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Synods over many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Presbyteries holden
forth in Scripture.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Second</hi> thing we promised to make out
is this, That as the Scripture holdeth forth
the Power of Presbyteries, so also the
Power of a Synod; by which we mean Church Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories
above Presbyteries, as they are above Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
or Congregational Elderships.</p>
                     <p>I. For understanding the Question, These Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
or greater Meetings of Church Officers, are
of three sorts: Some made up of several Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and these are Provincial Synods, (such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
we have twice a year) Or they are made up
of several Synods within a Nation; and these are
General Assemblies. Or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They are made
up of several Churches of several Nations, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
from them; and these are called Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Councils, or General Synods of the Christian
World. Now all these differ from Presbyteries,
not only in this. That they are more ample; but
also in this, That the Government by Presbyteries
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61451:96"/>
is the common ordinary way of Government held
out in Scripture: But Synods for the most part are
more rare, and upon particular emergent; as <hi>Act.
15.</hi> That Synod was called upon an occasion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which troubled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches about.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> All these kinds of greater Synods, The
Provincial Synod, and the Synod of a Nation, and
the Universal Councils, do not differ in Nature and
kind, but only in less and more; Wherefore it is
not needful that we hold out every one of them from
Scripture, It is sufficient that we hold out the Power
of Synods in the general, which is to be applyed to
every kind in particular: For so we find it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in other things. Particulars are infinite; and
therefore in things of one and the same kind Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rules are sufficient; Or a Rule for one particular,
which keeping the just proportion, is to be applyed
to other particulars of the same kind, As <hi>Matth:</hi> 18.
Christ sets down the way of walking in private
Scandals, speaking nothing of publick Scandals:
Not as if Jesus Christ did mean that publick Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
should be passed over, but that the same Rule
may serve for these, keeping the just proportion:
Even so is it here; If the nature of Synods be held
out in the Word, that is enough, though it speak
nothing of the bounds to which they should extend,
whether of One Province, or of All the Provinces
of a Nation; no more than it is particularly set
down in Scripture, what should be the number and
bounds of a particular Congregation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61451:96"/>
There is a <hi>Third</hi> thing for clearing of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
The <hi>Independents</hi> and we agree in this, That
the word gives ground for meeting of Synods; only
we differ about their Power: They grant that in
case of Division or Scandal, Synods may meet and
give their Advice in Matters doubtful; only they say,
that Synods have no Power of Jurisdiction to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
others in the Lord to embrace their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
We on the other hand maintain that they
have this Power, and that the Scripture holdeth out
such a Power belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>II. We might instance this in <hi>Act:</hi> 1, In the
choice of <hi>Matthias,</hi> which was done by no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church; For here were the Apostles, whose
Paroch-Church was the whole world: Here were
the Brethren of Christ from <hi>Galilie</hi> v, 14. Some
from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> v. 15. This meeting did a Church
business of common concernment to the whole
Christian World, and so behooved to be done by
those who did represent them, And therefore this
behooved to be a General Council.</p>
                     <p>But to clear the point more fully, we shall take
<hi>Act:</hi> 15. Where this Synod we plead for is held forth
clearly: The History is plain: A difference ariseth
in <hi>Antioch</hi> about Circumcision, This cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in <hi>Antioch</hi> it self; so they send up Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to determine this matter, where
there is a Synod of Apostles and Elders, and they
determine the Question. Now that it may appear
the Synod we plead for is here; consider <hi>first,</hi> That
there was a Church meeting or Judicatory here;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61451:97"/>
None may doubt of this, as is clear v, 6. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Consider, That this Judicatory is made up of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
from the several Presbyteries, we see that
Commissioners from the Presbytry of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was
there v, 6. And Commissioners from the Presbytry
of <hi>Antioch</hi> Act: 15. 2 <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others.
Now that these were Commissioners, and had voice
appears from <hi>Act:</hi> 16. 4. where the decree that was
then made was ascrived to all the Elders who were
present. It is very likely that there were other
Commissioners there also from <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia;</hi> For
they are joyned with <hi>Antioch</hi> in the Letter v. 23. For
what other Reason cannot be imagined, except that
as they were alike troubled with the Heresy as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
was, so they had their Commissioners there as
<hi>Antioch</hi> had, And therefore these Acts are binding to
them in a special manner, However it is clear that
there were Commissioners from the Presbytry of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
and of <hi>Antioch,</hi> so the meeting was made
up of two Presbytries; And by the same rule it may
be made up of moe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would consider that this meeting
made up of Commissioners from several Presbytries
makes binding Acts unto other absent Churches, who
were present only in their Commissioners; And
there are several things to clear this: <hi>First,</hi> They
determine the Question in v, 19. 20 <hi>Secondly,</hi>
They impose Their determination on the Churches
to be keeped by them: So in the Letters They wrote
to the Church of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> v, 28. The word
that is turned there a <hi>Burthen,</hi> signifies <hi>a Law</hi> or <hi>a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61451:97"/>
Decree,</hi> and so we find it in <hi>Act:</hi> 16. 4. There their
<hi>Conclusions</hi> are called <hi>Decrees which were ordained of
the Apostles and El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>ers at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>And which were to
be keeped:</hi> From all which it is clear They did make
Acts binding other Congregations. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We
find they put forth an Act of Censure on the false
Prophets v, 24. They called them <hi>Lyars,</hi> A brand
of Infamy. It's true They Censured them not with
Excommunication, For it was time enough to doe
That, when they knew they were become incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly
obstinate, according to the common Rule, <hi>An
Heretick after the first and second Admonition reject.</hi> By
this I hope, ye perceive clearly a pattern for greater
Synods, a Judicatory made up of Commissioners
from several Presbytries; and these making bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Laws to other Churches, who were absent in
their Persons, and only present in their Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</p>
                     <p>III. Their main Objection against this is, That
the Apostles were here, who were guided with an
infallible Spirit to determine; and so this can be no
Rule for our Synods, made up of men wanting that
assistance. To this we Answer, that this if it prove
any thing will make against our Opposits themselves
as well as against us; For they hold that here is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of a Synod for advice, so if their Argument
hold against Us in the One, It must hold also against
Them in the Other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shew before
that the Apostles were also Elders, and sometimes
Acted as Elders; Now if it can be proven that they
Acted as Elders here, it breaks the strength of their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61451:98"/>
Objection. But this is clear, <hi>First, Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
are sent by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> They wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
submit <hi>Act:</hi> 15. 4 Now in their Apostolick
Office they were not directed by me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>, And so
surely here they acted not as Apostles. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
The Apostles all along go not on that way, as
when guided by an infallible Apostolick Spirit;
For they state the Question, and debate it in v, 7.
Now when they write Scripture, they do not use
advice, nor do they debate what they shall conclude,
but speake all as immediatly inspired; But here
they debate. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>aving found Truth, By force of
Reason they conclude, as any other Assembly, upon
like assurance of Scripture warrand, may do, <hi>It seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good unto Vs being Assembled with one accord,</hi> &amp;c.
In v, 25. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Apostles did determine
any thing as Apostles, and were guided by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
inspiring Spirit of God, then they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Question fully that nothing needed to be
added: But so it was not here, For <hi>Peter</hi> v, <hi>6th</hi>
gives his Judgment, That Believers were freed from
the Ceremonial Law: What he saith is true indeed;
Yet it speaketh not fully to the point, untill <hi>James</hi>
addeth somewhat, to wit, That however the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils
were freed from the Ceremonial Law, yet to
eschew the Scandal of the weak Jews, They were to
abstain from things strangled &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> v, 20. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
They Acted not as Apostles, except we would
say, that <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apostle intending to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a Controversie, yet did not speak fully to the
point, which were an injury to that immediately
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61451:98"/>
inspiring Spirit, by which they were acted in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Scripture, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the decrees of the
Synod are put forth in the name and by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
not only of the Apostles, but Elders also, <hi>Act:
15. 22. 23. Act. 16. 4. Act.</hi> 21. 25. Now surely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Elders did never concurr with the Apostles
in Acts of their Apostolick office; As penning Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
&amp;c. From all that is said, it is most clear, that
the Apostles here acted as Elders, leaving a Pattern
for such like Judicatories upon the like occasions, to
the end of the World: Which is the <hi>Second</hi> Point.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="sub-subsection">
                     <head>¬∂ III. Inferior Church Judicatories are
Subject to Superiour.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Third</hi> point we have to make out is this:
That Inferior Church Judicatories are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to the Superior, as Sessions or
Congregational Elderships to Presbytries, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the greater have power
of Government over the lesser: For receiving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
from them, Complaints of them, Enacting of
Church Canons; unto which the Inferior ought to
be subject in the Lord. The point in short is, That
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61451:99"/>
particular Elderships are not Independent, so as to do
what they please, without being accountable to any
Judicatory above them; But Presbyteries are over
them in the Lord. We shall follow the former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<hi>First,</hi> To clear the Question. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To
bring Arguments for the Truth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To
answer Arguments against the Truth. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To
apply it to Use.</p>
                     <p>I. For the <hi>First,</hi> We allow unto particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
an Eldership and Power of Discipline
within themselves, to judge of these things that are
of their particular concernment: But as for things
wherein other Congregations are concerned with
them, We hold that such do belong to Superiour
Judicatories according to the Rule, <hi>What belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all should be handled by all. Secondly,</hi> We do not
give Power to any one single Congregation above
another: We say, That all Congregations (the least
as well as the greatest is equal in Power; This way
was the Bishops Tyranny, that made all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
of the Diocess subject to the Cathedral
Church, the Parish where the Bishop lived: So that
all others were to subject themselves to it, and the
great Lord Bishops Laws which he gave out in it.
We do only say, That all particular Congregations
should be subject to a Presbytery, made up of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
taken from among themselves, wherein no
Congregation can challenge Power more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The meanest hath as great Power in them as
the greatest. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We do not say that the Power
of Presbyteries or Synods are absolute, so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61451:99"/>
they conclude should stand for a Law; or that
they ought to be obeyed in every thing. We affirme
Their Power is a limited and Ministerial Power, It
is a Power <hi>in the Lord;</hi> So that put the case, If a
Presbytery or Synod should conclude a thing that is
wrong, They are not to be followed blindly. We
allow to every particular Christian a Judgement of
Discretion, whereby they should compare the Acts
of Church Judicatories, with the Rule of the Word,
and accordingly either to choice or refuse: Only
herein we say, <hi>First,</hi> That particular Christians
should have a kind of loathness to differ from the
Judicatories of the Church, arising from a secret
kind of diffidence and distrust of their own Light
and understanding; so that although they are not to
follow others blindly, yet they are to suspect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
rather than them; we mean when the matter
is dubious. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We say, That when the case
comes that it is evidently seen that Superiour Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories
have gone wrong, private Christians are
to differ from them indeed, yet so as to give great
Reverence and Respect to the Judicatory, even
when they are necessitate to dissent from their Acts,
least by their furious zeal they cast all loose and into
confusion.</p>
                     <p>But to come to the point, The Question is,
Whether all the Power of Church Government be
in the Hands of particular Elderships; And so if
particular Elderships be Independent: Or if Jesus
Christ hath warranted Presbyteries to be above
them in the Lord. We maintain the last: And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61451:100"/>
we clear our part the Controversy from several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p>II. The <hi>First</hi> Argument is taken from the many
defects that are in this way of <hi>Independency,</hi> where
the whole Power is put in one Congregation; so
as to be countable to none: We shall reckon four
or five of these Defects; and indeed very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
<hi>First,</hi> According to this way of Theirs, there
is no Authoritative way in Christs Church to right a
man that is wronged by a particular Congregation;
As put the Case that an Eldership should wrong
a man by Censuring him unjustly: According to
Their way, He must sit with the wrong, there is
no remedy to him till Christ come in the Clouds.
There is a second defect according to this <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
way of Theirs: There is no Authority in the
Church to heal Breaches in a Congregation: Put
the case that a People should divide from the Elders,
or the Elders among themselves, or that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
may have a contest with another: Now
in these cases, suppose both these Parties to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as too usually it falls out, so as They will not
yeild to any Advice, without Authority to back it:
Now what remedy is left in such Cases without the
assistance of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> that hath Power over both
Parties, to command them in the Lord to do what
is right: And can we think that Christ hath left no
remedy in his House for such evils, as may so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
fall out. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Independent</hi> way
leaveth no Authoritative mean for holding down
Pluralities of Religion; For if so, then let a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61451:100"/>
Congregation set up what Religion they please;
suppose it be <hi>Popery:</hi> There is no Authoritative
mean to hinder it: But in the Way of <hi>Presbytery</hi> it
is otherwise: <hi>Presbytery</hi> is Christs Weeding-hook to
weed out Heresies; so we observe wherever it is
set up it bears Heresy down; And no wonder;
For Judicatories are so subordinate, one to another,
that what is overseen in the one, is taken notice of
in the other. <hi>Fourthly;</hi> By this way of theirs, there
is no Authoritative mean for unity and uniformity
in the publick service of God among Congregations;
But every one being left to themselves, will take a
way of Their Own; This Congregation one way,
and that Congregation another way; which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
would prove a great stumbling block to the
weak, not knowing unto what Congregation to
joyn, because of the great diversity among all.
Put the case (to clear it in some things whereby ye
may guess at others) that in one Congregation they
would both read and expound, In another, they
would only Read: In others the line were not read
for singing; And in another, it were read: In some
Congregations Children were not Baptized but in
time of Sermon, In others, That Baptism were Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrate
at other times also: In some Congregations
Two Prayers before a Sermon, In another but one:
In another the Conclusion Sung, In another not.
Now though the Strong would not stumble at these
things, knowing that such in their own nature are,
for the most part at least, indifferent; Yet to the
weak Christian they might prove a ground of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61451:101"/>
For usually such presently stamp Conscience
on that part of the difference which they like best,
and hence arise contests, Janglings, and matter of
renting the Church. Now there is no way in <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi>
left for preventing of this. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The way
of <hi>Independency</hi> leaves no remedy to a Congregation
wanting a Minister, for Tryal of the next that comes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
Whose tryal is left wholly to the People by this way
of Theirs: How slight that tryal would be, any may
judge; How few Parishes can try a Minister in his
Abilities, If he be apt to Preach, convince gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
watch against ravening wolves &amp;c. Now this
is remeeded in the way of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> according to
<hi>Pauls</hi> Rule 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4. 14. That Ministers be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
‚Äî<hi>with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi>
This for the first Argument, from <hi>Five</hi> great defects
in the <hi>Independent</hi> way; Other defects also might be
instanced, but these may suffice.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Second</hi> Argument is taken from <hi>Matth. 18.
16.</hi> 17. 18. where Jesus Christ layes down a way for
the removing of private Scandals, or dealing with
an offending brother; From whence we argue thus,
If Christ hath laid down a way for gaining an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
brother, how much more for gaining an
offending Church: Its above all doubt that a Church
may offend, walk inoderly, wrest Justice. Now surely
Gods care must be no less of the whole Church than
of One Member: So that our consequence holds:
but we assume, There is no way to heal the Scandal
of an offending Congregation or particular Church,
but by compleaning to a Presbyterial Church above
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61451:101"/>
them: This is evident, For 1. our Opposites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will not censure them-themselves: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be both judge and party. 2. It appears from the
rule of proportion, For by that same rule that private
Christians are to be compleaned of to that Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
whereof they are parts; so the Eldership is to be
compleaned of to that <hi>Presbytry</hi> whereof it is a part:
and if the Christian liberty of the private Christian
be not taken away by the one, so neither is the just
power of the Eldership taken away by the other.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Third</hi> Argument is from that which we
handled before, That in Scripture is holden forth
Government by Presbytries over single Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and by Synods over Presbytries, From whence
we argue thus, That the way of Governing the
Church in the Apostles times was by Presbyteries
and Synods; And therefore the Church should still
be so Governed. For the first part of our Argument
That the way <hi>Then of</hi> Governing the Church was by
Presbytries and Synods, it was proved before: So
we have only to speak to the <hi>Second</hi> part of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that therefore the Church should be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
so now: And to clear this consequence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these things. 1. That whatever is recorded of
the practice of the Churches in the matter of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the Apostles times, can be for no other
end but to be a Pattern for imitation to the Churches
in after times, For <hi>whatsoever things were written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
times was for our learning and instruction Rom: 15.
4.</hi> 2. Those primitive Churches were planted by
the Apostles; Now who can imagine but what the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61451:102"/>
Apostles did of that kind, was according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given them by Christ; A promise of whose
presence they had with them in their Ministry, and
if so, then their practice must be a Rule to Generations
following 1 <hi>Cor: 11. 1. Be ye followers of me,</hi> &amp;c.
3. We make the practice of the Apostles then, to be
a Rule for us in other things; As from their practice
in giving the People liberty in choising their own
Deacons <hi>Act.</hi> 7. We argue, That the People may
choise their own officers yet: And from their practice
in having Ruling Elders in the Church 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5. 15.
We argue, That we should have Ruling Elders yet:
So from their practice in having the office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
we argue, That we should have them yet: And
from their practice in Celebrating the Lords Supper
on the Lord's day <hi>Act:</hi> 27. We argue, Therefore
we should celebrate it on that day yet. Now if so
be that Their practice should be a Rule to us in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, why not also in Church Government by
Presbytries and Synods; especially seeing that we
have made out, that Their practice is as clear in this
as in other matters. A <hi>Fourth</hi> consideration to
strengthen this Argument is this, That the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
now have these same Reasons to move them to
submit to that Government, which the Church in
the Apostles times had; and a Law or Practice is still
binding, so long as the Reason of the Law remains:
Now the Reasons that moved the Church in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
time to submit to Presbyterial Government,
was <hi>first,</hi> Because there were many things of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
concernment to all the Congregations in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:61451:102"/>
and therefore they were Governed by one
Presbytry as said is: so there are many businesses of
common concernment to many particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
now, and therefore it should be so yet. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
In <hi>Act:</hi> 15. There ariseth a controversie in
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and because the controversie cannot be
composed in the Presbyterial Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
therefore it is referred unto a Synod made up of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Presbytries, all concerned in it: So there are
businesses of common concernment to many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
yet, and some that cannot be ended in one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry,
and therefore there should be Synods for
composing of these things yet. And seeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
extraordinarly assisted, (one whereof might
have composed the Controversie) would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have a Synodical Convention for ending Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
Much more ought we to do it whose
Gifts are far Inferior to Theirs. By all which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
clear that the practice of the Church then in
that point, is binding to us now.</p>
                     <p>Argument <hi>Fourth,</hi> There is no Pattern of such an
<hi>Independent</hi> Congregation, by precept or Practice
in the whole Scripture, where one particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
with one Pastor, and Their Eldership,
did Exercise or may Exercise all Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in all its Acts, and that <hi>Independently:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp;c. The Antecedent is true. <hi>First,</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
cannot be given of Ordination of Ministers by
One Congregation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By precept and
Practice Ordination is to be by moe Pastors than one;
as <hi>Act: 1. 13. Act. 6. 2. Act: 13. 13. 1 Tim:</hi> 4. 14.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61451:103"/>
So it is clear, That it is by Pastors, and many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
and so cannot be by a single Congregation,
where there is required, and should be (say they)
but one Pastor. As to what they say of the Church
of <hi>Corinths</hi> Excommunicating the Incestous man.
We Answer, <hi>Corinth</hi> was a Presbyterial Church. And
<hi>Secondly,</hi> It proves not that they might Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<hi>Independently,</hi> For if a Controversie had arisen
about it, which they could not have ended among
themselves, they were to have their recourse to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
By the same Reason for which the Church of
<hi>Antioch</hi> had, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p>Argument <hi>Fifth,</hi> If so be that Congregations be
<hi>Independent,</hi> And no benefit of Appeals allowed to
the party grieved, Then the state of the Christian
Churches were in greater Slavery than the Jewish;
But this is absurd; For Christians are in an estate
of greater liberty; As appears from <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 1.
Therefore &amp;c. For clearing the first proposition<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> We
lay down these things; <hi>First,</hi> There was a Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Judicatories in the Jewish Church; As might
be made out from several places, We take one 2
<hi>Chron:</hi> 19. 8. where there is a Supream Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Judicatory v, 10. The matters they handle
come to them from other Judicatories: And <hi>Deut: 17.
8.</hi> Sheweth the matters to be handled by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Judicatory are such as had been before the
Inferior Court, but found too hard to be judged there;
So that here was a Refuge for the party wronged by
the Inferiour Court: Now if there be no such Refuge
left to Christians, we may certainly say, The state of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61451:103"/>
Christiansis most hard, being left under the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
sentence of the unjust Eldership, And no power
to right them; When the oppressed Jew might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Superior Judicatory.</p>
                     <p>We might further argue from this, Whatever was
in the Jewish Government that was neither Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,
nor Judicial; but Moral; That is binding
to us; For the Moral Law bindeth all alike, and is
not abrogate: But this, That there was subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Judicatories for the relief of the grieved party
among the Jews, was Moral, not Ceremonial, nor
Judicial. It is true that all things were determined
by an high Priest, among the Jews, who was typical
of Christ, and of his supremacy in Judgment: So
the Papists argue ill from the high Priest to the Pope:
But it is as true, That the Subordination of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
for things of harder knowledge, and relief
of the oppressed party, was Typical of nothing; But
Moral and of the Law of Nature, which forbids
party to be judge; which will naturally follow
if there be not Subordination of Courts. Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we shall not find that this Law is given to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in the pattern upon the mount, but was taught
by the light of nature to <hi>Jethro,</hi> and by him given
to <hi>Moses Exod. 18. 22. It shall be that every great matter
they shall bring unto thee,</hi> &amp;c:</p>
                     <p>III. We come now to Answer Their Objections
many whereof we have taken off in the first two
Heads<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> As for the rest we shall not trouble you
with those that are frivolous, as indeed the most
part are, we shall only pitch on these that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61451:104"/>
carry some shew of Reason, and whereof they boast
most.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>first</hi> Objection is from <hi>Matth:</hi> 18. 17. This
Church, say they, is a Parochial Church, and Christs
mind is that the business should be here ended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Appeal from it. Answer Christ means
not only a particular singular Congregation, but
also, if not mainly, A Presbyterial Church: For
<hi>first,</hi> The particular Church cannot sometimes heal
the distemper, as when it is divided, or when the
Church it self is Scandalous, as oft may fall out by
giving a wrong sentence; So that if Christ had
meaned only a particular Church should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaned
to, and in no case a Judicatory above them,
then his Remedy should have come short in curing
the desease for which he intends it, which to say
were no small imputation to Jesus Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Christ here alludes to the Government of the Jewish
Church, as appears from the Censure of the Obstinate
to be reputed as an <hi>Heathen,</hi> the same which was
among the Jews: And from the plainness of the speach,
<hi>Tell the Church;</hi> Which could not be otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
if he had not alluded to the Jewish Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
besides which, They knew no Judicatory, for
such offences as Christ spoke of to them, There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as yet no particular Church which had given its
name to Christ. Now (as we cleared before) the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
among the Jews which were to be complained
to for Scandals, were not only these who were in their
single Synagogues or Congregations; But also Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Courts, to which it was Lawful to Appeal
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61451:104"/>
from the lesser Courts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ meaneth
here of such a Church, as were the Churches of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. But these (as we have already
cleared) were Presbyterial Churches or Judicatories,
having the oversight of many Congregations: Now
sure these being the first Churches instituted by the
Apostles, must not be excluded from the power
of Government given by Christ to his Church in
that place.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Second</hi> Objection is this, That the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of Churches upon Presbytries layeth on a
yoke of Tyranny and Subjection upon particular
Congregations, equal to the Tyranny of Bishops:
And if the Church must be in bondage, it is better
to be subject to one Lord Bishop, than under a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Ministers and Elders in Presbytry or Synod.
For Answer, We make no other Subjection here than
what the <hi>Independents</hi> themselves make; For they
make Ten in a Congregation subject to Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and the Lawes of the Five hundred to be
binding to the Ten: So make we many Churches to
be subject in the Lord to all their own Pastors and
Elders, conveened in a Presbytry; What more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is there in the one than in the other? <hi>Secondly,</hi>
It is an unjust comparison to compare Bishops Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
with Presbytries. For 1. The Government by
Bishops was Humane, This is Divine. 2. The
Bishop being but One Man did by himself alone Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and that <hi>ad Arbitratum,</hi> Nor had he Any to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to; But here moe Pastors and Elders are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, who are by mutual advice to Rule Gods
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61451:105"/>
People, according to the Word of God. 3. The
Government by the Bishop was altogether extrinsecal
to, or without the Particular Churches: For the
Bishop was none of their Members, nor yet chosen
by them; But Presbyteries and Synods are not so,
They are wholly made up of Members and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
from those same very Churches, where
They govern, and so it is wholly intrinsecal. 4. We
say Government by Presbyteries is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its own nature Tyrannical, as that it is the
greatest remedy against Church Tyranny; because
it is a City of Refuge, for all these who are oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in their particular Congregations; For if in the
Independent Government one be wronged, he must
sit with it, till Christ come and right him: Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object:</hi> 3. Government by Presbytery layeth upon
Ministers and Elders the Charge of other Flocks than
these of whom the Lord made them Overse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs, <hi>to
wit,</hi> The Charge of all the Churches in the bounds
of the Presbytery: They are Elders to all these
Churches; because they govern them. <hi>Answer,</hi> It
followeth not that they have the Charge of all these
Congregations in particular, and in every thing that
concerns the Duty of an Elder; so that they are bound
particularly to Catechize, to Visit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only
They are Elders to them in things common to all,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61451:105"/>
And as they are joyned in the Court with others:
And this is not absurd, for in our Parliament, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
from Shires are Judges to the whole
Kingdom: But how? It is as they are joyned in
Parliament, not by themselves alone; It is in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
common to the Shire, not in other petty par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Affairs; And so it is here, They are Elders
to all the Congregations indeed, as they are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Presbytery; But not by themselves
alone: In things of common concernment to the
whole particular Congregation, not in these Duties
belonging to every Congregation in particular.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object:</hi> 4. If this Subordination, and Judicatory
above Judicatory were of Divine Institution, Its
like Scripture would have spoken more plainly of it;
not leaving it to be drawn out by so many far fetch'd
Consequences. <hi>Answer,</hi> We have already given
sufficient Warrand for this Government by clear
Consequences from Scripture; And Consequences
from Scripture are Scripture, else we must cast at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
points of Divine Truth which have no other ground
but Scripture Consequence: As the Trinity; and
Change of the Sabbath; yea we see Christ himself
grounding a material point, <hi>to wit,</hi> The Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon Scripture Consequence, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 26. 2.
We must not teach God how to set down his mind
in Scripture; We perchance think, It had been a
plainer way to have cast matters of Religion to so
many Heads; By which means many Controversies
should have been shunned, But He hath thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
The Lord in Wisdom hath scattered the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61451:106"/>
parcels of every Truth through his Book, intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with other Subjects, as the Gold is in the Mine,
and this to exercise his people in searching out his
mind from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>IV. In the last place, We come to make some <hi>Vse</hi>
of what is said. And the first <hi>Vse</hi> is this, If it be so
that this Government by Presbytery is grounded on
the word of God, Then ye would know it is not
a thing of nought we are contesting for, It's a part
of that Truth once delivered to the Saints, and a
Truth of no small concernment: What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
(think ye) of Particular Congregations, If they
had none above them to call them to an account?
What Divisions, Strifes, Heresies, Schisms
would ensue; if people were informed of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
that have fallen out among our Opposits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
where this way of <hi>Independency</hi> was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
The one half renting from the other, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
one another? It might make moderate
Men scar at it: But we need se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>k no other evidence
of this, than by looking on <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
these years by past. In the Church of <hi>England, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
could not be set up, <hi>Independency</hi> was pleaded for,
and practised; And what is become of it, Sathan hath
vomited out a floud of Errors, that there were never
more, nor more gross in any time of the Christian
World; Yea all the rotten Graves of old Heresie are
digged up, and now avowed: <hi>Socinianism,</hi> In denying
Christs Righteousness in the matter of Justification:
<hi>Anabaptism,</hi> In denying the Baptizing of Infants:
<hi>Arianism,</hi> In denying the Trinity: And many other
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61451:106"/>
such like. Yea there are some Errors there that were
never before heard of: Some affirming, There is
no Church they can joyn with: And therefore, They
turn <hi>Seekers.</hi> Some are above all Preaching, Prayer
and all Ordinances: And all these are the Fruits of
<hi>Independency.</hi> Again, look on the Fruits of the
<hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> where it hath
been in Vigour, God hath made it an Hammer for
battering down the beginnings of Error: So that
these twelve years bypast not any one Error hath
come to any Strength: And this all under God
from Presbyterial Government, being His Institution:
Our Judicatories were indeed terrible, as an Army
with Banners, though indeed we are now like to turn
contemptible. God himself heal our Breaches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Guard against the Errors that would
draw you from this Truth; If ye cannot carry the
grounds we have been speaking of with you, yet
ye may remember ye once heard this Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
from Scripture and Reason; That so when
ye meet with temptations to quite it, ye may advise
well before ye yeild.</p>
                     <p>I would press this<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> so much the more, As that
this Doctrine of Presbyterial Government is the Butt
of Sathan's Envy, the thing he would have most
gladly overthrown, As that which stands most in
his way; For so long as it stood in its integrity,
We might in the Lords strength have defied the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to have brought Error into <hi>Scotland.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is the thing he sets himself to brangle, To
get the hedge once plukt up, that so the wild Boar
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61451:107"/>
of the wilderness may come in. And (believe me)
there is nothing makes me more affraid, than that
through Gods permission, the Devil shall get a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludge
of Error brought in on <hi>Scotland;</hi> Because
those who have been intrusted with this Government
have weakned the power of it, by Divisions among
our selves; A copy is casten How that Erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spirits need not stand much on the Authority
of Assemblies, when they would cross their Designs:
We are affraid, yea we may be past <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.
That Presbyteries, Synods, &amp;c. have lost
much of the weight They had lately in mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
Only let me intreat you in the bowels of
Christ, That ye would put a difference betwixt the
Government it self, and the Persons who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with it; Doe not charge the faults of the
one upon the other: The best things that are may
be abused; And it is Peoples Tryal to put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the good of a thing, and the Abuse
of it. The Government is good, and of God;
and the abuse of it is evil and of men: What is
of God, cleave to it, and stick fast by it; what is
from mens corruptions, mourn for it: Pray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may get a sight of it: And thus ye shall walk
in an eaven way. Ye had need to deal with God to
ground you in the knowledge of these things; For
we know not how soon we may be put to it, to
quite them: Only remember They are Truths ye
have sworn to maintain with your hands lifted up
on high.</p>

                  <p>WE have gone through these Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
which are about the Government
of the Church: We are now to refute
some dangerous Errors of Doctrine. And <hi>first,</hi> We
shall begin with the Error of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61451:108"/>
The Errors of <hi>Separatists</hi> are many, but we shall
only engage with two Heads of them, which are the
main. The <hi>first</hi> is That which they teach concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Constitution of the Visible Church; Or who
it is that should be received Members of Christs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Body. The <hi>second</hi> is That which they hold to
be the duty of every sincere Christian, viz. That
when they spy any corruption in a Church wherein
they are Members, as if Persons Scandalous be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords Supper (seeing they ought all to
be Gracious who come there) Then (say they) It is
their duty to keep back from the Communion; and
not only so, but to quite That Church, and set up
a new Church of Their own. We shall begin first
with that Doctrine that concerns the Constitution of
Visible Churches. And therein we shall follow our
usual Order: <hi>First,</hi> Clear the Question. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Bring Arguments for the Truth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
those they bring against the Truth. And <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Apply the whole to some Use.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>First,</hi> For clearing of the Question, ye would
know what Church it is concerning which the
Controversy is. <hi>First,</hi> It is not that place
where Gods people meet to go about Gods
publick Worship, (such as this House we now are in,
which is called the Church by a Figure, improperly)
But it is the People gathered together in it; which
People are really and properly the Church; although
the House be so called, because it contains them, by
an usual Figure. The Church that we are to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of, is made up of Men and Women: And not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61451:108"/>
that which is built of Timber and Stone. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The
Controversy betwixt Us and Them is not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Invisible Church, that is called the Church of
the First-born, Those who by vertue of their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Calling are united to Jesus Christ the Head,
are living Members of His Mystical Body, and draw
Spiritual Influence from him. Concerning the
Church taken in this Sense, There is no Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
betwixt Us and the <hi>Separatists,</hi> but that the
Members of this Church are only made up of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
are all gracious, because this Church is
Christs Mystical Body, a Royal Priest-hood, the
Lambs Wife, all fair, undefiled<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The
Question Then is concerning the Church Visible,
which is, a Company of Men and Women, who have
according to the Tenor of Gods Covenant with the
Visible Church an Outward Ecclesiastical (which is
in its kind a real) Right to enjoy the Outward Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>This being the Church about which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
betwixt Us and the <hi>Separatists</hi> is, We shall
speak a litle to clear what is meaned by it; And <hi>First,</hi>
The Church is called Visible, not because the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it may be seen: For in that respect the Church
Invisible, the Church of Believers, may be called Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
For the Members of it being believing Men and
Women, may be seen also: But the difference betwixt
the Churches in those two Senses, is taken from
that which makes one to be a Member of the one
Church, as it differs from that which makes one a
Member of the other. That which makes One man a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61451:109"/>
Member of the Invisible Church, is True Grace,
sincere Faith, inward Marks thereof: Now Grace
is a thing that cannot be seen by another certainly:
Its true there are outward effects of it; but they are
such, that a Hypocrite may have the counterfeit of
them, so as the one cannot be discerned from the
other by a Beholder. The nature of Grace is only
known Infallibly and certainly to God; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
This Church is called Invisible. Again that
which makes a Man or Woman a Member of the
Visible Church is something that may be seen<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may be judged of, by those who have
Power to receive Members into the Church, and
cast them out from it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We said that this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church is a Company or Society of Men and
Women, that have an Ecclesiastical Right to enjoy
the Outward Priviledges of the Sons of God. For
understanding what is meaned by enjoying of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Priviledges, we shall show you That there are
Outward Priviledges, and Inward Priviledges of
those who are the Sons of God. Inward Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
are Jesus Christ himself; a Right to him, a
saving Right to the Covenant of Grace, and Life
Eternal; These are the Inward Priviledges of the
Sons of God: And only Believers have right to
those: Painted Hypocrites have no right to them.
But <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are Outward Priviledges of the
Sons of God; such as these, To be ordinary Hearers
of the Word Preached: To be taken a care of by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ his Servants: To have liberty to come to
the Sacraments: These are Outward Priviledges,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61451:109"/>
And these are Priviledges that a Member of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church hath a right to. We said they had
an Ecclesiastical Right or a Church Right to them:
That is, such a Right as gives Warrand to the
Church for receiving them to enjoy these Priviledges,
and yet possibly they have not a Right to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: As for Example, when there is a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hypocrite in a Congregation, who makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
seemingly to use the Means: That man hath
an Ecclesiastical Right to come to a Communion;
such a Right as may Warrand the Minister for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of him, although he have not a Right to
come before God; God will challenge the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
for coming, and not the Minister for suffering
him to come. Yet we are still to consider that tho'
this Ecclesiestical Right be not Saving, yet it is Real in
its kind, being founded upon Gods Covenant with
the Visible Church, and his Ordinance of admitting
such therein. Now ye may know somewhat by
this, what we mean by an Ecclesiastical Right, it's
That which gives warrand to Church Officers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a man to enjoy these Outward Priviledges: And
so ye may know what we mean by the Visible
Church whereof we Dispute.</p>
                  <p>There are several differences betwixt Us and the
<hi>Separatists,</hi> Concerning the Visible Church. First,
They affirm That there is no Visible Church on
Earth; But a single Congregation; As many as
may meet in one place. This we refuted in the
former Controversie; by shewing That in the Church
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there were far moe than could meet in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61451:110"/>
one single Congregation; yea many particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
And yet are called but One Church.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> They differ much from us, as also from the
Truth, concerning the power They give to this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church, They give them the full power of
Church Government, and that <hi>Independently</hi> from
any Chuch power on earth: This difference also
we spoke of in the preceeding Debate; And so we
shall stand now no longer upon it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We
differ concerning That which gives a Being to the
Church Visible; They say, To make a Society of
People a Visible Church, so as to have right to
partake of the Priviledges there of, It is requisite that
all the Members of that Society Swear a Covenant
one to another, wherein they bind themselves to
submit one to another in the Lord, to walk in all
the Ordinances of God, and not to leave that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till liberty be given them by the rest: So that tho a
man should be never so truely Godly and Gracious,
yet if he take not such a Covenant, and if he Swear
not such an Oath, He is without the Visible Church,
He is in the state of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>agan, to live and to die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Church Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>The Judgement of our Church, and that of Truth
herein is this, That wherever a man comes out of
one Particular Congregation (which we call a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch)
to another, By his so doing he comes under
a duty and Obligation, which he is bound to before
God, and the Congregation also, to discharge himself
in; Namely all the Duties pertaining to a Member
of that Particular Congregation or Paroch to which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61451:110"/>
he comes, Although he Swear not such an Oath.
We say, <hi>Secondly,</hi> he may also Swear to do these
Duties. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To bind this on all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of the Members of the Church, to take
such an Oath, so as if they take it not They are
not Church Members; We say, It is Will Worship
not commanded by God, either by Practice or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
in Old or New Testament. We might easily
prove that Jesus Christ never took This way to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Visible Church.</p>
                  <p>But the main difference is the Fourth, and that
is Concerning those who are to be kept or received
Members of the Church Visible; Or who they are
that have right to these Outward Priviledges we
spoke of: That which they hold in this Point is, That
they would have all Visible Churches disolved, and
then Churches gathered out of these, wherein none
are to be received or admitted to partake of Church
Priviledges, so as to be under the care of Ministers,
Admitted to the Sacraments &amp;c. but those who have
evident positive signes of Grace, and these not only
evident to the Minister and a few moe, but to all the
Members of the Congregation, so that every
one in the Congregation must be convinced, so
far as men can attain unto, that he hath Grace,
or else he is no Member of the Visible Church; by
which Rule they model Congregations; But there
was never a Congregation since Christ was on the
earth so constitute, except Their Own; For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Rule they will cast out the Two Part,
and of some Congregations, leave Ten Parts and take
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61451:111"/>
but the Eleventh, leaving all the rest as Pagans, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Baptising their Children, or admitting themselves
to any Church Priviledge: This is what They hold.
As for the Judgment of our Church, and that which
is according to the Word, take those Assertions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> We hold that every man indeed that is a
Member of the Visible Church ought to have Grace;
so that he sins against God and his own Soul if he
have it not; And all the priviledges he enjoyes will
do him no good without it. We say in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
all the Members of the Church ought to have
Grace; But to say, That they so ought to have
Grace, that none of them must be admitted to be a
Member of the Church Visible without it, This we
deny: It is ill reasoning from unanswerableness to an
obligation to a forfaulture of Priviledges: For every
man that is a Magistrate ought to have Grace; so
as he sins against God if he have it not; yet a man
may be a lawful Magistrate, and have the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of a Magistrate, although he have not Grace.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> We do willingly grant that in the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Church, and admitting of People to
the Lords Table: Our Practice comes far short of
the Rule; There is not that care taken to purge out
scandalous persons as should be, Our practice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
short of the Rule; But Our Rule which we
shall hold out (as we shall prove) is Good. To
know then what is the Rule according to which we
should admit men to be Members of the Church.
<hi>First,</hi> There are some who are admitted to some
Priviledges only, and not to all; as to Baptism: And
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61451:111"/>
these are Members of the Church Incompleatly, They
are Members, but not so fully; And those are, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that are born within the Church Visible; They
are Members, although not to be admitted to the
Lords Supper. Now betwixt Us and the <hi>Separatists</hi>
herein, to wit, whether Infants should be Baptized,
there is no difference. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are some
who are admitted to all Priviledges of the Visible
Church; And those are Members Compleatly and
fully: And concerning those the dispute is: Who
are those that ought to be admitted to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Priviledges of the Visible Church? They man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(as we heard) that none should be admitted
but those that can give evident Signs of Grace to
the satisfaction of the Consciences of all within the
Church. We hold <hi>First,</hi> that if it be known that
Men be Baptized. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they be free
of Scandal. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they submit themselves
to the Doctrine of the Gospel, and have some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
knowledge of the Grounds of the Christian
Religion, If these things I say be in a man, We
hold that he is to be received, although he cannot
give evident signes of the reality of the Grace of
God in him to All. And this is the Controversie.</p>
                  <p>II. Now we come to prove that which we hold by
Arguments. The first is <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did not
follow this Rule of Theirs in receiving Members to
the Church, and therefore it is not the right Rule:
That <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did not follow this Rule will
appear, if we consider Luke 3. Wherein consider,
Who it was whom <hi>John</hi> Baptized v, 21. <hi>Now when
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61451:112"/>
all the People were Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. It was <hi>all the People.</hi>
Consider <hi>Secondly,</hi> What he requires of this People
before he Baptize them, We shall find in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words that he seeks no more than that they would
be convinced that they were wrong before. And
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Profess an earnest desire to amend. So
we find in v, 10. <hi>And the People asked him, saying,
what shall we do?</hi> And the publicans in the 12. v,
do the same, who yet were but Course Men. And in
the 14 v, <hi>The souldiers likewise demanded of him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what shall we do?</hi> Now these Questions import
this much, That they were convinced they were
wrong, and professed at least a desire to become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
And accordingly <hi>John</hi> instructs them, thus and
thus ye shall do; And without more ado in v, 21.
He Baptizes them. Now it is not possible that <hi>John</hi>
could have got positive signes from every one of
them to convince him that they had real Grace;
Far less That every one of the multitude could
have been perswaded in Conscience of the reality of
Grace in each other; And therefore the Rule of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to be Members of the Visible Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be this, That every one to be admitted should
have evident signes of Grace, satisfactory to the
Consciences of all: <hi>John</hi> sought not this of those
whom he received, It's true he fals very sharply on
the Scribes <hi>Matth. 3, v, 7‚ÄîO generations of vipers,
who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come.</hi> But
it is as true, when he hath rebuked them, as ill
as they were before, seing now they professed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to amend, he Baptizes them in v, 11. <hi>I indeed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61451:112"/>
Baptise you with water</hi> &amp;c The same (<hi>You</hi>) whom he
spoke to in v. 7. As is clear from the Connexion of
every Verse. If it be Objected that they were not
received to be Members of the Church, although
they were Baptized. We shall once for all clear that
Baptism sealeth up a mans right of Membership in
the Church Visible. We find this from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Practice <hi>Act:</hi> 2. 41. Where the Way is how
they received men to be Church Members, it is
said <hi>They were Baptized</hi> &amp;c. And those who were
Baptized are said to be <hi>added to them</hi> and <hi>added to
the Church</hi> v, last, So in <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 38. The Eunuch
was received by Baptism to be a Member of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church. So <hi>Saul Act:</hi> 9. 18. And <hi>Lydia Act.
16, 15. Secondly,</hi> Circumcision was a seal of the
Jews right of Membership in the Visible Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Testament, And therefore Baptism is a
seal of our right to be Members of the Visible
Church under the New; For Baptism in the New
Testament is come in the same place with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
in the Old Testament. This is for our first
Argument.</p>
                  <p>The second Argument is taken from the practice
of the Apostles, And it is this, The Apostles went
not by that method of our Opposits in admitting
Members of the Visible Church, This was not the
Rule They followed: Therefore it is not the right one.
We clear this was not the Rule which they followed
from <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. Where in one day there are <hi>three
thousand added to the Church.</hi> Now surely none can
imagine that it was possible that every one of these
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61451:113"/>
                     <hi>Three thousand</hi> could be perswaded in conscience of
the regeneration of one another. It is true <hi>Peter</hi>
binds on them to Repent; But it is as true that on
their desire to be admitted to be Members of the
Visible Church, and some evidence of their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he receives them; Although there were many
of them did not even this much in sincerity. For <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> were but Hypocrits; So no more is
required of <hi>Simon Magus Act.</hi> 8. 13. And so of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
who afterwards forsook <hi>Paul.</hi> Yea if we look
to the Rule which Christ walked by, He sought no
more but a profession to follow him, and He sought
no more of <hi>Judas,</hi> to make him not only a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of His Society, but an Apostle and Minister;
Christ knew him well enough to be a Hypocrite:
And yet upon his professed desire to follow him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him to his Company, yea makes him a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
So that this Rule which <hi>Separatists</hi> so much
cry up, was neither followed by Jesus Christ nor
his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Argument we bring is this, There
was never a Church before or since Christs dayes
whose Members, All of them, could give evident
signes of Grace to each other; And therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a Rule of Gods appointing, That the Church
Visible must be made up of only such. We prove
the Antecedent; Sure the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi>
time was not such, every Member was not such a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Saint, so as he was known to be Gracious; For
sayeth <hi>Moses Deut. 29. 4. Yet the Lord hath not given
you an heart to perceive,</hi> &amp;c. and oftimes they are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61451:113"/>
upbraided as stiff-necked. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the purest Churches comming nearest the
Rule, to have been in the Apostles dayes, and yet
the Members of those Churches were not of this
kind. So the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a Church
that the Apostles themselves planted and Preached
to, and yet we shall find many in this Church who
were so far from giving evident signes of Grace one
to another, That there were many there <hi>Scismaticks
1 Cor:</hi> 6. Many there <hi>Fornicators</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst:
There were many there <hi>Drunkards,</hi> yea and
drunk about the time of the Lords Supper. And
those he reproves 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. Yea there were some
there who denyed some of the fundamental Points of
the Christian Religion as the <hi>Resurrection:</hi> As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Chap:</hi> 15. So this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
was not such. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The seven Churches of
<hi>Asia</hi> spoken of <hi>Revel:</hi> 2. 3. were Churches that had the
Candlestick among them, Churches that were in
Christs hand, that he took a care of, and yet they
were not such, as every Member of those Churches
had real signes of Grace, otherwise the Spirit of God
would not have said so often, <hi>If any man have ears to
hear</hi> &amp;c. If he had not supposed that there had been
in them blind, obdurate, carnal hearers. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
The same may be said of the Churches of <hi>Rome, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
Thessalonica,</hi> and of all the Churches that ever
we hear or read of since Christs days, never one of
them was such: And therefore we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that this Rule of Theirs cannot be Right, seing
neither Christ nor his Apostles nor the Church in
any Age did follow it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61451:114"/>
We bring a <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument and it is this: That
cannot be a right Rule of gathering Churches, that
would hold out a number of Gracious Souls from
being Members: But, this Rule of Theirs would
do so: Therefore, it cannot be the right Rule.
For the first part of our Argument none will doubt
of it. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Rule of Theirs would
hold out many truly Gracious, we prove it: For
first there are many that have Grace, that for want
of parts they cannot express the thing they have,
they are so far from giving evidences of Grace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they cannot satisfy themselves; Some
so Proud, some so Passionate, so Worldly, so Talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
so Imprudent, that it will be hard for any to
satisfy themselves that there is Grace in them. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
The way of some is so hid, or rather Gods way
in them so hid, that for any thing People can see in
them, they are nothing different from Natural Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians,
and yet many of such will make clear and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
discoverys of Gods Grace in them at their
death: The work of Grace then appearing that was
long under ground. And now according to this Rule
of Theirs, these are all to be holden out of the Visible
Church, and put in the place of Pagans; And so
That cannot be Christs Rule.</p>
                  <p>Our fifth Argument to prove the point is this,
That cannot be a Rule of admitting Members to
the Church Visible, which puts the Church in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
danger of Renting: But, this Rule of Theirs
puts the Church in a perpetual danger of being
Rent: Therefore, it cannot be the right Rule.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61451:114"/>
We shall clear that this Rule of Theirs puts the
Church in a perpetual hazard of being Rent: For
there are some more easy to be satisfied of the signes
of Grace than others, so That which will be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Church to one, will not be so to others. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
There are some that in progress of time will
grow more strick in searching: Hence that which
was a true Church to him the last year, will be
no Church to him this: And so this Rule of Theirs
keeps the Church in a continual hazard of being Rent,
of Separating after Separating, while they cast off all.
This hath made the most part of all Their Churches
rent, and one part to Excommunicate another.
Yea hence many of that Way cast off all Churches at
last, and turn <hi>Seekers;</hi> Cast off all Serving God
with others, all use of publick means, only serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God apart and by themselves alone; Because
they cannot be sure enough that any others have
Grace but only themselves.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument taken from the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
and comparisons under which the Church
Visible is holden forth in Scripture; which simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
do shew there is not That strictness required
in admitting Members to the Visible Church as the
<hi>Separatists</hi> judge; It's compared to a <hi>Draught net</hi>
cast into the Sea, that gathereth fishes good and
bad <hi>Matth: 13. Secondly,</hi> To a Field wherein is <hi>Wheat</hi>
and <hi>Tares, ibid. Thirdly,</hi> It is compared <hi>Matth:</hi> 22.
to a Table of Guests, where there are some with,
and some without a Wedding Garment. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
It is compared to a House wherein are Vessels of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61451:115"/>
Honour and Dishonour; and to a Fold of Sheep, and
Goats; And in every Church there are many Called
but few Chosen: Now how shall <hi>Tares, chaff, Goats,</hi>
&amp;c. give convincing signes of that which they have
not: Certainly these Similitudes seem to speak, That
there needs not so much Waling or Picking out, in
admitting Members to the Visible Church, providing
they be free of Scandals; Once take them in, and
and then let the Word work on them; This great
Waleing and Separation will be when the Net comes
to the shoar, when the great Harvest comes, when
the Sheep and Goats are severed. This much for
Arguments for the Truth.</p>
                  <p>III. We shall in the next answer Their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
whereby they labor to prove, that the
Church Visible should only be made up of such
Church members as can give satisfactory Signs of
Grace to each other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Their first Objection (which is the most specious)
is taken from these Glorious s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ies given to the Church
in Scripture. They are called Saints; a chaste <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>rgine
spoused to Christ; Sons and Daughters of the Lord
Almighty; and Christs mystical Body, whose Members
are all Gracious: Now, say they, seing the Church hath
these Stiles in Scripture, Should any be joyned to the
Church, but such, who to the uttermost of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
have Grace? For answer, If this Argument
conclude any thing, it will conclude that none
should be Members of the Visible Church, but those
who have Real Grace; for none is a partaker of Christs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
Mystical Body, the Lambs Wife <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But such only
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61451:115"/>
Now this, our Opposites themselves will not affirm,
They grant there may be painted Hypocrites in the
Church, and the Scripture saith the same; for <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> were
such; and so these places of Scripture, if they prove
any thing, will prove more than They will grant.
But to answer directly, ye would know that in the
Church Visible there is a Company of Good and Bad,
sincere Christians, and painted Hypocrites: Now the
Scripture speaks of them sometimes according to the
Better Part, and sometimes according to the Worse
Part; where it speaks of them according to the Better
Part, it speaks so of them as if there were not One Evil
Man among them all, hence are these Stiles, The
<hi>Lambs Wise, Sons and Daughters of the Almighty, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be Saints,</hi> &amp;c. They are so according to the
Better Part. Again when it speaks of the Visible
Church according to the Worse Part, it gives such
names as if there were not One Good Man among
them all; it calls them <hi>Stif-necked,</hi> a <hi>Rebelious house,
Children that are Corrupters;</hi> Now, As it were ill Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
to conclude from these places where such stiles
are given to the Church, that every one within the
Church were <hi>Corrupters, Stif-necked,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>not one
seeking God:</hi> For there he gives them those Stiles
from the Evil Part among them: So it is also ill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from these places where the Scripture calls them
the <hi>Lambs Wife, Sons and Daughters of the Almighty,</hi> &amp;c.
That they were All of them so; And we shall clear
it more fully from the Church of <hi>Corinth, 2 Cor, 6,
18.</hi> They get many Glorious stiles, They are called
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61451:116"/>
                     <hi>The Sons and Daughters of the Almighty,</hi> they are called
<hi>A chast Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11, 2. Now there were many
Schismaticks among them, some denying the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
some Vilifying <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, Many who
were Contentious, Drunkards, Fornicators; so that
these Stiles cannot be Verified of the Members of the
whole Church, but only of the Better Part that was
among them: even as men speaking of an Heap of
Chaff and Corn, will call it An Heap of Corn; Not
that there is nothing but Corn in it, but because the
Corn is the Best Part: And so the Church Visible
(wherein is a mixed Company) is denominated
from the Better Part sometimes in Scripture, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sons and Daughters of the <hi>Lord Almighty;</hi> and
sometimes from the Worse Part, and called <hi>Stiff-necked,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> II Their second Objection is taken from <hi>Act,
2.</hi> 47. Where it is said‚Äî<hi>And the Lord added unto
the Church daily such as should be saved.</hi> Say they, God
added no other to the Church but such as would be
saved, therefore we should adde no others. For
Answer, If any thing follow from this, it would
follow that none should be added to the Church but
these who are Believers really, for no other will be
saved: But this is against themselves: And therefore
our second Answer is this, That the meaning of the
words must be, That He had a chief care of adding
those to the Church who were to be Saved: But it
is not said that He added no other; for the same
Chapter sayes, He added moe; <hi>v,</hi> 41, whole <hi>three
Thousand</hi> were added, and yet all those were not to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61451:116"/>
be saved; For there were <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and
doubtless many other Hypocrites among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> III. The third Objection is taken from <hi>Matth,
22.</hi> 12. In the Parable concerning the Kings Banquet,
where he bids his Servants go and invite to the
Marriage, and finding One wanting the Wedding
Garment (says he)‚Äî<hi>Friend, how camest thou in
hither, not having a Wedding Garment?</hi> Now (say
They) this is a reproof to those who admitted him
to this Priviledge. We Answer, This is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair
to the scope of the Parable, if we look to the
command v, 9, <hi>Goe ye therefore into the high-ways,</hi>
&amp;c. They are commanded to invite all, and to hold
out none for want of the Wedding-Garment; For
that being Inward is only discernable by God. Indeed
this Parable will shew this much, That Ministers
may admit People to Communions, and yet Christ
will come with an after search, and find many there
whom he will cast, that Ministers have admitted:
Ye ought not to think that every man that comes
through a Ministers Tryal is in a good state; The
place says, That Christ found One wanting the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Garment; But it sayes not That Ministers
should let none come but those that had the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Garment; And to shew that this is the scope
of the Parable, see v, 14. There it is said, <hi>For many
are called, but few are chosen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> IV: Their fourth Objection is taken from <hi>Rev.
2.</hi> 4, 5. The Lord speaking there to the Church of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> sayeth, <hi>Nevertheless, I have somewhat against
thee, because thou hast left thy first love Remember
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61451:117"/>
therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and
and do the first works, or else I will come vnto thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and will remove thy Candelstick out of his place,</hi> &amp;c.
From whence They argue thus: None are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Church who will ruin the Church
But, all those who cannot convincingly prove their
Regeneration, will ruin the Church: Therefore they
ought not to be admitted. We Answer, That the
last part of their Argument is false: For there are
many Gracious Persons keeping their first love, who
yet can neither satisfy themselves nor others in the
Truth of their Regeneration, and that will not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We Answer, To the
first part of their Argument, where they say that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one who hath not real Grace will ruin the
Church: It is not universally true, for then there
should be no Hypocrites in the Church at all, neither
known nor unknown, for Hypocrites can do no other
thing but that which is tending to the ruin of the
Church; Now themselves will not say That all
Hypocrites are debarred; For they admit some such;
and Scripture saith the contrair in the admission of
<hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira:</hi> And so some must be admitted,
who, If God look not more to his own mercy than
to their me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>t, and more to the respect he hath to
others than to them, can do nothing but ruin the
Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> V. Their last Objection is taken from 2 <hi>Tim:
3.</hi> 5. Having <hi>a forme of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>liness, but denying the power
thereof: from such turn away.</hi> Therefore none are
to be admitted but those who can give satisfactory
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61451:117"/>
signes of their Regeneration. For Answer: It is
a gross mistake; For if we look to the place, Those
who have only a forme of Godliness, he tells what
they are, <hi>High-minded</hi> &amp;c. v, 4. And in the 6 v,
<hi>Subtile Hereticks</hi> who lead away the simple. Now
we say none such ought to be admitted, for those
are Scandalous: But what they say doth not follow;
For many cannot give satisfactory Signes of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
who yet are not Gross Livers, nor
Scandalous, nor seduceing Hereticks; And so not
of the number of those from whom <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Turn
away.</hi> And thus we have Answered the strongest of
their Objections.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Use.</hi> I. This Doctrine being thus cleared, ye
ought not to look on what our Opposites hold in
this Point as a matter of small moment, neither
ought ye to suffer your selves to be deceived with
the pretence of strictness with which they cover it.
It is a Doctrine that hath fearful Consequences: For
by this, the third part of the best Churches that
ever were, shall be put in no better case than Pagans
themselves, to live without all ordinances, their
Children without Baptism: And this will hold off
many who have true Grace; for how many are there
(even of those) who cannot give convincing signs
of Grace, either to themselves or others. By this
Rule mens Consciences shall still be held in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
whether they may stay members of such
a Church or not; because they can hardly be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
whether all in it have convincing signs of
Grace or not. Now the Judgment of our Opposits
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61451:118"/>
is, that if the Rule be not keeped Conscientiously,
Christians ought to Separate. By this Rule an insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
Burthen is put on Christians, not only to
examine themselves, but also the inward state of
others: By this Rule, all the Churches that ever
were in the dayes of the Prophets, Christs, Apostles,
or in the Primitive Times, have been in the mist; all
living and dying without the Visible Church, and
so without Baptism, and so as Pagans. As also this
shew of strictness beyond whatever God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
doth ever end in looseness, as appears by
the <hi>Separatists</hi> present practise; for, what ever they
speak against the looseness of other Churches, that we
are but a mixture of Drunkards and loose prophane
Livers; yet there is as great looseness in their own
Churches as in any other, for they make no scruple to
admit Hereticks, Covetous Vain, Proud Boasters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of all sorts, if so be they agree with them in
Principles against <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> This Rule puts men
in an overweening conceit of themselves; others are
nothing to them, all are unclean or at best but civil, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
moral Men; but they are the Godly, Saints, and
what not? Now that Doctrine which in its natural
Consequence puts People to overvalue themseves and
undervalue others, is certainly not <hi>of God.</hi> This rule of
theirs makes way for infinite Janglings, and carrying
on of self interests, under pretence of Holiness; for
when the Rule is, That which every particular man
thinks Signs of Grace, Such is the Corruption of the
best, that it will not be applyed to all alike; To
some they will be too strict, to others more lax, as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61451:118"/>
affection caries; Untill at last they think all good
enough, who are for Their Way; And all others, but
Natural, Worldly, and Carnal, who are not so.
I may say that this hath been one of the most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Doctrines that ever the Devil hatched; For it is
that whereby Sathan hath carried on his design main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these years by past; Many such Deceivers crying
up strictness, whereby they have made themselves to
be respected by some, and terrible to others, while
under this pretence, they have born down Christ,
Truth, and Holiness. I speak not this to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
Looseness nor to give a dash to holy Strictness;
It is our sin (and we are plagued for it) that we
have not walked according to our Rule? Yet I love
no further Strictness than what Christ Commands,
Let us stretch out our Arms to invite sinners, to give
Outward Obedience; and then when they are in,
let us Hew them with the Word and Discipline<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
This was Christs way, And his Apostles way, as we
have proved: So when <hi>Separatists</hi> say to you, That
there are such sinful mixtures in your Churches, that
an honest man is polluted to come among them; And
so it is better to stay in your Chambers with a few
of a gracious temper, and let the rest run to the
Devil; Tell them, Christ and his Apostles made no
such separation; And ye desire to be no stricter than
They were: Only this is not to plead for our coming
short of Christs Rule in our practise; That Scandals
are too easily past; That so many Ignorants are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Lords Table, is our sin, and so not
to be pleaded for. This for the <hi>first Head</hi> of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="subsection">

                  <head>Head II. No Separation from a True
Church, or Gods worship in
the Church, because of the sins
of Fellow-worshipers.</head>
                  <p>WE are now to speak of the <hi>Second Head,</hi>
Concerning <hi>Separation</hi> from true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the true worship of God in them,
because of the sins of Fellow-worshipers.</p>
                  <p>I. That which our Adversaries hold concerning
this, is, That the presence of wicked men at Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
do defile the Ordinances to the Godly:
Therefore, say they, where ever there is any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in a Church, or where prophane or wicked
men are suffered to be in it, The Godly are bound
to abstain from the Lords Table, and not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the mixed multitude; And because
they hold it is not Lawful for any to live in any
Church, where they cannot enjoy the whole Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God: Therefore they maintain that the
Godly are bound to Separate from That Church, and
to make up a Church of their Own, by gathering
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61451:119"/>
out so many of the Godly that are in it, as they can
get, and make a little Congregation of their own,
choosing any of them to be a Minister, and some
one or two to be Elders, And so they set up a
Church against a Church, a Church in the Bosome
of a Church.</p>
                  <p>This is not a new Error, It troubled the Church
of Christ long since, in the Fourth Century or som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than Three hundred years after Christ:
The <hi>Donatists,</hi> a kind of Hereticks arose and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Church for a long time, and did teach the
same very thing; Against whom the Godly Fathers
of the Church in that time did write: Yet because this
Error was carried on with a shew of Holiness and
Strictness more than ordinary, It took such deep
rooting in the mindes of some well minding People
(some of them at least) that it could not be driven
out by force of Argument, till the Lord did leave
the mantainers of this Error to fall into other vile
abominations, for all their pretence of Strictness;
Which made all others to loath them: And before
it could be gotten rooted out of the minds of men,
It troubled the Church almost 100. years together.
The same is the Errour which we have now to
Refute.</p>
                  <p>That ye may know what is the Doctrine of Our
Church, that we are sworn to, And which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Word, in this particular, Take it up thus;
<hi>First,</hi> We hold that the Church should be reformed
from all corruptions, And that wicked Scandalous
men should be casten out of the Church, at least debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61451:120"/>
from the Lords Table: This we hold, and herein
there is no difference betwixt Us and the <hi>Separatists:</hi>
But the Question is, When the Church Officers do
not their duty (as often it falls out) what through
negligence, and what through other corruptions,
and what through a base want of courage; so that
sometimes the Rule is not put in practice; By which
means all wicked men are not kept back from the
Ordinance of the Lords Table; And some corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are tollerated: The Question (I say) is, what
the Godly should do in that Case? And concerning
this we hold, <hi>First,</hi> That in such a Case, it is lawful
for a Godly Person to remove his dwelling, and
go dwell in another Congregation, where he
may have the Ordinances more purely Administrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
There is no tye laid on him, for binding him
to remain constantly where he is, if he may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
remove. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We hold that if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conveniently remove from that Congregation;
he may remain a Member of it without sin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he know there be several things which God
is angry with in it, providing he keep his own
hands clean of these. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We hold that as long
as the Godly man stayeth in that Congregation
where there are abuses of that kind tollerated, he is
bound according to his place to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of them, he is bound, according to Christs
Rule to admonish these who are Wicked and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;
and if his admonition do no good, he is
bound to delate them to the Eldership that they may
be Censured: If they be Censured, It is well, he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61451:120"/>
hath gained his point: But if they be not Censured,
Or not so fully as he would, he is to regrate the
matter to God and mourn for it. But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We
hold, that so long as he stayes in that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is not bound to keep back from Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
As from the Lords Table, or from any part
of service in it self lawful, because there are wicked
men joyning with him in it: Far less is he to make
a Rent in the Congregation or to draw away a
number with him, to set up a little Church for
themselves. And this is now the Question we are
to debate about. The <hi>Separatists</hi> say, He is bound
to keep back from the Communion; If any be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it who is prophane or wicked; And that
lest he be defiled with them. We say, if the Worship
and service be lawful and pure in it self, He sins
in keeping back from it, notwithstanding that others
joyn with him in it, whom the Church Officers
should keep back. We grant indeed, when the service
is not pure and lawful in its self; As for example,
when Communion cannot be had except the People
Kneel, And so worship the Bread: In that case, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is bound to keep back, that would keep
himself free of sin; Not because there are wicked
men going to the Table; But because the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is gone about in a sinful way. But our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Concerning Worship in it self lawful; That
is to say, when a Communion is Administrated by a
Minister Lawfully Called; When that <hi>Table Gesture,</hi>
which Christ himself used, is keeped at it; When in
all other things done according to his command;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61451:121"/>
What Godly Persons should do in that case, when
Scandalous Persons one or moe are suffered to come
to the Table: We hold, That notwithstanding of
their being there, he is bound to come foreward;
And the wicked man's being there defiles only the
Worship to himself, and not to those, who come
in honesty. This much for the state of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>II. Having cleared the Question, we come to
Our Arguments for the Truth; viz. That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of wicked men does not defile the Worship of
those that are Godly: And that the Godly should
not keep back from lawful Commanded Duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wicked men have their hands at them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg</hi> I. Our <hi>First,</hi> Argument is taken from the Church
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in Christs time; Any who know the
History of the Gospel, know that it was a very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Church, in Christ time, in Doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
Their Preachers the Scribes and Pharisees
were debauched Persons; They perverted the Law,
the blind led the blind: And when the Preachers
were such, ye may judge what the People
were; And yet we find that Christ and his Apostles
did joyn with them in the lawful Worship, For
<hi>First,</hi> Christ himself came yearly up to the Feast at
<hi>Jerusalem. Secondly,</hi> He is so far from commanding
his Apostles, and those who believed in him, to
keep back from the Ordinary Worship, because of
wicked men among them, That upon the contrair
he forbids them to stumble at any thing of that kind;
And commands them to come to the lawful Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61451:121"/>
as <hi>Matth: 23. 1. 2. Then spake Jesus to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and to his disciples, Saying, The scribes &amp;c.</hi>
Which is as if he had said do not keep back from
the lawful Worship, because they are but Godless
men that go about it; What they Preach according
to the word, do that, and for Their wicked life
follow them not in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg:</hi> II. Our <hi>Second</hi> Argument is taken from the
Church in the Old Testament: We find, for the most
part, many Corrupters and Graceless men that were
Members of that Church; Both of the Preachers, and
People; And yet we never find that the Godly did
loath the Lawful Worship or keep back from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of that: Yea we find, The Lord commands
them to joyn in the lawful Worship; And when they
would <hi>Separate,</hi> He reproves them for it. We shall
make this appear from <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Times of the
Church of the Old Testament. The <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
Time; There was a great mixture of prophane
men in the Church at that Time; As ye will find
<hi>Deut:</hi> 32. (only remember this all along that the
Point we are speaking to, is not to plead for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prophane men in the Church; We shew those
should be removed; But the Question is, when they
are keeped in, what the Godly should do in that
Case; If they should turn back and leave that Church)
I say we find, <hi>Deut:</hi> 32. the Church at that time, for
the most part, was not very sound, They corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, Their spots were not the spots of
Children; yet we never read that <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Godly did withdraw from the Commanded Worship,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61451:122"/>
because such were at it; yea, on the contrair, we
find them joyning with them, <hi>Deut: 29. Moses</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into a Covenant with them, Preaches to them,
Prayes for them: Yea <hi>Deut: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 6. 7. 8. The Lord
commands the People to come up to the Publick
Worship, in the place where he should choose to
place his name, and go about the lawful Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Duties: Tho (doubtles) there would be many
wicked men among them. The <hi>Second</hi> Time
of the Church in the Old Testament, which we take
to prove the Point is, in <hi>Joshua's</hi> time; there were
then great mixtures of wicked men among them;
As appears from <hi>Joshua</hi> 24. 14. 23. He bids them put
away the Strange Gods, So there were numbers of
them corrupt in the way of Worship, and yet we
find in the same Chapter v, 23. That <hi>Joshua</hi> conveens
them altogether to a Solemn piece of Worship, and
enters into a Covenant with God, and Preaches to
them on that Subject: Now surely <hi>Joshua</hi> would
not have done this, if so be the presence of wicked
men did defile the Worship to the Godly: And if it
had been a sin in the Godly to stay with the wicked
when about Worship. The <hi>Third Time</hi> is in <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>'s
time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. We find at that time there
were some Godly, <hi>Seven Thousand</hi> that had not
bowed their Knee to <hi>Baal;</hi> We find also an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
Multitude in <hi>verse</hi> 29. The Body of the People
Halting betwixt God and <hi>Baal;</hi> They would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say that God was their God, nor that <hi>Baal</hi> was
their God; and yet <hi>Elijah</hi> called All together to a
solemn Worship, a solemn Sacrifice; That is gone
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61451:122"/>
about <hi>verse</hi> 36. And there was Preaching and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that purpose. Now surely, If so be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of that Godless Multitude, which <hi>Elijah</hi> could
not get reformed in a hast, had prophaned the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the <hi>seven thousand</hi> Godly, <hi>Elijah</hi> would never
have been accessory to that sin: A <hi>Fourth</hi> Time is
from <hi>Solomons</hi> time to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s: There was great
Corruption tollerated in the Church then; As Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
God in the High-places, as is clear through
the whole Tract of the History of that time; And
there was much Prophanity of Life in that time;
which also appears from the frequent Sermons of
the Prophets to that purpose; And yet we never
read that the Prophets did separate from the lawful
Worship, because of that mixture in the Church:
Yea on the contrary we read they did joyn with
them in every Lawful Duty, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. Asa</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
all together, and enters into a Covenant with
them: <hi>Isaias, Jeremiah,</hi> and the rest Preaches to
them, Prayes with them. Now if the presence of
Wicked Men had polluted the Service to them,
then <hi>Isaias</hi> his Preaching and Praying, and joyning
with the People in Worship should have been defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Him. A <hi>Fifth</hi> Instance is taken from 1 <hi>Samuel
2. 16. Eli</hi>'s Sons the Priests were Prophane men:
whereupon the Godly began to abhor the Worship;
And so it is said in <hi>verse 17. Wherefore the sin of the
young Men was very great before the Lord, for Men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the Offering of the Lord.</hi> And to speak the
Truth, It was little wonder they did so: For in <hi>verse
22.</hi> We find the Priests were so Godless that they did
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61451:123"/>
ly with Women that Assembled at the doors of the
Tabernacle of the Congregation: Little wonder
then that the Godly did loath and withdraw: But does
the Lord approve of Their withdrawing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that reason? No, We see in <hi>verse</hi> 24.
Where <hi>Eli</hi> the Prophet speaks to his Sons, sayes he,
<hi>Nay my Sons: For it is no good report that I hear; ye
make the Lords People to transgress:</hi> Their abhoring
the offering of the Lord because of wicked men
that had their hands at it, is called <hi>(a transgressing)
ye make the Lords people to transgress.</hi> From all which
it is clear. That the presence of wicked men doth
not defile the Worship to the Godly, providing they
come honestly themselves: And that therefore the
wickeds presence should not keep them away.</p>
                  <p>There is an Exception which our Opposits have
against this Argument: And it is taken from the
State of the Church in the Old Testament; They
say, That to separate from the Church in the Old
Testament was impossible, there being no other
Church to joyn with; The Service was then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Temple; And so the Case of the
Church under the Old Testament, was far different
from the Case under the New. We might answer
several things unto this: As <hi>First,</hi> If so be that the
presence of wicked men doth defile the Worship to
the Godly, then the Godly had been bound to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from the Church, even under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although there had been no other Church to
joyn with: Better to be out of the Church Visible
than to be in it, if we must sin by abiding in it.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61451:123"/>
But to answer more briefly, we shall find Instances
in the New Testament that make <hi>Separation</hi> unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as well as in the Old, which Instances shall
make up our <hi>Third</hi> Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg,</hi> III. Our <hi>Third</hi> Argument. In the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> there was a Prophane Multitude, 1 <hi>Cor, 3,
4.</hi> We find there were Schismaticks in it. <hi>Chap,</hi> v.
<hi>v,</hi> 1. We find Incests were Tollerated, <hi>Chap. 6 v,</hi> 1.
We find there were men of Contentious Spirits, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Law before Infidels. Yea in that Chapter, We
find there were some pleading the Lawfulness of
<hi>Fornicatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> And <hi>Chap,</hi> 11. We find there were
Drunkards among them; And such Drunkenness as
was most abominable; For some came Drunk to the
Lords Table, <hi>v,</hi> 21. And <hi>Chap,</hi> 15. We find there
were some infected with a dangerous Heresy The
denying of the Resurrection. And so a number of very
offensive things were among them, But after all, the
Apostle. Tho he reproves them very sharply yet he
no where sayes, Ye that are Godly stay away from
joyning in Worship, because of such mens joyning;
But on the contrair he approves their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go about the Ordinances, Only reproving
the wrong way they came in. So <hi>Chap, 11. v, 18.
First of all when ye come together in the Church I hear
there be divisions among you.</hi> And <hi>v, 20. When you
come together therefore unto one place,</hi> &amp;c. He doth
not reprove their coming together, but suppones it
as a thing Lawful, only he reproves them for their
Divisions. So in the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> There was
much corruption among them, they were <hi>Bewitched</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:61451:124"/>
with Heretical Doctrine <hi>O Foolish Galatians who hath
Bewitched you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cap, 3. v,</hi> 1, They had <hi>begun in
the Spirit but were like to end in the Flesh,</hi> v, 3. In the
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were many who had fallen away
from their first Love, <hi>Revel,</hi> 2, 1. The Church of
<hi>Sardis, Revel:</hi> 3, 1. Did Tollerate prophane persons
such as defiled their Garments; And yet we never
read the Spirit of God commanding to Separat
from worship because of them: Indeed he reproves
them sharply for their Corruption; For their falling
away from their first love, For Their Tollerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prophane wicked men; But he sayes not All ye
that are Godly turn your backs upon that Church;
Make up a new Church of your Own; But direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
approves their joyning together in what was
right. So it is clear that <hi>Separation</hi> from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
is no more to be Tollerated under the New
Testament than it was under the Old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg:</hi> IV. Our <hi>Fourth</hi> Argument to prove the
point is this: The Sins of wicked Men only defile
the Worship to themselves: Therefore, not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
We shall find for this two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22. In the Parable of the Guests com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Kings Supper, there is one that wants
a Wedding Garmant <hi>verse</hi> 12. The Master of the
Feast finds him out, and sayes, Friend, <hi>How comest
Thou hither, And he was found Speechless.</hi> The
Master of the Feast sayes not All ye Guests are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
because this man sits with you; As should have
been said If his presence had defiled the Worship to
them: But only he reproves the Man himself; The
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61451:124"/>
sin is thine, and thou shall bear the blame of it. The
<hi>Second</hi> place is, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29. He that eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself:</hi>
He sayes not, He eateth and drinketh Damnation to
all, but to himself. It would necessarily follow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Doctrine, that he did eat Judgment
to all, If so be the presence of the wicked Man
did defile the Ordinance, or make it sinful to the
rest that Communicate with him: And therefore in
the preceeeding words it is said, <hi>Let a man examine
himself,</hi> &amp;c. He sayes not when ye are coming to
the Table, <hi>Let everyone of you examine your Neighbour,</hi>
Which would necessarily follow, If the presence of
the Wicked Man did defile the Ordinance to the rest,
but all he sayes is, <hi>Let every one examine himself,</hi> &amp;c.
It's true the permitting of a wicked person to come
to the Communion is the sin of the Church Guides,
but it is not the sin of Fellow Communicants, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is admitted to Communicate with them: For
He only defiles the Worship to Himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> V. Our last Argument to prove this Point is,
That from this Doctrine of our Opposits, it would
follow; That the Dignity and Worth of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did depend on Instruments, or upon those that
are partakers of the Ordinance, If so be that the sins
of the Instruments, or of Fellow-Worshipers did
defile the Worship: Now this is most absurd; The
Dignity of Ordinances depends on him whose they
are: The Word of God, however Preached, Is
His Word; Its true we are ready to cast at the
Word because of Instruments: But whoever he be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61451:125"/>
that Preaches, The Word is the Word of God, and
worthy to be received: And so the Sacraments,
Whoever they be that joyn with Me in them, lose
not their worth and efficacy to Me, who am seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ in them, though worthless men have
their hand at them: And the reason is, I do not
Communicate with them in what they do wrong,
Let God and Them reckon for that; The root of
my Communion is Christ; In so far as They lay
hold on Christ, I Communicate with them; In so
far as they do otherwise, I do not. The wicked
man professes Communion with Christ, and Seals up
an Outward Fellowship with the Visible Church: I
Communicate with him in That: But in so far as he
doth this Hypocritically, I do in as far separate from
him. And this much for the Arguments Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth. That the presence of Wicked men
doth desile the Ordinances to none but to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>III. In the next place we come to bring to the
touch-stone the Arguments they use against the
Truth, we shall shortly propound the most plausible
of them and take them off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj:</hi> 1: The <hi>First</hi> Objection is grounded on the 2 <hi>Cor.
6 17. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
&amp;c.</hi> This is the stongest of their Arguments:
The Lord commands the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to come from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them and Separate; And therefore (say they)
when there are wicked men coming together with
the Godly, the Godly ought to separate from them.
But to shew you the vanity of the Argument we
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61451:125"/>
shall Answer it by reading out the rest of the <hi>verse;</hi>
For it is clear what the Apostle aims at‚Äî<hi>Be ye sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing</hi> &amp;c.
He bids them only Separate from Sinful Actions,
and not from Lawful Duties. That ye may see yet
further the vanity of this Reason, Know, It was the
custom in the Church of <hi>Corinth 1 Cor.</hi> 10. When
Idolaters would invite some of their Christian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they would go with them, and eat with
them at their Idol Feasts, and they thought they
might lawfully do it, because they knew their Idols
were not true Gods, and so by their eating they
intended no worship to the Idol, as these Idolaters
did who did eat with them, but did it only to satisfy
their hunger and keep up common Friendship: Now
<hi>Paul</hi> discharges them from this kind of Communion,
and this is it he points at here, <hi>Be separate,</hi> Do not
meddle with their Idol Feasts because it was indeed
Communion with them in their Idolatry: And so it
doth not follow, because <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
be separate from Heathens, in doing a thing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
That therefore he forbids Christians to joyn
in a lawful Worship with the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> II. Their <hi>Second</hi> Objection is taken from <hi>Rev:
18, 4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, come
out of her, my People, that ye be not partakers of her sins,
and that ye receive not of her Plagues.</hi> But this place is
pitifully misapplyed to the purpose; For its evident
that the Apostle <hi>John</hi> is there speaking of whoorish
<hi>Rome,</hi> and is commanding all Gods People to Separate
from the Antichristian Church; Now let any judge
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61451:126"/>
if that be not loose Reasoning, We are commanded
to Separate from Rome, who hath overturned the
foundation of Religion, Worships the Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Creator, therefore we are to Separate from
Christs true and Purest Churches and Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in them, If so be prophane men be keeped in
them: It is a senseless Consequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. III.</hi> Their <hi>Third</hi> Objection against the Truth
is taken from 1 <hi>Cor: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>. 11. But now I have written unto
you not to keep company</hi> &amp;c. Say they, We are forbidden
to eat our ordinary meat with wicked men, and far
more we are forbidden to eat at the Lords Table
with them. To this we Answer, That indeed it
is the shame of Christian Churches, and our sin,
that Scandalous and Ignorant Persons are admitted
to the Lords Table; But when they are admitted
partly through the neglect of Ministers, and partly
through abounding corruptions, It doth not follow
that every private Christian is to cast himself out of
the Church, because wicked men are admitted. As
to this place here spoken of, Its true every tender
Christian is forbidden to use Familiar Society with
Fornicators, But it is not simply forbidden, as if it
were unlawful at all times to eat with them; For even
<hi>Paul</hi> himself eats with Heathens <hi>Act:</hi> 27. 35. So the
thing here forbidden is, That the Lords People
should not use intimat Society with wicked men;
yet so as when they cannot get it eschewed, It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
both to eat and drink with them; As put the
case we could not get it otherwise, it were lawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>
for us to eat with them following <hi>Pauls</hi> practice
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61451:126"/>
And so it follows in the matter of the Lords Table,
If it be in Ministers power to hold them back, if they
do it, it is well; If not, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that private Christians who have no power
to debarr them, and so cannot get eating with them
eschewed, without neglecting of a duty, are bound
to <hi>Separate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> IV. Their <hi>Fourth</hi> Objection is from 1 <hi>Cor: 5. 6‚Äî
Know ye not that a litle leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</hi>
Scandalous men infect the Church; And the Church
being infected, infects the Worship; and so if I come
to the Worship it is infected to me, and I do sin.
Now this is a Consequence far from <hi>Pauls</hi> words, a
litle <hi>leaven,</hi> sayes he, <hi>leaveneth</hi> &amp;c. Therefore cast
out the Incestous man. But he doth not say, If he
be not put out; cast out your selves. As for that
they say that prophane men infect the Worship, It is
without ground: Its true prophane men oftimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
these among whom they live; But they do
not infect the worship: For the way that prophane
men infect these among whom they live, is not Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,
As the Pest infects every thing it toucheth;
but they infect by their evil example: And so a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
man may infect another man, but by his evil
example cannot infect the Worship, because the
Worship is not carried away with evil example,
as a man is: And so if I can keep my self from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their example, the worship is pure and clean
to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> V. Their last Objection is (say they My coming
to the Table with them is a countenancing of them
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61451:127"/>
in their profanation of the holy things: So I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with them in their sins, &amp; say <hi>Amen</hi> to what
they do: And therefore better for me to withdraw.
We Answer, this is a plausible Argument to deter
People that are tender, but when tryed, it will be
found weak; For if so be this Argument do hold
for Separating from the Lords Table, it will
conclude also that we should not hear Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them for our hearing Preaching with
them is a countenancing of them, as well as our
coming to the Sacrament with them; And the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man profaneth the holy things in the one, as
well as in the other? And by this it should follow
that Jesus Christ should have been polluted; which
were Blasphemy to speak, by His Preaching to
Prophane multitudes; For in That He countenanced
them. Therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> For a more full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
we say, Worshipping with them is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to their sin, except it were in our power
to hold them out, but not otherwise; Thou doest
say <hi>Amen</hi> to what they do profess, that They are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, doing the commanded Duty; But not to
Their Hypocritical Way in doing of It: Did Christ
say <hi>Amen</hi> to the Pharisees way of Hearing although
He Preached to Them: So neither doest thou: But
as is already said Thou approves of Them in so far as
They do the Commanded Duty; But that it is done
Impenitently, Thou by Thy joyning in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
approves it not. This for their Objections.</p>
                  <p>IV. For <hi>Use,</hi> Our first is this: To regrate that
there is so much occasion given to this Error in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61451:127"/>
Churches of Christ, We may regrate that there are
so many of the Members of the Church Prophane
and Wicked; And that People walk not like Their
Holy Calling; We may regrate that the Officers of
the Church, Ministers, and Elders, do not Purge
out Scandalous Persons, Do not Labour to find
Them and Censure Them, and debarr Them from
Communions; But most of all it is to be regrated,
That many of those, who should Purge out others,
Their Life is such that They deserve to be Purged
out as Scandalous Themselves: For this cause it is
that the Lord threatens to Rent the Church; And
if He should let men arise among our selves, under
pretence of Pious strictness, to cast at Our Worship,
We behoved to say, Just is the Lord: Although on
the other hand it is no excuse, but a fearful sin to Them,
who by Their carriage Rent and undoe the Church,
because of some Corruptions that are in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> II. The Second Use is, That ye would, not
think all alike Guilty that may encline to this Error
of Separating from Lawful Worship, because of
wicked Men's being admitted to it. It's true there
may be some Piously strict, that upon the one hand,
loath at that which is Good, when they cannot get
it but in wicked Mens company, And upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, because they cannot live without the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
therefore They encline to make up a Litle
Church of Good Men of Their Own choise: By
which means the Devil takes advantage of Their
zeal to make them dishonour God by runing to the
other extreme: Now although the Humour of such
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61451:128"/>
should not be given way to, yet those who encline
this way from a desire of strictness are much to be
Pitied. But on the other hand, we are not to think so
of the Ring-leaders of this Error; It hath been found
by experience that such have been more carried on
by a conceit of their Own Holiness, than any true
Love to Holiness it self; It hath been usually found
in Heady men who had a mind to make a Rupture
in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e Church, that this has been the Method they
used to walke in, To cry up Holiness in themselves,
and to cry down all who differed from them, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender:
That so they might carry all with them
at last; At least to Rent and divide the Church: To
such we will say nothing, but Christs Curse, and the
Churches for Renting her bowels, will fall on Them.</p>
                  <p>But unto the other we will speak something, that
is, To those who are piously Strict and really loath
at the good Service of God, because such Persons
are at it who should not be there. To those I shall say;
<hi>First,</hi> Know what it your Duty. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> What
is not your Duty in reference to Prophane Men; Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we mistake our Duty and leap over it, to what
is not our Duty: Now your Duty in reference to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Men, Is not to take your hands from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
because Their hands are at it; <hi>To</hi> turn
your backs on your Duty because Prophane Men join
with you in it; It will be but a small excuse to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
when God reckons with you, when the Lord
will say, What made you neglect such a Duty? to say.
Lord I grant it was my Duty, but I could not, because
such Men were at it: Therefore ye should know
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61451:128"/>
your Duty in reference to those, and it is this, In the
place where ye live, when ye see a fault committed,
ye should tell the guilty persons of it; If the Fault
be open, and a Fault ye can get proven, ye ought to
delate it to those who have power to Censure them,
If so be they may be gained by this mean; Or if not,
ye have done your Duty: Or if the Church do their
Duty in casting out the Obstinate, then ye have your
intent: But if so be that notwithstanding ye have
done your Duty, yet the Church do not Theirs, in
purging the House of God: In this case, ye are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
the matter to God, to mourn for it, ye are to
testify that ye do not approve their way, and in so
doing ye have done your Duty, and may have peace:
For the presence of the wicked Man makes not the
work sinful in it self to you, <hi>He eats and drinks Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to himself,</hi> And not to you; His presence doth
not make the Worship sinful to thee; And so it looses
thee not from they obligation to join in the Worship:
For if that were true, That the presence of wicked
Men did defile the Worship to Thee, then Christians
would be in a very hard condition: For there was
never a Church so pure, but there were some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it, whom a Man truly tender would think
should not be there; There was never a Church so
pure but a tender Man zealously strict would find
some to challenge; And so according to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
there should be no Church that a tender Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
could joyn with; And so he should be forced
to serve God apart and by himself alone: And
this hath been the <hi>Separatists</hi> way, They have Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61451:129"/>
from one Church to another, till at last they
could get none to join with; And so turned <hi>Seekers,</hi>
that is, A <hi>Sect</hi> who think there are None they can
join with; And therefore, they cast off all Publick
Duties, and serve God by themselves alone; Because
they can see none so Holy as themselves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye would suspect Zeal when joyned with Error;
And fear Error most when it is covered over with
Zeal: For Error is never so dangerous, as when it
gets on the mask of Zeal, It being then most cruel and
most impudent: People then have no will to medle
with it, lest they should seem to be Enemies to True
Piety; And therefore because it is suffered and born
with, it turns impudent until it undo all.</p>
                  <p>I only give One word to guard this, and so I shall
end. There is not one Error that we refute, but if
not guarded, Prophane Men may abuse it, and so
may they This, to cast at those who are piously strict,
though in an orderly way: And therefore, We say it
is every Christians Duty to walk tenderly, and to
be so strict towards others, as God requires of him.
The thing we have Refuted as an Error is only this,
<hi>That because a Man cannot get all Duties gone about by
All, so strictly as God commands; That therefore he will
Separate from altogether:</hi> But withal we did show,
That not only a Man should be strict on himself
(where right strictness will alwayes begin) but also
do what in him lyes, according to his Duty and
Calling, That the Ordinances of God may be keeped
pure by others.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 Corinth. 1. 10.</bibl>
               <q>Now I beseech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that
there be no Divisions among you: but that ye
be perfectly join'd together in the same Mind,
and in the same Judgement.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Text begins a new Purpose, so it is
not necessary to speak much for clearing of
the Dependance and Cohesion: Only ye
would know somewhat of the State of this Church
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61451:130"/>
at the time when this Epistle was written, which
will help us not a little to take up the Occasion and
Scope of the Words read. <hi>Paul</hi> having planted a
Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> was after driven from thence by
the sury of the Jews, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 12.
In whose absence, partly through the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
partly through the subtilty of false Apostles, the
Church was rent in Factions; some taking part with
one Pastor and some with another, according to the
diverse estimation they held them in, for their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Eloquence, great Knowledge, and other parts.
The Church being thus rent, the Apostle addresseth
himself timously to the Cure of this so Great an Evil:
But because he was almost out of request with the
most part of that People; tho as he himself, <hi>Chap.
4. v.</hi> 15. declares, he had <hi>begotten them in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
through the Gospel;</hi> Therefore as a skill'd Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
being to administer a bitter Potion, he suggereth
the brim of the Cup, by shewing, That whatever
was Their respect to him, yet his Affection did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the same towards them; And this he insisteth
on from the beginning to the <hi>tenth Verse,</hi> wherein
he falls upon the Sore he intends to Cure, to wit,
Their Factions and Schism's, Obtesting them grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Name of Jesus Christ, That they would set
about the Healing of these woeful Rents, before
they should turn to worse.</p>
            <p>In the Words there are two things, 1, A Duty
to which they are exhorted. 2. Some Arguments
moving them to set about this Duty. The Duty is
last in order of the Words, and propounded in three
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61451:130"/>
Sentences: 1. <hi>That ye all speak the same thing. 2. That
there be no Divisions among you. 3. That ye be perfectly
joined together in the same Mind, and in the same Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The Duty pressed in all these may be taken
up in <hi>two.</hi> 1. An Evil they were to Eschew. 2. A
Good which they were to Follow. The Evil to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schewed
is in the second Sentence, to wit, <hi>That there
be no Divisions</hi> or (as it is in the Original) <hi>Schism's
among you.</hi> I shall not enter to speak of the nature of
<hi>Schism,</hi> or how it differeth from <hi>Heresy;</hi> It is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the opening up of the Text, to know what
Divisions or Schisms the Apostle meaneth by here:
And that is know'n from the following <hi>Verse,</hi> to wit,
Their Factious sidings in extolling One Minister,
and debasing Another, with many fruitless Janglings
and other bad consequences following thereupon,
whereof doubtless this was One, The engaging of
the Ministers themselves in Parties for upholding
their Dependants, So <hi>Verse 12.‚ÄîEvery one of you
saith</hi> I <hi>am of Paul, and</hi> I <hi>of Apollos, and</hi> I <hi>of Cephas‚Äî</hi>
One saith <hi>Paul</hi> is best, let us follow him: Another
sayeth, Nay, but <hi>Apollos</hi> is best, we'll follow him:
A third saith, <hi>Cephas</hi> is better than them both, I'le
follow none of them: Now away with these fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Contests saith he.</p>
            <p>In the next place. There is the Good to be Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and that is threefold, in opposition to three
sorts of Evils which usually accompany <hi>Schism</hi> in a
Church.</p>
            <p>The first Evil accompanying <hi>Schism,</hi> is, Flat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
first among Ministers, and next among
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61451:131"/>
People; when not only their Opinions do differ, but
they are so hot upon the Business, that at all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they proclaim their Differences<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> In opposition to
this, he exhorts them <hi>To speak the same thing,</hi> that is,
They would beware of Contradictions in a matter
of so small importance; Wherein they agreed, they
would speak to that; Wherein they differ'd, they
would forbear others, spending their time and parts
upon more edifying purpose.</p>
            <p>The second Evil accompanying <hi>Schism</hi> in a
Church, is, Renting of Affections, When the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one Body turn cold-rife one towards another
and their Affection dyeth: In opoosition to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
he exhorts them to be <hi>Joined together in the same
Mind,</hi> or the same Affection. It's true, the Word
here rendred <hi>Mind,</hi> is used indifferently for the whole
Faculties of the Soul, as the Understanding, Will,
and Affections; But the Understanding being spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to under the Word <hi>Judgement,</hi> which followeth;
We think with some of the best Interpreters, That
by the <hi>Mind</hi> here is meaned the <hi>Affections:</hi> So the
thing he presseth in the second Place, is, That not
only they would forbear others in the matter of their
Publick Expressions, but also would labour to blow
at the Coal of their almost dying Affections</p>
            <p>The third Evil accompanying a <hi>Schism,</hi> is, Difference
of Judgement; And in opposition to this, he exhorts
them to be <hi>Perfectly joined in the same Judgement.</hi> The
meaning is, They would labour to remove the Root
of the Difference by coming to One <hi>Judgement:</hi> Not
as if the Apostle had been careless what Judgement
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61451:131"/>
they had been of, providing they had been One; No,
the one part of every Contradiction is Truth, and
there is no Truth which the Apostle would have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Peace.</p>
            <p>This for the Duty pressed: Next there are some
Arguments perswading to this Duty. As 1. There is
the Apostles Insinuation, partly in his Affectionate
Exhortation, <hi>I beseech you,</hi> partly in his lovely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
<hi>Brethren.</hi> 2. There is his Grave Obtesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion‚Äî<hi>By
the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>‚ÄîThat
is to say, as the Name of Christ is dear to you,
which ye profess so much respect unto, so set about
the Cure of these Factions and Fractious Sidings and
Schisms, by which His Name suffereth so much.
There is a third Argument to enforce this Duty, in
the words <hi>perfectly joined,</hi> whereby the Apostle hints
at the great Evil the Church was under by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Schism,</hi> and the great good they should attain to
by the removal of it. The word in the Original is
borrowed from the Office of Chirurgeons, and that
part of it which consists in the mending of broken
Bones, and setting in joynt of Dislocated Members:
So it imports 1. That through occasion of the Schism
they were put all out of joynt: All the Members of
the Church were Dislocated, and therefore unfit,
so long as they remained in that case, for doing of
any good Office to the Body. 2. It imports, that their
following of his Advice for removing of the Schism,
would set every Member of the Body in it's own
place, and so enable the Body for going about acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
profitable unto it self, which now (the whole
Members being out of joynt) it could not do. This</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:61451:132"/>
This much for opening up the meaning of the
Words. Divers points of Truth, arising from the
several branches of the Text, might here be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
but I intend to insist upon One arising from
the scope which will comprehended the most part of
the rest; It is this, <hi>Vnity in the Church, is a thing
much to be laboured for and sought after; and Division
and Schism in a Church, is much to be eschewed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In prosecuting this Doctrine I shall first distinguish
<hi>Vnion,</hi> That we may know what <hi>Vnion</hi> is meaned.
2. I shall confirm the point. 1. By Scripture. 2. By
Reason, 3. I shall apply the Doctrine for our <hi>Vse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, To know what <hi>Vnion</hi> the Text and
Doctrine speaks of: It's fit you know, That there are
several sorts of <hi>Union.</hi> 1. There is an Union of the
Church Invisible, the tye and bond whereof is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Graces: All the Members of the Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
are United to Christ the Head by Faith,
and one to another by Love. This is not the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here meaned, The Text speaks of a Visible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church Visible, In Opposition to a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Rent and Schism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an Union of the Church Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of it's Members among themselves. This
again is twofold; The first is That <hi>Vnion,</hi> which is
necessary to the Being of a Church, and the Being
of a Member: So that a Church cannot be a Church,
nor a Man a Member of the Visible Church without
it: Wherein this <hi>Vnion</hi> consists, is Controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Us and the <hi>Independants.</hi> But the Doctrine
meaneth not of This <hi>Vnion</hi> either; So we insist not
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61451:132"/>
on it. The <hi>Vnion</hi> pressed in the Text, is such, that
the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> for the time did want, and yet
remained a Church. The <hi>Union</hi> therefore here mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is, A second sort of <hi>Union</hi> belonging to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church: To wit, That which is necessary to
the Well-being of a Church; without the which tho
a Church remain a Church, yet she losseth much of
her outward Beauty, her Authority is much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
her great work, which is the edification of her
self in Love (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13.) is much retarded: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a Church, but not such a Church as is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<hi>Cant. 6. 10. Who is she that looketh forth as the
Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as an Army with Banners?</hi> A divided Church is
not such a Church.</p>
            <p>But for further understanding of the <hi>Vnion</hi> here
pressed, ye would know that this <hi>Union</hi> which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Well-being of a Church is <hi>Threefold.</hi>
1. There is an <hi>Union</hi> in Judgement, when there is no
considerable Difference among the Members of the
Church, in the matter of Opinion; When all <hi>Think
the same thing.</hi> And this is here pressed, <hi>Be prefectly
joined in one Judgement.</hi> 2. There is an <hi>Union</hi> in Heart
and Affections spoken of <hi>Act. 4. 32. The multitude of
them that believed were of one Heart, and of one Soul.</hi>
And this <hi>Union</hi> is also here pressed,‚Äî<hi>Be perfectly join'd
together in the same Mind,</hi> or in Love and Affection, as
we shew'd in the opening up of the Words. 3. There
is an <hi>Union</hi> in Practice, and that is, when whatever
Difference there is in Judgement, yet it's not openly
proclaim'd: Publick Contradictions and Eristick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61451:133"/>
are eschewed, and an unanimous joint practice
in these things, wherein there is Agreement, is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
And this <hi>Union</hi> is also pressed in the Text,
I <hi>beseech you‚Äîthat ye all speak the same thing.</hi> So it's
clear the Text means all these <hi>three</hi> sorts of <hi>Union,</hi> the
Doctrine intends them All, and as might be made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
other Scriptures press them All. Only this,
we would know, the Order wherein they are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to wit, So as every Breach in the Former, is not
to make a Breach in the Latter; Every Difference in
Judgement, is not to make a Rent in Heart or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
Nor, tho a Rent be in both, doth it infer
necessarly a Divided Practice, at least in these things
wherein there is Agreement: And for that, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is clear, especially <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3. 15, 16 where <hi>v.
15</hi> the Apostle supposeth difference of Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Philippians,</hi> as to the point he is there speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and subjoineth for matter of Practice, <hi>v. 16.
Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us
walk by the same Rule,</hi> That is to say, Tho we cannot
agree in all things, yet let us eschew the prolaiming
of Our Differences, by Our contrary Practices.</p>
            <p>This much for the first thing, to wit, What <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
the Doctrine presseth. It is an <hi>Union</hi> necessary
to the Well-being of the Visible Church, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
an Union in <hi>Judgement,</hi> an Union in <hi>Affection,</hi> an
Union in <hi>Practice:</hi> An Union all these wayes is to be
sought for and laboured after, yet so as, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain to Union in the Former, we are yet still
to endeavour it in the Latter.</p>
            <p>For Confirmation of this Truth we might cite
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61451:133"/>
several Scriptures. 1. These wherein this Union is
promised to the Church, and that as a rich Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Blessing, such as <hi>Jer. 32. 39.‚ÄîI will give them
one Heart, and one way that they may fear Me for ever</hi>‚ÄîThe
like is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 22. 2. These Scriptures
wherein this <hi>Vnion</hi> is highly commended: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Ps. 133. 1. Behold how good and how pleasant it
is, for Brethren to dwell together in Vnity</hi>‚Äîand so
through the whole. 3. These Scriptures which
hold out the Mediator's Prayer to the Father for this
Union, <hi>Joh. 17. 21. That they all may be one, as Thou
Father art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be
one in Vs</hi>‚Äîand so <hi>v.</hi> 23. 4. Those Scriptures
where this Union is expresly enjoyned and pressed
whereof there are many; Such as <hi>Philipp. 2. 1, 2, 3.
If there be‚Äîany consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
Love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any Bowels and
Mercies; Fulfil ye My Joy, that ye be like minded, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi> And
2 <hi>Cor. 13. 11. Finally Brethren, farewel‚Äîbe of one
mind, live in peace‚Äî.</hi> And lastly, these Scriptures
where Division contrary to Unity is condemned, as
<hi>Rom. 16. 17.‚ÄîI beseech you, Brethren, mark them
which cause Divisions and Offences, and avoid them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for further Confirmation of this Truth, we
shall in the next place, bring foreward some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
concluding the equity and necessity, of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, and entertaining of Unity in the Church,
which shall also serve as motives to the Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Union furthers Edification: So <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3.
Union is pressed; And One Fruit among many to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61451:134"/>
be reaped hereby, is <hi>(v. 12.) the edifying of the Body of
Christ.</hi> And as Unity furthers Edification, so Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
marreth it; Divisions in a Church, tho about
small things, yet if stiffly mantain'd, prove a great
stumbling Block to the Weak; they are put to doubt
all Truths, because Men gracious and learned doubt
of some: So Division not only marreth progress in
the building, but striketh at the very foundation of
what is already built.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Divisions in a Church make the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
contemptible: Of all Men Ministers suffer most
this way, because usually they are most active in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and upholding the Division; and usually
even these who have Truth for them, suffer much
(if not most) this way: <hi>Paul,</hi> tho an Apostle, and
a Man for Truth, yet he lost much of the former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
he had amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though once
they would have pluck'd out their Eyes for him, yet
through the Division, their Distemper grew to such
an hight, that he was look'd on as <hi>Contemptible‚Äîrude
in speech</hi>‚Äîyea <hi>A Fool,</hi> and what not? as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from 2 <hi>Cor: 10. 10. Ch.</hi> 11. 6, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. The Essential Unity of the Church, and
the many things wherein a Church agreeth that way,
should enforce this Union. The Apostle <hi>Paul, Eph.
4.</hi> draweth a strong Argument for Unity and Peace
in the Church, from this Ground. The Duty is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<hi>v. 3. Endeavouring to keep the Vnity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the Bond of Peace.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. it is pressed by
this Argument, <hi>There is on Body, and one Spirit,‚ÄîOne
Lord, one Faith, one Baptism; One God and Father
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61451:134"/>
of all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi>‚ÄîHere are many <hi>Ones</hi> together in two or
three lines, as if he had said, What a shame is it for
you who are so many wayes <hi>One,</hi> to rent in pieces
for a thing of so small moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Divisions in a Church turn away every
Man's Eye from his main Task; I mean from the
joint opposing of Satan's main Design, to be wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one with another: It's Satans Policy when he
intends to bear down Truth in a Church, to set those
who should oppose him most, by the Ears about
smaller things, that so he may carry his point with
less difficulty; herein making use of <hi>Matchiavils</hi> (or
rather his own) Principle <hi>divide &amp; impera,</hi> Divide
and Carry. It's often seen that the nearer those who
differ come to one another, they drive on their point
against others with the greater Animosity and Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the Jews and Samaritans were at greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
than Jews and Heathens: And the Reason is
this, The less the Difference is, they have the more
hopes to bring others to their mind, hence their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
On-setts are more furious, and their Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the more bitter, the higher they were in their
hopes; and in the mean time while they mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as to bear down one another, Satan
cometh good speed in bearing down of Truth and
Them and All.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Union when once lost in a Church, is
hardly ever again attained: We read <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 39. that
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> parted, but we hear nothing of
their meeting again. And Church History sheweth
us, <q>That Schisms in a Church for almost just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61451:135"/>
have continued incureable for some Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
until not only the Authors and Ring-leaders
of the Schism, but also their Disciples were remo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved
by Death. <hi>Osiand. Gent.</hi> 4.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. When a Rent is made in a Church, as it
is hardly curable, so it still groweth wider: It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
to know whereabout a Rent begins, than where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
it will end. The greatest of Church Divisions
(some of them at least) have been observed to have
had but small Beginnings, hence is that commonly
received Maxim <hi>Omne Schisma desinit in haresin.</hi> The
Faction of the Donatists at first made but a Schism
separating from the Communion of the Church, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
pretence of some faulty Officers and mixed
Communions, but it was not long until they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
several Heresies.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine being thus Explained and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
from Scripture<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and Reason, I shall now apply
it to <hi>Use.</hi> Our first <hi>Use</hi> is for Refutation. The Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
refutes, at least layeth a just <hi>odium</hi> upon; the
Doctrine of <hi>Separation,</hi> and that Way which is called
<hi>Independant</hi> or <hi>Congregational,</hi> in so far as it is made
up of such Principles, as lay a Foundation for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Renting of the Church: Of which Principles
I shall reckon <hi>Four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, That Principle, whereby They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Lawfulness of gathering Churches, out of
Churches, acknowledged by themselves to be True
Churches. A most dividing Principle, in so far as
it gives way for every Man to Separate from his
Own, and to join himself with another Church
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61451:135"/>
supposed Purer, with contempt of the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
To gather Churches out of Churches, is
the way to destroy, but not to heal diseased Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
It is to destroy many Churches for making up
of One, as if one going about the Cure of a Natural
Body should cut off and take out all the sound Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and leave the rotten and diseased Members,
either to Cure one another or to perish. A strange
and desperate way of Cure.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Dividing Principle in that Way, is, The
Rule according to which they will have Ecclesiastick
Judgement pass'd upon their Church Members, to
wit, Conviction of their Inward good Estate, which
Rule being variable and uncertain, some will judge
one way, some another, according as they are more
or less enclined to Charity; yea the same Man at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, will have a various Judgement of the
Inward State of another, according as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
and Probabilities, (by which only he is led
to judge of what is within,) are more fully or spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
represented: Hence there is a Seed of Breach
upon Breach: But God hath not left his Church in
the matter of Authoritative judging to walk by such
uncertain Rules.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Dividing Principle in the <hi>Independant</hi>
Way is this, That all Church Power is solely in a
Particular Congregation. Hence if a Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
go wrong, tho but made up of seven Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(which is a competent number with them) there
is no Authoritative Mean in all the Churches of the
World to reclaim them. This must needs open a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61451:136"/>
Door to as many Divisions as there are Churches.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Dividing Principle is, That there is not
a Catholick Visible Church, yea no Church Visible,
but a Particular Congregation; and another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
they hold which followeth upon this, to wit, That
a Minister can exerce no Acts as a Minister, to any
but those of his own Flock. Hence 1. There can
be no Communion of Churches as Churches, there
remaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>h only a Communion of Members: There
can be no Church Act from one Church, or many
towards another. The Results and Determinations
of the most Famous Synods, made up of never so
many Churches, are to be look'd upon but as the
Actings of so many private Christians. Yea, 2. Hence
it will follow that there can be no Communion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Members of several Congregations, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church Ordinances, as in hearing the Word
jointly from a sent Minister, in Receiving the Seals
together; For according to this Principle a Minister
cannot Authoritatively Preach, nor in any respect
Administer Baptism or the Lords Supper unto any,
though never so Gracious, except to those of his own
Flock; no not tho they be occasionally present when
he is dispensing these Ordinances unto his Own:
Which Consequence is expresly granted by some of
the chief of that Perswasion. So it is a Principle
which destroyeth all Communion of Churches and
Members; and therefore inconsistent with Union.</p>
            <p>Several such like Principles in That Way might
be reckoned out, Concerning which the Doctrine
warrandeth us to say this much; If Unity be so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61451:136"/>
and so much to be sought after, then such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Principles cannot be of God.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Second Use</hi> is for Direction: If Unity be so
necessary, and so much to be laboured for, then we
are to bewail that we our selves are so far, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day a step further from it: Our Divisions grow
I fear all the <hi>three</hi> wayes, and in all ranks; Our
Heads are divided, our Tongues divided, yea and
our Hearts divided, Synods are divided, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are divided, Congregations divided: Ministers
divided, People divided; yea, and in some places
Families divided: Husband and Wife, Father and
Son, Mother and Daughter, Master and Servant, yea
and all divided. We are as Mad-men, every one
eating <hi>the flesh of his own Arm. Manasseh, Ephraim;
and Ephraim Manasseh: And they together against Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>‚ÄîAn
Evil never enough lamented, and the
more to be lamented that there is no appearance how
it shall be helped. There are many things may make
us look upon the present Division as our saddest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and greatest Weight: I shall reckon <hi>Six</hi>
things.</p>
            <p>1. The many particular Evils which upon an exact
search, it will be found Our Divisions have brought
upon Peoples own Spirits. How much of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time is spent in vain jangling, by which our
Heart cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e made worse? Many, I fear too
too many so taken up with their Heads that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their Hearts; the sweetness and profit of mutual
converse and fellowship is much marred; Our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
freedom and benefit that way much impaired:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61451:137"/>
Our Peace with God by our hot Debates<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> untender
Expressions, and bitter and unnecessary Reflections
of times brangled and shaken.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Thing that may make Us look on our
Present Divisions as our great Weight, is, The name
of Praise which this Church hath had for <hi>Unity</hi> in
times by-past amongst the Reformed Churches. In
the Harmony of Confessions, the Preface to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this as a rare Priviledge of This Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
many, and that which makes Her very Name
Famous among Churches abroad, That for the space
almost of Sixty Years She had keep'd Unity with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
without either Schism or Heresy. Now if U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
hath been formerly this Church's Praise, how
sad and weighty is it, and how woeful men are we,
that this Breach should be under our Hand?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Thing to make our present Division
weighty is, That it is the greatest Weight which
Gods People up and down the Land lyeth under, it's
a Weight beyond all other Weights and Sufferings:
And if it be their Weight, it ought for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be much more ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our Divisions, and Courses taken for
carrying them on, hath given a deeper Inward
Wound, to the Government of Christ's House than
all the Outward Power of the World could have
done The leading of us by pairs to a Stake for our
adhering to the Government and Constitution of our
Mother Church, our Imprisonment, Banishment, the
laying of Congregations desolate for that Cause,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61451:137"/>
could not have shaken the minds of many, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to these Truths, so much as our own Divisions
and Practices following thereupon have done. An
Inward Disease is more dangerous, and weakeneth
more than Outward Blows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our Division may and ought to be the
more weighty, the more of Judgement is in it: And
certainly there is much of Wrath and Judgement in
it. It is a judicial stroak; For all see it's Evil, the
most part are weary of it, and yet cannot fall upon
the right way for putting an end to it: Yea, no
course hitherto essayed for Union, but it hath proved
an hightning of our Division; And so it will until
it come to that hight which God in His just Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will have it at; However it's clear that Wrath
is in it, much of Judgement is in it, and that should
make it weighty: We side one against another, and
God is siding against us both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This should make our Division have a
particular Weight with us in this Synod, That we
drink most of its bitter Fruits: We are the Stage
whereon this cruel Dividing Spirit acts its Game
most: None in time past so United as We, but none
now so Divided; And even this may give Us sad
thoughts of our Accession to the beginning and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
of this woeful Rent.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Third Use</hi> is of Direction also following
upon the former, If <hi>Union</hi> be such a good; if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
such an evil; And if our Divisions be so
much to be bewailed; Then we ought to have some
thoughts towards the making up of our breach<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:61451:138"/>
there ought to be some guardings against these evils
which may follow upon it, until it be made up.</p>
            <p>The Prosecuting of this Use, as it is the most
part of our Work, so it is the most difficult; and I
fear also, considering our present Distempers, and
deep Engagements lying on every one almost to his
Own Way, that for the time it shall be but Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
Yet being led to it by the word of Truth, and
not knowing when the Lord may make it have it's
own Fruits, whether now or afterwards, I shall
with the Lords help adventure on it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in pressing this <hi>Use,</hi> I shall speak to <hi>three</hi> things.
1. I shall show what things I conceive as necessary
to be eyed by us while we aim at <hi>Union,</hi> if so we would
have Our aim's effectual. 2. Because a Compleat <hi>Union</hi>
is not soon to be expected, I shall give some Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the Management of Our Differences, so as
the Church of Christ may have the less hurt by them
at least. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall propound some Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to People, for preventing of stumbling, and
making Shipwrack upon our Divisions.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> I shall mention <hi>Six</hi> things we should
carry alongs with us while we aim at <hi>Union.</hi> Unto
all which I premit One General, as tending to give
Life to all the rest, without which all our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for <hi>Union,</hi> though otherwise never so regular,
though guided with never so much Prudence,
though prosecuted with never so much zeal, will
prove ineffectual; and it's this: That both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and People should be more in seeking after
God's Face: So long as we remain at a distance
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61451:138"/>
from him, no wonder we grope as Blind-men in the
dark, and cannot come nigh one to another: It's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath much withdrawn
from the Spirits of his People: There is not so
much of Life conveyed by Preaching, not such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
granted in Prayer; no such delight in Means;
no such joy in his presence; This is granted by all
and in a manner regrated by all, but lamented by few;
And fewer yet make it their work to have the
Lord returning and shewing himself as sometimes
he hath done: And until this be, we can look for
the less success of any attempts made for the removal
of this our sore stroak: But if God would return, It
were then easy work: One glimpse of him, filling the
House with his Glory, would scatter the Clouds of
mutual Jealousies, make us, as men ashamed, steal
from all our Dividing Principles; would put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
all our turbulent Distempers; and make us
blush at our proud and selfish Animosities: O! for
more of God, then would all be well. But I come
to the particulars to be eyed by us while we aim at
<hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is not to be expected that Our <hi>Union</hi> will
begin at our Uniting in Judgment, In that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
about which our unhappy Differences began.
It was the Judgment of some from the beginning,
that the standing at a distance in other things, until
we should be united in That, should put Us at a
further distance, even in That. Our <hi>Union</hi> in <hi>Practice</hi>
first, will be the shortest cut to bring us unto <hi>Union</hi>
of Judgement about that Question, if ever we shall
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61451:139"/>
come to it at all. Hence publick Debatings before
the People, and such as tend to make others odious
who are not of our Way, is not the way for <hi>Union.</hi>
Such work irritateth, but convinceth not. It's true
no Truth may be quit for <hi>Union,</hi> No, not the least,
<hi>Quisquil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> praetiosissima, The very refuse of
Truth is most precious:</hi> Yet that the positive asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of some Truths may be forborn for Peace's
sake, I believe is granted by All, and there is good
reason for it: Only there is one exception here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<hi>to wit,</hi> when Truth is impugned, then there
is a necessity to speak for it, at least till there be such
a Testimony given to that Opposed Truth, as may

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e rested upon. And in this Case some may be
made unwillingly to speak, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was
once in defence of his own Estimation, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 11.
I am become a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me:
for I ought to have been commended of you:</hi>‚ÄîAs if he
should say, God knows, I have no more delight
to speak of this subject, than ye have to hear me,
but your Indiscretion forceth me to it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> thing to be carried along with us, while
we aim at Union, is, no union of this kind of
which the Doctrine speaks, can be expected in the
Church, except there be an <hi>Union</hi> in one Supreme
Representative; land that such an one whose Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we may stand under for the present. As it is in the
Civil State, so is it in the Church as to this purpose,
No <hi>Union</hi> can be there, as of one actually incorporate
Body, except it be under one and the same Supreme
Rulers: So is it in the Church, So long as there is no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61451:139"/>
agreement about One and the same Supreme Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
under whose Authority we may stand for
the present, But one part standeth for it's Authority,
another is contrary unto it, or setting up another
against it, In this case the matter is clear, there is
no compleat <hi>Union</hi> but a fixed <hi>Schism,</hi> or at the best
a strong tendency unto it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> thing to be eyed is, If so Our <hi>Union</hi>
must be under one Supreme Representative, then
such ways of Union will do no good as carry not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
the Body: An Union if not with the Body,
instead of healing, doth widen the Rent. A resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or desire to unite with a few not caring for the
rest, will not produce an union, I mean of the Church,
altho it may be of a stronger Party in the Church.
These few would possibly as gladly unite as others
would have them, if it were not evidently a
strengthening of the Breach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Yet a Part ought to labour with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for condescending, as low as warrantably can be,
for Peace's sake: Only a Caveat must be here, They
are so to deal with the Body to condescend for <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as to beware of making a new Rupture in the
Body upon their not granting: For that were in a
desperate way to make a new Rent, because others
will not take Our way for removing of the Old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If we desire an hearty cordial <hi>Vnion,</hi> it
would be endeavoured without rubbing upon the
Credit. 1. Of Persons. 2. Of Parties. 3. Of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
If the Credit of all can be held up, it's
well. He is no friend to <hi>Vnion</hi> that would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61451:140"/>
the contrair: But if some must suffer, Love to
the Publick and Zeal for God, will teach That the
former is to yeild to the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Persons to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Credit both of Persons and Parties,
yea, and of both Parties themselves, if need be,
are to stoop for upholding the Authority of Divine
Ordinances. A litle of this Self-denial would do
much good: But how litle of it is there to be found?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Dividing Principles and such as tend of
their own nature to obstruct <hi>Union,</hi> should be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
There is One Principle often spoken of by
some, and now made more publick, which if main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
in Our judgment will close the door upon
<hi>Union</hi> in hast, to wit, <hi>That it is unlawful to sit in an
Assembly with those, who have enacted persecution against
the Godly.</hi> And this in the sence of the Propounders, &amp;
as it is expresly, tho injuriously, applyed by them, is as
much as to say, It is unlawful to joyn in any Assembly
made up for the most part of those who acted in
and approved of Our late Controverted Assemblies:
Now if it be unlawful to joyn in an Assembly made
up for the most part of such, why not also unlawful
to join in a Synod or in a Presbytry likewise made
up of such, yea and to join at a Communion Table
where the most part are such. And indeed some (of
the People chiefly) draw out their Principle to this
full length. A Principle which (to say no worse of
it) striketh at the very throat of Peace; and, if
stood to, makes it desperat; and so I hope is, and
will be disowned by all who cordially pretend to
Peace and <hi>Union</hi> in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:61451:140"/>
These I conceive and many moe should be eyed by
Us in Our aiming at <hi>Union,</hi> if we would have Our
endeavours effectual: But because a Compleat <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in an ordinary way is not to be so soon expected,
I shall in the next place give <hi>Two</hi> Directions for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
our Differences; So as the Church of Christ
may have less hurt by them at least.</p>
            <p>The first Direction is, That we ought to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these Tentations, which Our Standing Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may readily make way for, Whereof I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Tentation is this, An oversight of every
other fault almost, whether in Ministers or Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
providing they be true to the Party. A Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is a dangerous thing, and in nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than in this, That it driveth men, if not all the
more tender, to take fidelity unto the Party to be the
prime, if not the only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> and badge of honesty,
and enclines them to look on all other things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Corrupt Principles, or loose Practices, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
Infirmities. A woeful Tentation! and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
both to Truth and Piety; And therefore
ought so much the more to be guarded against on
both hands,</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Tentation is, The secret wishing after,
and rejoycing in the Slips one of another. An Evil
so woeful that <hi>David</hi> complains to God of it even
in his avowed Enemies, <hi>Ps. 38. 16.‚ÄîWhen my
Foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</hi> And
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> complaineth of it in his false Friends, <hi>Ch.
20. v.</hi> 10. They‚Äî<hi>watched for my halting.</hi> And
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61451:141"/>
yet an Evil that even Good men, if once engaged
in Parties, will have a Battel with,</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Tentation upon Our standing Divided,
and which is also to be guarded against, is, A bending
of Our selves to the outmost of Light, and possibly
beyond it, for strengthning of our selves, to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these things, in relation to these who now
Rule, which not long since we would have abhorred
both in our selves and others. It is very possible that
as Gifts blind the Eyes of the Wise, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. So
the seeming advantage unto that which we conceive
Truth, may draw out somewhat like an Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such like Work, from those of our own
Judgement, and if these do approve, it is the less
matter (think we) that others do disapprove: But
we ought to remember there are others to sift our
Actions: Forreign Churches abroad, our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
being sober and settled, and above all God
the Judge of All.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Direction for managing our Differences,
is, That we ought not to be so taken up with others
as to take our Eye off from guarding against that
which is Satan's main design against the Church of
Christ at this time. Satan does as a subtile Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
labour to raise a Mutiny among the Forces which
should oppose him, that while they are wrangling
one with another, he may carry his Point, without
stroke of Sword.</p>
            <p>Being to insist a little on this Direction, I shall
first speak to what I conceive to be Satan's main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the Church at this time. 2, I shall give
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61451:141"/>
some Directions to manage our Differences, So, as
not to further this his main design, nor yet to be
short-coming in our Duty against it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> For taking up what is Satan's great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
we shall in a word or two lay before you a
wonderful Contexture, as it were of God's Wisdom
and Satan's Malice, since the first beginnings of the
Christian Church even untill now. There is no
Truth almost but Satan's Malice hath set it self in
some one Age of the Church or other, to bear it
down; And God's Wisdom hath still overshot Satan,
making use of his Malice in opposing Truth, for the
further clearing of that Truth, which he intendeth
most to obscure and darken. Satan's first design in
the first Ages of the Christian Church was to beat
down that great Fundamental Truth of <hi>Christs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:</hi>
But after long debate this Truth was fully
cleared by the means of several Worthies, whose
Spirits the Lord stirred up in these Ages to mantain
That so much opposed Truth: Satan therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beat off this strong Fort of Christianity retired
a little, and laboured next to bear down the Truth
of <hi>Christs Humanity:</hi> But the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>h hereof, the
more it was opposed, growing the brighter, The
Lord making Light break up convincingly in the
midst of Hot Debates; Satan retired a little further
yet, and bent his whole force in the following Ages
against the <hi>Vnity of Christs Person:</hi> And next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Distinction of his Natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Satan not prevailing this Way either, he set
himself to undermine Christ Jesus in all His Offices.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61451:142"/>
1. By setting up the Infallibility of Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
against His Prophetical Office. 2. The Doctrine
of Merit in the matter of Justification against His
Priestly Office. 3. The Doctrine of Free-will and
power of it in Man's Conversion to God, against the
Inward part of His Kingly Office. And for the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part of it, he set himself to wrest the Scepter
of Christ's Government from His own Office-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and put it in the Hands of Popes, Cardinals,
Arch-bishops and Bishops. But after long Contest,
Truth is now aboundantly cleared and confirmed in
all these. Thus, as One saith, the Lord Jesus hath
been content to dispute His Ground by Inches with
the Devil, until almost He hath beat him out of
all; only Satan hath no will to quit it so, it seems
to us he is now giving his last and sorest On-set; on
which in a desperate way he is to venture all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his design is evident, to cast all in a Confusion.
First, By trampling under foot the Outward Court
of God's House, I mean the Constitution of His
Church Visible, by the Doctrine of Renting and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi>
And next to deprive the Catholick Church
Visible, and all Her considerable Members, of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by the Doctrine of <hi>Independancy,</hi> which
confineth the whole Power of the Keys within the
narrow circuit of a Particular Congregation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all the Particular Churches are left as so many
small Boats in a storm, to dash one against another,
having no Intrinsical authoritative Mean to make
them steer an even Course without rushing one upon
another. Thus Satan aimeth to cast all in confusion,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61451:142"/>
that he may undo all. What in former Ages he could
not do in destroying Gospel Truths by Piece-meal
and one by one, he intends now to do it by whole
sale, and all at once; For if once the bottom of the
Ship be split, and the Rudder broken, the precious
Ware contain'd in it, can hardly be preserved. Now
that Satan's main design is to deface these Truths
which are about the Constitution and Government
of the Visible Church, that thereby all may be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Confusion, appeareth, In that not only the
method God hath hitherto keeped, doth point at it;
There being few other Points of Truth to clear, but
also the thing speaketh for it self, the main speat of
the Errors of the time running directly contrary to
these; So that certainly, as God intends to clear
Truth in these, so it's not the least part of Satan's
main design against the Church of Christ at this time
to obscure Truth in these.</p>
            <p>This then being Satan's design, I shall in the next
place give some Directions how to manage our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
so, as not to further this main design, nor
yet be short coming in our Duty against it; Of which
Directions I shall reckon <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We ought to examine Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
even tho by us conceived just and lawful,
How far they may contribute for furtherance of
that Design; and in that respect should be more
circumspect and sparing at least in medling with
them. Thus the Apostle <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 2. 3. would not
Circumcise <hi>Titus,</hi> tho Circumcision at that time was
a thing Lawful, as appears from his Circumcising
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61451:143"/>
of <hi>Timothy, Act.</hi> 16. 3. much about the same time,
and yet he would not Circumcise <hi>Titus:</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is <hi>v.</hi> 4. There were <hi>False Brethren</hi> present; who
would have taken advantage of That his Practice,
to confirm themselves in their opposition to that
Truth, which Satan intended most to bear down at
that time; to wit, The freedom of the Christian
Church from the yoke of Mosaical Ceremonies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thinks himself bound to abstain from that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
tho in it self Lawful, and which in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cases would have been necessary: And that lest
by That his Practice he should have been advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to Satan's main design against the Church of
Christ at that time.</p>
            <p>It's true Truth remains still Truth, however Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
abuse it, yet seing all grant that the venting of
some Truths at sometimes is unseasonable, and so
for that time may be forborn; And seing it would
seem that nothing makes a Truth more unseasonable,
than when it is known that Satan will make bad use
of it, for bearing down that Truth which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
mainly to clear; It will follow that the
venting of such a Truth ought to be at least with
great modesty, and much holy Circumspection, if
not altogether forborn for that time.</p>
            <p>For Application of this Direction, I will not say
much: Only I shall propose it to your serious
thoughts, Whether or not the late Proceedings in
opposition to the Supreme Judicatories of the Church,
together with the Tenets whereupon they are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(which for Peace's cause, and from unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61451:143"/>
to give the least occasion of Irritation, I forbear
to name) whether or not, I say, These (even suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Lawfulness of the Practices, and Truth of
the Opinions) seem not to have been unseasonable
for the time; as being apt to be abused for leading
People upon the Errors of the time: Such as the
Contempt of Ecclesiastical Judicatories; Quarrelling
the Constitution, and Separating from the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of our Church. I fear much it will be hard
for People (not acquainted with subtile Distinctions)
to conceive, that any Corruption amongst those with
whom we converse, can make Civil Fellowship with
them Unlawful, but it must make Church Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
especially Communion-table Fellowship, with
the same Persons, to be as much, if not much more,
Unlawful. But I forbear, not being without hopes
but that Brethren Gracious and Wise will ponder
what they hold, and what they practise, when they
see bad use made of it, beyond their own Intention
and Purpose.</p>
            <p>There is one thing further I shall say for applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
chiefly upon the other hand, and it is this, Such
Practices ought to be eschewed, as may prove unjust,
and unnecessary Irritations unto People, to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
head-long upon the Errors of the time. I do
not love that any thing should be done of purpose,
to make People (as we say) kyth or appear in their
colours, I mean, to bring out these Practices, the
Seed whereof thou conceives to be already within;
which at the best is to cast a stumbling Block before
the Blind. I might reckon several Practices which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61451:144"/>
are not only Irritating, but also in themselves Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
such as, Promiscuous admissions of Clean and
Unclean to the Lord's Table; Little pains taking by
Ministers to Instruct People with Knowledge; Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much of Passion, but little of Reason, against
Errors. There be many whose Zeal is honestly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
against Error and Confusion, who yet by these,
and such as these, are not a little indirectly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the furtherance of it.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Second</hi> Direction how to manage our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
so as not to further Satan's main design, is,
That all, especially Ministers, would beware of such
things as of their own Nature do prove, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
observation have proven, Fore-runners of Error
and Confusion: Of which I shall reckon <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing to be eschewed, is, Unscriptural
Expressions while speaking of things Religious, as,
Cases of Conscience, Exercises of Mind, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Truths: An affected way of bringing forth old
Truths in new and uncouth Phrases, high soaring
Notions, serving more to astonish than inform the
Hearers, <hi>Paul 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 13. bids, <hi>Hold fast the form
of sound words,</hi> and not only of sound Doctrine: It
was <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Observation in his time, and severalls
since, that those who coin new Words and strange
Expressions, tending only to amuse the Hearers, are
in hazard to be carried away themselves, and to
carry others with them, unto some New and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Opinions.</p>
            <p>2. Ye must beware lest a disgust of old Truths
spread amongst the People, together with an itching
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61451:144"/>
after new Things, new Opinions, new Cases, new
Fellowships, new Teachers. Ye'll find 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 3,
4.</hi> That itching Ears in People go before the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ear from the Truth. For preventing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Ministers should be much in the inculcating of
old Soul-saving and Soul-humbling Truths; And
for keeping these still fresh and savory, much of the
need of Christ should be pressed; to a Soul-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
for Christ, every bitter thing is sweet, but a
Soul full of Conceit loatheth the Hony-comb.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Thing predisposing to Error, and so to
be guarded against, is, The undervaluing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.
It hath been Satan's method in drawing on
People towards Error at all times, and in no time
more than these of late. <hi>First,</hi> To make them despise
their Faithful Ministers; that once getting the Ear
stopped by prejudice against thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> he might get the
more ready access for his Emissaries to infect them
with Damnable Errors. It is the Observation of a
Reverend Writer of late, speaking to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
That the <hi>Galatians</hi> were easily seduced, so soon as
they were made to disgust <hi>Paul</hi> their Faithful Teacher.</p>
            <p>This much for the <hi>Second Direction</hi> for managing
of our Differences so, as not to come short in defence
of these Truths, which Satan is labouring most to
deface.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Third Direction,</hi> is, To be watchful over the
first Buddings of Error That way: There are some
lesser Errors whereby Satan scoureth the Field, and
maketh way for these great Ones which he mainly
intends: Whereof as to the present case I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61451:145"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>„Äà1 page duplicate„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:61451:145"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>„Äà1 page duplicate„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="576" facs="tcp:61451:146"/>
some. Concerning which, whatever we might
speak from our own knowledge of the propensity of
severals towards some of them; yet I shall rather
choise to speak of them in the abstract, as such, That
if People should be taken with them, will make way
for that Confusion which Satan mainly aimeth at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Error</hi> 1. The first whereof is, That no Man tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Godly, ought to be Censured for Opinion or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which we conceive he owneth or practiseth
from grounds of Conscience, tho his Opinion or
Practice tend never so evidently to the Renting of
the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Error 2. Secondly,</hi> That the presence of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Persons at the Lords Table, defileth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
unto all who Communicate, knowing such to
be there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Error 3. Thirdly,</hi> That a Minister Scandalous, tho
not Judicially proved such, ceaseth to be a Minister,
so that it is unlawful to receive either Word or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
at his hand, or to join in Discipline with
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Error 4. Fourthly,</hi> That there is no special tye
upon People to countenance the Ordinance, in that
Congregation whereof they are Members: But a
liberty left to go constantly where they may be most
edified, tho with the discouragement of those whose
hands they are bound to strengthen.</p>
            <p>I have only mentioned these Tenets without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation,
being confident that none of Christs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to whom herein I mainly speak, will own
them: Only I shall point at <hi>three</hi> things Ministers
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61451:146"/>
should make conscience of as their Duty, in relation
to these or such like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As it is our Duty to watch against propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Scandal upon the one hand, so to be learning
where any thing of this kind vents it self either in
Practice or Contentious Reasoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We should not think lightly of such,
when they do appear; and that Because, 1. They
do evidently make way for Satans great design in
these times, which is to cover the Church of Christ
with Confusion. 2. Because that however possibly
such do not reflect so much upon our own Ministry
as upon others, who we may conceive have justly
procured their own grief, yet a year or two may
lay them down at the door of him who thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for the time at greatest distance from them, and
that with so much the more weight, as that he did
not resent these evils sooner. 3. Such would not
be thought of lightly, Because Experience sheweth,
That the simple overseeing of such, is not the way
to root them out, but rather to make them take
strength.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Third thing that Ministers
should make Conscience of in relation to such, is, To
set about the Curing of them, wherein ye are to eye
two Caveats. 1. As ye would thrive so set about
the Cure of One evil as not to neglect Another; They
are not to be approven, if any such be, who in
their Reproofs bend themselves wholly against Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but little against Prophanity and Vice; neither
are they to be approven, if there be any such, who
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61451:147"/>
pass over the reproof of Error wholly, because the
Person to be reproved will hardly take with it; or
that prophane men will take occasion to mock at Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
because of it: These things require indeed that
the Duty be wisely and tenderly done, but not that
it be left altogether undone. A second Caveat to be
eyed is, your Cure should be more in Convincing
Arguments, than in Bitter Reproofs: Else it will
be taken but for the venting of Passion, and that ye
have nothing to say in Reason; which will make
the Disease worse.</p>
            <p>This much for the second branch of our last Use.
The <hi>Third</hi> shall be some Considerations to the
People, especially, for preventing their stumbling
and making Shipwrack upon the present Divisions.</p>
            <p>The First Consideration is this: The Church in
all Ages hath been afflicted with Divisions from the
Apostles time even till now: yea, in the very time
when the Apostles were alive themselves, We read
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 39. That two great Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
were so divided, that they parted one from
another: The Word made use of in the Original,
to express their Contention, signifieth, The high
fit of a Fever (<hi>a Paroxism</hi>) It is the very word; The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord thereby insinuating, That their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
cast them, as it were, in the rage of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and yet the matter whereabout the contest fell
out was not very great: Much like That, which
was the Fountain of our woful Rent, <hi>to wit,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Mark</hi> who had before deserted the Work, should
be again employed in it, The one would have
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61451:147"/>
him, the other would not; hence they part Company.
And what Divisions fell out amongst the primitive
Churches almost presently after they were planted
by the Apostles, The Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Corinthians, Galatians,</hi> &amp;c. make it very clear.
And for the times following the History of the
Church doth abundantly testify, That from the
Apostles Death to this very Age, the Church hath
still been shaken with Rents and Schisms, in some
one place or other; and these sometimes even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the most Gracious Men of those times, as
<hi>Augustine, Hierom, Zuinglius, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi>
Together with several others, whose Names, if it
were pertinent I might recite. So that ye are not to
stumble at the present Divisions: There is no new
or strange thing befallen Us: The Church of
Christ in all Ages hath been tryed with the like.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Consideration to prevent stumbling at
our present Divisions is, That God hath foretold
Church Divisions should be, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 19. There
must be also Heresies among you‚Äî</hi> And he hath not
only foretold that simply they must be, but so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
he should have an holy hand in them, <hi>Matth. 10. 35.
I am come to set a man at variance against his Father,
and the Daughter against her Mother‚Äî</hi> So that he
hath an Holy hand in Church Divisions, he permits
them to be, and for wise Reasons, whereof I shall
reckon <hi>Three.</hi> 1. He permits Divisions to be,
That Men's Spirits may be thereby tryed. So 1 <hi>Cor.
11. 19. There must be Heresies among you,</hi> And
wherefore?‚Äî<hi>That they which are approved may be
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61451:148"/>
made manifest.</hi> There is a great deal of evil lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Peoples Spirits, Unsound Principles in some,
Seeds of loose practices in others, Pride, Conceit, and
other unmortified Distempers, in a third sort; and
Divisions in a Church decipher those. 2. Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are sent for the clearing of Truths: This, as
we shewed before, has been Gods method from the
beginning, when he had a point of Truth to clear,
he hath suffered men to contradict it, and the more
it hath been contradicted, it hath still grown the
brighter. 3. He permits Divisions to be, that in
his Holy Justice they may be a stumbling block to
the wicked; If thou think there are so many Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and so many Religions, that thou'l care for
no Religion, until wiser People than thou agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves; Then Church Divisions and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Opinions in Gods just judgment are thy
Destruction.</p>
            <p>A third Consideration to prevent stumbling at
our present Divisions is, That some good use may
be made of them in the mean time; I shall first
speak to some Bad Uses of them which ye are to
eschew: And then to speak to some Good Uses of
them which ye are to seek after.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>First</hi> bad Use of the present Divisions is,
From them to take occasion of Rejoycing, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are set together by the Ears: A woeful Use!
Thou rejoycest in that which is the Gospels shame,
the Godly's weight, and God's dishonour; and
God shall rejoyce in thy shame and ruin another day
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:61451:148"/>
2. Another bad Use is, Because of them to wish
That the work of Reformation had never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
as having such ills following upon it: An use
which the carnal <hi>Israelites</hi> did often make of their
present strait, <hi>Would God</hi> (say they) <hi>we had never come
out of</hi> Egypt. An Use which speaks, That for all thy
professed adherence to the work of God and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
yet thou hast never thought upon it as His
work; else a blast of Affliction could not have put
thee so soon out of love with it.</p>
            <p>3. The giving over of your selves to a Spirit of
Loosness, it being a lawless time: Some Ministers
may possibly make this Use of the present Division,
but it is a woeful Use, and such as will deceive: God
may of purpose have sent such a time that thou may
without fear fill up thy Cup, and so be taken course
with afterwards for all together.</p>
            <p>4. It is a bad Use of them, to observe only which of
the wayes do afford most advantage, where the Sun of
Prosperity is most like to shine, that ye may strike
in there, but with a resolution, if the Wind change
ye will change also: A bad Use and unworthy of a
Man, much more of a Christian Man, whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is to be ruled by Conscience, Scripture and
Reason; and not by self-interest and advantage.</p>
            <p>5. The last bad Use of the present Division is, To
blow at the Coal; making it your work what ye can
search out and scrape together, from the carriage of
these who differ, that ye may vent it, and make
them odious by it. A base uncharitable and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Use. A thing so woeful that <hi>David</hi> complains
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61451:149"/>
of it in his very Enemies. <hi>Ps. 56. 5, 6. Every day
they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me
for evil. They gather themselves together, they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they mark my steps when they wait for my Soul.</hi>
This is a thing I may say, which hath had it's own
hand in the hightning and continuance of our
Differences, if that which <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 20.
be true, as it is most true,‚Äî<hi>Where there is no tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer
the strife ceaseth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These now are bad Uses which ye are to eschew,
but out of the Eater cometh meat, there is some
good Use may be made of our present Divisions, and
that ye should seek after.</p>
            <p>The first good Use is, That from these separating
stirs ye would labour to be convinced of abused <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
Our Division speaketh that Union hath not
been improven aright, neither amongst Ministers
nor Professors, there hath been much of carnal Joy,
triffling over of time, but little and too too little of
God in our Fellowship: And therefore in His just
Judgement He hath given us some other thing to set
our Teeth on edge with, ye should be convinced of
this, and be humbled for it.</p>
            <p>A Second good use of our present Division is, Ye
should press so much the more after Peace with God,
If strife with men be so wasting and wearisome,
what will Gods feud be? If peace with men be so
hard to get, seek the more of peace with God:
Seek the more of his smileings, the more thou meets
with of men's frownings: seek the more warmness
in him, the more of Coldness thou meets with
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61451:149"/>
from men; seek the more of Counsel and Direction
from God, the more Reservedness thou finds in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from whom thou was wont to get sweet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
This were a sweet use of our present Divisions; An
Exposition of <hi>Sampsons</hi> Riddle indeed; For thus
<hi>Out of the eater should come meat, and out of the bitter
should come sweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, By these Divisions ye may discover much
evil in your spirit that was before undiscovered,
what a deal of Pride, not enduring to be opposed?
What Carnal Emulation at the good of others?
What rejoying at their slips? What eagerness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the pursuit of things of little worth, when more
excellent are neglected? What violent Eruptions of
unmortified nature, bending after courses unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
for making of our Point good, except
Grace did bear them down? Ye find such a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of some things, such as may make you abase
your selves before God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our present Divisions may confirm us in
the Main, and settle us more than ever in the belief of
those so much opposed Truths concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ's House, and Constitution of Visible
Churches: and that because those who are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and oppose one another much, yet for the
most part do agree in these. If a mans house stand
after the shaking of many strong winds, he concluds
the foundation is good, This is a strong Argument
for Truth, that our Divisions Factions and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
one against another, do not shake our minds
in relation to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:61451:150"/>
Fifthly, Our present Divisions may be a spur
to more diligence in dealing with God for helping
foreward of his so much retarded Work. He is an
unhappy man who, when the Ship of the Church is
at the point of shipwrak, will not use violence against
his own Laziness, and improve his interest with
God, that he would help his tossed Church at a dead
lift. Oh! that there were more of this Use; The
Generation of those that seek God are fallen asleep:
many are the means that God hath used to rouze us
up; We have had the Calm Voice of the Word;
and that hath not done it; We have had the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-claps
of Sad sufferings from without, and that
hath not done it: And now the Earth-quakes of
heart Divisions within, have shaken All: And, if God
prevent not, will overturn All. And if this awake
us not, Oh! Lord what will thou do next!</p>
            <p>I shall now shut up all with the words of my Text,
<hi>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of Our Lord
Iesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that
there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly
joyned together in the same mind, and in the same Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
I know, as matters now stand, This, and
all we have spoken from it, may prove but thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the water, as to the thing by us intended: Yea,
and very like it may be made use of for the hightning
of prejudices, and further increase of Our strife;
and if so be, I am at a point what to Answer: That
even this will confirm unto me the Truth of what
I have said, to wit, That Our Divisions are an Evil
much to be lamented; It is a Judicial stroak, in so
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61451:150"/>
far as nothing can be said for the removal of it, but
thereby one way or other it taketh strength; It is a
strong fire, that when water is poured upon it, blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up the higher; It is a dangerous Disease in the
natural body, which is so prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>lent, as to turn the
very medicine applyed, unto the nature of that vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Humour, whereby the disease is further fed and
nourished. And yet tho all this should be (which
God avert) I have another thing to say, and it is the
ground of my comfort as to Our present sad stroke;
That Jesus Christ who hath found out the way to
make God and man <hi>One,</hi> when they were at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
hath ways enough to reconcile us one to
another, tho Our Divisions were at a greater hight
than yet they're come to: And if he hath pleasure in
us he will make us <hi>One,</hi> tho it should be on our own
Expenses: He may possibly do it by sending us to
one Common Goal, or some such like thing; For
our adhering to the Cause of God, Covenant and
precious Liberties of the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ, That precious Trust committed unto us by
him, and transmitted unto us by our Zealous and
Faithful Predecessors, who in the obtaining and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of them, loved not their lives unto the
death. If He have pleasure in us he will make us
unite, and if no other thing will do it, he will make
such like work as this do it: And it's very like such
like work may be ere long: For shall we look on
our mother Church oppressed and bereaved of these
Priviledges which are left unto her by her Lord and
husband, in his Latter Will and Testament, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61451:151"/>
shall we not so much as in ways competent for us,
upon all hazards resent it? Shall stronger Powers
usurp upon the Church's Right and in the mean time,
shall we by our mutual janglings, encourage them
to go on in this woful Work? Or shall we resent these
wrongs the less, or secretly approve of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casue
possibly that which is our own design for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one another is thereby promoved? God forbid.
Now the God of Peace establish our Peace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and give us Peace one with another in himself.</p>

               <bibl>PSALM 51. 6.</bibl>
               <q>Behold, thou desirest Truth in the inward
Parts: And in the hidden part thou shalt
make me to know Wisdom.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Psalm is one of <hi>Davids</hi> Penitential
Psalms, wherein his Conscience being first
awakned, and made sensible of his Sin, He
pleadeth hard for God's Mercy &amp; Grace, and especially
for the Pardon of his Sin; which Petition He insists
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61451:152"/>
upon most, and doth again and again inculcate it.</p>
            <p>The Words read in the First Part of this <hi>Verse,</hi> hold
out somewhat which God mainly called for, and <hi>David</hi>
aimed at, as a necessary Ingredient in his Penitential
Address unto God; Without which nothing he could
do in any Duty of God's Service, or particularly in
This which He is presently about, would have been
acceptable to God, and which being obtain'd and
in exercise, all He did was the more savoury; and
therefore He maketh mention of it in the midst of
His Prayer and present Exercise, that thereby He
may both mind His Heart, of the great necessity
there was to have it, and also may chear up his
weighted Spirit somewhat, in confidence that He
would be accepted of God in His present Address,
seing He had something of that necessary Ingredient,
which God doth so much require, desire, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of.</p>
            <p>The thing it self is expressed by the Word <hi>(Truth)
Behold thou desirest Truth in the inward parts,</hi> &amp;c.
Whereby is not meaned Truth in the Judgement,
opposed to Error; nor Truth in People's Words,
opposed to the Sin of Lying, and speaking Untruth;
But it is <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> called here
<hi>Truth in the inward parts;</hi> In a word, it is the Grace
of Sincerity and Singleness of Heart; For so is this
Grace often expressed in Scripture, <hi>Isai. 38. 3. I have
walked before thee in Truth,</hi> saith <hi>Hezekiah) and with
a perfect,</hi> upright, or sincere <hi>Heart.</hi> And <hi>Ephes. 6. 14
Having their loins girt about with Truth,</hi> &amp;c. That is,
with Sincerity and Single-heartedness. This then is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61451:152"/>
That Truth which God requires as a necessary sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
Ingredient in all Duties, and especially in all
Religious Performances; And which <hi>David</hi> here
holds out with a <hi>Behold,</hi> as the thing which above
any other thing he had aimed at, and yet would
aim more at, in his Penitential Address unto God.</p>
            <p>We have then in the Words, 1. A Note of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
(<hi>Behold</hi>) which <hi>David</hi> prefixeth to that
which he is to say; I call it a Note of Attention, for
that is the use it serveth for in this place, as I shall clear
afterwards. 2. There is That which he subjoineth
to this (<hi>Behold</hi>) The Lords Complacency and Delight
in the Grace of Sincerity, and the Exercise of it, as
that without which his Present Address could not be
savory or acceptable to God: <hi>Thou desirest Truth in
the inward parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall observe <hi>Two</hi> things in General before I
come to the Particulars of the Text. 1. From this,
<hi>David</hi> holds out the Rule he had walked by and was
to walk by for making his Present Address to God,
In confessing of Sin, and pleading hard for Pardon,
acceptable. Hence take this Doctrine. That it is not
enough that we do somewhat of Commanded Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but we must labour to do what we do in some
measure acceptably: <hi>David</hi> not only confesseth Sin,
and pleads for Pardon, but he aims to do it in Truth,
that so he may do it Acceptably; For while he saith,
<hi>God did desire Truth in the inward parts,</hi> it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implyed that He aimed to have it: There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for this; Because, If the thing we do be not done
Acceptably and in the Right Manner, though the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61451:153"/>
thing done be never so good in it self, the doing of
it is but lost labour unto us: Thus though it was a
piece of Commanded Duty under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to offer up Sacrifices to God; yet when Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
made not Conscience to discharge this Duty in
the Right Manner, all they did was to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as if they had done nothing at all; Hence <hi>Isai.
1. 11. To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
unto me? saith the Lord:</hi> &amp;c. Yea, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
any Duty is in it self, and the greater good is
to be had by going about any Duty in a Right and
Acceptable Manner, the greater is the Hurt and
Damnage which we incurr by it, when we advert
not how we do it; And when, without taking heed
to our Feet, we rush foreward to it, and carry our
selves but carelesly in the mean time that we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about it: What more excellent, comfortable,
and Soul edifying Ordinance is there than this of a
Communion, which through God's Mercy ye have
yet the liberty of approaching unto? Is it not a Feast
of Fat things? of Wine on the Lees well refined,
wherein we Feast with Christ and upon Christ, His
broken Body is Meat indeed, the most excellent that
Heaven or Earth can afford: And yet (saith <hi>Paul</hi>)
If ye come not to this Ordinance in the Right Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if ye set not your selves so to go about it as that
ye may be accepted in your work, if ye eat or drink
unworthily without previous Examination of your
selves, <hi>Ye shall eat and drink Damnation and Judgement
to your selves;</hi> Not only shall your Table prove a
snare, but your meat be turned into poyson; And
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61451:153"/>
therefore consider this in the entry, and labour to
have it imprinted on your Hearts, That it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to come rushing foreward to your Work not
considering how ye come; Your coming ought to
be according to the Direction given, <hi>Eccles. 5. 1.
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House of God,</hi> &amp;c.
As at all time, so especially when ye approach unto
such a dreadful Ordinance a this is, whereof the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is so great, if ye come Right, and the hurt
and hazard so unspeakably great, if ye come Wrong.</p>
            <p>But Secondly observe yet in General, That in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about Commanded Duties in some measure Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably,
ye ought now and then to reflect upon
the Manner and Way of your discharge of Duty,
even in the mean time when ye are about it: For so
doth <hi>David</hi> Here, He casts an eye upon the Right
Manner how He should have prayed, to wit, In
Sincerity and Truth, even in the very midst of his
prayer, while he saith unto God, <hi>Behold, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
Truth in the inward parts,</hi> And thus Christ in
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. saith unto His Disciples, in the very
mean time they were Hearing. <hi>Take heed therefore
how ye hear:</hi> And surely our Hearts do oft turn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
vain, wandering and lumpish, or heavy, in the
Service of God, because we do not seriously mind
how sinful, shameful, and unseemly it is that it should
be so: A check of this kind in time, and seasonably,
to a vain, straying and wandering Heart, would do
much through God's Blessing to make it halt: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
doth this oft, especially <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 5. where he
turns his speech from God, and gives himself a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61451:154"/>
and check for the present unsuitable frame of
Heart wherein he then was, <hi>Why art thoucast down, O my
Soul?</hi> (saith he) <hi>And why art thou disquieted in me? hope
thou in God,</hi> &amp;c. So that this reflecting upon the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Way how ye discharge Duty, even in the
mean time when ye are about it, is useful: When ye
find your Heart out of frame, a serious timous check
given unto it, will prove an effectual mean to reclaim
it: Besides, if upon your reflecting thus, ye find mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
tollerably Right, and your Heart in such a frame
for the Main, as the Lord requireth, it will furnish
you with matter of boldness, courage, and confidence:
as here it doth <hi>David,</hi> who having found somewhat
of this Truth and this upright and sincere frame of
Heart, in his own <hi>Inward parts,</hi> He takes ground of
Confidence from That, to expect that God who
had given him This, could also give him more, <hi>In
the hidden part</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou shalt make me to know
Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Vse,</hi> This doth shortly speak <hi>two</hi> things. 1. The
Service of God is a Work not of the Outward Man
only, but also and mainly, of the Inward Man: The
Heart and Mind of a Man must be exercised in it, if
so be go rightly about it; And that many wayes: And
this is One way, The Heart must be exercised by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
now and then upon it self, and observing its
own present frame and disposition, how it comes up
to the Rule prescrived by God, for making what we
do in the Service of God Acceptable. And next
it speaks the great guilt of many in God's Service, A
piece of the Iniquity of our Holy Things, for which
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61451:154"/>
we ought to be humbled; That many times whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
our Tongue is busie our Heart is idle, when our
Outward Man is present, the Inward Man is away,
and gets liberty to depart from God without check
or challenge. This is it that God complains of, <hi>Isai.
29. 13.‚ÄîThis People draw near me with their mouth,
and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their
heart far from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I come to the words in particular 1. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
prefixeth a (Behold) while he is to speak to that
which was necessarly required for making his Adress
acceptable to God: <hi>Behold</hi> is somtimes a note of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
prefixed to such things as are wonderful, as
<hi>Isai. 7, 14. Behold a virgin shall conceive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> and bear a
Son</hi> &amp;c. And so it may be taken here, it is indeed
a thing wonderful that God should desire or delight
in <hi>Truth in the inward parts,</hi> or that any thing which
is in us, or proceeding from us should be lovely to
him; There is such a mixture of unlovely sinful
dross in every thing of that sort. But we think it
doth rather serve here (as often elswhere) For a
note of Attention; Only taking it so, ye must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that <hi>David</hi>'s design and aim hereby is not so
much to stirr up God as his own Heart, and the
Hearts of others in whose hands this Piece of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should come, to take heed to the following
Purposes.</p>
            <p>We shall from this shortly mark <hi>Two</hi> things 1.
The Hearts even of the best have need of being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to take heed unto what is the Lords mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Right and Acceptable Manner in going
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61451:155"/>
about comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ed Duty; For therefore doth <hi>David</hi>
see it needful to pluck his own ear (as it were) for
making himself more attentive to this Subject, by
prefixing a <hi>Behold</hi> a note of Attention unto it, <hi>Behold
thou desirest Truth in the inward Parts.</hi> The Truth
is, if we get the substance of Duties gone about, we
are ordinarly too apt to think that it is but needless
scrupulosity, to be anxious about the manner how
to do it; So are we in Prayer, So are we in Hearing,
and so are we also in coming to Communions;
when ever occasion is offered, and an outward Call
or invitation given us to come, there is none almost
but his Conscience will challenge him if he stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back;
But as to the qualifications of the Call, and
what is required of you for coming Acceptably, It
is a wonder to see with what a careless ear the most
part do hear any thing of that sort; as if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
were a Charm to work upon People whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be fitted to Receive it or not; So that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for Preparation do serve (as to many) for no
other use, but for a Customary Ceremony, and to
fill up so much time. These necessary Directions
which are given you to come in the right manner
and the warnings you get, telling you how
dreadful a thing it is to come Wrong, are minded
no longer by the most part, than the mean time they
hear them, and by some scarcely so long: Hence
certainly it is that the Lord is not so Familiar with
the Hearts of People at his Own Feast as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he hath been; It is no wonder, Because we
come not as Prepared Guests with a Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61451:155"/>
to meet with him; Yea doubtless hence it is
that the Lord doth threaten so hard to draw his
Table, and to suffer men to impose upon us a Dead
lifeless formal way of Worship, that therein we may
see the Copy of our own Hearts, who if they get the
outward form gone about, they care little for the
inward Life, Power, and Substance; and surely if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it come to this, (as God knows how soon it may)
that all our Religion shall consist in threed-bare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Forms, and that more pains be taken by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to press upon People the observance of these
Forms, than the very Life and substance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Performances, we must justifie the Lord in it,
for that is the very Copy of our formal Hearts. Our
Love to and resting on Formality may provoke the
Lord to wreath the yoke of a Dead, Lifeless and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Service on our necks, that we shall not be able
to shake it off, though we would. The Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shapes out Cross Dispensations in the publick,
according to these sinful Distempers which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and prevalent in the Hearts of People, that
therein they may see the unlovely Representation and
Idea of their Own Heart <hi>Jer:</hi> 5. 31. He'l suffer even
<hi>The Prophets to Prophesy falsly, and the Priests to
bear Rule by Their means, If his People love to have it so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The consideration of this your Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Aversness to hear what is the Lords mind,
concerning the Right and Acceptable Manner of
going about Commanded Duties, should make you
so much the more to stir up your selves, to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
heed unto any thing that is spoken to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61451:156"/>
For therefore in order to his own upstirring
doth <hi>David</hi> prefix a Note of Attention (<hi>Behold</hi>) to
the purpose in hand. 1. Directions of that kind
are needful to be given; For (as ye heard) though
ye do all that is Commanded, as to the Substance
and Matter, yet if ye do it not in the Right Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
all ye do is to no purpose, as I cleared from <hi>Isaiah
1.</hi> 11. 2 If it be needful that such Directions be
given, then it is needful that ye diligently hear them,
else ye cannot obey them, ye'l but leave them where ye
find them, as oft-times ye do; In which case your
Hearing them doth but aggravate your guilt in the
neglect of them. 3. Our backwardness and avers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to hear and lay to Heart what is spoken to that
purpose; though it be great, yet is not such, but
if it be wrestled against and manfully opposed
it may be overcome; It is only Our giving way to it
without resistance, which makes it strong, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and shameless, when our setting our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
seriously and in earnest to wrestle against it,
would make it to cede, according to that word, <hi>Jam.
4. 7. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not insist on this, only This serves in place
of a Preface for stiring you up to hear and lay to
Heart what I am to say on the rest of the Text,
which holds out the Lords mind (as to one thing at
least) concerning the Right and Acceptable Manner
of going about Commanded Duties, and especially
This Duty which now ye are called to, of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lords Table: <hi>The Lord desireth Truth in the
Inward Parts.</hi> It's true, not only what ye heard from
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61451:156"/>
the former Note, but your own experience at such
times doth shew your Hearts are woefully backward
to Hear and lay to Heart any thing that is spoken to
this purpose; But seeing the thing is needful, and
so needful as that all your other pains, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to what ye hear to this purpose, will be to
no good purpose: Therefore ye ought to bestir your
selves, striving in earnest against your own Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness:
And if ye seriously set your selves to
strive against it, I doubt not but ye will get it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
at least in part.</p>
            <p>This much for the Note of Attention (<hi>Behold</hi>)
I come next to that which is subjoined, to. This
(Behold) <hi>viz.</hi> The Lords complacency and delight
in the Grace of Sincerity, and the exercise of it, As
that without which <hi>David</hi>'s present Address could
not be Savory or Acceptable to God: <hi>Thou desirest
Truth in the inward Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We'l find <hi>Three</hi> things in the Words, For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it is which makes our Performances accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God. 1. In general, It is somewhat which
God desires, approves, or loves, <hi>Thou desirest,</hi> &amp;c.
2. It is somewhat in the <hi>Inward Parts,</hi> not so much
That which is External, and seen by Men, as what
is Internal, and known only to God, and the Man's
own self. 3. One main particular hereof is condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on, to wit, <hi>Truth,</hi> the Grace of Sincerity and the
Exercise of that Grace, <hi>Thou de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>irest Truth in the
Inward Parts,</hi> Of all which I shall endeavour so
to speak, as that therein ye may see both your bypast
failings for your Humiliation, and also may see a Rule
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61451:157"/>
to which ye ought to Conform your selves for time
to come; As in the practise of all Duties, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in your Address to God at this time. First
then observe, The Rule of going about Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Duties Acceptably and in the Right manner is
God's approbation: For <hi>David</hi> doth not propose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself to follow That which would please his
Own Humour, or the Humour of others, but that
which God Desires, Loves and Approves of; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
(saith he) <hi>thou desirest Truth,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had
said, The t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ing O Lord which I aim at, is, That
which thou Desires and Approves: Thus the Lord
saith to <hi>Abraham Gen. 17. 1. Walk before me, and be
thou perfect,</hi> He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> have His Approbation (hinted at in
the words <hi>Before me</hi>) the Rule of his walking accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably:
This was the Rule which Christ himself when
he came unto the World did walk by, <hi>Psal. 40. 6,
7, 8, Sacrifice and Offering thou didst not desire‚ÄîThen
said l: Lo, I come‚Äî. I delight to do thy will, O my
God:</hi> And there is reason for it, If we consider 1.
That God is our main Party to whom we must give
an account for all we do; We must give an Account
to others also, but he'l reckon with us when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have done with us. 2. He hath tyed us to
this Rule and will reckon with us according to it,
<hi>Deut. 5. 32. Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord
your God hath commanded you:</hi> You shall not turn aside
to the Right hand, or to the Left. And therefore
3. Ye must look mainly to what He approves or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves,
else all ye do will be to no good purpose,
<hi>Matth. 6. 2. They do their Alms, that they may have
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61451:157"/>
Glory of Men, verily I say unto you, they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
This ought to make you search what is the
Rule ye walk by, and to which ye labour to conform
your selves most, in your walk: And for your more
easie search, I shall point at some who walk not by
this Rule.</p>
            <p>1. Those walk not by this Rule, who set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to come up in their way not to what God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
but to what the time, and any Party who bears
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>way in the time, desire: This is the Rule which the
Pharisees would have had all in their time to walk by
<hi>John. 7. 48. Have any of the Rulers</hi> (say they) <hi>or of
the Pharisees believed on him?</hi> And it is the Rule that
many walk by in all times; they know no other
Religion than That of the Times, and which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Them best who bear the greatest sway; So that
if Such should change their way every year once,
They will not scruple much to change it as oft. This
is the Rule which these did follow whom God
doth threaten, <hi>Hos. 7. 3. They make the King glad with
their wickedness, and the Princes with their Lies.</hi> They
cared not what they did if so they might please their
King and Rulers by it: Such are Time-servers,
Men-pleasers, and so cannot be God-pleasers; For
(saith <hi>Paul) If I yet pleased men, I should not be the
Servant of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Those walk not by this Rule of God's Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Desire, whose highest design in the point of
Duty is, To follow the Example of others; And
whose great enquiry is, not so much to know what
God Desires, as what others do; and rest upon that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61451:158"/>
as sufficient that they may do the like: This is the
Rule which God forbids to follow, <hi>Exod. 23. 2.
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> &amp;c. And
<hi>Broad is the way which leadeth to destruction, and many
there be that go therein:</hi> And yet it is a Rule which
many follow, both as the matter <hi>what,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>how</hi> they do it: How many are there, that
though they want not their own Convictions and
Challenges for several things they themselves are
conscious of, yet if there be many who are under
the Power of the same Evils with themselves, they
force themselves to take Peace and hold on, because
there are many guilty of the same fault: Alas,
That is but a very poor ground of Comfort, To go to
Hell with Company, and speaks but very little zeal
for God's Honour, else the more thou seest it tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on by others, thou would be the more tender of
it; and consequently the more Common any sin is,
thou should hate it the more, because God gets the
more Dishonour by it: This was <hi>David</hi>'s way, <hi>Rivers of
Tears</hi> (saith he) <hi>run down mine Eyes because of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
who transgress thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Those walk not by this Rule, who walk only by
that which their own Carnal Wit and Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
approves; How many are they, who though
they cannot but know that God in His Word requires
more exactness in their Walk, yet they rest on that
which they think their own Carnal Wit thinks may
suffice; They'll do what they can in Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which indeed is but to do what they please;
But for further, God must forgive them: Thus
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61451:158"/>
they'l medle with what is easie, pleasant, and profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table,
in Religion; But for what is hurtful, burthen
some, or may bring loss, they'l never owne that;
Because their Carnal Reason suggests unto them, that
less than that may serve the turn, Religion is good,
but People ought not to impoverish or destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for it: Thus many do easily dispense with
themselves for the neglect of all painful Hazards and
expensive Duties; such as To deal their Bread to the
Hungry, To choose Affliction rather than to sin;
Not to recompense evil with evil, but evil with
good, To cleave unto Christ and Truth when the
wind of Tryal and Persecution blow hard in their face.
These and such like Duties are not much stood on
by the Man that walks by this Rule of Carnal Reason.
As also the Duty of Mortifying your Predominant,
Cutting off of the Right Hand, plucking out of the
Right Eye, and that painful Duty of Heart-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Self-judging, as at all times, so chiefly when
ye are coming to a Communion, Carnal Wit will
suggest to you that such precise strictness is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Now this Rule is flatly contrary to that which
is here prescribed, The Rule of Gods Approbation:
For the <hi>Carnal Mind</hi> is Enmity to God, and <hi>Flesh
and Blood</hi> cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. Those walk not by this Rule whose great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is to conform themselves, not so much to
what God Desires, as to what they themselves find
Peace in, and who if they get not troublesome
challenges from Conscience for their way, do take it
for granted that their way is good enough, and do
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61451:159"/>
never set themselves to enquire further about it:
Now this is an unsure Rule: For 1. Many may
have Peace in that which is just opposite to what
God Requires and Desires. Ye'l see <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19.
How the Prophane Ruffian cryeth, <hi>Peace, he shall
have Peace, though he add Drunkenness to Thirst:</hi> As
it were in despite of God. But, 2. Tho' thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be not thus fear'd, yet it may be sleeping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou takes no pains to get it awakened; And if
thou wouldst but rouze it up, and make it pass im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Sentence upon thy Way, There are many
things thy Conscience would give thee little rest in, for
which now thou finds no check or challenge. 3. It
would be considered, whether Conscience now and
then do not give you some gentle Checks for many
things, tho it wound not sore, because ye do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
command it to silence, so that it doth not speak
to purpose, being overaw'd so that it dare not speak.
In either of which Cases, Peace of Mind is not a safe
Rule to walk by; For ye may have Peace in that
which God approveth not.</p>
            <p>I come now to the second thing here expressed,
for clearing what That is, that makes our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
accepted of by God: It is somewhat in the
<hi>Inward Parts,</hi> not so much that which is External
and obvious to the Eyes of Man, as Internal and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to God, even the hidden man of the Heart.
It's true the man who would walk acceptably, must
also look to that which is External, to wit, that which
God hath Commanded, according to <hi>Philip. 4. 8.
Finally, Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61451:159"/>
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report; If there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and if there be any praise, think on these things.</hi>
So he is not to over look all things External, or look
on them as things indifferent, if they be Honest, Pure,
of a good Report, and any vertue in them, he must
set about them: Only the great Work of such a
man should ly most about his Heart and <hi>Inward Parts;</hi>
how to get it brought up to Duty and keeped at
Duty: For <hi>John 4. 24. God is a Spirit, and they that
Worship him, must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
The Heart is the thing which God doth mainly seek.
<hi>My Son</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>Prov: 23. 26. Give me thy
Heart.</hi> And He doth so seek it, that if he get it
not, he cares not for all the rest, <hi>Isai. 29. 13. This
People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their
Lips do Honour Me, but have removed their Heart far
from me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might here run out in a sad complaint That the
Religion of the times is almost all Out-side-work (at
least in very many) who the longer they live
make the less ado about the Heart: And is it not
so, If when ye neglect the external part of Duty ye
get a Challenge, but if that be discharged ye have
Peace, though there be no more care about the Heart
than if ye had none? But as to your accquitting
your selves in this particular of making your great
work ly about the Heart and <hi>Inward parts,</hi> Try your
selves but by these <hi>Three</hi> things. 1. What is your
care to restrain and mortify Heart Sins, which the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61451:160"/>
Apostle calls the Filthiness of the Spirit, As High
conceit of your selves, and your envying of the
good of others, because it overshadows you; The
Sin of Fretting and repining under cross dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
of not reverencing God in, and being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with your Lott. Try I say what your Cares
and Endeavours are to mortify these and such like
Heart sins; 2. Try what Conscience ye make to
Discharge Inward and spiritual Duties, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
only the Inward man to be acted in them;
As the Duty of meditating on God, keeping inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and fellowship betwixt your Hearts and Him,
The Duty of self judging, and calling your self to an
account every night of the days work, the Duty of
stooping to God under Cross Dispensations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
aright of every thing that God does.
Try I say what Conscience ye make, to discharge
those and such like spiritual Duties. 3. Try in what
way your greatest Care doth run in these Duties which
require both the Outward and Inward man; Is your
great Care to act from right motives, and for right
ends? or rather do ye not on the contrair take but
litle care what be the frame of your Heart within, if
ye but get the outward work done, and a fair out-side
which none can challenge? Is your desire not only
to exercise your Tongue in Praying, Your voice
and art in Singing Praises, but also and mainly, to
exercise your spiritual Graces, your Faith, your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
your Love, your Repentence for Sin, and
your joy in God? I fear if ye try by these marks, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us shall find, that though the Inward parts be
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61451:160"/>
that which God Desireth most, yet it is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we do give him least, which makes a great part
of our Duties to be but shadows of Duty; They
have the external draughts and lineaments, shape
and proportion of Duty but no more; they are painted
Duties, like a painted man without life, a painted
fire without heat, Let the tryal of your self in these,
and judging of your selves for them, be a part of
your <hi>Preparation:</hi> And take this for a further part of
it from the same Ground, if ye would have what ye
do about your <hi>Preparation,</hi> accepted of by God, let your
great work ly about your Heart, how to get it
brought to Duty, and wrought up to some good
Frame; for the Lord desireth mainly the <hi>Inward
parts;</hi> and where your backward, dead, and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Hearts will not move or drive for you, beseech
the Lord to draw them, and make them <hi>willing in
the day of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now lastly, I come to the particular here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
on as a necessary Ingredient, for making
our performances Acceptable and savoury <hi>viz.</hi> The
Grace of Truth and sincerity, <hi>Behold thou desirest
Truth in the Inward parts.</hi> And it gives us this
Doctrine That the Grace of sincerity and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it, Is abosolutely necessary for making our
Duties acceptable to God; It's so necessary that the
Lord will accept even very little where it is, when
he I reject much where it is wanting: we'l see both
these if we look to the Scripture verdict of two
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> The first is, <hi>Asa,</hi> He was guilty in
many things, there were very visible defects in him
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61451:161"/>
as sufficient that they may do the like: This is the
Rule which God forbids to follow, <hi>Exod. 23. 2.
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> &amp;c. And
<hi>Broad is the way which leadeth to destruction, and many
there be that go therein:</hi> And yet it is a Rule which
many follow, both as the matter <hi>what,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>how</hi> they do it: How many are there, that
though they want not their own Convictions and
Challenges for several things they themselves are
conscious of, yet if there be many who are under
the Power of the same Evils with themselves, they
force themselves to take Peace and hold on, because
there are many guilty of the same fault: Alas,
That is but a very poor ground of Comfort, To go to
Hell with Company, and speaks but very little zeal
for God's Honour, else the more thou seest it tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on by others, thou would be the more tender of
it; and consequently the more Common any sin is,
thou should hate it the more, because God gets the
more Dishonour by it: This was <hi>David</hi>'s way, <hi>Rivers of
Tears</hi> (saith he) <hi>run down mine Eyes because of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
who transgress thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Those walk not by this Rule, who walk only by
that which their own Carnal Wit and Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
approves; How many are they, who though
they cannot but know that God in His Word requires
more exactness in their Walk, yet they rest on that
which they think their own Carnal Wit thinks may
suffice; They'll do what they can in Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which indeed is but to do what they please;
But for further, God must forgive them: Thus
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61451:161"/>
they'l medle with what is easie, pleasant, and profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table,
in Religion; But for what is hurtful, burthen
some, or may bring loss, they'l never owne that;
Because their Carnal Reason suggests unto them, that
less than that may serve the turn, Religion is good,
but People ought not to impoverish or destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for it: Thus many do easily dispense with
themselves for the neglect of all painful Hazards and
expensive Duties; such as To deal their Bread to the
Hungry, To choose Affliction rather than to sin;
Not to recompense evil with evil, but evil with
good, To cleave unto Christ and Truth when the
wind of Tryal and Persecution blow hard in their face.
These and such like Duties are not much stood on
by the Man that walks by this Rule of Carnal Reason.
As also the Duty of Mortifying your Predominant,
Cutting off of the Right Hand, plucking out of the
Right Eye, and that painful Duty of Heart-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Self-judging, as at all times, so chiefly when
ye are coming to a Communion, Carnal Wit will
suggest to you that such precise strictness is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Now this Rule is flatly contrary to that which
is here prescribed, The Rule of Gods Approbation:
For the <hi>Carnal Mind</hi> is Enmity to God, and <hi>Flesh
and Blood</hi> cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. Those walk not by this Rule whose great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is to conform themselves, not so much to
what God Desires, as to what they themselves find
Peace in, and who if they get not troublesome
challenges from Conscience for their way, do take it
for granted that their way is good enough, and do
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61451:162"/>
never set themselves to enquire further about it:
Now this is an unsure Rule: For 1. Many may
have Peace in that which is just opposite to what
God Requires and Desires. Ye'l see <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19.
How the Prophane Ruffian cryeth, <hi>Peace, he shall
have Peace, though he add Drunkenness to Thirst:</hi> As
it were in despite of God. But, 2. Tho' thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be not thus fear'd, yet it may be sleeping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou takes no pains to get it awakened; And if
thou wouldst but rouze it up, and make it pass im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Sentence upon thy Way, There are many
things thy Conscience would give thee little rest in, for
which now thou finds no check or challenge. 3. It
would be considered, whether Conscience now and
then do not give you some gentle Checks for many
things, tho it wound not sore, because ye do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
command it to silence, so that it doth not speak
to purpose, being overaw'd so that it dare not speak.
In either of which Cases, Peace of Mind is not a safe
Rule to walk by; For ye may have Peace in that
which God approveth not.</p>
            <p>I come now to the second thing here expressed,
for clearing what That is, that makes our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
accepted of by God: It is somewhat in the
<hi>Inward Parts,</hi> not so much that which is External
and obvious to the Eyes of Man, as Internal and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to God, even the hidden man of the Heart.
It's true the man who would walk acceptably, must
also look to that which is External, to wit, that which
God hath Commanded, according to <hi>Philip. 4. 8.
Finally, Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61451:162"/>
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report; If there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and if there be any praise, think on these things.</hi>
So he is not to over look all things External, or look
on them as things indifferent, if they be Honest, Pure,
of a good Report, and any vertue in them, he must
set about them: Only the great Work of such a
man should ly most about his Heart and <hi>Inward Parts;</hi>
how to get it brought up to Duty and keeped at
Duty: For <hi>John 4. 24. God is a Spirit, and they that
Worship him, must Worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
The Heart is the thing which God doth mainly seek.
<hi>My Son</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) Prov: 23. 26. Give me thy
Heart.</hi> And He doth so seek it, that if he get it
not, he cares not for all the rest, <hi>Isai. 29. 13. This
People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their
Lips do Honour Me, but have removed their Heart far
from me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might here run out in a sad complaint That the
Religion of the times is almost all Out-side-work (at
least in very many) who the longer they live
make the less ado about the Heart: And is it not
so, If when ye neglect the external part of Duty ye
get a Challenge, but if that be discharged ye have
Peace, though there be no more care about the Heart
than if ye had none? But as to your accquitting
your selves in this particular of making your great
work ly about the Heart and <hi>Inward parts,</hi> Try your
selves but by these <hi>Three</hi> things. 1. What is your
care to restrain and mortify Heart Sins, which the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61451:163"/>
Apostle calls the Filthiness of the Spirit, As High
conceit of your selves, and your envying of the
good of others, because it overshadows you; The
Sin of Fretting and repining under cross dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
of not reverencing God in, and being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with your Lott. Try I say what your Cares
and Endeavours are to mortify these and such like
Heart sins; 2. Try what Conscience ye make to
Discharge Inward and spiritual Duties, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
only the Inward man to be acted in them;
As the Duty of meditating on God, keeping inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and fellowship betwixt your Hearts and Him,
The Duty of self judging, and calling your self to an
account every night of the days work, the Duty of
stooping to God under Cross Dispensations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
aright of every thing that God does.
Try I say what Conscience ye make, to discharge
those and such like spiritual Duties. 3. Try in what
way your greatest Care doth run in these Duties which
require both the Outward and Inward man; Is your
great Care to act from right motives, and for right
ends? or rather do ye not on the contrair take but
litle care what be the frame of your Heart within, if
ye but get the outward work done, and a fair out-side
which none can challenge? Is your desire not only
to exercise your Tongue in Praying, Your voice
and art in Singing Praises, but also and mainly, to
exercise your spiritual Graces, your Faith, your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
your Love, your Repentance for Sin, and
your joy in God? I fear if ye try by these marks, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us shall find, that though the Inward parts b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:61451:163"/>
that which God Desireth most, yet it is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we do give him least, which makes a great part
of our Duties to be but shadows of Duty; They
have the external draughts and lineaments, shape
and proportion of Duty but no more; they are painted
Duties, like a painted man without life, a painted
fire without heat, Let the tryal of your self in these,
and judging of your selves for them, be a part of
your <hi>Preparation:</hi> And take this for a further part of
it from the same Ground, if ye would have what ye
do about your <hi>Preparation,</hi> accepted of by God, let your
great work ly about your Heart, how to get it
brought to Duty, and wrought up to some good
Frame; for the Lord desireth mainly the <hi>Inward
parts;</hi> and where your backward, dead, and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Hearts will not move or drive for you, beseech
the Lord to draw them, and make them <hi>willing in
the day of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now lastly, I come to the particular here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
on as a necessary Ingredient, for making
our performances Acceptable and savoury <hi>viz.</hi> The
Grace of Truth and sincerity, <hi>Behold thou desirest
Truth in the Inward parts.</hi> And it gives us this
Doctrine That the Grace of sincerity and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it, Is absolutely necessary for making our
Duties acceptable to God; It's so necessary that the
Lord will accept even very little where it is, when
he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>l reject much where it is wanting: we'l see both
these if we look to the Scripture verdict of two
Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> The first is, <hi>Asa,</hi> He was guilty in
many things, there were very visible defects in him
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61451:164"/>
trary to that which the Law of God required: as
particularly, he caused imprison the Prophet who
reproved him 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 16 10. He did not remove
the superstitious High places, and yet see what the
Spirit of God saith of him 1 <hi>King 15, 14. The High
places were not removed: nevertheless Asa his Heart
was perfect with the Lord all his days.</hi> Implying that
because he was a sincere upright hearted man, the
Lord overlooked his many other failings. So much
is also implyed in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Prayer, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it gets from God 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 18. 19. The
good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his Heart to
seek God, the Lord God of his Fathers, though he be not
cleansed according to the Purification of the Sanctuary, And
the Lord hearkned to Hezekiah and healed the People.</hi>
The other is King <hi>Amaziah 2 Chron: 25, 2. He did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not
with a perfect Heart.</hi> Implying that though he
did many things which in themselves were Right
and Good, yet because his Heart was not single, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and straight, in what he did, the Lord doth
not regard it; which cleareth the thing I said before,
That the Grace of Sincerity and exercise of it is so
necessary, that the Lord will accept even very little
where it is, and will reject much where it is wanting.</p>
            <p>Now for opening up this Grace of Truth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
a litle, in order to the application of the
Point: Know 1, Sincerity is a Grace which looketh
mainly to the Inside, therefore it is here called
<hi>Truth in the Inward parts:</hi> If thou be a Sincere man,
an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61451:164"/>
Though a fair outside, may please Onlookers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they see no further, yet it will not please thee,
because thou knows it will not please God, <hi>He desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Truth in the Inward parts.</hi> But of this already. 2.
Sincerity and Truth of Heart makes a man's Tongue
and Heart to go together in all his deportment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to God or man; The sincere hearted Man is not
a double Man, he labours to be that in effect which
he gives himself out to be. Thus 1. <hi>John</hi> 3. 18<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Truth
is opposed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>air words which are no more but
Words; <hi>My litle Children</hi> (saith he) <hi>let us not love
in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</hi>
Implying where <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Deed</hi> go not together,
there is no singleness, sincerity, or Truth there. 3.
Sincerity aims at the right end, and works from
right, approven and spiritual motives. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Paul Philip:</hi> 1. 15, 16. Puts this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the sincere and unsincere man, The Sincere
Man works out of love and good will to Christ and
Truth, the Unsincere man again works the same
Work, and as much of it, but he works out of envy
and strife, For some base and by ends. This Grace
of Sincerity and Truth makes a man look not only to
the Substance of his Actions, that they be Right and
Commanded, but also to the Manner of them, and
chiefly that they be from spiritual motives and for a
right end, that is, for God's Glory, Thy own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Thy neighbours good and Edification.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Vse,</hi> Ye would try if there be not much
want and inlake of this Truth and Sincerity among
Us; It's true every inlake and failing in the exercise
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61451:165"/>
of Sincerity will not prove a Man to be Unsincere;
As every act of Hypocrisie will not make a Man an
Hypocrite if so he do not countenance himself in it;
If so he do bewail it and flee to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to get
pardon for it, and strength to subdue it: It is not
for this end I would have you to search and try your
Inlakes in the exercise of Sincerity, that ye may give
your selves over for Rotten-hearted Hypocrites: But
that you may bewail it, take with it, judge your
selves for it, flee to Christ to get it pardoned, and
to get Grace to amend it; And your making this
use of your foul Failings, as to this point, shall be a
clear evidence, that though there has been much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity,
and shameless Hypocrisie in you, yet ye
are no real Hypocrites<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>But the main Use of the Point is, That as ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to come to the Lords Table Acceptably, and in
the Right Manner, so deal with God sincerely and
in Truth, that is, Let your great Work ly about
your Heart and Inward Parts to get some right frame
and disposition put on them, whereof I spoke before;
Only an humble, hungring frame, thirsting after Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion
and Fellowship with him, is a good frame
at such a time. Again let your coming flow from
Spiritual Motives, and level at Right and Approven
Ends; But especially deal Sincerely and in Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>th
with God, by labouring to be That indeed, which by
your Act of coming to the Communion ye give your
selves out for. Now ye give your selves out for
many things. 1. Your Coming saith, That ye have
need of Christ, and must be at him; And therefore
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61451:165"/>
deal sincerely and in Truth with Christ, in searching
out and being affected with the need ye have of
Him. 2. Your Coming to the Lords Table speaks
that ye are weary of your old Masters, and have a
real mind to change them; Now I beseech you deal
sincerely and in Truth with God, and see it be so
that ye are really weary of your old Lusts which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
enslaved you; And that ye have a mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to quite them. 3. Ye do hereby give out that you
have a mind to take God for your Master, to enrol
your self in the List of His Soldiers to fight against
the Devil, the World, your own Flesh, and every
thing which is an Enemy with Him; Deal in Truth
and dissemble not with God in this: See ye come
not to give God a Day, with a secret purpose to give
the Devil an Year. 4. Ye do hereby give out, that
you mind to close with Christ on His own Terms;
See ye deal sincerely with Him in this also; And
for this end, Ponder well and think on the Terms
before hand, for if ye close a Bargain with Him on his
own terms, and so deal sincerely and in Truth with
him; Ye must first take him Freely, For <hi>Come and buy</hi>
(saith he) <hi>without money and without price. Isai</hi> 55. 1. And
therefore ye must not keep back from Him, or come
heartlesly to Him, because ye find no worth in your
selves for which ye should be beloved by Him: If ye do
so, ye deal not Sincerely and in Truth with Him. 2. If ye
take Him on his own Terms, and so deal Sincerely with
Him, ye must take him wholly, not only as a Priest to
save you, but as a King to Rule in you: If ye mind to
make no other use of Christ but to get your by-past Sins
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61451:166"/>
pardoned by Him, that ye may take on a new Score
in time to come, ye deal not Sincerely and in Truth
with Him; ye pretend to take Him on His own
Terms, and that is to take Him wholly; And yet
ye will not take Him as a King to Rule over you.
3. Ye must take him with all the hazard that may
follow upon your taking of Him, ye must take him
with a resolution to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>leave to him, through Well
and through Woe, aswell when the World frowns
upon him, as when it smiles, otherwise ye deal not
Sincerely with him: For these are his own terms
whereon ye pretend to close with him; <hi>If any man</hi>
(saith he) <hi>will be my Disciple, les him deny himself, take
up his Cross and follow me.</hi> And lastly, Ye must take
him Irrevocably, for it is an everlasting Covenant:
So that if the next day when the sensible Fruits of a
Communion do not answer your expectation, ye
loose your grip and quite the Bargain, ye do not deal
Sincerely and in Truth with Him.</p>
            <p>I shall shut up all I have said, by giving some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
for making you deal thus Sincerely and in
Truth with him. Know 1. He is dealing Sincerely
and in Truth with you; He minds indeed to close a
a most blessed Bargain with you, and with all of you
who mind to take him at his Word, and to give him
Credit; And if ye will but credit him, ye shall find
from experience ere long that he hath been sincere,
real, and in earnest with you: And to the end ye
may trust him, He gives the most speaking evidences
of His Real sincerity towards you which can be given:
Before ye take a tryal of him, ye have His Word for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61451:166"/>
it, His Writ for it, His Oath for it, and ye shall have
His Seal and Pledge of it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Even, that He shall be all
that to you which He gives himself out for: so that
I may well say, The Lord is dealing Sincerely and
in Truth with You, and therefore do ye so with Him.
2. Your dealing thus Sincerely and in Truth with
Him, (as I shew'd before) will make him overlook
your many other Failings, which otherwise he will
take notice of, and reckon on your Account. 3. If
ye deal not Sincerely and in Truth with Him now,
it is a venture when, or if ever again ye get such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
occasion to do that which ye now leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
Many of us have often at such times dealt
deceitfully with God, our Hearts have not been
straight before Him: And yet for all this, he gives
us a New Offer, That notwithstanding all that is
come or gone, He shall be our God, and we his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
And if ye close with this Offer in Truth, and
on his Own Terms, ye shall find him to be forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to his Offer; But if ye shall slight him,
and deal deceitfully with him, seeming to close a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with him when really ye do it not, It is a venture
(I say it over again) if ever ye get such another Offer.
The shaddows of the Evening, in respect of the bright
Sun-shine of Pure Ordinances we have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
seem to be stretched out upon the Land, and
our Sun drawing towards a declining; But though
that should not be, yet who is there among you can
infallibly promise, That he shall ever see another
Communion? yea or hear any number of Sermons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this. And therefore while it is to day hear his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61451:167"/>
Voice<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and harden not your Hearts: Behold <hi>Now,</hi>
this very present (<hi>Now</hi>) is the Acceptable time and
the day of Salvation; And therefore <hi>Seek the Lord
while he may be found, and Call upon him while he is
near.</hi>

crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block,‚Äî</hi>
hath had its accomplishment in all Ages,
and in no Age more than in this; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61451:168"/>
His way of working, both with Churches and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Souls, hath been a stone of stumbling and
rock of offence to many; yea moe and moe are stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
still, what through one occasion or other; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who once did seem to run well in the way to
Heaven, in the way of Truth, and in the way of
Piety, have either already taken up, or are in hazard
to take up, such an halt, as Christ may be conceived
to say, to those very few who seem resolv'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him through Better and Worse, as once he said
<hi>Joh. 6. 67. Vnto the twelve</hi> (when many of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
went back and walked no more with him) <hi>will
ye also go away?</hi> I have therefore chosen this Text
to speak from, now immediatly after having enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
your selves to walk in Christs Way, that thereby
ye may guard against that woeful common evil of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended in Christ,</hi> or of stumbling and taking up an
halt in his Way of Truth and Piety, notwithstanding
all the stumbling blocks and rocks of offence ye may
meet with: For <hi>Blessed is he</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>whosoever
shall not be offended in me.</hi> The Words are a Part of
Christs Answer to that Question propounded to Him
by Two of <hi>John</hi>'s Disciples at <hi>John</hi>'s desire, <hi>verse 20.‚ÄîArt
thou he that should come, or look we for another?</hi>
Ye may wonder that <hi>John</hi> who knew Christ so well,
should have moved such a Question: But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, <hi>First,</hi> Tho Souls know Christ never so well,
they'l desire and have need to know him better, and
to get what knowledge they have of him confirmed
to them, especially in the day of Trial; For <hi>John</hi>
was now in Prison<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And <hi>2dly.</hi> They'l desire that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61451:168"/>
others may know him also; For it appeareth from
what goeth before, that <hi>John</hi> propoundeth this
Question for his Disciples satisfaction, and to satisfy
their Doubts more than his own.</p>
            <p>Christ's Answer hath two Parts<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 1. He bids them
shew <hi>John</hi> what they saw him doing, <hi>Verse 22.‚ÄîTell
Iohn</hi> (saith he) <hi>what things ye have seen and heard,
how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor
the Gospel is preached.</hi> If ye ask what makes this
to the Answer of the Question; I answer, It maketh
much, for it shews he was doing that which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
foretold the <hi>Messias</hi> would do, <hi>Isai.</hi> 35. 5, 6. And
therefore he behoved to be the <hi>Messias.</hi> 2. In thir
words he answereth a main Objection against this
Truth taken from Christ's own low condition and
the practice of his Followers, which made many
bear off him: For they expected a Glorious <hi>Messias,</hi>
a Great earthly Monarch; And because Christ was
but obscure and mean, therefore they stumbled and
were offended in him: To this Christ answereth,‚Äî<hi>Blessed
is he whosoever shall not be offended</hi> (or scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized)
<hi>in me.</hi> The word rendered here (<hi>offended</hi> or <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd</hi>)
seems to be a Metaphor taken from Travellers,
who having dashed their Foot or Leg at some stone
or block in the way, do stumble or take up an halt
so as they can go no further, at least advance not so
quickly in the way as they did. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> while
he sayes <hi>Offended in me,</hi> take this first <hi>Actively;</hi> And
so the meaning is, They should not take occasion of
stumbling from any thing in Christ or in His Way.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61451:169"/>
2. It may be taken <hi>Passively,</hi> so as to point out the
Way that we should not stumble nor take up an halt
in; For there are some wayes, to wit, Every sinful
course and way, that it were good for People to
stumble in, and turn their backs upon: But this Way
wherein we should not stumble, is Christ Himself,
and the Way of Truth and Piety prescrib'd by him,
<hi>Blessed is he</hi> saith Christ) <hi>who shall not be offended in
me.</hi> As if he had said, Happy is that Man who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not occasion from Me, or any thing in My Way,
to stumble or turn his back upon Me, and that course
of Truth and Piety wherein I have commanded him
to walk.</p>
            <p>The Words are but One entire Proposition and
Sentence, I need not therefore spend time in divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; But shall come to the Doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Lord applyeth the general Prophesies
Concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Old Testament to
Himself in particular; shewing they were verified in
Him; For the Words (<hi>in me</hi>) have in them a direct
Answer to the Question propounded by <hi>John</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and shews the <hi>Messias</hi> was come; and that
He is That <hi>Messias.</hi> Whence we might mark, That
JESUS CHRIST the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was Born in
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> brought up in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and Crucified
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is that very same <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to
Come and promised to the Fathers. We might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>2ly,</hi> That before He gave this Answer that He
was the promised <hi>Messias</hi> whom they were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and not to stumble at, He doth first prove by
Scripture that it was so, while he hids <hi>John</hi>'s Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61451:169"/>
tell their Master, he was doing such miraculous
Works as the Scriptures did foreshew none but Christ
should do. Whence we might learn, That all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and Debates about Religion should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
from Scripture, and according to the Rule
set down in Scripture: For here when a Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
among <hi>John</hi>'s Disciples, If JESUS the Son of
<hi>Mary</hi> was the promised <hi>Messias?</hi> neither <hi>John</hi> the
Baptist (than whom there was not a Greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
among these that are <hi>Born of Women</hi>) yea nor
Christ himself who was Greater than he, do take it
upon them to determine in it: But <hi>John</hi> sends them
to Christ, and Christ sends them to the Scripture
for a Solution. Thus, <hi>To the law and to the testimony</hi>
(saith the Lord, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. 20.) <hi>if they do not speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi>
The neglect of this Rule hath been the In-let to
Humane Traditions, without, and contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
both in Worship and Government in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Church: And if this Rule once be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
there can be no end of Humane Ceremonies,
untill all that trash which is in the Roman Church be
brought in upon the Church of God: For if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Man can make way for One, it may also
make way for all the rest.</p>
            <p>But passing those, The <hi>two</hi> following Doctrines
are these that I intend most to insist upon, And both
of them are implyed. 1. That there are many stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Blocks in Christ's way, whereat People are
apt to Offend, take up an Halt and stumble. And
yet, <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is nothing of that kind which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61451:170"/>
ought to make us stumble: For if there were not
some stumbling Blocks, Christ needed not so much
guard against them; and by his guarding against
them, he shews we should not stumble at them.</p>
            <p>I shall prosecute both these Poins joyntly. 1. By
condiscending upon some of these Rocks of Offence
from which the <hi>Jews</hi> at first, and many since, have
taken occasion to stumble at Christ, to take up an
Halt in his Way, and to turn their backs upon it.
And 2. By making it evident that there is no ground
or reason why ye should stumble at any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> stumbled at the Meanness of
Christs Person. They could never take him, whom
they looked on as a Carpenters Son, accompanyed
with a Train of poor Fisher-men, to be their long
looked-for Glorious <hi>Messias.</hi> And there is a Rock
like to this which many yet do break their neck upon
and stumble at, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Meanness of a Ministry;
Their Spirits cannot digest to be reproved, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
and (as they think) trampled upon, by silly
Bodies: And therefore, they must have Ministers;
some of them at least, advanced to the highest pitch
of wordly Honour; As thinking it will be less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to be controlled, reproved, and made to stand
in awe by such; which is in effect to stumble at the
Way which God thinks meetest for saving Souls;
even that his Servants may have but little of outward
Worldly Dignity, whereby the Efficacy of their work
on Souls may not be imputed to them but to Him,
and usually Gods own Way comes best speed, 2 <hi>Cor.
17. Paul,</hi> speaking of the mean and afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61451:170"/>
of Christs Ministers, saith‚Äî<hi>We have this
Treasure in Earthen Vessels, that the excellency of the
Power may be of God and not of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Jews</hi> stumbled at Christs Doctrine: The
Doctrine of Justification by Faith laying hold on
Christs Righteousness, <hi>Rom: 10. 3. They could not
submit themselves unto the Righteousness of God.</hi> And
his condemning of the very first Motions of the
Heart to Sin; as appears by Christs vindicating the
Law from the corrupt Glosses of the Scribes and
Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. &amp;c. Thus the Doctrine of
Christ, especially the strictness of it, and that acura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Holiness enjoyned by it, is a stumbling Block
unto many yet: How many are they who would
willingly embrace Christ's Doctrine, so as to profess
themselves Christians; But to be so strick laced in
your practice as that ye must dye to the World, deny
your selves, pluck out the Right Eye, cut off the Right
Hand, and so as ye dare not lye, no not for gain, nor
Drink to Excess with your Commerads; nor Curse
and Damn your selves, no not when ye are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
no, nor avenge your selves with your own
hand when ye have gotten a wrong; This they
think sounds harsh, and must either have Liberty in
things of that kind, otherwise they'l altogether
quite It.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Jews</hi> did stumble at the simplicity of the
Gospel and Gospel Ordinances: They could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the laying aside of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies,
which made the Worship of God somewhat glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Carnal Eye, and therefore was that way of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61451:171"/>
Religion called, <hi>Gal: 4. 2. 3. The Rudiments of the
World,</hi> and Pedagogy of the Law fitted for the
Church while she was in her Infancy; as Rudiments
and Pedagogues are for Babes and Children; Now
that the <hi>Jew</hi>'s did stumble at the Way of Christ
because of it's simplicity, and because of the laying
aside that outward dress of Mosaical Ceremonies. Is
clear from the many Disputes which <hi>Paul</hi> hath
throughout his Epistles to that purpose. And this
hath been frequently a ground of Offence and stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to many since, who could not, or cannot think
but God is better pleased with his Worship, when
its decked up with a number of Humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that may breed (as they think) Humility and
Devotion in the Worshipers, than when its gone
about in that plain simple way wherein Our Lord
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath enjoyned it. But this were to make
People wiser than God; For if he had thought such
things needful, or that they would prove acceptable
to him, could he not easily have commanded them;
But now he hath not only not commanded, but also
forbidden any thing of that kind, <hi>Col: 2, 20. Wherefore
if ye be dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>
why, as though living in the World, are ye subject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
Touch not, Taste not, Handle not; which all
are to perish with the using after the Commandments and
Doctrines of Men?</hi> Evidently teaching that the Lord
did not abrogate His own Ceremonies under the Old
Testament, that men might appoint Theirs under
the New. And as to that which is suggested, That
Humane Ceremonies added to Worship are a means
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61451:171"/>
to quicken Devotion, as the Papists affirm of their
Images and Relicts; The Apostle tells us in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
23 <hi>verse, Which things have indeed a shew of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Will-worship and Humility‚Äî</hi> They seem to
be such, but really are not: It's but <hi>A shew of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
Devotion and <hi>Humility</hi> which is wrought by
any Mean of man's Invention.</p>
            <p>4. Men are ready to stumble at Christ and his
Way, because of the sinful Infirmities of Instruments
and Ministers: Let them, say they, mend their
own Faults, and we will mend ours; but as long as
Ministers, the best among them, have their own
Faults, some Pride, some Avarice, some Worse,
Let them reprove our Faults as they please, we will
hold on and be doing; For if Sin were as ill as they
say it is, would not they themselves be more afraid
of it: But herein ye must know that ye stumble
at the Wisdom of God: For as ye heard from 2 <hi>Cor:
4. 7. We have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels, that the
excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us.</hi>
He might have Preached to you by sinless Angels; But
this makes more for the Glory of God, when he
makes use of Men puzled with a Body of Death
like your selves, as an Hammer in his Hand to beat
down the Body of Death in others; For we must
say in this Case, no Thanks to the Preacher, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</p>
            <p>5. Men are ready to stumble at the Scandalous
Out-breakings of others: Especially of those whom
Christ hath employed as Instruments for promoting
his Kingdom in Peoples Hearts; No doubt this made
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61451:172"/>
many stumble at Christ and his way, That <hi>Judas</hi>
one of his Own Company for Covetousness did sell his
Master, and hang'd himself afterwards. And indeed
such Scandalous slips in those do prove dreadful
Stumbling-blocks, First, To Profane men, who
have no Love to Religion, but lie at a catch to lay
hold on any thing whereby they may throw dirt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and here they get the very thing they wish:
Hence (saith Christ) <hi>Woe to the World because of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi>
They think themselves Happy because of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
For they have got that which makes Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hateful: But our Lord saith, <hi>Woe be to them because
of Offences,</hi> For they prove stumbling-blocks and
break-necks to them. Again they prove dreadful
stumbling blocks to Godly weak ones, whose face
is thereby covered with shame, so as they have not
the courage to go on in Christs Way, and set their
Face against the storm of reproach, and disgrace,
which is raised up with such like work: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
know there is no reason to stumble
at Christ or his Way for any thing of that kind: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
1. He approveth no such Scandalous outbreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
His Word condemns them in all, and in none
more than in his Followers: Because <hi>David</hi> by his
fall made the Enemies of God to transgress, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sword never departed from his House. 2. He
permits such Offences to be, for holy wise and just
Reasons, or that wicked men may thereby get occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to vent that inward Spite they still carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion and Godliness; and so in Gods holy
justice be permitted to break their necks upon them.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61451:172"/>
And 3. That all (even the best) may see therein
their own weakness before a tentation, and what
unspeakable obligations they are under to God, That
they are not made examples of humane frailty unto
others, as others are to them. And <hi>4ly</hi> That all
may learn not to have the Persons of men in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to love Truth and cleave unto it, not for the
Piety of men who owne it, but from that worth that
is in Truth it self: So as that tho the very Ministers
themselves who Preach it should run away from it,
or by their Scandalous outbreakings thro durt upon
it, Yet ye may still adhere to it: In which case, that
whereon others stumble and break their neck, should
make you advance the faster in your way, and God
should bring you <hi>meat out of the eater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>6th</hi> thing that proves a stumbling block unto
many is, Diversity of Opinions: There are so many
Religions, and Opinions about Religion, they know
not which to follow, let all men once agree among
themselves and then thy, I'l choose, but till then
they'l forbear; and so in effect do mock at all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
But neither should this be: For in the deep
wisdom of God <hi>There must be Heresies‚Äîthat they
which are approved may be made manifest. 1 Cor:</hi> 11. 19.
Besides It lyeth not in the Devils power so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
matters but that humble seekers of God will
find out the right way, He that guids the blind in a
way they know not, will lead such: There are proud
conceity People, even tho otherwise good, and
there are also Careless profane People, that is, Such
as look upon all Religion as Policy; who are most
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61451:173"/>
like among such uncertainties, to lose their way.</p>
            <p>7. People are ready to stumble at Christ and his
way, Because of the Quality of his followers; It's
the Poor receive the Gospel: <hi>John 7. 48. Have any
of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</hi> And
as Christs Followers are of the poorest sort; So usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Cross is their Livery <hi>Through many tribulations</hi>
(saith Paul) <hi>they must enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
And who is Poor, sickly, tender, despised, mocked
at, afflicted in body and mind, if Christs Followers
be not? But there is no Reason for stumbling at
Christ and his Way for this; And if thou stumble at
it, thou stumbles at the wisdom of God, who 1 <hi>Cor:
1. 27‚ÄîHath chosen the foolish things of the World, to
confound the wise; and‚Äîthe weak things of the World to
confound the things which are mighty; And base things
of the World, and things which are despised, hath God
chosen‚Äî</hi> And as to the Cross they get noe more of it
than what is needful for them 1. <hi>Peter 1, 6‚ÄîThough
for a season (if need be) ye are in heaveness‚Äî</hi> It is needful,
and they find it needful; so as many times they will
be made to say, they could not want one dram of it;
besides that the bitter Cross makes Christ the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to them, and so sweet, as to furnish them with
more contentment in their Crossed condition, than
a King hath, who swayeth a scepter; <hi>Psalm 4. 6.
The light of Gods countenance made</hi> David <hi>Glad</hi> &amp;c.
To this add, Their Heaven is not here; and the
Lord of purpose maketh earth bitter to his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that Heaven may be the sweeter when it cometh.</p>
            <p>8. Not only common Calamities from God, but
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61451:173"/>
bitter persecutions from men, attend the way of
Godliness; and these make many stumble and take
up an halt. Christ our Lord <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 21. Speaks
of a sort of men, who‚Äî<hi>when tribulation or persecution
ariseth because of the word, by and by they are offended.</hi>
And the experience of all times sheweth that many
formerly forward do then faint: Neither want they
their pretended Reasons, for they are made to suffer
as evil doers, often as disloyal or seditious persons,
which to some, makes sufferings more terrible than
any other thing. Again, they'l but faint and shame
the Truth when they are put to it, and therefore
think it better to quite it in time; And how can
they be answerable to God, to run the hazard of los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all they have in the World, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and posterity Beggars; To this add, what if
sufferings should run higher than goods, even to their
life? They are not ready to dye, and so they may
lose their Souls; besides they yeild but in a little,
but quit not all; and therefore it is not wisdom
(think they) to be too peremptor, These and such like
Reasons make many stumble at Persecution and a
suffering Lot, when it attends God's way and those
that walk in it; But there is as little cause to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at Christ and His Way, at this, as for the rest;
For seeing Christ our Lord and Master went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
through a sea of many sad sufferings, why
should it be look'd upon as a matter unbeseeming, or
a ground of stumbling, that it is with the Servants as
it was with their Lord, and with the Disciples as it
was with their Master: Christ strives to prevent his
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61451:174"/>
Disciples stumbling by the same Reason, <hi>John</hi> 15, 15.
Again, a Suffering Lot hath still, when it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ's Fellowers, made Christs Way, the Way
of Truth and Piety, a gainer: It hath ever proven
so, as might be made appear both from Scripture
and Ecclesiastick History: As it was with the Apostle
Paul <hi>Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>p.</hi> 1. 12. So hath it been, and so it will be,
with all Christ's suffering Followers‚Äî<hi>I would</hi> (saith
he) <hi>Ye should understand‚Äîthat the things which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
unto me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance
of the Gospel:</hi> This ever hath, is, and will be, God's
none-such Way, wherein none can follow him, to
make his Truth, his Work, his Church, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
thrive best when they are born down most:
As the Children of <hi>Israel Exod:</hi> 1. 12. Who‚Äî<hi>the
more they were afflicted, the more they multiplied and grew</hi>
and therefore to stumble at Christ's way because of
Persecution, and a suffering Lot which usually doth
attend it, is nothing else but to break our neck upon
the deep and infinite wisdome of God; because he
takes his own Way, the surest and speediest way, to
make his Church to grow; and will not take Ours.
Besides all these pretexts and excuses of stumbling
on this account may be easily answered: For tho
it hath been the lot of Gods Servants, even when
they have suffered for Righteousness, to be suffering
in the eye of the World as evil Doers; yet, in that
case men must think it enough that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves unto God; and that there is a
day coming when their integrity shall be brought
forth as the Light. 1, <hi>Cor: 4 3‚Äîwith me</hi> (saith the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61451:174"/>
Apostle) <hi>it is a very small thing that I should be judged
of you, or of man's Judgment‚Äîhe that judgeth me is the
Lord.</hi> Again none ever suffered that for him which
he did suffer for them; He takes nothing from men
but what he hath first given unto them, neither puts
he them to more than what he doth fit and strengthen
them for: It holdeth constantly, <hi>In the mount the
Lord will be seen.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet: 4. 14. If ye be reproached
for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of
Glory and of God resteth on you‚Äî</hi> And when People
are put to the outmost of what can be expected, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to lay down their Lives; what is it but a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their debt a little sooner? For once die they
must: And tho they should shift the matter at that
time, how quickly may God take their life from them
another way; possibly in a long lingering and pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sickness, with greater torment, and a gnawing
worm of Conscience besides: and for any loss of
goods, Lands, and inheritance, that either People
themselves, or others of their Relations may sustain,
by cleaving to Christ's Way in a suffering time; It
is not to be valued to the loss of God's favour and
countenance, which cannot but follow, if men do
otherwise; God's peace and Favour, the light of
his countenance listed up, is that Hundred fold, more
than houses, brethren, sisters, Children, and Lands,
which a man who suffereth the loss of all these things
for Christ's sake and the Gospels, shall receive even
now in this life: As our Saviour teacheth <hi>Mark. 10.
29,</hi> 30. So besides that God hath a thousand ways to
make up to men any loss of that kind: at least so
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61451:175"/>
far, as no man who sets his face towards Heaven,
shall want a competency for carrying him there, and
when a man's once there, he needs no more: <hi>Matth:
6. 33‚ÄîSeek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you.</hi> And
many things may fall out that may impoverish you,
in which ye will neither have that honour nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
which attends the Christians loss for
Christs sake. And tho ceding for a little might
put a storm of trouble by; yet he that is not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the little, will never be faithful in that which
is more; and it is Satan's Policy at all times to draw
out the cause of sufferings to small things; As <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Hoof, <hi>Mordecart</hi>'s Beck, and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s opening of his
window: In which case, to wit, the case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
even small things become great. From all
which It's aboundantly clear there is no real Reason
why any should stumble at Christ and his Way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of Peresecution, or a suffering lot which usually
doth attend it.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>Ninth</hi> and Last thing which makes People,
ready to stumble at Christ and his Way, and not
only at one piece of his way, but the whole bulk of
Godliness, and turn perfect Atheists, is, The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
temper of Ministers<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> When, Alas so much
the more is our shame! it is usually observed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Ministers (almost of all Countries<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>) are of
that Religion and Way which is most in Credit, and
which the sway of the Court runs most for: Thus
among Papists, almost all are Papists; In <hi>Sweden</hi> and
<hi>Denmark,</hi> almost all are Lutherans: And here with
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61451:175"/>
Us, and in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> almost all are Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists:
And that which increaseth the Scandal and
Rock of Offence is, When it is observed they easily
turn their Tongues to speak the language of all
times, forewardly crying up such a Way the one year,
when the Ruling Power is for it, and not only crying
it up, but engaging their Credit and Conscience by
the most solemn Tyes which can be imagin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men to promote it, and pressing, with all
the most serious vehemency that Men can use, upon
the Lords People to do the like. And yet when
times change, and that they perceive the promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such a Way doth not make for their Worldly
interest, they will cry it as much down again: As if
there were no respect to be had, either to God, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Credit; but only to Peoples Interest and
Standing. Thus in the dayes of <hi>Constantine the Great</hi>
a Godly Prince, all the Ministers almost were Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox:
Again, in his Son <hi>Constantius</hi> his dayes, almost
all of them (even the same Men who had been at
the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and condemn'd the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy)
turned <hi>Arians:</hi> Hence it was then said, <hi>Vnus
Athanasius contra totum mundum.</hi> And as it was in
that Age, so hath it been almost ever since, The
sway of the Court and Ruling Power of the Times,
hath carried with it the generality of Ministers too
great a length, to say and unsay, as they did enjoin
them. This I grant is indeed a Rock, which of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other hath in it most of Offence, a Rock whereon
many a Soul hath made Shipwrack: And if the
mighty Power of God did not preserve his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61451:176"/>
It were a Worlds wonder, if it did not banish
all sence of Religion out of the World, making all
Flesh turn Irreligious Atheists: But notwithstanding
the Word of the Lord doth furnish us with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say of this Rock also; that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why any should stumble at Christ's Way for it.
And 1. Because both Scripture and Humane Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do shew, That though it hath been so almost
in all times; yet the Lord hath guided the matter
so, that he hath still keep'd a Church to Himself.
I have shewed so much already from Church Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time: And for Scripture History,
Ye know in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 14. The tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Defection was so prevalent, that for any
thing could appear to such a sagacious Man as <hi>Elijah,</hi>
He, and he only, <hi>was left alone.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 4.
There were but a few Names <hi>left in Sardis which had
not defiled their Garments</hi> with the Iniquity of the
Times. 2. This may also contribute to remove
stumbling, That the Lord, amongst all the most
general Defections of Ministers, hath ever keeped
some streight: So as the Way of Truth and Piety is
not left without a Witness, and some encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to those that walk in it. In <hi>Achab</hi>'s time there
was one <hi>Elias,</hi> yea several others, tho <hi>Elias</hi> knew
not of them: And in <hi>Sardis</hi> there were a <hi>few names</hi>
at least, who had <hi>not defiled their Garments.</hi> Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
the <hi>Arians</hi> so far prevailed, that it was said, the
whole World groaned and wondred at it self that it
became <hi>Arian,</hi> yet there was One <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And
when Antichrist was to prevail, it is shown <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61451:176"/>
3. That notwithstanding all the Tyranny of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
and the torrent of Corruption in these times,
God should have His <hi>Two,</hi> that is, tho not many,
yet some few Witnesses.</p>
            <p>3. The Lord in His deep Wisdom doth measure
out such a Dispensation for heightning His Churches
Tryal, And that these who keep their Garments
clean may come forth as Gold. It is but an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Tryal, and calls for little Resolution to stand
it out, When all the Lord's Ministers speak one
thing, lifting up their Voice as a Trumpet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the dreadful Judgements of God on all
who turn their back on Truth and Piety; But when
the generality of Ministers at any time do blow the
Trumpet of Defection from the Lord, That speaks
Loyalty indeed, If then, notwithstanding such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
People stand to the Lords Banner, and in
nothing be moved from it: And that because the
Trumpet gives an uncertain sound, speaking one
thing one day and another thing the next: So that
to stumble at Christ's Way because of this when it
falleth out, is to stumble at the Wisdom of God.</p>
            <p>4. Therefore should no Man stumble at Christ
nor His Way for this, because the Lord in all times
hath made it, and no doubt will yet make it, tend
to the advantage of His Way in the close; So as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
times growing more favourable, the
Church of God hath thereby been freed from a Fleece
of Time-servers, who would never otherwayes have
discovered themselves: Besides that others who
through weakness, had turned aside in some degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:61451:177"/>
with the torrent of the time, somewhat against their
Heart, have been made to acknowledge their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God's Glory: And so make up by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
the breach they had made on God's Way
by their Fall. And consequently for any to stumble
at Christ's Way because of This, is to break their
neck on that, which in God's method doth make His
Way most lovely in the Close.</p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Two</hi> Points yet which might be
handled jointly as the former; The one Expressed,
The other Implyed, and both of them serve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the last, to wit, That whatever we meet with
in Christ's Way, we should not love Christ nor His
Way the less: None of these things should make us
take up an halt in His Way, much less turn our back
upon it. For 1. It is an happy thing not to stumble
at Christ or His Way: This is expressed in the Text.
2. The Man who is offended in Christ, who turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his back upon Him because of Stumbling-blocks
or Rocks of Offence in the Way, That Man is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Man and cursed. I might prosecute both these
Points, but for the time I shall forbear, and only say
something in Answer to a needful Question: I think
one may readily ask what I call Christ's Way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
we should not stumble; For there are Men and
Parties of several wayes, There are Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
Sectaries, Socinians, Formalists, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Prelatists or Episcop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>l-men, Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
and Quakers, every one whereof, have
their Own Way about Religion; And no doubt all
of them will call their Own Way Christ's Way: And
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61451:177"/>
therefore it is needful to know which of these wayes
are Christ's Way indeed, that so we may not turn
our backs upon it. In Answer to which Question,
It cannot be expected (if it were but for the time)
I can enter in a Debate concerning what is Right or
Wrong, what is Christs, what is not Christs in All
those Wayes; I shall therefore only give you some
general Directions for finding out what is Christ's
Way amidst the tide and torrent of so many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinions: And these such, that upon the one
hand I think there is no Man having his right Wits
about him, with the least Grain of Piety, but he
must give his Assent unto them; And yet such as
through God's Blessing, being rightly improven,
shall not leave you without a Guide what to choose as
God's Way, and what not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, I doubt not it will be taken for granted
by All. That the Way of Christ whereat we should not
stumble, are the Essentialls of Piety and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I mean Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance unto
Life, Holiness and tenderness of Walk in eschewing
all known Sin, and coming up to the Practice of all
known Duty: This is it I intended mainly all alongs,
to wit, That notwithstanding all the forementioned
Rocks of Offence, ye would not turn Profligate,
Profane, Debauch'd, and Irreligious Atheists; but
hold on in the Way of substantial Piety notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of all, and over the belly of all.</p>
            <p>2. But this is not all: It's but a loose way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and very near to no Religion at all, for a Man to
pretend to no more but adhere to the Practice of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61451:178"/>
Duties, and the Faith of Fundamental Truths,
while in other things he sayes and unsays, and rolls
about with the times: For hereby they may suffer
the Devil to do with the most part of Scripture what
he pleases: For Truths absolutely necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are but few, the Lord in Mercy having so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that the meanest capacity may explicitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them and all of them, seing they cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
without them: But tho there be some few Truths
only of absolute necessity for Salvation; yet there
are others in their own kind also necessary, to wit,
for Gods Glory and your own Comfort, and the Lord
will have you sticking closs by these Truths once
knowing them to be Truths, as well as by others;
and that because a great part of Christ's Way lyeth
in a Mans adherence even to these Truths, to wit,
God's Glory and the Mans own Comfort: And a
Profane loose and indifferent Spirit as to these, doth
both in the nature of the thing and in God's just
Judgement, beget in progress of time, Profane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
and Atheism as to other more great and
substantial Truths: So doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> inform
the <hi>Galatians, Ch. 5. 9. A little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then the great Question is to know which is
Christ's Way in Truths of that sort, that so we
may not stumble at it: For which in the first place
take <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Philipp. 3. 16. Nevertheless where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</hi>
And 2 <hi>John 8. Look to your selves that we lose not these
things that we have wrought</hi>‚ÄîIn a word, whatever
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61451:178"/>
a Man is perswaded on good ground to be Christ's
Way, let him stick closly by That as his way, and
whatever he meet with, beware of doing any thing
wherein his own Heart will condemn him. I say
this, because there are some Truths of an inferiour
Nature, which are as clearly revealed in Scriptures
as other more substantial Truths: And consequently
a Man may as much be perswaded of the one as the
other: And tho another Man may think, or say he
is perswaded of the contrary Error that it is Truth,
and be deceived: Yet it follows not that the Man
who is perswaded of Truth to be Truth is deceived
likewise; There is a Man who in his Dream thinks
certainly he is awake and speaking, that Man cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is deceived: But it were a strange thing to
conclude from that, that the Man who is really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
cannot know if he is so, but must alwayes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he may be deceived and in a Dream.</p>
            <p>This much then for things out of Doubt, and
wherein a Man upon good grounds hath attained to
a full perswasion of the Truth that is in them. But
the greatest Question of all is, concerning Points of
the Truth whereof we are not absolutely perswaded
without some scruple and ground of Doubt to the
contrary, how we may know what is God's Way in
those. And for this I shall give you some Marks. <hi>1st.</hi>
The Light of Nature will teach us in things Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to encline to the surest and safest side, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which least can be said: As for Example, in
that Controversy concerning the adding of Sacred
significant Ceremonies invented by Man to God's
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61451:179"/>
Worship: As; Bowing to Altars, Kneeling at the
Communion, Signing with the Cross at Baptism,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those who plead such Additions to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
and unlawful, do bring <hi>Deutr. 12. 32. What
things soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
not add thereto, nor diminish from it,</hi> And such like
Scriptures for a Proof. The Patrons of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
answer<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> That God forbiddeth such Additions
only which are contrary to the Word, but not such
as are besides the Word neither forbidden nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by it. Now that is the very Answer which
Papists give to Our Protestant Divines, while we use
the same Scripture for an Argument against all their
superstitious Ceremonies invented by Men: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if that Door be once opened, a Door is opened
not only for one or two, but all the Ceremonies of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for on that ground only do they
plead for them: When we ask what Warrand have
they from Scripture for their frequent Crossings,
their use of Salt, Spitle, Exorcisms in Baptism, their
use of Holy Water, Baptising of Bells, Pilgrimages,
and Pennances? They Answer it is enough of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
for the Church to Command them, that they
are not expresly condemned in Scripture. Now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way that is pleaded for such Ceremonies casts
up so wide a gap; It's sure, that to abstain from
them altogether, is the safest.</p>
            <p>2. That Way in things Doubtful is most like to be
Christ's, the Chief Promoters whereof are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with by-ends, self designs to acquire World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honours or Riches, or Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> Benifices to themselves,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61451:179"/>
but on the contrary, the very thing they plead for,
and that part of the Contradiction which they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is, That nothing of that kind, further than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Compitency, and Ministerial respect, should be
bestowed on Christ's Ministers. And upon the other
hand, it is a shrewd Presumption at least that such a
Way is not Christ's, wherein the Chief Promoters
do palpably seek themselves and their own Worldly
Interests: The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> useth to lay great weight
on this Mark, especially <hi>Rom. 16. 18.‚ÄîSuch serve
not our Lord Iesus Christ, but their own belly</hi>‚ÄîSo that
if they seek their own Bellies they serve not our
Lord Jesus Christ. And <hi>Philipp. 3. 18, 19‚ÄîMany
walk‚Äîthat are the enemies of the Cross of Christ‚Äîwhose
God is their belly‚Äîwho mind earthly things.</hi> If
it be evidently seen they mind earthly things, They
are but <hi>Enemies to the Cross of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When People doubt about several Wayes
which of them is Christ's Way, they are to stick by
that unto which they are most engaged, and by
more solemn tyes obliged, until (at least) they be
clearly convinced it is wrong, for very common
understanding will judge That to be the surest.</p>
            <p>4. That way which by the grant of its Adversaries
hath ground in Scripture for it; tho they also say men
may change it, must certainly look more like Christ's
Way than the contrary which is confessed by its prime
Maintainers to have no ground in Scripture, but that
the great Warrand which is given for it, doth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ly in the
Authority of men. Even an heathen King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
did know so much, that every thing in the House of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61451:180"/>
God behooved to be done according to the revealed
will of God; whence he issueth forth a Decree <hi>Ezra; 7,
23. Whatsoever is commaded by the God of Heaven, let
it be diligently done, for the house of the the God of heaven:
for why should their be wrath against the realm of the King
and his Sons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> That which tends most to the promoting
of Piety, and is attended most with the Fruits of a
Godly life, and tender conversation in it's most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
mantainers and followers, and this not for a little
short flash only at it's first beginning and when it is
as it were upon it's Tryals, but at all times when
ever there was any Controversie about it, That
Way I say looketh most like to Christs Way: For
all His Way and every Piece of it tendeth unto That
to make People lead a Godly and Holy life <hi>Titus 2.
11‚ÄîThe Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath
appeared to all men: Teaching us that denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,
and Godly, in this present World.</hi> And upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
That way, whereof the most zealous mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and and followers, as to their generality have
been still plagued with prophanity and looseness;
That way I say looks not like the way of Christ. Wee'l
find Christ himself doth lean no small weight on this
Mark <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15, 16 Where he gives a general
rule whereby to try false Prophets and teachers, to
wit, The Fruits and Effects which their Doctrine
hath upon their own Lives and Conversations <hi>Ye shall
know them</hi> (saith he) <hi>by their fruits: Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles.</hi> And <hi>verse 20.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61451:180"/>
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</hi> Now all
these things are such undoubted Truths as none will
get them deny'd in the general, and yet such as
through Gods Blessing being rightly improven, may
give People light in the former Question, To know
which is Christ's Way, among the many waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> on
foot in the Church of God; so as we need not any
further application, but exhort you with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Paul 2 Tim: 2. 7. Consider what</hi> I <hi>say, and the

when these tidings came to the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,

               </hi> A Man of extraordinary
Parts and Calling (for he was an Apostle, as is clear
from <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 14.) I say the Church sends him as far
as <hi>Antioch,</hi> for helping foreward the Work. And in
this <hi>Verse</hi> we have <hi>Barnabas</hi> his coming to them, and
what he does when he comes: <hi>Who when he came,
and had seen the Grace of God, was glad, and exhorted
them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave

            </p>
            <p>In which Words we have these things considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
1. <hi>Barnabas</hi> his coming to <hi>Antioch.</hi> 2. We
have what he saw when he came, He saw the Grace
of God, to wit, The wonderful effects of God's
Grace, in bringing so many to embrace the Doctrine
of the Gospel. 3. We have what this sight did work
upon him. 1. It made him <hi>Glad.</hi> 2. It brought a
pithy needful exhortation from him to these New
Converts, the sum whereof is here set down‚Äî<hi>That
with purpose of heart, they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:61451:182"/>
What Explication is needful, I shall insist on as I
go through the Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is mentioned he came to <hi>Antioch.</hi> But we
hear nothing of any great train he carried along
with him, Or any great solemnity at his Reception,
tho he was an Apostle the highest Office-bearer in
the Church: But only that he came, doubtless in a
sober way as became a Minister of Christ: It was a
thing then unknown in the World for Church-men
to go accompanied with Trains like Princes, and
that whole Countrey sides and greatest Personages in
them, behooved to wait upon their Grandeurs. It
never was well with the Church of God since
Church-men began to overtop Peers and Nobles.
But the thing I mark from this is, That <hi>Barnabas</hi> tho
an extraordinary Office-bearer in the Church and an
Apostle, doth nevertheless obey the Orders of the
Church at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> For it's mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 22. That
the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> sent him forth, and here,
That he did come accordingly: Now what this
Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was, to whose Directions he
subjected himself, is clear from <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18. It was
the Church of Elders or Presbyters, even a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as hath been made out convincingly these years
by-past against the <hi>Independants.</hi> To the direction
of which Elders, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did submit himself
there, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> doth here. From which it is clear,
that even the Apostles and extraordinary Office-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the Church were very respective and tender
of that Authority which Jesus Christ hath given to
His Church and the Judicatories thereof. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
chiefly in <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:61451:182"/>
               <hi>First.</hi> When there were Churches constitute and
Church Judicatories erected to manage the Discipline
of the Church, the Apostles did not exercise power
of Jurisdiction over these Churches by themselves
alone, neither in the Ordination of Ministers, nor
in the Censuring or Excommunicating of Scandalous
Offenders, but tho they were without doubt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Pastors of the whole Church, yet they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the same to Ordinary Church Judicatories: Thus
<hi>Paul</hi> doth not Ordain <hi>Timothy</hi> to be a Minister alone,
but admits the Ordinary Presbytery to do it. 1 <hi>Tim.
4. 14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was
given thee by prophesy, with the laying on of the hands
of the Presbytery.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. he clearly speaks of
the power of Excommunication as residing in the
Church Judicatory at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and reproves them for
their not making use of that Power in Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the Incestuous Person, and stirrs them up to
their Duty. <hi>V.</hi> 4, 5. That <hi>In the Name of our Lord
Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> V. 5. <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
such an one unto Satan, for the destruction of the
Flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> thing wherein the Apostles did show
their respect to Church Judicatories was this which
is here mentioned in the Text, That in many things
they were ordered by, and subject to their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Thus in the place cited <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. The
Church of Elders or Presbyters at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> give
their Injunctions to <hi>Paul</hi> that for removal of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

that many thousands of Jews had taken against
him he should publictly practise some of the Jewish
Ceremonies in purifying himself and shaving his
head, which were at that time things indifferent:
And accordingly it's mentioned v. 26. That <hi>Paul</hi>
did follow their direction: All which shews that the
Authority of Church Judicatories was very much
tendred even by the Apostles themselves. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
do indeed boast themselves to be the Apostles
Successors, and their only Successors, I shall not stand
upon this, It being made very clear by Protestant
writers against the Papists, In the controversy about
the Pope, That the Apostles had no Successors, as to
what was extraordinary in their Office; and as to that
which was Ordinary in it, as to Preach the Word,
Dispense the Sacraments, and exercise Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
over particular Churches, That they have
in these all Ministers for their Successors: But passing
that, What I am now on is, That the Bishops of these
latter times have encroached more upon the Power
and priviledge left by Christ unto his Church and
Church Judicatories, than ever the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themselves
(whose Successors they give themselves
out for) did. For as I have cleared from the present
Doctrine, The Apostles did leave the matters of
Ordinary Jurisdiction to be managed by Ordinary
Church Judicatories; but so do not they, The
whole Body of Christ's Ministers within a Church
(though they were all gathered together) may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ordain a Minister, nor Excommunicate a
Scandalous Offender, but this must be done only by
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61451:183"/>
the Bishop, and such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e doth Substitute under him
for it. Again the Apostles were in some things at
least subject and ordered by the Directions of
Church Judicatories, but so are not They, such a
Condiscendance could not stand with their Honours
and Dignities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have in the Text what <hi>Barnabas</hi> saw
among them when he came, and this is called, <hi>The
Grace of God.</hi> The meaning whereof is not as if all
of them had been converted and indued with saving
Grace, neither doth Grace here signify Gods Grace
inherent in them, but Gods Grace and free Favour
which he saw in the effects of it, in that it wrought
so Powerfully in bringing a great many to embrace
the Doctrine of the Gospel among whom there (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
were many sincere and real Converts, though all of
them were not so. However the thing he saw was,
The mighty progress and success of the Gospel; and
this occasioned by a strong and cruel Persecution
(mentioned verse 19) the Ministers are forced to flee
from their Flocks; wherever they go they Preach,
Gods Grace and mighty Hand accompanies their
Labour to the Conversion of many thousand Souls,
this is the <hi>Grace</hi> which <hi>Barnabas</hi> saw.</p>
            <p>Hence take this Doctrine, That sadest Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Truth do frequently prove an occasion of the
Gospels spreading: Thus it was <hi>Act: 8. 3. Saul‚Äîmade
havock of the Church, entring into every House, and
haling Men and Women, committed them to Prison.</hi> v. 4.
<hi>Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went every
where Preaching the Word,</hi> Even as far as <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>nice,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61451:184"/>
Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 19 of this <hi>Chapter</hi>
The making havock of the Church occasioned the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of the Church, which hath frequently fallen
out since, which gave ground to that true and ancient
saying, <hi>The Blood of Martyrs is the seed of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reasons why the Work and Grace of
God thrives best at such times may be many. As 1.
Peoples Ears are then bored and readiest to drink in
the Word with greediness, because then they have
little other comfort left them: Affliction and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
is a Tasty Sawce to make the Word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
<hi>Psal. 141. v. 6. When their Judges are overthrown
in stony places, they shall hear my words for they are
sweet.</hi> 2. At such times the Servants of Christ are
more diligent in their Work, as they can have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to it, and more fervent in dealing with God by
Prayer for a Blessing to their Work, because the thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Work is all the reward which they can
then expect. And 3. The Lord doth then, usually
countenance the Labours of his Servants most, because
they are most despised, few do then care for them,
or takes any notice of them. And therefore the Lord
takes this way, both to hearten them and to put re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
upon them. And 4. The Couragious, Constant
and Cheerful enduring of Hardships and Sufferings
for Truth, doth commend that Truth for which they
suffer, unto others, even to indifferent Spectators;
and makes them enquire after it, and desirous to know
what so much worth there can be in it.</p>
            <p>I shall not insist for Application, hasting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the latter part of the Text, Only if it be
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61451:184"/>
so, Then People are not to lookupon Persecution
and a suffering time for Truth, whenever it comes,
as so sad, so dismal, and dreadful a thing, For this
at least may be expected to be lovely in it; The same
Truth which men labour to bear down, shall spread
the faster and the further. And that this is so, the
following Doctrine will shew.</p>
            <p>Another Doctrine ariseth from the first effect this
sight did work on <hi>Barnabas,</hi> It made him <hi>Glad,</hi> for
so saith the Text, <hi>Who when he came and had seen the
Grace of God was glad.</hi> The Doctrine is this, That
the Gospel and Truth do spread, and gain ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
People, is matter of Joy and gladness to a
Godly heart, though the times were otherwise never
so sad: For there were many things to make <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
sad at this time, If we consider 1. How they
had stoned the first Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> to death, a man
full of the Holy Ghost, and used him so as if he had
been the most notorious Malefactor that ever the
Earth carried. And 2. The prosperous state of the
Churches Enemies, the Scribes, Pharisees, High-Priests,
a company of degenerate corrupt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who at that time did sit at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> guiding
all things at their pleasure, That if any did but mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against their State and Dignity, though in the
furthest part of all the Realm, their hand could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reach them; They needed no more but hound
out a <hi>Saul</hi> with a Commission if it were to <hi>Damasc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
to take them, and bring them bound to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
As is clear from <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1, 2. And 3. if ye consider
his own poor condition, and that of others the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61451:185"/>
of Christ at that time, who were hunted from
corner to corner, yea from Kingdom to Kingdom.
These, and many such things as these, were at that
time to make <hi>Barnabas</hi> sad, and yet this makes him
take all in the better part, and in a manner digest
all, <hi>That when he came he saw the Grace of God</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
the Labours of his despised Servants, and
a rich Income of Souls to the knowledge of Christ
and the Gospel. <hi>And when he saw</hi> this, he was <hi>glad;</hi>
He is in some sort so transported with it, That in a
manner he forgets <hi>Stephen</hi>'s death, he envyeth not
the prosperous state of the Churches Enemies, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
doth much resent his Own hard lot, or that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who were Christs Faithful Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
All which cleareth the Doctrine, That the
spreading of Truth will make a Godly Heart <hi>Glad<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi>
though the times otherwise were never so sad. Thus
was it with the Apostle <hi>Paul, Philip, 1. 12. The things
which happened unto me.</hi> (saith he meaning his Bonds,
Imprisonment and other harsh usage) <hi>have fallen out
rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel.</hi> Whereupon
v. 18. he breaks out, <hi>What then? notwithstanding every
way, whether in pretence or in Truth, Christ is Preached;
and I therein do rejoyce; yea, and will rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Try your selves by this, What it is
that makes you <hi>Glad,</hi> Is it the thriving of Gods work
in Souls? The down-bearing of Sin? The growth
of Piety? If so, It speaks thee to be a man of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
temper: and upon the other hand, If things
of that kind do rather make the sad; and if the back-going
of Gods Work, The destroying what he hath
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61451:185"/>
built, The plucking up of what he hath planted,
The thriving of sin and Wickedness<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> The general
Loosness of the times; If (I say) these things make
thee <hi>Glad;</hi> It speaks thee to be a man of a
woful temper, a very Godless Heart. But 2. If this
be a thing that will make a Godly Heart <hi>Gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> in
the saddest of times, then Pray to God for it; that
it may be so, That the Work of God may thrive in
Hearts, That those woful Spiritual Plagues of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Deadness and Hardness of Heart may be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Gospel may take many by the Heart who
never hitherto knew the Power of it. It's easie for
God to bless his Truth in the Mouth of his despised
and persecuted Servants, and to make a gracious
Change, tho Wickedness were at the greatest hight:
And if he do it, whatever may be the other sadness
of the Times, thou who art a Godly Heart shall have
reason to be <hi>Glad,</hi> yea and thou shall be <hi>Glad,</hi> tho
thou were lying bound in a Prison with <hi>Paul,</hi> thou
shalt in a manner forget thy Sorrow, and in that
thou wilt rejoyce.</p>
            <p>But I come now to the <hi>2d.</hi> Effect which this sight
did work in <hi>Barnabas;</hi> It brought a pithy needful
Exhortation from him to these new Converts: For
saith the Text,‚Äî<hi>When he had seen the Grace of God
he was glad and exhorted them all,</hi> &amp;c. I observe first
in general that this was the Eirand the <hi>Church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
had sent him on, at least the Chief part of it,
and that which he minded most, therefore his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
this part of his Commission is only mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
even his Exhorting of them and Confirming
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61451:186"/>
them, by Preaching to them. Hence this is clear,
That Preaching and Exhortation is one part at least
of the Ministerial Office, yea and a great part of it:
It is such a piece of the Ministers Duty, that both
the Converted and Unconverted have need of it, and
such need, That in an ordinary way they cannot be
saved without it. It's needful to the Unconverted,
For <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.‚Äî<hi>Faith cometh by hearing</hi>‚ÄîAnd
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21.‚ÄîIt pleased God by the foolishness of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to save them that believe.</hi> It's needful also to the
Converted, as is clear both from this Text (for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had seen the <hi>Grace of God</hi> among them, He
seeth it needful to exhort them) and from <hi>Acts 14<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
21,</hi> 22. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Confirm</hi> the <hi>Disciples,</hi> and
exhorted them <hi>to continue in the Faith,</hi> Exhortation
and Preaching even to those that are already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
is God's mean to Confirm them. In a word,
it will neither be good for the Converted nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
among us if ever it come to this (as the
Lord knoweth how soon it may come) that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be looked on as no part, or a very Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of the Ministers Duty, or a thing Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
whether he Preach or not, providing ye Read,
Sing, or Say a Set Service, which within a little can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wear threed-bare to people by frequent
Hearing: Alas! how little Food is there in such like
work for hungry exercised Souls? How little stuff
to rouze up or work upon the dead drouzie secure
Conscience? We read in Scripture that Apostles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
and Ministers, were sent out to preach and
to mind that as a great part of their Work, yea and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61451:186"/>
to mind it more than the Administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17.‚ÄîChrist sent me not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
but to preach the Gospel.‚Äî</hi> That is, not so much
to <hi>Baptize</hi> as to <hi>Preach;</hi> But we never find they were
sent out to read, say, or sing a <hi>Set Service,</hi> and much
less, that they did place the stress of Religion on such
a Service, Caring the less, if that were done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there had been Preaching or not: Alas! Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when we consider how much plain and powerful
Preaching, fervent and Soul-piercing Exhortation
hath been in <hi>Britain,</hi> and how little use, the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have made of it, and how much they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued
it: It were little wonder though liberty
to <hi>Preach</hi> were taken from Ministers, or Preaching
Ministers removed from People, and such set over
them as can do no more than what any School Boy
may do, even to read an Homily or old printed
Preaching, and to chant over a Service Book.</p>
            <p>But I come to the <hi>Exhortation</hi> it self, or rather the
sum of what <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached to them: For we
may not think he spoke neither more or less than
these very words: Doubtless he ran out and enlarged
excellently on these Heads; but this was the sum of
what he said, <hi>He exhorted them all that with purpose
of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi> Here we have
<hi>Two</hi> things. 1. The thing exhorted to, or what he
would have them do, which is <hi>To cleave unto the Lord.
2.</hi> The manner wherein he would have it done <hi>viz.
With purpose</hi> or resolution <hi>of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the First, The thing exhorted to, is, <hi>to cleave
to the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> who usually gets the Name of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61451:187"/>
               <hi>Lord</hi> in the New Testament: And the word rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>[cleave unto him]</hi> signifieth also <hi>continue with him.</hi>
Now the Lord to whom he exhorts them to Cleave,
or to continue with, is, 1 The <hi>Lord Christ Himself,</hi>
who tho Bodily absent, yet is Spiritually present,
and as to the Merit, Vertue, and all the Fruits of His
Death, is offered to us in the Promise: And the
Way how we <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>eave to the Lord</hi> thus, is, By Faith, and
the continuing in the exercise of that Grace: This
is it which is called <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ing in him. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 6. And
<hi>Dwelling in him. 1. Joh.</hi> 4. 13. Take this then for the
first Piece of this large and comprehensive Duty to
which ye are here exhorted, That ye who have fled
to Christ by Faith, <hi>Cleave</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and Continue
with him, that is, mantain what ye have do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ein closing
with Christ, beware of loosing these grips ye have
laid hold on, but frequently renew them, that so
ye may cleave the nearer to him.</p>
            <p>This is nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ary, for 1. Satan will not fail to let
showers of Tentations flee at you, to drive you from
Him, and make you loose your grips; And surely
ye shall be made to loose them, unless you put on a
Resolution thus to <hi>cleave unto Him.</hi> 2. This Cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Him, and Abiding in Him, is the cause of
fruitfulness, <hi>Joh. 15. 4, 5. I am the Vine</hi> (saith Christ)
<hi>‚Äîhe that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth
forth much fruit:</hi> It is little wonder there be but few
Fruits after a Communion, because instead of <hi>Cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord,</hi> and mantaining what ye have done
in closing with him, and instead of doing it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ye do on the contrary upon the least cross Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61451:187"/>
begin to question the reality of what ye
have done, and to retire as Men ashamed, because
ye have Hoped.</p>
            <p>Now that ye may thus mantain what ye have done
in Closing with the Offer of Christ held forth in the
Promise, and so <hi>cleave to the Lord</hi> in the exercise of
Faith; I shall recommend to you these <hi>Three</hi> things.
1. Labour to be tender in your Walk; For tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Walking is a Fruit of Faith, and the want of
it will beget a suspition that ye have no Faith nor
ever had it, and if ye suspect ye want Faith ye can
have little heart <hi>to cleave to the Lord</hi> by exercising it:
There is nothing which more obstructs our Boldness
in adhering to our Interest in Christ, and in our
<hi>Cleaving</hi> to him by Faith, than Untender Walking.
2. Dwell much in the daily sence of your Wants,
this will put you frequently to employ Him: When
People want Water within doors, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
run often to the Well with the Bucket to
draw, but when ye wear out of acquaintance with
your emptiness and Wants, and think ye have a
Fountain and sufficient stock in your selves, ye'l make
but little use of Faith, and seldom use making of it
makes it to decay, that ye cannot make use of it when
ye would. 3. Do not needlesly and without a ground
call in question the reality of your former closing with
him; For that, as I told you before, will make you
heartless to set to it of new; Or however ye questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reality of what ye have done already, yet see
that in no terms ye question your Right to close with
him by Faith, and believe in him for time to come:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61451:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For whatever thou hast done formerly, the Gospel
Offer is yet at thy door, and a Command from God
unto thee to close with it, and if thou hast not done
it in earnest before, thy need is so much the greater
to do it frequently and in earnest now.</p>
            <p>But now to proceed, By (<hi>the Lord</hi> to whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
them to <hi>Cleave,</hi> is not only meaned <hi>The Lord
Himself</hi> as he is offered in the Promise, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all that he hath recommended to our care, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of our respect to him, Thus we testify our
respect to absent Friends by owning their Concerns
and Interests, and if ye ask what these things are that
the Lord Christ hath recommended to our care, I
answer in <hi>two</hi> words, First, His Truth, and next his
Service. So that 1. ye are to Cleave unto, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his Truth against Error; according to what
the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> commands, <hi>V. 3<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>‚ÄîYe should earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contend for the Faith,</hi> (to wit, the Doctrine of Faith
or Truth) <hi>which was once delivered unto the Saints
2.</hi> We are to Cleave to and Continue in his Service,
whether the Duties of Immediate Worship we should
cleave to these against Superstition, voluntary ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,
Will-worship and Idolatry: Or the Duties of
our Particular Callings and Stations; All which
should be gone about as Service to him; So Servants
are to do <hi>their service with good will, as to the Lord,
and not to men, Ephes.</hi> 6. 7. Now that Cleaving to
all These is meaned by <hi>Cleaving unto the Lord,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Deutr.</hi> 10. 20. and 30. 20. where <hi>Cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord</hi> is explained by <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> by
<hi>obeying his voice,</hi> by <hi>serving him</hi> and <hi>swearing by his
name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:61451:188"/>
Now to speak a little to each of these. 1. Ye must
<hi>Cleave</hi> to and continue in his Truth. <hi>Gaius</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for this 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. even that <hi>he walked in the
Truth;</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23. we are bidden <hi>Buy the
Truth and sell it not;</hi> And ye heared from <hi>Jude,‚ÄîYe
should contend for the Truth:</hi> For Error contrary to
Truth is of a Damning Nature, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 1. They
are called <hi>Damnable Heresies;</hi> And Error in point
of Truth makes way for Prophanity and loosness of
Life, a sound Heart and an unsound Head cannot
well subsist; Therefore doth <hi>Peter 2 Epist.</hi> 3. 17. call
Error‚Äî<hi>The error of the wicked<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>For helping you to this needful Duty of <hi>Cleaving
to the Lord,</hi> by <hi>Cleaving</hi> to His Truth, I shall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to you these things. 1. Beware of Scepticism,
or making all Truths debateable, or those Truths
especially which may bring you in greatest hazard
to confess or cleave to: This is down right contrary
to the Cleaving to Truth here enjoined. 2. Do not
undervalue any Truth, say of no Truth as <hi>Lot</hi> said
of <hi>Zoar, (is it not a little one?)</hi> and so I may skip from
it. It's true there is a difference among Truths, some
greater Truths and some smaller; But as it is of Sins,
so it is of Errors, The lesser alwise doth make way
for the greater, and there is no Truth which cometh
not from the God of Truth; And therefore no Truth
which ye should look on as a thing Indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye think so or otherwise of it: Besides in times
of Defection from Truth, it is the usual Artifice of
Persecuters to extenuate those Truths they labour to
bear down, as things Indifferent, and very triffles;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61451:189"/>
When in the mean time their own practice doth give
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>r Profession the lie; For if they thought them
things indifferent and triffles, why would they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>n for adhering to them? Besides tho some
Truths be not so absolutely necessary to Salvation, but
a Man may be saved tho he think otherwise, yet it
doth not follow we should be careless of all such:
Thus tho a Man's hand be not so absolutely necessary
but he may live without it, yet he were a mad Man
who on that account would wittingly and willingly
cut it off: Besides an Error in some Truths, which will
not damn one, may condemn another who knows
at least may easily know it to be an Error, and yet will
live and die in the Justification of it without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
3. Ye ought chiefly to cleave to those Truths
which ye are most engaged to owne, either by God's
sealing them to your Spirits, or by Catechising and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
you from your very Childhood in them, so
that ye are put out of all doubt of the Truth that is in
them, or by bringing you under most sacred Tyes of
Solemn Vows and Oaths to maintain them; I say, ye
ought to look upon it as your Duty chiefly to Cleave
unto such Truths. 2 <hi>Joh. 8. Look to your selves that we lose
not those things that we have wrought;</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,
<hi>It is not safe after vows to make enquiry.</hi> If a Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
grow once so wide as to let such Truths pass
through either for Errors or Triffles, he may perswade
himself there is not a Truth in all the Bible, if he be hard
put to it that he'l stick at, but that meeting with a pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
suitable tentation he'l let it slip through after them
4. We are to Cleave to Truth not only by retaining
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61451:189"/>
the knowledge of it, and by giving assent to it in
our Judgements but also by giving a modest and
faithful profession and confession of that Truth on all
hazards when we are called to it: This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
1 <hi>Pet: 3. 15. Be ready alwise to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you, with meakness and fear,</hi> and <hi>Rom: 10. 10.‚Äî
With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and
with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</hi> This
is necessary both for the honour of God, <hi>Truth</hi> being
a piece of his Name which we are bound to confess
<hi>Rev: 2. 13‚ÄîThou holdest fast my name and hast not
denyed my faith‚Äî</hi> And its necessary also in order to our
own Salvation For <hi>whosoever</hi> (saith our Saviour)
<hi>will confess me before men, him will I also confess before
my father which is in heaven; but whosoever will deny
me before men, him will I also deny before my father
which is in heaven.</hi> This now as upon the one hand
it doth not justify unseasonable Confession contrary
to <hi>Matth: 7. 6‚ÄîCast not your pearls before swine, lest
they trample them under their feet, and turn again and
rent you;</hi> So upon the other hand it reproves those
who dar not or will not give a Confession of the
Truth even when they are called to it, and much
more those who deny the Truth either expresly, or
Interpretativly, That is, when they do that which
men are apt to take and have reason to take for a
denial of the Truth, tho they do not deny it in so
many words.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> We must <hi>cleave unto the Lord</hi> by
Cleaving to and continuing in his Service, for that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61451:190"/>
is the other thing which he hath recommended to our
Care, as an evidence of our respect to him: <hi>Joshua</hi>
bids the People, <hi>Take diligent heed‚Äîto cleave unto the
Lord and serve him,</hi> Jos: 22. 5. Now this holds first
of the Ordinances he hath appointed for his Service
and Immediate Worship: Ye must Cleave to these.
In order to which. 1. Beware of Will-worship, or
doing that in his Worship which he hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Colos, 2 20. Wherefore if ye be dead with
Christ from the Rudiments of the World: Why as though
living in the World, are ye subject to Ordinances?</hi> To
wit, Ordinances and Commandments of Men in
Gods Service, as he explains verse 22. And he gives
some instances of them verse 21. <hi>Touch not, taste not,
handle not.</hi> It is true men may appoint the outward
Circumstances of Order and Decency for going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these parts of God's Worship which he hath
commanded; such as are Time and Place, what
hour of the day ye shall meet at publick Worship, and
in what Place, and such like, which are Common
both to Civil and Religious Actions; but they may
not under that pretext, appoint new practices of
Worship to God, or significant engaging Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
As for example, That the Sign of the Cross be
used in Baptism, As a Token we shall not hereafter
be ashamed to Confess Christ Crucified; And that
Ministers Preach with a White Shirt or Surplice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their Garments, to signify the Holiness of their
Calling; or as the Ancients did ordain those who
were Baptized to wear White Garments for the
space of eight dayes after Baptism, To signify their
<pb facs="tcp:61451:190"/>
being washen from Sin: For by that same Rule,
They may command every one to taste Vinegar and
Gall at the Communion, as a Sign that they shall not
be ashamed of Christ who Died so: And to put on an
Helmet, Breast-plate, and other Armour in time of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship, To signify our Resolution to Fight the
Battle against Sin and Satan so long as we live; And
suck or drink in Milk publickly in time of Divine
Worship, In token that by Faith we draw in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby.
Now any may see that to command these and such
like, were to appoint New Work in Gods Service,
and more than to do that Work he hath appointed
Orderly and Decently. Besides many things of
Lesser moment and of the same nature with these;
I mean significant Ceremonies are appointed by God
in his Law, to which there is yet added that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Deut. 12. 32. What thing soever I command you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to do it, thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish
from it.</hi> So that the appointing any such things in the
Worship of God is an adding to Gods Law which
is there prohibited.</p>
            <p>I shall be more brief in the following Directions for
<hi>Cleaving</hi> to the Ordinances of Gods Immediate Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
And therefore 1. Beware of Irreligious Impiety
in neglecting these Ordinances: Ye are commanded
to wait upon them, <hi>Pray without ceasing, Despise not
Prophesying (or Preaching) Speak to your selves in Psalms
and Hymns, Give attendance unto Reading.</hi> Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>cleave to the Lord</hi> in these Ordinances if ye neglect
to go about them; ye must countenance publick
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61451:191"/>
Ordinances, make Conscience of secret Duties. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of Formality in going about them, by resting
in an out-side work; But above all things, strive to
bring the Heart up to them, otherwise ye do not
as ye ought, <hi>cleave unto them, God is a Spirit, and will
be Worshiped in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> The Lord will
not rockon you to <hi>cleave</hi> unto them, tho ye be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at them, if so your Heart be far away from them.
<hi>3dly.</hi> Beware of up-sitting or back-sliding from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Conscience of them, after ye have once begun;
That it be not said of you as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said
once of the <hi>Galatians, Ye have run well, but who did
hinder you that ye should not obey the Truth.</hi> Otherwise
ye do not cleave unto them.</p>
            <p>But further, This <hi>cleaving to the Lord,</hi> by <hi>cleaving</hi>
to and Continuing in his Service doth hold in the
Duties of our Particular Callings and Stations. And
in order to your Cleaving to these, or to the Lord
by making Conscience of these. 1. Do not neglect
them; I mean those Duties which ye owe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Servants, or as Masters; as Parents, or as
Children; as Husbands, or as Wives; as Magistrats,
or as Subjects: Much of the Life and Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is manifested in the Conscientious discharge of
such Duties; and a man manifests best what he hath
by making Conscience of such; <hi>Rom:</hi> 12. 11. Ye
are not to be <hi>Sloathful in Business.</hi> 2. What ye do
even in things of that kind, strive to do it as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Lord. For (as I have shew'd) so much
is enjoyned Servants; Thus shall ye <hi>Cleave to the
Lord,</hi> even by going about your Ordinary Calling,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61451:191"/>
when ye discharge the Duties thereof as Service to
Him, that is, when ye do them because He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
you so to do, and that ye may adorn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and take away all occasion of Reproach, by
your Conscientious Diligence in the practice of them.
3. Let not the Duties of your particular Stations
make you neglect the Duties either of Publick or
Private Worship, there is time for both, ye cannot
<hi>Cleave to the Lord</hi> in the Duties of the one sort, if
they shall justle out the Duties of the other. 4 Strive
to keep Communion with God even in the practice
of such Duties, by sending up secret thoughts and
pithy ejaculations to God among hands; as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
did <hi>chap.</hi> 2. By labouring to make a Spiritual
use of every thing that occurs, or which ye meet
with. This much now for their <hi>cleaving to the Lord,</hi>
the thing He would have them to do.</p>
            <p>I shall now speak a little only, to the manner
wherein the Lord would have it gone about; Its <hi>with
a purpose</hi> or resolution, and a <hi>purpose of Heart.</hi> 1. It's
with a purpose and resolution, he would have them
take on a fixed resolution to do, and that as an help
to make them do: Hence take this Doctrine, That ye
may <hi>cleave to the Lord</hi> and continue constant and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in his Truth and Service, ye must take on a fixed
Resolution and Purpose so to do, I suppose ye have
taken on such a Resolution as this at your coming to
the Lords Table, but tho ye have done it, yet your
wisdom will be every day to renew it: <hi>David</hi> had
taken on such a purpose, <hi>Psal. 17. 3‚ÄîI am purposed that
my Mouth shall not transgress,</hi> yea he binds himself by
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61451:192"/>
an Oath to it, <hi>Psal. 119. 106, I have Sworn, and I
will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments</hi>
This is that piece of the spiritual armour called
<hi>Ephes: 6. 15‚ÄîThe preparation of the Gospel of peace.</hi>
Even a prepared, ready, resolute purpose in the Lords
strength, to go on in the Way of Truth and Duty,
notwithstanding of any hazard, hardship, or difficulty,
I say it must be a Purpose taken on in the Lords
strength, for without him we can do nothing; For
sayeth <hi>David Psal: 71. 16. I will go in the strength of
the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ye must labour to bring up your hearts to
such a Resolute Purpose as this, to go on in the Way
of Truth and Duty, notwithstanding hazard, hardship
and difficulty: For 1. The want of such a Resolution
or Purpose will not keep off Tryal and trouble, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the putting of it on, hasten Tryals. <hi>Job
34. 33. Should it be according to thy mind? he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
it, whether thou refuse or whether thou choose.</hi>
2. Couragious Resolution and <hi>Purpose</hi> to fear no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
but to charge through all difficulties and
hazards, is half victory <hi>Jam: 4. 7. Resist the Devil and
he will fly from you.</hi> 3. When a Resolution and Purpose
is once laid, to undergo all that ye may meet with
in the Way of Truth and Duty, it is usually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with cheerfulness in Duty: Now God loveth a
chearful giver, when upon the contrary if an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
storm of Tryal and trouble come on a man
before he be fully resolved to endure the worst of it,
It doth at least very much damp and weaken him,
if it do not wholly make him quite the way. 4.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61451:192"/>
The promise is made only to the persevering and
Resolved man; <hi>He that endureth to the end shall be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
when <hi>The backslider in heart shall be filled with his
own wayes</hi> (Prov: 14. 14.) That is, he shall meet with
some plague and judgment in his way, which will
make him weary of it and be grieved of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
e're all be done, tho this usually comes out of
time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vse</hi> is for Reproof to those who are like the
<hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, <hi>halting betwixt two Opinions,</hi>
and can never suffer themselves to come to an even-down
Resolution and <hi>Purpose</hi> on all hazards to <hi>cleave to
the Lord,</hi> to his Truth and his Service, whatever
it may stand them; but do either think to put the
evil day far from them, by imagining they'l one way
or other Shift it: or if they see no probability in this,
but that once it will be at their door; yet they keep
themselves Irresolute, in an hovering suspense what
to do when trouble cometh; Whence so soon as
they meet with a tentation, they begin to Capitulate
with it, when they should Resolutely repell it, and
after a little Capitulating, they'l find out some shift
or other to beguile themselves, and so do give up
their armes and basely yeild.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> This <hi>Purpose</hi> and Resolution to <hi>Cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord</hi> must be a <hi>Purpose of the Heart.</hi> It's true
every <hi>Purpose</hi> is a <hi>Purpose of Heart</hi> if it be Real;
But there are some Purposes which are not Real, but
naked Convictions of the judgement, that such and
such things should be done, which some are apt to
take for a <hi>Purpose of Heart,</hi> when they are only of a
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61451:193"/>
Heart and a Heart, or of a double and deceitful
Heart, but not of a single and sincere Heart: ye
should therefore labour to be single and sincere in
your Purpose and Resolution of <hi>cleaving unto the Lord,</hi>
such a <hi>Purpose</hi> as your <hi>Heart</hi> may be engadged in
it. For which cause ye must. 1. Forecast what such
a Resolution may stand you, otherwise if ye look
over that, or look not unto it, your <hi>Purpose</hi> will not
be sincere, and ye will not stick by it: and when the
thing comes ye looked not for, ye'l do the thing ye
thought not: and even that which to think on now
would make you say with <hi>Hazae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> 2 Kings 8. 13. Is
thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?</hi>
2. Beware of a mixture of unsincere motives and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends:
If ye resolve to <hi>cleave to the Lord</hi> either for
temporal advantage, or to get a name of Constancy
or to eschew the Imputation of Changeableness this
will argue Unsincerity in your <hi>Purpose,</hi> and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it will not hold out long: Let your eye
therefore be single, in being acted from spiritual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
love to Christ, love to Truth, so shall your
<hi>Purpose</hi> be a <hi>Purpose of Heart</hi> 3. If your <hi>Purpose</hi> to
<hi>cleave to the Lord</hi> be sincere and a <hi>Purpose of
Heart,</hi> then the whole man, your soul, your body,
all the Faculties of the one and Members of the other,
must be ready to follow out their whole <hi>Purpose.</hi>
for the heart commands the whole man, your <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses</hi>
and Resolutions which have nothing of action
following, are not <hi>Purpose's of the Heart;</hi> as when ye
<hi>Purpose to cleave to the Lord</hi> in the mortifying of such
a sin, and yet ye have not power to keep from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61451:193"/>
which lead unto it; ye <hi>Purpose to cleave</hi> to such
a Truth, and yet cannot endure to be at the pains to
get your selves rooted grounded and established in
the Faith and knowledge of it. I say no more but
remember the Text, and be exhorted to <hi>cleave unto
the Lord,</hi> His Truth, His Ordinances, His Service,
<hi>with Purpose of Heart.</hi>
