         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And because these Kingdomes are guilty of many sinnes and provocations against God, and his Sonne Iesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present distresses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dangers, the fruits therof; We professe and declare before God and the world, our unfained desire to be humbled for our owne sinnes, and for the sinnes of these Kingdomes, especially, that we have not as we ought valued the inestimable benefit, of the Gospel; That we have not labored for the purity and power thereof, and that we have not endeavored to receive Christ in our hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives, which are the causes of other sinnes and transgressions, so much abounding amongst us; And our true and unfained purpose, desire, and endeavour for our selves, and all others under our power and charge, both in publicke and in private, in all duties wee owe to God and man, to amend our lives, and each one to goe before another in the example of a reall Reformation, that the Lord may turne away his wrath, and heavy indignation, and establish these Churches and Kingdomes in Truth and Peace. And this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty God, the searcher of hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as we shall answer at that great day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed: Most humbly beseeching the Lord to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to blesse our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

there, the same may be with all religious solemnities swerne and subscribed by all true Professours of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all his Majesties good Subjects in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Extract.</p>

               <p>Some Commissioners also, were sent from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for furthering the Covenant and the intended union of the Churches of both Kingdoms. This Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presented to the Honourable House of Commons, and considered by them in the severall branches and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof, was recommended to a Committee to be chosen of their own Members, and sorne of the Divines of the Assembly, together with the Commissioners sent from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the intent that some expressions might be farther explained, and that the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> also might bee expresly taken into the same league and Covenant with us: Which being done with great care and diligence by those Committees and Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, It was then read in the Assembly of Divines, and afterwards in the House of Commons, and received a most full and universall assent from the Members of both, <hi>Nemine contradicente.</hi> This form of Covenant was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented also to the House of Lords, by whom likewise it was taken into consideration, and approved of, as fit to be entred into by the three Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 22. of <hi>September</hi> it was concluded by the House, this Oath and Covenant should be solemnly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken publikely in the Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> called Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> Church, the Monday following, by the House of Commons and the Assembly of Divines: To which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53696:7"/>
purpose an Order was sent to the Assembly from the House to give them notice thereof; and that some of the Assembly be appointed to pray and to exhort, for the more solemn celebrating of so serious and weighty a service. The Assembly appointed Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> to make the exhortation, Mr. <hi>Iohn White</hi> to pray before, and Mr. Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> to pray after the exhortation. The House met at the usuall place, and thence went with their Speaker to the Church; the Assembly also at the same time with their Prolocutor. A Psalme being sung, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne prayer was made, after the prayer an exhortation to the Honourable House and Reverend Divines en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to this work as a work of a marvellous high nature and concernment. This being ended, Mr. <hi>Alexander Hendersam,</hi> one of the Commissioners sent from the Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being also desired thereunto, made a Speech to the like purpose.</p>
               <p>Then the Covenant was read, notice being first given to the Assembly, that after the hearing of it, each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should immediately by swearing, worship the great Name of God, and testifie so much outwardly by lifting up their hands: which was all done very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and with so much joy seen in their countenances, and manifested by clapping of their hands, as was suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the gravity of such a worke, and the sadnesse of the present times.</p>
               <p>Both Assemblies having thus sworn, with whom the Commissioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> joyned, the Speaker with the Members of the House of Commons, went up into the Chancell, and there subscribed their names in a Roll of Parchment provided for that purpose, in which this Covenant was fairly written, and afterward the Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53696:7"/>
the Commissioners from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Members of the Assembly of Divines did the like in another Roll, which being finished, the Name of God was again solemnly invocated, and praises returned for vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing this Church and Kingdome so happy and joyfull a day; a Psalme was sung, and then the Assembly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed.</p>

               <head>An Exhortation made to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House of Commons and Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Assembly, by <hi>Mr. Nye</hi> before he read the Covenant.</head>
               <p>A Great and solemn work (Honourable and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend) this day is put into our hands, let us stir up and awaken our hearts unto it. We deale with God as well as with men, and with God in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excellencie, for by him we sweare, and at the same time we have to doe with God and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who now reacheth out unto us a strong and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable arme of assistance. The goodnesse of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing succour and help to a sinfull and afflicted people (such are we) ought to be matter of feare and trembling even to all that heare of it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 33. 9. We are to exalt and acknowledge him this day who is fearefull in praises, sweare by that Name which is holy and reverent, enter into a Covenant and league that is never to bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by us nor our posterity, and the fruit I hope of it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53696:8"/>
shall be so great, as both we and they shall have cause to remember it with joy; and such an Oath as for matter, persons, and other circumstances, the like hath not been in any age or Oath we read of in sacred or humane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet sufficiently warranted in both.</p>
               <p>The parties ingaging in this league are three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, famous for the knowledge, and acknowledgement of Christ above all the Kingdoms in the world; to swear before such a presence, should mould the spirit of man into a great deale of reverence; what then to be engaged, to be incorporated, and that by sacred Oath, with such an high and Honourable Fraternity? An Oath is to be esteemed so much the more solemn, by how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the persons are that sweare each to other: as in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when God sweares to his Son, on earth when Kings sweare each to other; so in this businesse, where King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes sweare mutually.</p>
               <p>And as the solemnity of an Oath is to bee measured by the persons swearing, so by the matter also that is to be sworne to; God would not sweare to the Covenant of works, he intended not to honour it so much, it was not to continue, it was not worthy of an Oath of his; but to the Covenant of grace, which is the Gospel, he swears and repents not of it. God sweares for the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and of Kingdoms: And if Kingdoms sweare, what subject of an Oath becommeth them better then the preservation and salvation of Kingdomes, by establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdome of a Saviour amongst them, even our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is a Mediator and Saviour for Nations as well as particular persons?</p>
               <p>The end also is great and honourable, as either of the former, <hi>Two is better then one,</hi> saith He who best knoweth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53696:8"/>
what is best; and from whom alone every thing hath the goodnesse it hath. Association is of divine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring; not only the being of Creatures, but the putting of them together: the cluster as well as the grape is the work of God: confort and harmony amongst men, especially amongst Saints, is very pleasing unto the Lord. If when but two or three agree and assent upon any thing on earth, it shall be confirmed in heaven; and for this, because they gather together in his name, much more when two or three Kingdomes shall meet and consent together <hi>in his name</hi> and <hi>for his name, that God may bee one, and his name one amongst them,</hi> and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence amidst them. That prayer of Christ seemeth to proceed from a feeling sense of his own blessednesse; <hi>Father, that they may be one, as thou in me,</hi> &amp;c. Unity amongst his Churches and Children must needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very acceptable unto him: For out of the more deep sense desires are fetcht from within us, the more pleasing will be the answer of them unto us. Churches and Kingdomes are deare to God, his patience towards them, his compassions over them, more then particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, sheweth it plainly. But Kingdoms willingly engaging themselves for his Kingdome, his Christ, his Saints, the purity of Religion, his worship, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all particulars, and in all humility, sitting down at his feet to receive the law and the rule from his mouth; what a price doth hee set upon such? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when (as we this day) sensible of our infirmity, of an unfaithfull heart not steddy with our God, but apt to start from the cause, if we feele the knife or the fire; who binde our selves with cords, as a sacrifice to the hornes of the Altar. We invocare the name of the great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53696:9"/>
God, that his vowes, yea his curse may be upon us, if we doe not this; yea though we suffer for so doing: that is, if we endeavour not so farre as the Lord shall assist us by his grace, to advance the Kingdom of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ here upon earth, and make Jerusalem once more the praise of the whole world, notwithstanding all the contradictions of men.</p>
               <p>What is this but the contents and matter of our Oath? What doe we covenant? What doe we vow? Is it not the preservation of Religion, where it is reformed, and the Reformation of Religion, where it needs? Is it not the Reformation of three Kingdomes, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatiom universall, Doctrine, Discipline, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in whatsoever the Word shall discover unto us? To practise, is a fruit of love; to reforme, a fruit of zeale; but so to reforme, will be a token of great prudence, and circumspection in each of these Churches. And all this to be done according to Gods word, the best Rule, and according to the best reformed Churches, the best interpreters of this Rule. If <hi>England</hi> hath obtained to any greater perfection in so handling the word of righteousnesse, and truths, that are according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as to make men more godly, more righteous: And if in the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> any more light and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in matters of Order and Discipline, by which their Assemblies are more orderly: Or if to any other Church or person it hath beene given better to have learned Christ in any of his wayes then any of us; wee shall humbly bow, and kisse their lips that can speak right words unto us in this matter, and help us into the nearest uniformity with the word and minde of Christ in this great work of Reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53696:9"/>Honourable and Reverend Brethren, there cannot be a more direct and effectuall way to exhort and perswade the wise, and men of sad and serious spirits (and such are you to whom I am commanded to speak this day) then to let into their understandings the weight, and worth, and great importance of the work they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded unto. This Oath is such, and in the matter and consequence of it, of such concernment, as I can truly say, it is worthy of us, yea of all these Kingdomes, yea of all the Kingdoms of the World; for it is swearing fealty and allegeance unto Christ the King of Kings; and a giving up of all these Kingdomes, which are his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, to be subdued more to his Throne, and ruled more by his Scepter, upon whose shoulders the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is laid, and <hi>in the encrease of whose Government and peace there shall be no end, Esa.</hi> 9. Yea, we finde this very thing in the utmost accomplishment of it, to have been the Oath of the greatest Angel that ever was, who setting his feet upon two of Gods Kingdomes, the one upon the Sea, the other upon the Earth, lifting up his hand to heaven, as you are to doe this day, and so swearing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. The effect of that Oath you shall find to bethis, that the kingdoms of the world become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Lord and his Christ, and he shall reigne for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. His Oath was for the full and finall accomplishment, this of yours for a graduall, yet a great performance towards it.</p>
               <p>That which the Apostles and Primitive times did so much and so long pray for, though never long with much quietnesse enioyed, that which our Fathers in these latter times have fasted, prayed and mourned after, yet attained not; even the cause which many deare Saints now with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53696:10"/>
God, have furthered by extreamest sufferings, poverty, imprisonment, banishment, death, even ever since the first dawning of Reformation: That and the very same is the very cause and work that we are come now, through the mercy of Jesus Christ, not only to pray for, but sweare to. And surely it can be no other, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and answer of such prayers and teares of such since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and sufferings, that three Kingdoms should be thus born, or rather new born in a day; that these Kingdoms should be wrought about to so great an engagement, then which nothing is higher, for to this end Kings raign, Kingdomes stand, and States are upheld.</p>
               <p>It is a speciall grace and favour of God unto you Brethren, Reverend and Honourable, to vouchsafe you the opportunity, and to put into your hearts (as this day) to engage your lives and estates in matters so much concerning him and his glory. And if you should doe no more but lay a foundation stone in this great work, and by so doing engage posteritie after you to finish it, it were honour enough: But there may yet further use be made of you, who now are to take this Oath, you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as chiefe master Builders and choyce Instruments for the effecting of this settled Peace and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which if the Lord shall please to finish in your hands, a greater happinesse on earth, nor a greater means to augment your glory and crown in heaven, you are not capable of. And this let me further adde for your encouragement, of what extensive good and fruit in the successe of it, this very Oath may prove to be, wee know not. God hath <hi>set his Covenant like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> not onely for duration, but like also for exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: The Heavens move and roule about, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53696:10"/>
their light, and heat, and vertue, to all places and parts of the earth; so doth the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, so may this gift be given to other Covenants that are framed to that pattern. How much this solémn League and Oath may provoke other Reformed Churches to a further Reformation of themselves; what light and heat it may communicate abroad to other parts of the world, it is only in Him to define to whom is given the <hi>utmost ends of the earth for his inheritance,</hi> and worketh by his exceeding great power great things out of as small beginnings.</p>
               <p>But however, this I am sure of, it is a way in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility most likely to enable us to preserve and defend our religion against <hi>our common enemies,</hi> and possible a more sure foundation this day will be laid for ruining Popery and Prelacy, the chiefe of them, then as yet wee have been led unto in any age.</p>
               <p>For Popery, it hath beene a Religion ever dexterous in fencing and muniting it selfe by association and joynt strength; all sorts of Professors amongst them are cast into Fraternities and Brother-hoods, and these Orders carefully united by Vow one with another and under some more generall notion of common dependency. Such States also and Kingdoms as they have thus made theirs; they endeavour to improve and secure by strict combinations and leagues each to other, witnesse of late yeares that <hi>La Sainte ligue,</hi> the holy league. It will not bee unworthy your consideration, whether seeing the preservation of Popery hath beene by Leagues and Covenants, God may not make a League or Covenant to be the destruction of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, the very rise of Popery seemeth to be after such a manner by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53696:11"/>
Kings, that is, Kingdomes assenting and <hi>agreeing</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by some joynt Covenant (the Text saith, <hi>with one minde,</hi> why not then with one mouth?) to give their power and strength unto the Beast, and make war against the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where you read the Lamb shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Beast, and possibly with the same weapons, he is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, he can unite Kings and Kingdomes, and give them one minde also to destroy the Whore and be her utter ruine; And may not this dayes work be a happy beginning of such a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed expedition?</p>
               <p>Prelacie another common enemy, that we Covenant and sweare against, what hath it been, or what hath the strength of it been, but a subtile combination of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men formed into a policy or body of their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion framing themselves into Subordination and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie one upon another, so that the interest of each is improved by all, and a great power by this meanes acquired to themselves; as by sad experience we have lately found: The joynts and Members of this body, you know were knit together by the sacred engagement of an Oath, the Oath of Canonicall obedience as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it: You remember also with what cunning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie they endeavoured lately to make this Oath and Covenant more sure for themselves and their posterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And intended a more publike, solemn and universall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, then since Popery this cause of theirs was ever maintained or supported by. And questionlesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> also must at last have been brought into this holy league with <hi>England.</hi> But blessed be the Lord, and blessed be his good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and the Parliament, that from the indignation of their spirits against so horrid a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53696:11"/>
yoke, have dashed out the very braines of this project; and are now this day present before the Lord to take and give possession of this blessed Ordinance, even an Oath and Covenant as solemn and of as large extent as they intended theirs; uniting these three Kingdoms into such a League and happy combination as will doubtlesse preserve us and our Reformation against them, though their iniquity in the mysteries of it should still be working amongst us. <hi>Come</hi> therefore (I speak in the words of the Prophet) <hi>let us joyne our selves to the Lord,</hi> and one to another, and each to all, <hi>in a perpetuall Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now entring upon a work of the greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concernment, to us and to our Posteritie after us, that ever was undertaken by any of us, or any of our fore-fathers before us, or neighbouring Nations about us; if the Lord shall blesse this our beginning, it will be a happie day, and we shall be a happy people. An Oath is a duty of the first Commandment, and therefore of the highest and noblest order and rank of duties; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must come forth attended with choycest graces; especially with these two, humility, and feare.</p>
               <p>Feare, not onely of God, which ought to be in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent measure, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 53. <hi>Iacob</hi> sware by the feare of his father <hi>Isaac,</hi> as if he covered to inherit his fathers grace, as well as his fathers God: But also feare of an Oath, it being a dreadfull duty, and hath this peculiar, its established by the Oath of God, I have sworne that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me every tongue shall sweare, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23. Its made the very Character of a Saint, he feares an Oath, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
               <p>Humility is another grace requisite, set your hearts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53696:12"/>
before God in an humble obedient frame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serve him, and sweare by his Name.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was sensible of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, even in the very act of this duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>I call God to witnesse, whom I serve in my spirit;</hi> Although it be a work of the lips, yet the heart and whole man must be interessed if we expect this worship to be acceptable, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 108. <hi>Accept the free-will offering of my mouth, and teach me thy judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also it must be done in the greatest simplicity and plainness of spirit, in respect of those with whom we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; We call God as a witnesse betwixt us who search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart: <hi>With him is wisedome and strength, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and deceiver is his, Iob,</hi> 12. 19. He hath wisedome to discover, and strength to punish, if our hearts be not upright to our brethren in this matter. Let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this, that the words of our Covenant bee hands; it may not be so much as in the desire of our hearts, that they should become snares, no not to the weakest and simplest person that joyneth with us. In the whole worke make your addresse unto God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his father <hi>Isaac,</hi> and let there bee the like feare and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie over your spirits, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 12. <hi>My father perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will feel me, and I shall seeme to him as a deceiver, and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I take liberty with more earnestnesse to presse this care upon you, because I have observed Oathes and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants have been undertaken by us formerly, and by the command of Authority, the fruit wherof, though great, yet not answered our expectation, the Lord surely hath beene displeased with the slightnesse of our hearts in the worke. I beseech you be more watchfull, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53696:12"/>
stirre up your hearts with more industry this day then ever before: As it is the last oath you are likely to take in this kinde, so is it our last refuge, <hi>tabula post nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And having sworn, and entred into this solemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to God and man, make conscience to doe accordingly, otherwise it is better thou shouldest not vow, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. As is said of fasting, it is not the bowing down of the head for a day, so of this solemn swearing, it is not the lifting up of the hand for a day; but an honest and faithfull endeavouring after the contents of this Covenant all our dayes; A truce-breaker is reckoned up amongst the vilest of Christians, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. so a Covenant-breaker is listed amongst the worst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. But he that sweareth and changeth not, though he sweare to his hurt, that is, he that will keep his Covenant and Oath though the contents of it prove not for him, nay possibly against him, yet he will keep it for his Oaths sake; such a one <hi>shall have his habitation with the most High and dwell in his Tabernacle, Psal.</hi> 15. And as for you Reverend Brethren, that are Ministers of the Gospel, there is yet another obligation will lie upon you; let us look to our selves, and make provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to walk answerable to this our Covenant for the Gospels sake; it will reflect a great aspersion upon the truth of the Gospel, if we should be false or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in any word or purpose, though in a matter of lesse consequence, as you can easily collect from that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53696:13"/>
apology of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18. how much more in such a case as this is, if we should be found to purpose, nay more, to vow, and covenant, and sweare, and all this <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the flesh,</hi> and <hi>with us there should be,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all these obligations, <hi>yea yea,</hi> and <hi>nay nay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may all who take the Covenant this day, be constant, immoveable, and abound in this work of the Lord, that we may not start aside, or give back, or goe on uncomfortably, there is a twofold grace or qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be laboured after.</p>
               <p>1. We must get courage, spirits that are bold and resolute. It is said in <hi>Haggai,</hi> that <hi>the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel Governour of Iudah, and the spirit of Ioshua the high Priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came, and did work in the house of the Lord,</hi> the work of Gods house: Reformation-work especially, is a stirring work: read Stories, you find not any where, Reformation made in any age, either in Doctrine or Discipline, without great stirre and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. This was foretold by the same Prophet, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. the promise is, <hi>He will fill his house with glory;</hi> but what goeth before? <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</hi> that is, <hi>all Nations,</hi> as in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This place is applied <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. to the removing Jewish Rites, the moveables of Gods house. The like you finde in the Apostles times, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. the truth being preached; some beleeved, others did not; here beginneth the stirre, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. those that beleeved not, <hi>took unto themselves certaine lewd fellowes of the baser sort, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a company, and set all the City in an uproare:</hi> and when they had done so, complained of the brethren to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53696:13"/>
the Rulers, as men <hi>that turne the world upside downe, ver. 6.</hi> Read also <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 27, 30, 31. In such a work therefore men had need be of stout, resolute, and composed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we may be able to goe on in the maine, and stirre in the middest of such stirres, and not be amused at any such doings. It may possibly happen, that even amongst your selves there will be out-cries; Sir, you will undoe all, saith one; you will put all into confusion saith another; if you take this course, saith a third, we can expect nothing but blood: but a wise States-man, like an experienced Sea-man, knoweth the compasse of his vessell, and though it heave and rosse, and the passengers cry out about him, yet in the middest of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, turneth not aside from his work, but steereth on his course. I beseech you let it be seriously considered, if you meane to doe any such work in the house of God as this is; if you meane to pluck up what many yeares agoe was planted, or to build up what so long agoe was pulled downe, and to goe thorough with this work, and not be discouraged, you must begge of the Lord this excellent spirit, this resolute stirring spirit, otherwise you will be out-spirited, and both you and your cause slighted and dishonoured.</p>
               <p>2. On the other hand we must labour for humility, prudence, gentlenesse, meeknesse. A man may be very zealous and resolute, and yet very meek and mercifull: Jesus Christ was a Lion, and yet a Lambe also; in one place he telleth them he commeth to send <hi>fire on the earth:</hi> and in another place rebuketh his Disciples for their fiery spirits, <hi>Luke</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 54. There was the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in <hi>Moses,</hi> and in <hi>Paul,</hi> and it is of great use, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this work of Reformation. I have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53696:14"/>
any disputes carried on with more bitternesse in mens writings, and with a more unsanctified heat of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yea and by godly men too, then in controversies about Discipline, Church Government, Ceremonies, and the like. Surely to argue about Government with such ungoverned passions, to argue for Reformation with a spirit so unreformed, is very uncomely. Let us be zealous, as Christ was, to cast our all, to extirpate and root out every plant his heavenly Father hath not planted; and yet let us doe it in as orderly way, and with the spirit of Christ, whose servants we are. <hi>The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient, in meeknesse instructing those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. We solemnly engage this day our utmost endeavours for Reformation; let us remember this, that too much heat, as well as too much coldnesse, may harden men in their wayes, and hinder Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>Brethren, let us come to this blessed work, with such a frame of heart, with such a minde for the present, with such resolutions for the time to come; let us not bee wanting to the opportunitie God hath put into our hands this day; and then I can promise you, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Consider this day and upwards, even from this day, that the foundation of the Lords work is laid, Consider it, from this day will I blesse you, saith the Lord:</hi> Nay, wee have received as it were the first fruits of this promise, for as it's said of <hi>some mens good works, they are manifest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. Even so may be said of the good work of this day, it's manifest before hand, God hath as it were before hand testified his acceptance; while wee were thinking and purposing this free will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53696:14"/>
Offering; he was protecting and defending our Armie; causing our enemies the enemies of this work to flie before us, and gave us a victory, not to be despised. Surely this Oath and Covenant shall bee <hi>Iudahs</hi> joy, the joy and comfort of this whole Kingdome; yea, of all three Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ King of the Saints govern us by his Spirit, strengthen us by his power, undertake for us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hee hath sworn, even <hi>the Oath which hee sware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that hee would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him without feare in holinesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before him all the dayes of our life, Luke</hi> 1. Grant unto us also, that when this life is finished, and we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to our Fathers, there may be a generation out of our loynes to stand up in this cause, that his great and reverent Name may be exalted from one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to another, untill he himself shall come, and perfect all with his own hand by his own wisdom; even so come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, come quickly,</p>

            <head>A SPEECH Delivered by Mr <hi>Alexander Hendersam,</hi> immediately before the taking of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by the House of COMMONS, and Assembly of DIVINES.</head>
            <p>ALthough the time be farre spent, yet am I bold (Honourable, Reverend, and Beloved in the Lord) to crave your patience a little; It were both sinne and shame to us in this so acceptable a time, in this day, which the Lord hath made, to be silent and to say nothing: If we should hold our peace, wee could neither be answerable to God, whose cause and work is in hand; nor to this Church and Kingdome, unto which we have made so large profession of duty, and owe much more; nor to our native Kingdom, so abundant in affection toward you; nor to our own hearts, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rejoyce to see this day: We have greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then the leprous men sitting in a time of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity at the gate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to say one to another, We doe not well, this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace? It is true the <hi>Syrians</hi> are not yet fled; but our hope is through God, that the work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun this day, being sincerely performed and faithfully
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53696:15"/>
pursued; shall put to flight, not only the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> but all other Enemies of the Church of God; of the Kings honour, and of our liberty and peace.</p>
            <p>For it is acceptable to God and wel-pleasing in his sight, when his people come willingly in the day of his power (and how shall they not be willing in the day of his power?) to enter a religious Covenant, with him, and amongst themselves. Whatsoever be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people of God, whether in sorrow and humiliation before deliverance; or in rejoycing and thanksgiving after deliverance; this is it, which the Lord waits for at their hands, which they have been used to performe, and with which he hath been so well pleased, that it hath been the fountaine of many deliverances and blessings unto them. When a people beginneth to forget God, hee lifteth up his hand against them and siniteth them: And when his people, humbled before him, lift up their hands, not only in supplication, but in Covenant before the most high God; he is pleased (such is his mercy and wonderfull compassion) First, to lift his hand unto them, saying, <hi>I am the Lord your God;</hi> as we have it three times in two verses of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> And next he stretcheth out his hand against his Enemies and theirs. It is the best work of Faith, to joyn in Covenant with God; the best work of love and Christian Communion, to joyn in Covenant with the people of God; the best work of the best zeale, to joyne in Covenant for Reformation, against the Enemies of God and Religion; the best work of true loyalty, to joyn in Covenant for the preservation of our King and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; and the best proofe of naturall affection (and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53696:16"/>
to bee without naturall affection, is one of the great sinnes of the Gentiles) to joyn in Covenant for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Native Countrey, Liberties, and Lawes; Such as for these necessary ends doe withdraw and are not willing to enter into Covenant, have reason to enter into their own hearts, and to look into their faith, love, zeale, loyalty, and naturall affection.</p>
            <p>As it is acceptable to God, so have we for it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and example, not onely of the people of God of old, of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Low-Countreys; but of our own Noble and Christian Progenitors in the time of the danger of Religion, which is expressed in the Covenant it selfe. The defect was; They went not on throughly to enter in a Solemn Covenant; an happinesse reserved for this time: which had they done, the corruptions and calamities of these dayes might have been prevented: And if the Lord shall be pleased to move, loose, and enlarge the hearts of his people in his Majesties Dominions to take this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not in simulation, nor in luke-warmnesse, as those that are almost perswaded to be Christians, but as becommeth the people of God, it shall be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of many evils and miseries, and a meane of many and rich blessings, spirituall and temporall, to our selves, our litle ones, and the Posterity that shall come after us for many Generations.</p>
            <p>The neere and neighbouring example of the Church and Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is in this case worthy of our best observation: When the Prelats there, were grown by their rents, and Lordly Dignities, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant power over all sorts of his Majesties Subjects, Ministers and others, by their places in Parliament,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53696:16"/>
Councell, Colledge of Justice, Exchequer, and High Commission, to a monstrous dominion and greatnesse, and like Gyants, setting their one foot on the neck of the Church, and the other on the neck of the State, were become intolerably insolent; and when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God through their oppression in Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Lawes, and what was dearest unto them, were brought so low, that they chused rather to die, then to live in such slavery, or to live in any other place, rather then in their own native Countrey; Then did the Lord say, <hi>I have seene, I have seene the affliction of my people, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.</hi> The beginnings were small, and contemptible in the eyes of the presumptuous Enemies, such as use to be the beginnings of the greatest works of God; but were so seconded and continually followed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable evidences of Divine Providence, leading them forward from one step to another, that their Mountaine became strong in the end. No tongue can tell what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions filled the hearts, what teares were poured forth from the eyes, and what cryes came from the mouthes of many thousands in that Land, when they found an unwonted flame warming their breasts, and perceived the power of God raising them from the dead, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them a new world, wherein should dwell Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Righteousnesse. When they were destitute both of moneys and munition, which next unto the spirits and armes of men, are the sinewes of Warre, the Lord brought them forth out of his hid treasures; which was wonderfull in their eyes, and matter of astonishment to their hearts: When they were many times at a pause in their deliberations, and brought to such perplexity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53696:17"/>
that they knew not what to chuse or to do, for prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the work of God, only their eyes were toward him; not only the feares and furies, but the plots also and policies of the Adversaries, opened the way unto them, their devices were turned upon their own heads, and served for the promoting of the work of God. The puritie of their intentions elevated above base and earthly respects, and the constant peace of their hearts in the midst of many dangers, did beare them out against the malitious accusations and aspersions put upon their actions; all which were sensible impressions of the good providence of God, and legible characters of his work: which as the Church and Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at this time with greater difficulties then theirs, have in part already found, so shall the Parallel be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to their greater comfort in the faithfull pursuing of the work unto the end.</p>
            <p>Necessitie, which hath in it a kinde of Soveraignty, and is a Law above all Lawes, and therefore is said to have no Law; doth mightily presse the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tland</hi> at this time. It is no small comfort unto them that they have not been idle and at ease, but have used all good and lawfull meanes of Supplications, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Remonstrances to his Majestie, for quenching the combustion in this Kingdome: And after all these, that they sent Commissioners to his Majestie, humbly to mediate for a reconcilement and Pacification; But the offer of their humble service was rejected, from no other reason, but that they had no warrant nor capacity for such a Mediation; And that the intermixture of the Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Civill government of the Kingdom, was such a mystery as could
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53696:17"/>
not be understood by them. Although it be true, which was at that time often replyed, that the eighth demand of the Treatie, and the answer given thereunto concerning the Uniformity of Religion, was a sufficient ground of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie; and the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament against Episcopall Government, as a stumbling block hindering Reformation, and as a prejudice to the Civill State, was ground enough for their information. The Commissioners having returned from his Majesty without successe, and the miseries of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the distresses of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the dangers and pressures of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> growing to greater extremity; such as were intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with the publike affaires of the Kingdom were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate according to the practise of former times (his Majestie having denied a Parliament) to call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Estates for considering of the present affaires, and for providing the best remedies: which immediately upon their meeting by the speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, did receive information of divers trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous attempts of Papists in all the three Kingdoms, as if they had been called for that effect: And by the same Providence, Commissioners were sent from both Houses of Parliament to consider with the Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of such Articles and Propositions as might make the conjunction betwixt the two Nations more beneficiall and effectuall for the securing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; Liberty against Papists &amp; Prelats with their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. Their Consultations with the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly, did in the end bring forth this Covenant, as the only meane after all other have beene assayed, for the deliverance of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> out of the deeps of affliction, preservation of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53696:18"/>
Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the extremity of misery, and the safety of our native King and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from destruction and desolation. This is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold necessity which Nature, Religion, Loyalty, and Love hath laid upon them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unknown in this Honourable, Reverend, and wise Audience, what errors, and heresies in doctrine; what Superstition and Idolatry in Worship, what Usurpation and Tyranny in Government, what cruelty against the soules and bodies of the Saints have been set on foot, exercised, and executed for many Generations, and now of late, by the Roman Church; all which wee hope through the blessing of God upon this work, shall be brought to an end. Had the Pope at <hi>Rome</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is doing this day in <hi>England,</hi> and were this Covenant written on the Plaster of the Wall over against him, where he sitteth <hi>Belshazzar</hi>-like in his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious pomp, it would make his heart to tremble, his countenance to change, his head and Miter to shake, his joynts to loose, and all his Cardinals and Prelates to be astonied.</p>
            <p>When the Reformed Churches, which by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been exciting us to Christian Communion and Sympathy in this time of the danger of Religion and distresse of the Godly, shall heare of this blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction for uniformity in Religion according to the Word of God and the defence thereof; it shall quicken their hearts against the heavinesse of oppressing sorrows and feares; and bee no other than a beginning of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee and joyfull deliverance unto them, from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian yoke and tyranny.</p>
            <p>Vpon these and the like considerations wee are very

confident, that the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> will most cheerefully joyne in this Covenant, at the first motion whereof, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In your own sense and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience you will finde, that although, while you are assaulted or exercised with worldly cares and fears, your thoughts may somwhat trouble &amp; direct you; yet at other times, when upon seeking of God in private or publike, as in the evening of a well spent Sabbath, or day of Fast and Humiliation, your disposition is more spirituall, and leaving the world behinde you, you have found accesse unto God through Jesus Christ, the bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of your hearts will be strongest to go through with this work. It is a good testimony that our designes and wayes are agreeable to the will of God, if we affect them most when our hearts are furthest from the world, and our temper is most spirituall and heavenly, and least carnall and earthly. As the Word of God, so the prayers of the people of God in all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches are for us, and on our side: It were more terrible then an Armie to heare that there were any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent supplications to God against us; blasphemies, curses,

and horrid imprecations there be, proceeding from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirit, and that is all. That Divine Providence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so which hath maintained this Cause and supported his Servants in a marvellous manner unto this day, and which this time past hath kept things in an equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and vicissitude of successe, will we trust from this day forth, through the weight of this Covenant, cast the ballance, and make Religion and Righteousnesse to prevaile, to the glory of God, the honour of our King, the confusion of our common Enemies, and the comfort and safety of the people of God: Which he grant, who is able to doe above anything that we can ask or think.</p>
