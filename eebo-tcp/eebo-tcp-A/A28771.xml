            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REMARKS</hi> Upon the Two Years Raign of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> when King of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of King <hi>John.</hi> Submitted to the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament.</head>
            <p>OF all the Attempts made ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt for the Subverſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, that of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in King <hi>John</hi>'s time, was the moſt dangerous, and was render'd the more pernicious, by reaſon the <hi>Dauphin</hi> enter'd the Kingdom by Conſent of the People, and that he was receiv'd as a Deliverer, and not as an Enemy; but he ſoon under the Umbrage of the former, acted the latter, as by the ſequel will appear.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chronicles tell us, that upon the Diſcontent betwixt King <hi>John</hi> and the Barons, the latter invited the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to reſcue them from the Preſſure of King <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Londoners</hi> in conjunction with the Barons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd the <hi>Dauphin</hi> King of <hi>Englannd</hi>; At his firſt coming, he publiſh'd 3 Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in each whereof he did ſet forth the Male Adminiſtration of King <hi>John,</hi> and render'd him as Odious and Obnoxious to the People, as the hopes of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Malice, and Invention could make him. And withal, that he himſelf would govern <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> by their own Laws and Cuſtoms, redreſs their Grievances, and by ſuch ſly Inſinuations, the <hi>Dauphin</hi> wean'd the People from their Allegiance, and ſupplanted King <hi>John</hi>; but as ſoon as he got footing, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forts and Caſtles into his hands; an Army of Foreigners about him, and the Power of <hi>France</hi> to back and ſecond him, he ſoon forgot his Declarations, and of all his Promiſes, never fulfill'd one Tittle, but on the contrary deſpis'd and rejected the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (excepting ſome corrupt Perſons, upon whom he prevail'd for Gratuity's and Bribes, to betray their Country, and to enſlave all the reſt of our Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) the beſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus Haraſs'd, and remov'd from all Places of Truſt and Profit, and the reſt preferr'd; the new King (not doubting to make himſelf the abſolute Maſter of all) tacitely call'd into his Aſſiſtance all the Mercenary Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners he could prevail withal, whereby he thought not to leave the Name nor the Memory of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe days were a moſt War-like, Victorious People, and very reſolute in the defence of their own Rights and Property's, which they thought very improper for a Prince of their own Invitation and Election to Invade; and for a Prince that could pretend to no colour of Right or Title of his own, but what he receiv'd from the People; and that had it not been for the Courteſy of the ſame People, moſt certain it is, that no ſuch foreign Prince could have any ſuch Power over them; And to loſe their Rights by the boundleſs Ambition of a King of their own making, they unanimouſly reſolv'd in their own Defence, to loſe their Lives firſt, they being all well convinc'd, that ſuch a King was made for the Good of the Kingdom, and not the Kingdom made for the Ravage of ſuch a King.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus juſtly angred and irritated againſt the Lawleſs Deſigns of their New King, they watch'd his Motions, and obſerving him to prefer Tyranny to Mercy, and that in Oppreſſions, Expences, Ambition, and Male-Adminiſtration, he had far ſurpaſs'd King <hi>John</hi>; and ſeeing their All expos'd to the Mercileſs Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of his Foreign Needimites, here the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found their own Miſtakes, and concluded their flying from the Preſſures of King <hi>John,</hi> for Refuge and Protection to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> was but leaping out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not aſleep, they had their Eyes open, and were very ſenſible of their diſmal Conditions, and of the Miſery's and Afflictions, which the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> (in order to make himſelf abſolute over them) thought to Entail upon this Realm; and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was as ſenſible of the People's Hatred: Thence flew
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103695:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the contrary Deſires of Revenge and Security in each other, which could not be reconciled but by Mutual Injuries; here the <hi>Dauphin</hi> ſoon found himſelf in as great Diſtreſs, as if he had been born under the Star of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who, when he had Cut off one <hi>Hidra</hi>'s Head, had his Labours continued by the ſuddain Production of many. The <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the faſter he cut off the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the faſter they grew upon his Hands, and the more Potent Enemies he made himſelf; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had at laſt neceſſitated the whole Kingdom, to declare againſt him: Yet he did not ceaſe, but repeated his Crimes, inſomuch, that he with his Cabinet Councel and Secretaries, fill'd the Nation with feigned Conſpiracies, and Helliſh Inventions againſt himſelf, whereby to carry on his Wicked Deſigns, and Murder, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the beſt Families in <hi>England</hi>; in order to which, he caus'd Spyes to be placed in every Family, whereby he broke Publick Unions, and diſſolv'd Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; he Bribed Wives with their own Diſhonours for to betray their Husbands; and Encourag'd Children with too early hopes of Patrimony, to Rifle their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Cabinets; and Servants beyond Manumiſſion, to reveal more than their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Secrets: He puniſh'd Suſpicion for manifeſt Crimes, and Circumvented the Innocency of ſome to recover his own Guilt: For all thoſe whom he injur'd, he fear'd, and all he hated and fear'd, he Injur'd; he cauſed his Emiſſaries at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Feaſts, to gather up the looſe Speeches of Men, made free by Exceſs of Wine and other Liquors, and the Innocent Form of Table-talk, to be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Compacts of Treaſon, until he had made every Man's Houſe his Grave or his Priſon.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Dauphin</hi> finding all his Meaſures upon falſe Bottoms, and that his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Favourites, by their Perverſe Counſels contributed to his Ruin, and could render him no more Service; all their Tricks and Siniſter Dealings being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſcover'd, which expoſed them to the Univerſal hatred of the better part of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or to thoſe whoſe Integrity to the General Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> oblig'd them to ſignify their Abhorrence againſt all the Foreign and Domeſtick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, carry'd on, and hiddenly manag'd by Foreigners and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, for the Subverſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties; Here the <hi>Dauphin</hi> thinking to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf with the People after ſo many Injuries, expos'd all his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites to the Hatred of all their Fellow-Subjects, throwing the Odium of their own pernicious Councels upon their own Heads, and caus'd them to be us'd and treated, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Edi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, us'd their Beaſts and Malefactors in their Theatres, when they would recreate their People in their <hi>Spectacula,</hi> made them accuſe and deſtroy one another; leſt what they had done for him, they may practiſe againſt him, for that Inſtruments of great Crimes do by their very Sight, mightily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him that employ'd them, which was the Caſe of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and of his corrupted Favourites.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> finding by Experience, that Ambulatory Governments are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive and Deſtructive, and like Planets, which at their riſing and ſetting bring Storms and Tempeſts to uſher them in and out; and ſo in Caſes of Travelling Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, they are always attended with War, Taxes and Rapines. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ruin of the Old and Execution of the New, the Unhappy People under ſuch Governments, have their Treaſure conſum'd, their Strength decay'd, and their Eſtates and Fortunes ruin'd, by being of contrary Party's one againſt another; when as their Amity and Union, would heal their Wounds, redreſs their Grievances, and make them Maſters of their own Rights and Liberties, whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe days were fully convinc'd, and united in one Common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt againſt the common Enemy that pretended to be their Deliverer; Here the <hi>Engliſh</hi> proclaim'd that the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and all his Foreign <hi>Gabells</hi> ſhould depart the Kingdom by a Day; adjuſted all Accounts with him, and paid him what Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Charges he could juſtly demand. And thus the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Raign, and the Fortune of his Favourites ended in Confuſion.</p>
