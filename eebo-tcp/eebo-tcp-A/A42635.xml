            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Building is much
minded in these times,
I thought fit to publish
some Principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may stand the lovers of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97440:8"/>
it instead. Yet without spending
time and Paper to Note how a
Point, Line, Angle, Demi-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
Cube, Plint, Baze, Pedestal,
Colombe, Head, Architrave,
Frize, Cornice, or Frontispiece must
be made; and what Dimensions
all those several parts (a Point
excepted) must have, since all
Master-Workmen ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
(as Schollars their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and Arithmaticians their
Table) how every Particle must
have its just proportion; and that
the height of Windowes and
Doores must be double their
breadth; and also to be carefull
to maintain the due esteem of
their Art, since its Dimensions
and Rules came directly from
Heaven, when the great Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and Surveyor of Heaven
and Earth, prescribed the Rules
and particular Orders for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97440:8"/>
Building of a floating-Pallace,
<hi>(Noahs</hi> Ark) and the glorious
matchlesse Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
the perfect House of Prayer.</p>
            <p>And therefore such Precedents
may serve to convince those who
say, That a wise-man never ought
to put his finger into Morter,
since there is a necessity for
Building, especially among Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
who do not, or cannot live
in Caves and hollow Trees, or
as the Wilde <hi>Indians,</hi> who have
no other Roofs but of Palmito-Leaves,
nor Wainscot, but Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouses,
as they call the Poles to
which they tye a Woollen Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac
to lye in.</p>
            <p>There are three Capital Points
to be observed by men, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Build well: VIZ,
<list>
                  <item>Solidity.</item>
                  <item>Conveniency.</item>
                  <item>Ornament.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97440:9"/>
Those who have Marshald the
Orders of Colombs (to make good
the first Point) have Ranged the
Toscan to be the Supporter of a
Building, but such an Atlas must
stand on a firm Ground, not as ill
Builders place Colombs (either
of Brick or Stone) like things
Patcht or glewed against a Wall,
and for the most part against the
second Story of a Building, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the very <hi>Gothish</hi> Custome,
who at least did begin their But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trises
from the Ground) as if their
intent were, that the weight of the
Colombs should draw down the
Wall, on the heads of those that
passe by.</p>
            <p>Such Builders confound the first
and essential point of Building, (to
wit, <hi>Solidity,</hi> with <hi>Ornament</hi> and
<hi>Conveniency)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will make a shew of some
thing, but misse thereby (as ill
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97440:9"/>
Bow-men) the Mark: They may
perchance have heard of rare Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
nay, seen the Books of
the <hi>Italian</hi> Architects, have the
Traditions of <hi>Vignola</hi> in their
Pockets, and have heard Lectures
on the Art of Architecture, which
have laid before them the most
necessary Rules, as also the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
of the several Orders of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombs,
and Discourses made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that the <hi>Toscan</hi> is as the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
so of the <hi>Jonic</hi> and <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian;</hi>
the first of the two to
Resemble the Dressing of the
Daughters of <hi>Jonio,</hi> who had
Twists of Hair on both sides of
their Cheeks. The <hi>Corinthian</hi>
Heads to represent a Basket with
Acante Leaves, and the Guttered
Colombs, the Pleats of Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Womens Cloaths.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Grecians</hi> (in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of their Victories) did
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97440:10"/>
Range the Colombs in their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
to represent the number of
Slaves which they had taken; the
Grains, Beads, Drops, Pendants,
Garlands, Enterlaced-Knots, Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and an infinite number of
Ornaments, which are put on the
Frize, to signifie the Spoiles which
the Victors had brought away
from their Enemies; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Memory thereof, did
place them on their Buildings, that
they might also serve for a true
History.</p>
            <p>But none of such Ornaments
were ever impediments to the
strength or convenience of a Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
for they were so handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and well contrived, as once the
Dutchesse of <hi>Cheiveruse</hi> (a French
Lady) said of the English Females,
that they had a singular grace to
set their Ornaments right and
handsomly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97440:10"/>
The <hi>Barbarians</hi> and naked <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyers,
Caripowis, Alibis,</hi> (and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Charibdiens)</hi> do place Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
in their Nostrils, which are
proper for the Eares; and these
hinder not the use of the Lips,
which ought to be observed by all
Builders.</p>
            <p>And as for the inside of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks,
Builders should in the first
place set the Doores, Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and Windows, as may be
most convenient for use.</p>
            <p>Builders ought to be not onely
experimented in House-keeping,
but also good Naturalists, to know
(before they spend time and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials)
the required Property to
every part of a Building. A Doore
to be so set as it may not convey
the Wind toward the Chimney or
Bedstead, though opened never so
little.</p>
            <p>The Windows to be so placed,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97440:11"/>
as that the Fire made in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
may not attract the Aire and
Moysture, and so prove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesomest
part of the Room for
those that are near the Fire;
Which was the main reason why

and <hi>Haynault,</hi> during her many

prepossessed with a prejudice,
never approached a Fire to

made by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> Queen
Mother to <hi>Lewis</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, just as she
returned to her Pallace) had no
time to Shift her, she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to approach the Fire to
dry her self, and few dayes after she
fell sick and dyed upon it: which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97440:11"/>
Relation being very true, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
in the time that I resided
for the King of blessed memory in
that Court, I thought fit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to perswade all Noble (and
curious Builders, to place their
Doors, Windows, and Chimnies
in their proper places.</p>
            <p>And though it be not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in this small Discourse to
Treate of Dimensions (which are
fit for a Primar to Apprentices,)
Yet I cannot desist (by reason of the
West-<hi>Indian</hi> Herican-like-windes
which happened <hi>February</hi> last, to
perswade all Builders to forbear
the Buildlng any more those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Chimney-Shafts, which
when they fall, break both Roofs
and Sealings of Roomes, and kill
good People in their Beds: since
a Chimney some two Foote high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the Ridges of the Roof
of a Building, (which is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertopt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97440:12"/>
by a Church or Steeple,
or some other eminency,) is as
good a conveyance for the smoak,
as any of a greater height. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are those high Shafts of
Chimnies real Ornaments to a
Building, much lesse to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of a Soveraign: nor do the
<hi>Germane</hi> Travellers of this Age
any more fill (as formerly) their
Table-Books with the number of
them, as they were very carefull
to note the Names of their Hoatts,
where the best Wine was, and
when they tasted that called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grima-Christi,</hi>
they moaned and
askt why he did not weep in their
Countrey. Its true, that the least
addicted to Bibbing, did put in their
Stam-books the Dimentions of
the <hi>Phanteon</hi> and of the <hi>Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters;</hi>
as also of <hi>Caprazola fiescati,</hi>
and such Magnificent Structures
above Ground in <hi>Italy,</hi> and under
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97440:12"/>
Ground <hi>La Pessina Admirabile,
La Grota de la Sibila Cumana, Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
de Cicerone, cente Camere, é
le Sepulture de le nobili Antichi.</hi>
But they are now taught by <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
to observe the Inside of Men,
and Buildings. And as the best
Ornaments of a Face appears at
first sight by the Eyes, Mouth,
and Nose; so doth the best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of a perfect Building, by
Windowes, and Doores well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as also by a large, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
commodious, and well-set
Staircase.</p>
            <p>Noble, manificent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Staircases, must in the
first place participate of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
manner of Pace and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>There is no man of sound Limbs
(and that hath a gallant Gate) but
lifts his Toes at least four Inches,
when he goeth an ordinary easie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97440:13"/>
Pace; so that if two steps (each
four Inches high) be eighteen
Inches broad, or deep, which
makes six and thirty Inches the
two (the just measure of a mans
two steps,) they may be ascended
from the first Floor, to the higher
Story, as if a man walked on a level
ground.</p>
            <p>2. Those Staires ought to be so
long, that the Attendants on each
side the Noble Person, Prince or
Soveraign, may not be streightned
for roome.</p>
            <p>Such were the Monarchlike
Staires of the Pallace of <hi>Darius</hi>
and <hi>Cyras</hi> the Great, at <hi>Chelminor</hi>
in <hi>Persia</hi> near <hi>Saras,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
between <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Espa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi>
I do speak indeed of a Pallace
without comparison to any other,
the Walls of Circumvallation of
that Pallace, being four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
foote thick, and the Staires (as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97440:13"/>
yet in esse) are fourty foot long,
in number an hundred and eight,
of Circular Form, and of so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
an Accesse, as that Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
do ascend them on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could not have been so much
in danger of an Onset in a Paire
of Staires, large enough for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Retinue to his Person, as he was
in a narrow Pair, which History
mentions.</p>
            <p>Neither had <hi>William</hi> Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> been so easily Shot at <hi>Delff</hi>
in <hi>Holland,</hi> descending a narrow
Pair of Stairs.</p>
            <p>3. A Noble Paire of Staires
should have a Cupelo, and no
Windowes on the sides, which
for the most part serve but for
Rude and Unadvised Men to
break.</p>
            <p>In some Pallaces and Noble-Mens
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97440:14"/>
Houses, <hi>Too many Staires
and back-Doores</hi> (as the old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Proverb) <hi>makes Thieves and
Whores.</hi> And the setting the Front
of a Building towards the North-West,
and a Pallace, like Cardinal
<hi>Wolseyes</hi> ill-placed one (now called
<hi>Whitehall)</hi> on a low ground by
the River side) makes work for
Physitians, Apothecaries, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
Coffin and Grave-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
            <p>But as for a Seate on MoorishGrounds
(except the Builders
observe the practice of those of
<hi>Venice</hi> (in <hi>Italy)</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
(in <hi>Holland)</hi> who bestow more
Timber of Oake in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one, than in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of six Houses, in effect 'tis to
Build perpetually, leaving to their
Posterity to prop and redresse their
ill grounded Buildings; and they
may well be rankt with the Duke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97440:14"/>
of <hi>Arscot,</hi> who built much in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
and (in a merry humour)
designed in his Will ten Thousand
Gilders <hi>per annum,</hi> to support
and alter what he had Built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.</p>
            <p>I must also advise Builders on
high Grounds, to cause their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors
to search for Springs, and
shun them; which serve better to
fill up Glasses to allay the Vapours
of <hi>Gascony</hi> Wines, than to make a
Pond in a Sellar.</p>
            <p>Builders ought also to be very
curious and carefull in the choice
of the place to Build a Seat on, for
good Prospect, well Garnisht with
Woods, and the Water at hand,
not too near, nor too far from a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> I must wish all Princes and
Noble Persons who are resolved
to Build Pallaces and Seats answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their quality, to imitate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97440:15"/>
those who in the Heathen age were
so carefull in the ordering of the
Structure of their Stone Images,
especially of their <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,
Apollo, Mars, Neptune,</hi> (and all their
Fry of wanton Godesses) as to
empannel a Jury of Philosophers,
Naturalists, Physiognomists and
Anatomists, who were to direct
the Sculptors how to Represent
those Images. And so I would
wish Builders to proceed in the
contriving the Models of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Fabrick, to wit, to consult
(as those of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> did in the
making the Model of their Town-House,
divers experimented Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects,
though they pitcht for the
Front on the worst of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Before the Workmen,
make use of Materials, and not
to Build at Randome, as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of too many ill Builders is;
And when once the Model is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97440:15"/>
never to alter, nor to pull
down what hath been well begun,
nor to hearken to the diversity of
opinions, which have been, and
are the causes of many Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Extravagancies in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and especially those who
seem to have had for Models Bird-Cages,
to jump from one Roome
into the other by Steps and Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
to cause Men and Women to
stumble.</p>
            <p>And the sides all of Glass (like
Spectacles) the glass Windows
of small Payns, with great store
of Lead, to draw the more Wind
and Moisture from the open
Aire within Doores. As also
Windowes with store of Iron
Casements, which rust, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shut close, notwithstanding
all the various devices of Smiths,
to catch Money out of the
Builders Purses, contrary to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97440:16"/>
good custome in <hi>Italy, Spain,
France, Germany,</hi> and the Low-Countreys,
which certainly for
plurality of Voices should be
believed, and followed.</p>
            <p>Those Nations cause their
glass Windows to be fitted in
woodden Casements treble rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to keep out Wind and
Rain; they are lined with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Shutters, and have double
boarded Shutters without, to
resist all the violence of the
Weather and Theeves.</p>
            <p>Let no man mistake these
Windows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for wooden Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for such are usually seen
here in <hi>England</hi> in old wooden
Houses, the Casements scarce
above one Foot and a half high,
tottering things; for these are
substantially, strongly, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
made Casements; nor are
the wooden Shutters such Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-like
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97440:16"/>
things, as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
put on the outside of the
Windows on the <hi>London</hi> and
Suburbs Houses, but double-Deal
well-riveted Windowes,
with substantiall Locks, Bolts,
and Hinges, and a double Iron
Bar, with a Bolt fixt in the
middle of them both.</p>
            <p>Nor do good Builders affect
partitions of Lime and Hair
in their Houses, nor any of
their Bricks to be daubed over
with finishing Morter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> are very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the tempering their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the laying it as thin
as possibly they can, to prevent
the sinking and bending of their
Walls, which the laying of the
Morter too thick doth cause;
and experience sheweth, that
when some Walls are taken
down in <hi>England,</hi> half of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97440:17"/>
substance is Sand and Dust.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> (as likewise
the <hi>Grecians</hi> before them) did
not make use of their Lime at
the same time it was slakt, but
for six Moneths time suffered to
putrifie, and so putrified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a Seiment, which joyned
with Stone (or Brick) made
an inseparable union, and such
strong work as I have seen Iron-Tools
break on the old Morter
of the <hi>Amphitheaters</hi> at <hi>Verona</hi>
and <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their manner of preparing
Lime is to lay it in Cisternes
the one higher than the other,
that the Water (after it hath
been so stirred as that it is well
mixt and throughly liquid)
may drayn from one Cistern
to the other, and after six
Moneths time (the Lime having
evacuated its putrefaction) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97440:17"/>
purified, and then they
mix two parts of Lime with
one part of Sand, and makes
that strong and pure Morter,
which if practised in <hi>England</hi>
would make a wondrous strong
Union, especially if the Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
did beat the Clay as it
ought to be, the English Clay
being better than the Italian,
nay the best in the world.</p>
            <p>They are very carefull in the
making large and deep Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to let the Walls rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Foundations rest and
settle a good while before they
proceed to the second Story.</p>
            <p>Some of our Carpenters have
learned to lay Boards loose for
a time, the <hi>Italians</hi> and other
Nations are not sparing therein,
they nayl them as if for good
and all, but rip or take them
up again, to fit them for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97440:18"/>
As I said before, no Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is begun before a mature
Resolve on a compleat finisht
Modell of the entire design:
the Builder having made choice
of his Surveyor, and committed
to him all the care and guidance
of the work, never changeth on
the various opinions of other
men, for they are unlimited,
because every mans conceits are
answerable to their profession,
and particular occasion.</p>
            <p>A Soveraign or any other
Landlord, is then guided by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Principles, as well as by
his own Resolve, taken on a
long considered Modell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know (by experience)
how suddain changes are able
to cause monstrous effects.</p>
            <p>They know that a well-expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Surveyor must not be
disturbed in his task, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97440:18"/>
but as the Silk Worm
and the Soul of Man, the first
in his Husk, the second in the
Womb, wherein both the one
and the other (by the powers
of the great Architect and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of all things) works out
his own compleat Fabrick, if
not interrupted; but if inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by any outward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
it happens that those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
become the originall causes
of exorbitant Features and Forms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
An <hi>Item</hi> for all Builders to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a good Architect quietly to
pursue his task, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
it.</p>
            <p>It hath been observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the French (a Nation as
much addicted to changes is
any) that when the charge of
an undertaking hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to many, it caused but
confusion, and therefore its a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97440:19"/>
saying among them, <hi>Trop de Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sineirs
gattent le pottage,</hi> Too
many Cooks spoils the Broth.</p>
            <p>I shall not spend time, and
transgress on the Readers pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
concerning the making of
Clay, and burning of Bricks,
only say, that it imports much
the Clay should be well wrought,
before it be put in the Mould:
experience hath also taught Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
to have them of such a
length, thickness and wideness,
that four of them (together
with the Morter thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing)
may raise a Foot.</p>
            <p>As for Free-stone, <hi>Portland</hi>
Stone works well, and makes a
good union with Bricks, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be compared with Marble, nor
to the Blewish Stone of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Namur.</hi> But 'tis
also certain, that this Climat makes
Marble it self to Moulder very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97440:19"/>
much; as for example, the <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel</hi> in <hi>York</hi>-House Garden,
which did not Moulder when it
stood in that of the Duke of <hi>Larma</hi>
at <hi>Valedolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(together with the moistnesse
of this Clime) being of a contrary
operation to the temper of the
Aire in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Builders see their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
Water-table, Cornishes,
Railes, and Balisters to decay, they
must have patience, since there is
no Material but is subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and that Railes and Balisters
(either on the top of the Walls of
a Frontispiece, or in Belconies)
though never so well Painted in
Oyle, and of the best seasoned
Timber,) but must be renewed at
fourty or fifty years end.</p>
            <p>Builders ought to calculate the
Charges of their designed Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and especially with what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97440:20"/>
Summe of Money they are willing
to part, and yet remember to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
some Philosophical Humorist,
who resolves to venture on a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thing called a Handsome Lady,
without which their Fate seems to
tell them they cannot live, and
therefore makes an account before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
that all things will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
answer his expectation. But
on the contrary, the Lady instead
of being a good Houswife, (and
an assistant) proves expensive, and
an impediment. And if it prove
otherwise, he will be a great gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by the bargain; for let Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
put their design to Master-Workmen
by the Great, or have
it Wrought by the Day, either
the Workmen will over-reach
themselves, or the Builder will be
over-reached.</p>
            <p>Charity to the one, and respect
to the other, moves me to keep
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97440:20"/>
the rest in my Pen, yet shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be backward to inform either
of them in the ear what may be the
best for them to choose.</p>
            <p>But I must freely advise all Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in general, never to begin to
Build on a Ground before it be
Purchased, as the late Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> did at <hi>York</hi>-House,
where there hath been much daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and breaking through old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
decayed Walls; first to make
a Ladies Closet on the corner of a
Wall where a Butteryses stood,
and which was taken away for the
Closet, intended only at first for
a Closet of ease, and to serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> could
be perswaded to accept as good a
Seat as that was, in liew of the
same, which could not be so soon
compassed, as the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
had occasion to make use
of Rooms, to entertain (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97440:21"/>
to the Dignity of a prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of State) forreign Princes
and Embassadors; so as on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
all the Butterises that upheld
that rotten Wall were thrown
down, the Seelings of Roomes
supported with Iron-bolts, Belco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
clapt up in the old Wall, daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over with finishing Morter, and
all this (as a Toadestoole groweth
in a night) to serve untill a Model
for a Solid Building (to stand even
with the Street) were made, and
to be Built of such Stone as the
Portico or Water-Gate at the
River side is; and this was done
on a Moorish Ground, whereon no
New Building could stand any
time without Proppings, which
was contrary to the main Principle
of good Building.</p>
            <p>I must proceed and conclude
with my humble respects concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Palaces of Sovereigne Princes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97440:21"/>
which must differ as much from
other Buildings, as their quality
and condition from that of their
Subjects.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, as <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
must be the first Principle in
all good Building; so much more
ought it to be observed in that of
Sovereigns, unto whom the whole
world hath access.</p>
            <p>And as there must be spacious
Ground before their Palaces, their
Inner-Court ample, the Offices
for their Retinue large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
and so placed as they may
neither be an annoyance nor of ill
aspect.</p>
            <p>The first Stories ought rather
to be vaulted than boarded, to
prevent such an accident as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to <hi>Lewis</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> French King,
(and his Queen at a Ball,) when
the Floore of the Roome (with all
the Company) fell down; the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97440:22"/>
King and Queen only remaining
(by a special Providence) on the
Hearth of the Chimney, setting
under the Cloath of State.</p>
            <p>And as there is a necessary
Magnificence to be exprest on the
Front and inside of Princely Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
answerable to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
so is it absolutely necessary,
that the Architect be possest with
a Soul as great as the Player in the
French Play, called the <hi>Viriona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
where he perswades himself
to be <hi>Alexander,</hi> and governs his
Motions accordingly. And the
Lines and Strokes of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
must be <hi>Alexander</hi>-like: his
Figures and Statues <hi>Colosses,</hi> his
<hi>Pyramidis</hi> like those of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and the Vaults like that Rock
wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi>
wrastle for Mastery in a Valley in
<hi>Persia,</hi> between <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Espa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
at a place called <hi>Carimonsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97440:22"/>
where formerly was a great
City six English Miles long; in
which <hi>Groto,</hi> the <hi>Alexander</hi>-like
mind of the Sculptor, hath Hewn
within the Rock, (besides <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
on Horseback, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Huntsmen and Ladies) the
aforesaid <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi>
wrastling to break a Ring between
them.</p>
            <p>Such a like mind Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> (Sonne to the Great <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi>
of <hi>Savoy)</hi> infused into his
Architect, Sculptor, and Caster
in Brass, who he imployed in the
Designing and Building a Stable
in <hi>Turin,</hi> within all of Marble, the
Racks, Manger, and the upright
Posts all of Copper, Richly
Wrought, Conveyances of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pipes. The Manger fourteen
Inches wide at the bottom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Pale for Water on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
The uppermost edge of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97440:23"/>
Manger three foote eight Inches
high from the Ground, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> great Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Horse
to raise their Neck.
The Rack Poles three Inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
and upright, that as the
Frenchman saith, <hi>(Lapetit vienten
mangeant)</hi> the Horse may feed
more chearfully, the Hay and Dust
may not fall on their Heads, as it
doth out of a Rack which stands
shelving: the under part of the
Manger ought to be made up to
keep in their Litters, and no Boxes
made there for Dogs, as some not
curious do, where no Harnesses,
Saddles, Coverings of Horses, or
any other Implements or Tooles,
are not to be seen about the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,
since those things do but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
the Accesse of a Cavallier to
the Horses.</p>
            <p>The disposing a Stable into a
double Range, hath been affected
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97440:23"/>
by some, who would see all their
Horses at once.</p>
            <p>Others love only a single Range,
with a broad Walk, and if they
have a great number of Horses,
returne at the end into another
Range, if the Ground can afford
the same, so as a Wall makes the
Partition between the Horses.</p>
            <p>The Paving of such a Stable is
very neat, being of white or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
(twice burnt) <hi>Flanders</hi> Bricks,
in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Clinkart,</hi> farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Planking of Stables, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Reasons. The Paviors (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Bricks are laid) throw sharp
Sand over them, and twice a day
they are Watered with a Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Watering-Pot, and Swept
with a Broom, which the Grooms
are to continue sometimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sand gets between the
Joynts, and makes the Paving
very close and firm. The Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97440:24"/>
at the Foot of the Manger,
must be raised at the least six
Inches higher, than at the Gutter
where the Posts are placed, which
ought to be five Foot and an half
distant one from the other, which
Ground so Paved is of double use;
first, that the higher a House stands
towards the Manger, the better
sight it is, and especially when the
Lights of the Stable strikes on the
Horse their backs, which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That a Horse its usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
standing place being so much
shelving accustomes the Horse (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
more on his hinder Feet
than on the foremost) to be more
light and nimble in his Gate and
Pace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That his Stall doth not
remain under him, and especially
when its standing hath eight foot
in length from the Manger to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97440:24"/>
Channel, which for neatness ought
to be above Ground, the eight
Foote in length, being at full the
space which the Horse doth possess
when in the night time he lyeth
stretcht on his Litter.</p>
            <p>I must not omit by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to Write somewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kitchin of a Princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether there should
not be as much curiosity, if not
more in the Kitchin than in the
Stable; since the Meat prepared
in a Kitchin, ought to be Drest
with all Neatness, and preferred
before a fine Lace about the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Cooks Towel: Neither are
the Vessels of Silver but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Neatness which ought
to be observed in all Cookery.
The French-Mans Glasse is
wrenched as often as he Drinks,
and why should not Cooks be
more Curious and Neat in their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97440:25"/>
Kitchins, than Grooms in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
And as a Stable can have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
for the Horses Water, so
may Kitchins for Slabbering, for
Guts of Fowls and Deer, Coles,
Ashes, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatsoever else can
cause Dirt and Nastiness, and be
freed from the annoyance of Smoak,
which many ill-placed Doors cause;
nor ought the Kitchin or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Selleridge, (as in some
Palaces in <hi>France)</hi> to be so placed
as they may prove prejudiciall to
the Court, and if they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a Palace they ought to be
vaulted.</p>
            <p>I must not forget that the Roof
of a Palace should be covered either
with Lead or blew Slates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Brass, which a Pope mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to cast Canons, no such as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eat, drink and sing.</p>
            <p>No curious eye can well indure
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97440:25"/>
those Barn-like Roofs of many
Noble Persons Palaces, covered
with red Tiles, which break and rot
away, and then the Roof being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and patcht, seems to be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
Mantel, which I would not
have the Nobles and Courtiers to
be. See the Roofs of <hi>Lester, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
Southampton,</hi> and such like
their Palaces, whether they do not
look as Barns for Hay, and not Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,
by their patched Tiles?</p>
            <p>As for the main bulk of Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
its true some have a greatness
in plainness, as that of <hi>Farners</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> whereof <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>
made the <hi>Architrave, Frize</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for Bigness and Solidity,
that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> and <hi>Escuriall</hi> in
<hi>Spain;</hi> for Ornament, <hi>Munikch</hi> in
<hi>Bavaria;</hi> the <hi>Louver</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> for
Vastness, Situation and Ornament,
by the imbossed Imagery on the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97440:26"/>
Frontispiece, variety of Orders of
Colombs, with the delight of the
annexed Tuilleries, wherein as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in that of the Palace of the
Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> but above all in
the Cardinals their <hi>Vignas</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi>
is observed the form of a true
Princely Garden, consisting not
only in much Air, great plots of
Grass, low Borders, large Gravell-Walks,
but for close Walks, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Groves, and Statuaes, to
make good the Italian saying, <hi>Per
variar natura é bella.</hi> And as for
the imbossed carved Imagery on
the Frontispiece of a Palace, their
Dimensions must be according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their distance from the Ground;
which is a main point requisite to
be observed also in Scheames,
wherein divers undertakers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
very great faults, not only by
the not reducing whatsoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to the true Lines of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97440:26"/>
but also by omitting the
giving such Proportions to things,
as may satisfie the sight of all the
Spectators at their severall distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for Excellency doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in vastness, nor in the quantity
of Objects, nor Shapes, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>The Sphear in an Angle of a
great Chamber in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pedro è Vatica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
in <hi>Rome</hi> confirms this truth, and
every judicious Eye will be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therewith. Seas must not only be
seen to have a naturall motion, but
heard to make a noise of breaking
of their Waves on the shoar, and
against the Rocks. Clouds must
not only drive, but be transparent.
Winds, Thunder, Lightning, Rain,
Snow, and Hail, must be so heard,
seen, and felt, as that Spectators
may think those sights to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
operations. The Sun, Moon,
and Stars, no Past-board devices,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97440:27"/>
but so represented, as that they
may dazle the Eyes of Spectators,
And all the Motions of Sceanes
and Mutations as insensible, and no
more to be discovered, than that
of the Hand of a Diall.</p>
            <p>Neither can all great Rooms of
Princely Palaces serve for this use,
except they be after the Moddell
of such as the Italians have built,
as there is a good one at <hi>Florence</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> with conveyances for
Smoak, and capacities for Ecchoes,
which <hi>Inigo Jones</hi> (the late Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor)
experimentally found at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> and by his built Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
House, so as having found his
own fault, he was constrained to
Build a Woodden House over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
the Court of <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatness of a Sovereign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not in the quantity of Stone
and Timber heapt together, The
Quarries possess more Stone, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97440:27"/>
the Woods more Timber than a
Banquet Room. Let any good eye
judge, whether it be not true, that
the extream height of a Room takes
not away the greatness of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that is in the same, and that all
Hangings of Tapistery make no
shew at all, unless they reach to a
proportionable height of a Room.</p>
            <p>Since the greatness of a Nation
consists not in a Husk, but in it self,
and in its Sovereign, nothing should
be suffered to diminish the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that greatness within or
without Doores. A Sovereign and
his Retinue, in a too vast Roome in
height, width and length, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like a company in a Valley near
high Mountains. Whenas a body
standing on the brow of a Hill, and
seen from below, seems to be a kind
of <hi>Colosse,</hi> which argueth that there
must be a great discretion used in
the making them fit and pleasing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:97440:28"/>
All which I do not Write to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
any Modern Works, nor
any of the Cavallier-like <hi>Operas,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
good Talent being commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
As I am confident there are
some that live, who will not deny
that they have heard the King of
blessed Memory, graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to avouch he had seen in <hi>Anno
1628,</hi> (close to the Gate of <hi>York</hi>-House,
in a Roome not above 35.
Foot square,) as much as could be
represented (as to Sceans) in the
great Banquetting Room of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi>
and that divers judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
will not deny, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the several Triumphall
Arches Erected in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
consists not in their Bulk.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (who
have shown their Master-ship in
them) did conform them to the
respective places.</p>
            <p>Things can be too great, as well
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97440:28"/>
as too little, too massie, and too slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
too gaudy, and too plain; and
Colours placed together, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
not one with the other, as blew
and green. God in his Rainbow hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shewed us the best way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Colours. Nor is it the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Timber or Stone, that speaks
love in an Arch; but rather when it
is composed of the hearts of Loyal
Subjects, which surpasseth all that
can be made.</p>
            <p>May therefore the oldest and
most tottering House in the Land,
breath forth of its Windows what
may answer that true love, and in
point of good Building, wherewith
this Discourse is begun, (next to
the giving such a new Form to the

as may in a manner equalize those
