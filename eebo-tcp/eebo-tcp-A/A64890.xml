         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is releeved, and quite defeated the
Rebells before it, where there was to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Incountred by ſome Companies from <hi>Millwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke,</hi>
but they were quite Routed by our Forces,
ſlaying about an hundred and fifty, with the
loſſe of none. The Lord <hi>Muskeys</hi> Army is rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from that quarter by my Lord <hi>Inchequid</hi> and
Colonell <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> with onely two Troopes of
Horſe and three hundred Muſquetiers. The
maine body of the Lord <hi>Muskeys</hi> Forces conſiſt
of 36 Colours; They ſent out ſome to give us
Skirmiſh, but preſently packt up their baggage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64285:3"/>
and fled. Our men purſued them two or three
miles, charging fiercely upon their Reare, and
Routed the whole Army; there were ſlaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred of their men, without the
loſſe of a man.</p>
            <p>SEven hundred Horſe are ſafely Landed here
from you, ſome upon Friday, Saturday, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and Munday, and the Lord <hi>Lile</hi> landed here,
and Lord <hi>Digbie</hi> on Tueſday from Holy-Head.
Vpon Munday one Maſter <hi>Ask</hi> his man was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with Powder going to the Rebells, who
was that night put upon the wracke, but was
not ſtretcht; the next morning Alderman <hi>Bey</hi>
was committed, as it is ſuppoſed, about that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe:
that night another was taken with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and one <hi>James Cleare</hi> was committed for
buying of Powder in <hi>Cheſter</hi> a little before this
Plot was diſcovered; but it was not brought
over, ſo when the Newes was come to <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
the man that ſold it ſent for it backe from <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham;</hi>
This was not well carried, for it was
not knowne till now. This day one <hi>James Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi>
was brought in, who was at the firſt of this
Rebellion a great Favourite with the State, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64285:4"/>
made Sheriffe of a Countie; but in ſtead of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
that office made himſelfe a Captain with
the Rebells.</p>
            <p>Many other pretty things might I write, but
it were not worth relating; The Souldiers are
very unruly, and diſcontented for want of their
pay, and wee are much burthened, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much out of order, without wee have
ſpeedy ayd and money, all things will not goe

out to <hi>Leiſlipe,</hi> a houſe of Sir <hi>Nicholas Whites,</hi>
there was none with him but onely a Troope
of Horſe, the Rogues let them come within a
Muſquet ſhot of the Houſe or thereabouts, a
hundred Musquetiers came out ſome private
way, and were like to compaſſe them round,
then the Rogues out of the houſe did appeare
when they thought the reſt had gone behinde
our horſe, ſo upon that they were faine to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate,
