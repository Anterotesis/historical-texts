         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HArd hearted Nature! That being yet ſo young, ſhould bring forth ſo cruel a Monſter? A Brother to kill a Brother, and that for no other quarrel, but for his Righteouſneſs, becauſe his deeds were good, and <hi>Cains</hi> evil; what malignity did our firſt Parents fall, diſtil into all the ſucceeding Race? Yet being queſtion'd by the voice of Heaven, <hi>Cain,</hi> deſperately evill as he was, was not ſo impudently ſhameleſs as to own, though not ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to confeſs the fact; but why ſhould we remember <hi>Cain</hi> with ſo black a Character? <hi>Cain,</hi> a Saint may ſeem, compared with the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> whom this latter age hath produced; we have ſeen (as this day <hi>England</hi> direful Tragedy; <hi>England,</hi> that moſt diſmally hath committed Felony upon her ſelf, and with her own bloody hands, cut off her own Royal head: Oh, 'tis a ſad judgement, that upon the defect of our prayers, and the omiſſion of our obedience, is fallen upon us, a judgment accompanied with ſuch lamentable conſequences, occaſioned by ſo deplorable an action, ſo fatal a blow, as no hand can write the ſtory of it, for trembling; or if it could, no eye were able to read for weeping; no tongue is able to ſpeake it's greife, for ſtammering and titubations; or if it ſhould, no ear were able to hear it, for glowing: Nay, we have ſeen that that is ſo far from being communicable to poſterity in any credible relation, that we our ſelves, can hardly believe our ſelves, to to have ſeen a moſt gracious, glorious King, ſetled in his Fathers Throne, by the Laws of God and of the Land, confirmed in his Regal Power, by the Oathes of Allegiance, taken by his very enemies, in the iſſue of a ſharp tedious War, after the expence of many thouſands of Noble, Generous, Loyal, Proteſtant Chriſtians lives, in his juſt defence, to be at length, by the power of a rebellious, treacherous crew of his own Subjects, (and many of them his falſe-hearted, houſhold Servants,) born, and bred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grown rich under his happy Government, (and by his liberal hand) brought to a ſolemn tryal, under pretence of Law, formally arraign'd for his life &amp; adjudged by thoſe that were his profeſſed foes (and without being heard) as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer and a publique Enemy to be put to death, by the ſevering his Head from his Body; and that this ſentence ſhould be executed, by the force of the Souldiery, on a Scaffold erected before his own Court? In the midſt of Populous <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> in the face of the Sun at noon day, God, Angels, Men, looking on; and to paſs through his Banqueting-houſe, his houſe of State and Pleaſure, to this Mount-Calvary; and as a Lamb, before the Shearers not to open his mouth? Oh the Heavens! I dare not enter into too ſerious a conſideration of this unheard off, unparalel'd fact, leſt I drown my ſenſes in the Abyſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible ſorrow; the whole world abroad ſtands amazed at it, <hi>England</hi> onely being under the ſtroke, remaines ſtupidly inſenſible of her own, both fin and miſery: The earth indeed at this day, was not felt to quake, but all mens hearts, (not more hard then the Adamant) trembled: The graves indeed did not open to let forth their dead, but many tender-hearted, amongſt the living, with grief dyed, and went to their graves: The vales of our Temples indeed were not rent, but our material Temples themſelves, in this the head of our Church on earth, were vertually deſtroyed in his Majeſties Dominions: More, I cannot tell more, on this ſad Theam; I dare not ſo much as think, leſt I thinking, dye: Much leſs do I know what to do, (for ſince the Creation of the World, the like hath not been ſeen) but mine eyes, dear God, are towards thee.</p>
