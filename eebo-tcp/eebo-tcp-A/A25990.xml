            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Name ſtands already Printed to
a late Eſſay, Entituled, <hi>Several
Aſſertions proved, in order to Create
another Species of Money than Gold
and Silver,</hi> of which I am not aſhamed;
and I have added my Name to this, that
(whatever uſage it meets with) I may
ſtand bound to recognize it.</p>
            <p>I hope I have ſuch a Warrant to ſearch
for Truth, that will juſtifie me in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through all Crafts and Sciences to find
it; as Hunger juſtified <hi>David</hi> and his
Men, for entering the Prieſt's Houſe, and
eating the Shew-bread.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I find that I ſhall ſcarce
be able to begin, much leſs to get through
my Argument, without unfolding ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of Iniquity between Prieſts and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
relating to the Titles and Settlements
of Lands, I hope that the Modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb facs="tcp:108376:3"/>
of either of theſe Sciences will not
be offended with me for ſpeaking the whole
Truth; but if they ſhould, <hi>They will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be Witneſſes againſt themſelves, that
they juſtifie the Deeds of their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I ſhould be charg'd with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs,
for mingling ſacred things with
ſecular, I will ſhelter my ſelf under the
Lord of the Sabboth, who was accuſed for
doing Buſineſs on that day; and

ASSERTIONS
PROVED,
In Order to Introduce a BILL,

Titles of Lands.</head>

               <head>Firſt Aſſertion. That as the Law now ſtands, the Free-hold
Lands in England may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered
in diverſe Manners, and at
diverſe Places.</head>
               <head>PROVED.</head>
               <p>FRee-hold Lands may be incumbered
theſe ſeveral ways:</p>
               <p>1. By Feofment, which muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in the Place where the Lands lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108376:4"/>
2. By Grant with Attornment, of which
the Tenants muſt have Notice.</p>
               <p>3. By Fine and Recovery (with a Deed
leading the Uſe) which are Matters of
Record.</p>
               <p>4. By Bargain and Sale, inrolled in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Four Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or
with the <hi>Cuſtos Rotulorum</hi> of the County
where the Lands lye.</p>
               <p>5. By Judgments in Three Courts at
<hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. By Recognizances entered in the
Courts where they are acknowledged.</p>
               <p>7. By Statutes Merchant and Staple tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Chancery.</p>
               <p>8. By Leaſe and Releaſe, which may
be Executed any where.</p>
               <p>9. By Leaſes granted out of the Lands,
which may be Executed any where.</p>
               <p>10. By Rent-charges granted out of the
ſame, which may be Executed any where.</p>
               <p>11. By Will in Writing.</p>
               <p>12. By Bonds to the King, which are
in the Nature of Statutes-ſtaple.</p>
               <p>All theſe are Incumbrances made by the
Act of the Party: Beſides which, there
are others that happen by Default, as
Acts of Bankrupcy, Eſchaets and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Now I am not a going to Calumniate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108376:4"/>
the Law, for allowing of ſo many ſorts
of Incumbrances on Lands, but for permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to be done in diverſe places,
<hi>Which doth render the Titles to Lands incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and therefore is a Deficiency in the Law:</hi>
And tho' the Law hath directed ſeveral
of them to be recorded, yet this doth not
remedy the Incertainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe theſe Records do lye in
ſeveral Places, which makes the Search
thereof chargeable, and the Finding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe thoſe that are upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
have no Preference above thoſe that
be not; ſo that ſhould a Purchaſer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all that are Recorded, he may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by thoſe that are not; which can
never be diſcovered, but by the Confeſſion
of them that made them, becauſe they may
be executed any where.</p>
               <p>Therefore the drift of this Eſſay, is to
give a Sanction to one Place above all the
reſt, by annexing a Priviledge to it, and
leaving it to every Man's pleaſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will purchaſe that Priviledge or
not.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the Neceſſities and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
whereof, I offer the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108376:5"/>
               <head>Second Aſſertion. That the Advantage taken (by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyancers
in the Law) of the Statute
of Ues, 27 H. 8. in making
Clandeſtine Conveyances, contrary to
the true intent and meaning of that
Parliament, and all the avowed Laws
and Cuſtoms of England, doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
a Neceſſity of a Regiſtry to
prevent them.</head>
               <head>PROVED.</head>
               <p>In tracing out the Occaſions of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Statute, I was drawn through
all the Statutes againſt Mortmain, as far
back as <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which doth prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
the giving Lands to Religious Houſes;
by which it did ſeem to me, that Lands
had been ſo given before that time, or
elſe it had not been prohibited: For hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Prohibitions generally come after
the Fact committed, whereas the Laws di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
prohibit by way of Prevention: <hi>Adam</hi>
was forbidden the Tree, before ever he
had taſted of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Statute againſt Mortmain was
made by God himſelf, before the Fact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108376:5"/>
for by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which
inſtituted the firſt Society of Prieſthood, the
Levites are forbidden to have any Inheritance
but the Tithes, that they might not dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Poſſeſſions; but Avarice increaſing
upon them, by an Acquiſition of Wealth,
which they did not know how to diſpoſe
of, they agreed to ſet up a Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
by way of a Joint-Stock, for the uſe
of the Church, which was not within
the Words of the Prohibition; and out
of this Joint-Stock they paid <hi>Judas</hi> the
<hi>thirty pieces of Silver,</hi> which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
by him, they were loth to part with
it, and yet puzzled what to do with it;
becauſe being the Price of Blood, it was
againſt their own Canons, to put it again
into their Treaſury; <hi>Therefore they took
Counſel, and bought the Potters Field, to bury
Strangers in.</hi> As my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> commends
the Wiſdom of our Ancient Clergy, for
always chooſing the moſt Learned in the
Law to be of their Counſel, ſo it ſeems theſe
Prieſts of old were endued with the like
Wiſdom: <hi>For the Children of this World
are wiſer in their Generation than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe Lawyers adviſed their Clients,
that notwithſtanding this Canon, they might
purchaſe Lands with this Money, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
them to their Church: But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108376:6"/>
againſt the Law divine, prohibiting
their purchaſing of Lands, the Lawyers
found this Stratagem, <hi>to purchaſe theſe Lands
for a Burying-place only, in the Nature of a
Church yard;</hi> which being a thing of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and made Sacred, would exempt, or at
leaſt excuſe it from this Statute againſt
Mortmain; and the Prieſts computing that
this might turn to as much Profit as any thing
elſe, (having double Duties for Lodging of
Men, and Meat for Horſes) they conſented
to lay out their Money in it, (any thing
to get a Penny in an honeſt way.)</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Field of Blood</hi> was <hi>the firſt
ſpot of Glebe in the World,</hi> to which
the Prieſts will be intituled, (in right of
the Church) if ever they gain the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>But having laid this Neſt Egg, they
went on to join Field to Field, and had
they been let alone, had converted whole
Kingdoms into Holy Ground before now.</p>
               <p>And why Houſes of Religion are ſaid
to be more haunted with Ghoſts than Lay-Tenements,
I can't tell, unleſs ſome of their
ſubſequent Augmentations were the Price of
Blood, as well as their Original Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now to begin at our Laws:</hi> It is
ſtrange to obſerve, how the Parliaments
of <hi>England</hi> did hunt the Prieſts and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
with Statutes againſt Mortmain, from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108376:6"/>
the making of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 9. H. 3. to
this Statute in 27. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and yet could
never catch them.</p>
               <p>The Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (as has been
obſerved) <hi>prohibited the giving of Lands to any
Religious Houſe:</hi> To evade this, the Lawyers
adviſed the Clergy two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That
whereas ſeveral great Eſtates were held of
them, under ſmall Rents, that they might
purchaſe in theſe Eſtates to their Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were before held of them. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
The Prohibition of the Statute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Religious Perſons only,</hi> that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Clergy were exempted.</p>
               <p>To hunt them out of theſe Holds, the Statute
of 7 <hi>E.</hi> 1. called <hi>Statutum de Religioſis,</hi> doth
prohibit any <hi>Religious Perſons, or others,</hi>
(which includes the Secular Clergy) by
any manner <hi>of Craft or Engine to take Lands
in Mortmain,</hi> and ſo they could not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
in the Eſtates held of them.</p>
               <p>To evade this Statute, the Lawyers advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Clergy, That if they had any ſilly
Confeſſants who had a mind to be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Eſtates, they might ſuffer a
feigned Action to be brought againſt them,
and therein loſe their Lands by default,
which Recoveries were adjudged by the
Juſtices not to be within any of the words
of this Statute, and therefore they were
allowed; <hi>For that Recoveries being proſecuted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108376:7"/>
in courſe of Law, were by Law preſumed to

               <p>
                  <hi>To drive them out of this Hold, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of</hi> Weſtminſter 2. makes all Lands ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be forfeited to the Lords of the Fee,
and for want of their Entry to the King.</p>
               <p>To evade this Statute, the Lawyers
adviſed the Clergy two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That for all Lands lying found the Church,
they might enter into them by aſſent
of the Tenants, and make them Church-yards
by Bulls of the Pope, (<hi>whether</hi> they
had this by precedent from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Purchaſe, or according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>That good Wits jump,</hi> is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.)
<hi>Secondly,</hi> They adviſed them, that
they might purchaſe Lands in the Names
of other Perſons to their Uſe.</p>
               <p>To hunt them out of theſe Holds, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 15 <hi>R. 2. prohibits both theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To evade this, the Lawyers adviſed the
Clergy, that they might purchaſe in the
Names of other Perſons, <hi>in Truſt</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which Truſt was not within the
preciſe words <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the Prieſts continued to Cheat
the People of their Eſtates, and the Lawyers
the King of his Eſchaets, for above three
hundred years together, in ſpight of all
Laws made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:108376:7"/>
In which time they had taught the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
this Craft, to convey away their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Eſtates to Perſons in Truſt, whereby
to prevent the Deſcent to the Heir, and
conſequently the Wardſhip to the King
and other Lords, and yet to keep the uſe
and pernancy of the Profits to themſelves
and Families: Of which King <hi>H.</hi> 8.
complaining to his Judges, they adviſed
an Act for Transferring all Uſes and Truſts
into Poſſeſſions; for which purpoſe a Bill
was drawn by the King's Counſel, and
preſented to the Houſe of Commons, in
the <hi>24th.</hi> year of his Reign, when it was
rejected, but paſſed in the <hi>27th.</hi> which is
this Statute of Uſes.</p>
               <p>And four years after a Statute paſſed
(worth all the former) for Diſſolution of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries;
by which the Prieſts loſt their
Lands, and the Lawyers their Clients, (tho'
not their Cunning) as will appear by the
Sequel.</p>
               <p>Now this Statute of Uſes, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
a new Conveyance in the Law,
(which was not before) by way of <hi>Bargain
and Sale,</hi> for tho' a Bargain and Sale did
raiſe a Uſe at the Common Law, yet it
was not a compleat Conveyance to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Poſſeſſion, without an actual deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of it in the Country: but now this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
doing that Office by transferring the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108376:8"/>
Uſe into a Poſſeſſion, a Bargain and Sale
became a compleat Conveyance without
any other Ceremony: And the ſame Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
forſeeing that this Bargain and Sale
ſo perfected might become a Clandeſtine
Conveyance, to be executed any where,
did intend to provide againſt it, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Short Statute the ſame Seſſions for
that purpoſe, called <hi>The Statute for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollments,</hi>
by which all Conveyances of
Inheritance of Freehold, which paſs by
Bargain and Sale only, are to be Enroll'd
within ſix Months after the Date, that
Purchaſers may have Notice thereof from
the Record.</p>
               <p>But of late years the Lawyers have topt
their Inventions upon theſe two Statutes.
For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> They make a <hi>Bargain and Sale</hi>
for a Term only, (now generally called a
<hi>Leaſe for a Year</hi>) and which is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Statute of Enrollments, and by this
the Leſſee gains a Uſe <hi>at Common-Law,</hi>
and a Poſſeſſion by <hi>the Statute of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes;</hi>
which makes him capable of taking a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
of the Reverſion at Common Law,
and then they make <hi>a Releaſe</hi> to him
and his Heirs accordingly. Which two
Deeds make him one perfect Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and ſo by putting the Common-Law
at both Ends, and the Statute of Uſes
in the Middle, the Statute for Enrollments
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108376:8"/>
is bilkt, and theſe Conveyances <hi>by Leaſe
and Releaſe,</hi> which are Clandeſtine Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
and invented by the Abuſe of one
Statute, and the Eluſion of the other, are
become the Common Conveyances of the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I challenge the Inns of Court to ſhew,
that either the Common Law, or any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>England,</hi> ever directed any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances
to affect Lands, but by Solemn
Livery and Seiſin, or matter of Record;
and therefore theſe Clandeſtine Conveyances
are crept in, contrary to the Intent and
Meanings of Parliaments, and all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
Laws and Cuſtoms of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>There are two Common Titles to Lands
in <hi>England:</hi> The one by Deſcent, which
is proved by Marriages, Baptiſms and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;
and the other by Purchaſe, which
is proved by Deeds; and where there is
one Diſpute of Title by Deſcent, there are
ten by Purchaſe; becauſe the Titles which
ſhew the Deſcent are regiſtred, and thoſe
by Purchaſe are not; for were theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
Baptiſms and Burials, left at large,
without notifying of them, as Purchaſes
are, it would ſoon breed Confuſion in all
the Deſcents of the Kingdom. And is it not
a Reproach to the Law, that that part of
the Titles of Lands, which is the Province
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108376:9"/>
of poor Pariſh Clerks, ſhould have more
certainty in it, then that which belongs to
the Profeſſors of the Law?</p>

               <head>Third Aſſertion. That all Objections made againſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry,
upon account of Miſchiefs which

not only contrary to all the avowed

to the very Eſſence of Title, and the

               <head>PROVED.</head>
               <p>Some Notice is eſſentially neceſſary to
the Title of every thing that is vendible:
<hi>To make a Title, is to take the Property of a
thing from one Man, and put it into another,</hi>
of which it is neceſſary that other perſons
ſhould have Notice, as well as the Parties,
or elſe the Purchaſer can have no Title
becauſe there is no Witneſs to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it, in caſe the Seller ſhould deny
it. And as ſome Notice is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all Title, ſo the more Notice
the better is the Title; it were better
for every Man who is Owner of an Eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that all Men knew his Title, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:108376:9"/>
whenever he had Occaſion to diſpoſe of
his Eſtate, there would be no further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the Title of his Lands, than to
the Title of Money in his Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>And as Notice is thus neceſſary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to Title, ſo in the Hiſtory of
Conveyancing, the moſt perfect Titles are
moſt Notorious, or rather the moſt Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
are moſt perfect.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Antiquity of Precedents
is the greateſt Argument in the Law, I'll
quote one out of that Authority, which
treats of things done before the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World, and fortells us of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things that will come to paſs after the
Diſſolution of it. The Hiſtory of the
World is but a Modern Treatiſe of things
of a late Date, which were done in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of Counſels and Decrees made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<hi>Matters of Fact</hi> ſet forth, without
the Original Deſign and Inſtitution of them
ſeem irrational, and to have no Meaning
in them: Would any thing ſeem more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
than that the taking off a Seal,
and delivery of a piece of Parchment by
one Man, ſhould give another a Title to
an Eſtate, if the Law were not known,
which gives the Sanction to this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</p>
               <p>The Precedent I am going to quote,
is, <hi>That great Settlement of Eternal Life,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108376:10"/>
made by God upon Jeſus Chriſt, for the
Conſiderations therein mentioned:</hi> The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
or Contents whereof, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Execution, I find in that Hiſtory
which we call the Goſpel; but becauſe
the Contents thereof is not a Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Eſſay, I will not dare to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it here: But the manner of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being directly within my Argument,
(or rather my Argument within that) I dare
relate it as I find it. This Settlement was
firſt Enrolled in Heaven, (<hi>in the Volume of
the Book it is written of me</hi>) afterwards
was Sealed and Executed in the Blood of
Chriſt, (<hi>the Seal of the Covenant</hi>) in the
preſence of all the World, (<hi>the Sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is gone through the whole Earth</hi>) and
ſince that hath or ſhall be Written and
Preached, Printed and Publiſhed in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Kingdoms, Tongues and Countries.
(<hi>This Goſpel muſt firſt be preached in all the
World, as a Witneſs to all Nations, and then
ſhall the End be.</hi>) By all which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is bound up from diſpoſing Eternal
Life in any other manner, than purſuant
to this Settlement, without giving himſelf
the Lye, which he cannot do; and Man
hath ſuch Notice of this Title, that he can't
accept any other, without becoming an
Impoſter upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:108376:10"/>
And this is the higheſt Precedent for
Man to form his Titles by, as far as it is
imitable by him; <hi>The things on Earth are
but the Patterns of things in the Heavens,
where the Originals are kept, to try the Truth
of all things by.</hi> God delivered out the firſt
Forms of all things in the World, of Ships,
of Regular Buildings, of Letters written
with his own Hand, of Marches and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments,
taught the firſt Workers in
Braſs and Bugle-work, Linnen and Silks,
Plowing and Harrowing, Sowing and Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Threſhing and Winnowing; all which
he owns to come originally from himſelf.
<hi>A Jove principium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now to begin with the Buſineſs of
Man: The firſt Purchaſe I find ſince the
Beginning of the World, was made by</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>of</hi> Ephron, <hi>the</hi> Hittite, <hi>in theſe Words,</hi>
And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah,
which was before Mamre, the field and the
cave which was therein, and all the Trees
that were in the field, that were in all the
Borders round about, were made ſure to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
for a Poſſeſſion, in the preſence of the
Children of Heth, before all that went in at the
Gate of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another was made by</hi> Boaz <hi>of</hi> Naomi, <hi>in
theſe words,</hi> And Boaz ſaid unto the Elders, and
unto all the People, ye are Witneſſes this day, that
I have bought all that was Elimelechs, and all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108376:11"/>
                  <hi>that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand
of Naomi: Moreover, Ruth the Moabiteſs,
the Wife of Mahlon, have I purchaſed to be
my Wife, ye are witneſſes this day. And all
the People that were in the Gate, and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſaid, we are witneſſes. (O Tempora! O
Mores!)</hi> Purchaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Marriages made
without Lawyers or Prieſts: However, I
have mentioned theſe Conveyances more
particularly, becauſe I fancy our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Conveyancers, with all their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
of Stationers Ware, can't make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
either for Form or Subſtance; and
theſe were made by Paroll, being before
the Delivery of the Form of Letters to
Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt that I have obſerved in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
was the Purchaſe of Redemption
made by</hi> Jeremy <hi>of</hi> Hananael, <hi>in theſe
words,</hi> And I ſubſcribed the Evidence, and
ſealed it, and weighed him the Money in the
Ballances, ſo I took the Evidence of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
both that which was ſealed according to
the Law and Cuſtom, and that which was
open, and gave them to <hi>Baruch,</hi> in the ſight
of <hi>Hananael,</hi> and in the preſence of the
Witneſſes, who ſubſcribed the Book of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
before all the Jews that ſate in the
Court of the Priſon; and charged <hi>Baruch,</hi>
ſaying, take the Evidence, as well that which
is ſealed, as that which is open, and put them
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108376:11"/>
in an Earthen Veſſel, that they may continue
many dayes.</p>
               <p>By this it doth appear, that Regiſtring
of Deeds is as antient as the Deeds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Here is the Original Sealed, and then
Regiſtred in a Book, to which the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſubſcribe their Names: Now <hi>Baruch</hi>
had the Cuſtody of the Regiſtry, in the
Nature of a Publick Notary, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
being elſewhere called <hi>Baruch the
Scribe:</hi> But that the Original was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him, was an extraordinary thing,
for that belongs to the Purchaſer: But it
being juſt before the carrying away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
into <hi>Babylon,</hi> (of which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had
Notice) he delivered them both to <hi>Baruch,</hi>
to hide them till the return of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
               <p>That which I Cite theſe Precedents for,
is the Notoriety of them, by calling all
the People together to bear Witneſs, and
an Inrollment beſide to that which was in
Writing.</p>
               <p>And methinks all the Old Forms in the
beginning of Deeds, ſhew the Intention
of making them as publick as they could
be; <hi>Know all Men by theſe Preſents;</hi> and,
<hi>To all People to whom theſe Preſents ſhall
come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as the Law intends Notice of all
things done by Deed, ſo it hath provided
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108376:12"/>
Publications for things done without Deed,
as Fairs and Markets for Selling of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
that the Purchaſers may not be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Publications in the Churches before
Matrimony, and Regiſtring after it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Bigamy:</hi> So the Law marks Felons
in the Hand, that none may truſt them.</p>
               <p>And yet after all this, there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
intended in the Bill for this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
whereby any one may Conceal the
Uſes declared of his Eſtate, yet ſo that
there ſhall be ſome Notice taken of the
Deed, by which the Uſes are declared,
that the Owner of the Land ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Selling or Mortgaging his Eſtate,
'till he doth produce that Deed, whereby
a Purchaſer or Lender cannot be defeated.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="assertion">
               <head>Fourth Aſſertion. That all Objections made againſt this
Regiſtry, upon Account of Reducing
the Practice of the Law, are one good
Reaſon for it.</head>
               <head>PROVED.</head>
               <p>The practice of the Law in Civil Cauſes
is divided into three Sorts: Firſt, <hi>The
transferring of Titles,</hi> which is called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyancing.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>The ſhewing forth and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108376:12"/>
defending theſe Titles in Forms of Law,</hi> and
this is called <hi>Pleading.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
upon theſe Conveyances, and Pleadings
(when they come in conteſt) before the Judges,</hi>
and this is called <hi>Practice at the Bar:</hi> So
that the Practice of the two latter doth
ariſe from the Errors or Incertainties of
the former. Were the Titles of Lands
once made certain (which they may be
by a Regiſtry, and no otherwiſe) I know
what I think of the future Gains of the
Law. The profit of the Law ariſes from
the Incertainty of Property, and therefore
as Property is more reduced to a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the profit of the Law muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with it; the Fall of the one muſt be
the Riſing of the other. Actions of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Battery, and Cauſes on the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
would ſcarce find ſome of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiteers
Perriwiggs, and yet (if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Evidence) they ſtand obliged to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
in Titles for many of theſe. Theif
and Whore, Kick and Cuff, are very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Effect of forcible Entryes, Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
and ſerving of Proceſs, in which
the Title comes frequently in Queſtion.
But the reducing this part of the practice
of the Law, are things not ſeen as yet.
The <hi>Proximus ardet</hi> will fall upon the
Conveyancers, and that not by altering the
Forms of legal Conveyances, or taking them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108376:13"/>
out of their hands, or putting any ſtop to the
Dealing in Lands, (for that will be encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but by expoſing their manner of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in this Conveyancing part of the Law.</p>
               <p>For as it was numbered among the Sins
of one of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he made
Prieſts of the meaneſt of the people, ſo it
is the misfortune of the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that Conveyancers are frequently
made out of <hi>Old Attornies</hi> or <hi>Noblemens-Leaſe-makers,</hi>
fumpt up in <hi>Bar-gowns.</hi> Two
Qualifications are neceſſary to a compleat
Conveyancer: Firſt, <hi>That he be incapable
of diſpatching Buſineſs ſo faſt as he ſhould.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>That he doth not diſpatch it ſo faſt
as he can.</hi> Not to ſpeak of bantering their
Clients with their ſeeming Care and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in delaying their Buſineſs, ſhewing
great Trunks of old Writings in their
Chamber, calling to their Clerks (before
them) for one Lord's Settlement, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ladies Jointure, to tell what great
Clients they have; and when they come
to be paid, they reckon their Fees by lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
and latitude. I have ſeen an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Mortgage of one Skin, bred up by
a Scrivener (in ſix Year) to one and twenty,
by aſſigning it every Year, and adding
one Skin to every aſſigment, by Recitals
and Covenants: As Cows after three
Years old, have one wrinkle added to each
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108376:13"/>
Horn for every year after, which ſhows
their Age: And I am informed, that one
Deed of ſixty Skins was heaved out of
a Conveyancer's Office the other Day.</p>
               <p>At this rate in a little time the Clyents
muſt drive their Deeds out of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
Chambers in Wheel-barrows. Theſe
Aſſignments and Re-aſſignments of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
have been a pretty ſort of Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites;
eſpecially if they have but an old
Judgment or Statute kept on foot, theſe
are certain annual Incomes. I knew two
Serjeants at Law, (Uſurers,) made it their
common practice every Long Vacation,
to ſwop Securities with one another, to
make their Mortgagers pay for the Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and (doing this without Advice of
Counſel) they once Merged an old Term,
and thereby ſpoiled their Title to ſecure
their Fees; which (as to them) anſwers
the Character given of theſe Graduates
by a Forreign Hiſtorian, <hi>Eſt in Regno
Angliae genus hominum doctorum indoctiſſimum
communiter vocat, The Learned Serjeants at
Law:</hi> Now I cann't think but theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyancers
and Aſſigners would be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to produce ſuch things to a Regiſtry;
and that therefore they muſt either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviate
their Conveyances, or looſe their
Practice.</p>

But whether this Regiſtry will make
theſe Reductions: 1. Of the Length of
Conveyances. 2. The Incertainties of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles:
And, 3. By Conſequence, the other
Practice in the Law, I cannot tell: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I hope it, and believe ſome of them
fear it.</p>
               <p>But if the Cryes of Monks and Fryers
had been regarded, we had never heard
of the Diſſolution of Monaſteries; and if
the Clamours of Maſters of Requeſt,
Clerks and Eſchaetors had prevailed, the
Court of Wards and Liveries had been
ſtanding at this day: And yet perhaps moſt
of theſe had either purchaſed their Places,
or were bred up to that part of the Law

J. <hi>Hales</hi> had made a Purchaſe, he would
ſay, <hi>Now I would give a Years purchaſe more
to be ſure of my Title:</hi> And if we ſhould
ask thoſe who have loſt their Eſtates, for
want of a diſcovery of Deeds, they would
ſet a higher Price upon it.</p>
               <p>Men generally make their Purchaſes
(with the acquiſitions of all their former
life) to ſettle them on their Poſterity, for
whom they are more ſollicitous than for
themſelves; and therefore they are always
more jealous of the Title than the Value,
becauſe a deficiency in Title goes to the
whole, but a deficiency in Value goes but
to part only; and for that Reaſon they
would almoſt think nothing too much to
aſſure them of their Title.</p>
               <p>If a Man one hundred and fifty Miles
from <hi>London,</hi> is to ſue his Neighbour but
for 10 <hi>l.</hi> he muſt employ an Attorney in
the Country, who muſt ſend to another in
<hi>London</hi> to make out a Writ, and this muſt
be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Entered in one Office, and Sealed in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108376:15"/>
another, and then ſent to the Sheriff, who
muſt make out a Warrant, and deliver it
to his Under officers; who muſt arreſt the
Defendant, take a Bail bond to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
and after Bail given to the Action,
the Plaintiff muſt declare, to which the
Defendant may plead almoſt what he
pleaſes for Delay; and if he pleads to
Iſſue, (which is the faireſt can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
there muſt be Iſſue joined, a Record
ſealed, and ſent down to the Aſſizes, a <hi>Ven.</hi>
and <hi>Diſtringas</hi> to return the Jury, Notice
of Tryal to the Defendant, a Tryal had,
the Verdict returned upon the <hi>Poſtea,</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
entered, Execution ſued out and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Sheriff, and a Warrant from
him to his Under-officer to levy it.</p>
               <p>Now I don't calumniate this Proceſs for
recovery of Debts, nor did I ever hear
the Lawyers complain of this as a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to the People. But why of all troubles
the trouble of a Regiſtry ſhould be only
grievous, I can't tell, unleſs becauſe it puts
an End to Strife: Is it ſuch a mighty trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for an Attorneys Clerk, when he is to
enter up a Judgment, to ſtep into the
Regiſtry, and leave an Entry made of it?
and is it ſuch a great trouble for a Man,
when he has ſealed a Deed, to go to the
Regiſter to acknowledge it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:108376:15"/>
There's more trouble than all this in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Copy-hold Eſtates, and yet we
don't hear much Complaint about them:
Men are ſeldom in ſuch haſt about laying
out their Money, or at leaſt their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
are not ſo violent in diſpatch of their
Buſineſs, but they may diſpenſe with the
Ceremony of a Regiſtry, to prevent the
loſs of their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feſtina Lente</hi> is the Conveyancers Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and therefore they adviſe their Clients
not to hurry them, nor put them out of
their own pace; they muſt think nothing
troubleſome but the Entering the Deed
in a Regiſtry. To come to a Lawyers
Chamber twice a Week, to know when
they ſhall come again; then to have a
Bill of Directions to ſend for ſome Deed
which the Lawyer wants, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is a hundred Miles diſtant, in they
know not whoſe hands, to employ an
Attorney to ſearch for Judgments, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
Recognizances, Deeds Inrolled in
four Courts, to ſend for a Copy of a Will
proved in a remote Dioceſs, and bring an
Account of all this to the Lawyer, and
give him a New Fee, and then begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
and may be two or three ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi>
before the Title be finiſhed; and the
Clyents muſt not think much of all this, but
take it as the Nature of Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108376:16"/>
And yet I cann't ſay but all this may
be Neceſſary, as the Caſe now ſtands,
which muſt ſtill grow worſe, if let alone:
For the Troubles and hazards of Titles muſt
continually increaſe, until they are reduced
to a greater Certainty by a Regiſtry.</p>
               <p>But then as a Regiſtry would reduce
the Incertainty of Titles, it muſt thereby
take away the Delayes in Conveyancing,
and conſequently abridge the Charges: For
as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made long Prayers, as a
Pretence or Equivalent for devouring Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
Houſes, ſo Practicers in the Law
muſt make out long Bills, on pretence for
demanding large Fees: Like ſome Tooth-drawers,
who dragg their Patients by the
Jaws about the room, to ſhew them how
hardly they earn their Money. To cure
Deficiency in Titles, would be as fatal to
Conveyancers, as the Cure of a lame Legg
to a Beggar.</p>
               <p>It is pleaſant enough to any one (but thoſe
who are to pay for it) to read a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyancers
Bill of Fees, made out for Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
who don't pay well by the gret.</p>
               <p>To Counſel for peruſing ſeveral long Deeds
of the Title, which from the beginning to
the end was near ſix Months, and drawing
ſeveral long Conveyances, in all thirty Skins of
Parchment, 100 <hi>Guineas.</hi>

               <p>Tho' the Soil of Lands lyes in in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p>And many Deeds containing Lands in

               <p>But ſhould it afterwards be found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to extend this elſewhere, it will
be better done from this as a Precedent,
than to ſettle it altogether.</p>
               <p>The Judges of the Kingdom were at

               <p>Nothing can be perfected without a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
and therefore to reſolve to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
till we can do every thing, is an

And having thus argued for Publication
of Titles, as a Notice againſt Frauds, I hope
Envy cannot ſay, but I have fairly publiſhed
my Thoughts about it: And were all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions

this before they paſſed, perhaps it might ſave
the labour of ſubſequent Acts to repeal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

               <p>As to what I have ſaid in the Law, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to them that know it, whether I have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited
or miſinterpreted it.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid
of ſome of the Lawyers, I am ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in my Relation to that Science, that I
would not exchange it, to be a higher Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate

to the Candor of the Cheifs of the Law
(who ſit in the Seats of Judgment) in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
