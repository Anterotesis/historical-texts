         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He whole Designe of this Dedication,
as to the Ground and End of it, is
so clearly transparent to those who
know, how Gods Providence hath set
me, a weak Labourer in the Lords
Vineyard, to work under the shadow of your
Lordships protection, that it is a superfluous waste
of words and time, to defend the presumption of
this Address, which, without mine Apologie, may
be reasonably taken for a just expression of my
duty. It were moreover an unpardonable tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
against your Lordships quick Apprehension,
whose vigorous spirit is active and piercing in the
observing of Occurrents, if I should make a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Harangue, to discover mine intentions in
thus testifying the sense I have, both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
benefit, which I enjoy together with other
sons of the Prophets, who dwell in safety under
the sheltring and refreshing shade of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
<pb facs="tcp:63789:3"/>
Patronage, and also of those peculiar obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
laid upon me by your Lordships singular
favour, the repetition whereof in particular were
impertinent, but my publick acknowledgement
in general is as decent, as my private remembrance
of them is perpetually and indispensably requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.
I have onely a minde to wish, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of my own Soyl, which I pay as tribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Lordship, were as agreeable for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
to the divine matter which I handle, as
the discourse it self is proper, and (as I humbly
conceive) suitable to your Lordships pious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For I cannot with silence pass by, what
I have seen with huge satisfaction; that as your
Lordship hath had a share in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s happiness,
in <hi>knowing the holy Scriptures from a childe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note>
               <hi>which are able to make Thee wise unto salvation:</hi>
so It hath grown in knowledge, by the advantage
of Gods special endowment, a capacious and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
Memory. It is also a blessed and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Rarity, that in an Age of men sadly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into Atheism, who endeavour to forget that
they are Gods off-spring, and would fain be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the Mushrooms of Chance, and are not
onely sunk below Beasts in enormous sensuality,
but also fallen beyond the apostasie of the Devils
in absurd Incredulity, with a perverse ingratitude
denying the Lord that bought them, and with a
sottish insolencie denying the God that made
them; your Lordship in the midst of this corrupt
and crooked generation hath continued sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and unmoveable in the belief and profession
of the general Principles of Religion, upon which
<pb facs="tcp:63789:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as a sure Basis all Justice and Civility are founded,
and particularly of the Doctrine declared and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
aversion from Atheistical profaneness, and
from new-fangled pretensions to Religion.</p>
            <p>Some have observed of us Islanders, that we are
very apt to vary our Fashions, and have ascribed
our Inconstancie to the changeable temper of our
Air, and the unstable complexion of our Climate.
I wish our Country-men were not as vainly, and
that more dangerously fickle in altering the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of their Religion, as they are mutable in the
habit and mode of their Apparel. I am sure the
fault of this flitting and shifting humour is not
chargeable upon the Stars, Skie, Air, or other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are all the innocent creatures of a
good God, and uneffective upon the wills of men.
But the shame and misery will light heavie at last
upon these unballasted mindes, unstable souls,
unwary followers of cunning seducers, or itching
affecters of novelty, who delight to wander, but
forsake their own mercy, while they trust in lying
vanities. To prevent the going astray, or being
misled from the way of Truth, and peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
which depends thereon, in one main point
of Christian Religion, I have published a Piece
of my Father of pious memory; which tho imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
because a mortal disease cut off the thred of
his meditation first, and shortly after of his life,
drawn forth to fourscore years within a few
weeks; yet is (as I suppose) a very useful Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
on which any Christian exercised in the
study of Scripture, may build the same super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure,
<pb facs="tcp:63789:4"/>
which the Author would have raised,
if God had granted him a little longer use of
light.</p>
            <p>To this I have subjoyned a short Discourse of
mine own composure, tending to the explication
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> their doctrine concerning
Justification, for the removal of a stone of offence,
the seeming contrariety between the blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
which some weak Christians have stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at, and some scoffing enemies of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have taken up, to cast at the head, and wound
(if it were possible) the credit of the Gospel. And
I hope that the precious Relick premised will
adde weight and value to mine Offering, which I
tender in all humility first as a Peace-offering to
the Church of God; and I present it to your
Lordship as a cluster of that Vineyard, whereof I
am an unworthy Dresser: devoutly praying that
your Lordships benign influence on the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
may be recompensed from on high, with
the plentiful distillation of all blessings upon your
Lordship, and your Lordships whole Family most
worthy of Honour; to which I am resolved, as
well as engaged, to remain in all faithful obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</p>

PREFACE
To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause I stand accountble for the increase of Books
when the world seems to be overcharged already
with the number and bulk of them, even to the
wearying of the Readers flesh and spirit; I desire
thee with candour to receive this brief Account of
my publication of these ensuing Treatises.</p>
            <p>The God of truth and of peace (which two
Titles are the most resplendent Gems in the Crown of Gods glorious
Attributes) hath commanded us to embrace and maintain with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
love and zeal the <hi>Truth and Peace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">zech. 8. 19</note> Since also both these
are the Legacies of our blessed Saviour, bequeathed to his Church
by his Testament, sealed with his bloud; certainly every sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is concerned in both;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 1.</note> but <hi>the stevvards of the mysteries of
God</hi> are yet more deeply engaged in the preservation or restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both, to their utmost ability. At present, our amazing and
distressing thoughts are great for <hi>the divisions of Reuben,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 5. 15.</note> (to use
the words of <hi>Deborah</hi>) and the spiritual flames of dissention which
(like the late dreadful Fire in the Citie) devour the strength and
beauty of our Church, call for the assistance of all hands to quench
them. But as in a Conflagration, while some labour to repress the
violence, or stop the course of the spreading Fire, others are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to guard the Goods, and, while they stand with aking hearts for
the Calamity, do good service in perserving their neighbours as well
as their own Goods from perishing or plunder: so while my Brethren,
the blessed sons of peace, are hard at work, in drawing water out
of the ever-living spring, the Scripture, which plentifully affords the
Word of truth and peace, and applying the same for the allaying of
<pb facs="tcp:63789:5"/>
these consuming flames, (whose endeavours for the <hi>peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
I pray God to prosper) I have undertaken to preserve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seue
an important Truth concerning Justification, from the attempts
made by same to corrupt or obscure this heavenly doctrine. That I
might discharge my fidelity in securing the Apostolical doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched
by the Church of <hi>England</hi> from a dangerous blow offered
at it, by raising an Objection out of S. <hi>James</hi> against S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
then (because Christians are concerned neither to set, nor to leave
the holy Apostles at oddes one with another) going about to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them in an unsound way, to the prejudice of Religion it self; I
did lately on a just occasion frame a short Discourse for mine own
satisfaction, and for the instruction of others. For I conceive my
self, tho by many degrees inferiour to <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet in some measure
to lie under S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s double charge to him,<note place="margin">

what I have been sufficiently taught and assured of,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> to commit the
same unto faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Thus
far I allow Tradition of the faith once delivered to the Saints, tho
it be not infallible, unchangeable, and incorruptible, either by the
course of nature, or by the promise of grace to any particular Race
or Succession of men, yet to be a duty required of Ministers, and a
means to propagate the Truth; whether that delivery be transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by word of mouth, which is transient, or by writing, which is
permanent, as now I transmit, what I have received. For I count
it a special instance of Gods gracious providence to me, not onely
that I was born of a Parent eminent for Learning and Piety (the
Honour I owe my Father will free me from the guilt of vanity in
this modest celebration of his Memory) but also in this, that I was
well acquainted with his Doctrine, and particularly in this Head
concerning Justification, which he had discussed with a piercing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and explicated with a happie perspicuity; not leaning to his
own understanding, but after an examination of an innumerable
variety of Writers on this Argument, making the language of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in the common sense of the words the Rule of his Judgment
and speaking, that he might <hi>speak as the oracles of God.</hi> By this

In the year of our Lord 1640, <hi>April</hi> 19. he began in the course
of his Ministery to unfold that portion of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.
and in process of time, by Gods assistance accomplished his intended
explication of the entire Doctrine concerning Justification, with
that accurateness of Method, solidity of Reason, and elearness of
expression, which was usual to him in such a weighty Argument, and
very satisfactory to his judicious Auditors. The rude draughts of
his Meditations be kept by him, and they are yet extant. He was
urged often to publish them; but according to his modest declining
appearance in publike, he was averse from printing what he had
preached with a chearful freedom of speech. At last, not so much
the importunity of friends, as the love of Truth, which he pitied to
see not onely opposed by Old Adversaries, but also assaulted by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Enemies, and in danger to be smothered in a crowd of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled
Errours, qickned him to set upon a new Work, to recollect
his loose Papers, to revise his Notes, to new-model his Treatise, and
to fit it for the publick benefit of the Church to posterity. But the
Lord had measured his task and his time. An Ague, which turned
shortly to a violent and mortal Fever, was the messenger that sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
him, and diverted him from communicating his conceptions
to the Church,<note place="margin">A. D. 1654.</note> to the resigning of his spirit to God. This Piece, tho
unfinished, I cannot well permit to perish in the dust: And I publish
it now while I have opportunity, (for I am also hasting to the land
of forgetfulness) because I conceive it hugely useful to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and clearing of the Truth, to the determining of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
which would be easily resolved, if the sense of words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which men are apt to wrangle, were understood and agreed on,
and to the direction of the considering Reader in the way to a good
understanding in this Cardinal Point of Christian Religion. For
such is <hi>igneus vigor,</hi> the fiery temper, (as <hi>Virgil</hi> says) of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born
Soul, that a small hint given to an active nimble minde, is
like a spark falling on sulphury matter, which is sufficient to light a
Candle, or to kindle a Fire, for the enlightning and warming the
whole house. So this spark of doctrine communicated to receptive
understandings, and cherished with Meditation, may prove a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
introduction to a bright and lasting light of Truth. And it may
be accounted no small benefit, that the Author, who intended to do
more service for the houshold of faith, did (what his time allowed
<pb facs="tcp:63789:6"/>
him) out of the hard flint strike fire for others to make use of, and
to improve. But,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz.</note> some will be ready to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> mine
affection blindes and transports me. And tho my over-valuing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
for this Fragment may be justifiable by my Relation to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
yet I am both too nearly interested to judge <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sincerely
and impartially, and too meanly qalified, to sway other mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by mine estimation. I confess all this, and am so far from
presuming that I can any ways adde any lustre to my father of pious
memory, that I fear, lest this very Work of his be sullied, when it
is offered to the world by mine hands. I do therefore invite the
Reader onely by the assurance, that this was a Piece of his last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
and so having set up this Taper, I let it shine by its own
light. So much for the former Treatise, to which in good manners
I have given the precedence before mine own.</p>
            <p>And of the latter I shall say little besides what I have already
intimated. It was a proud Fancie and Motto of one, who being
raised from an obscure original, took himself to be the sole Engineer
and Artificer of his own Fortune,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30.</note> like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ascribing
his estate to his own Wit and Power for the erecting it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gave for his Devise in a Shield, a Spider in the center of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Web spun out of his own bowels, with this word, <hi>Mihi soli
debeo,</hi> insinuating that he was indebted to none but himself. I
am very far from the arrogancie and ambition of being deemed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or to have drawn out my little knowledge by my mine
own sole industry. Tho I acknowledge God to be the fountain of
wisdom, as he is <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> and therefore I desire to be
<hi>taught of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> yet it will not misbecome me to acknowledge that
my fathers instruction, in this point especially of Justification, was
the Conduit-pipe whereby I have derived what I now profess from
the holy Scripture. For upon the Word of God in Scripture, and
not upon the Tradition of my Father, (how learned soever, yet not
infallible) do I ground my Faith. But as it is a piece of ingenuity
to acknowledge by whom we profit in knowledge, so it is in me a
duty of filial respect to confess, that I am indebted to my Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for that excellent Observation, which was to me <hi>Indictum ore
alio,</hi> unheard-of from any other mouth, concerning the different
Questions or Cases in S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>James,</hi> which after him I have
now propounded as a fair way to reconcile the holy Apostles. And
<pb facs="tcp:63789:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
because this hath not been so fully and generally observed, it may
now also appear new to others, and on that score suffer contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Christianity it self at the first appearance was rejected for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
tho (as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says of it,<note place="margin">Aug. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. I. 22. c. 7.</note> and I may say the same of
this particular) it was <hi>Veritas nova consuetudini, non contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
rationi;</hi> it was a Truth new indeed to custom, but not contrary
to reason. I desire therefore the Christian Reader to be so just, as to
examine the Discourse with sobriety, before he cast it awaey with
scorn; and to be so civil, as to give me leave in an Age too ambitious
of latitude and liberty, to enjoy my desired freedom of adhering to
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and choosing such a way
of Reconciliation as preserves the Truth as well as Peace.</p>
            <p>But if any being sensible of some reflexion in my Discourse upon
his own Opinion, and impatient of controul, grow so froward, as
when he is unwilling to be convinced, and unable to convince me of
Errour, (I mean at least in the main matter of my Discourse) he
shall go about to raise dark and groundless suspicious against the
Author, and in stead of Reasons to disprove his Opinion, cast forth
Reproaches to disparage his person; I shall onely say of my Writings;
as <hi>Ovid</hi> did of his Verses,
<q>Judicio poterant candidiore Legi;</q>
they might have been read with a more candid judgement. One
Caution more I hope will be taken in good part, That the Reader
will not be so dis-ingenuous, as to endeavour to weaken the credit of
an Orthodox Doctrine of our Church, which hath no affinity with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
interests, because it hath been asserted by some, that have sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the seeds of Sedition and Schism among us; or to blast the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of his brother who maintains both the Doctrine and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philo Jud. Just. Mart. Origen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Greek Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
speak, with might and main, as occasion requires, because the
Schismaticks (some, not all) are of the same opinion in this point.
It were unjustly done, and would be unkindly taken, if any one that
holds some disputable point of Divinity in common with the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
should for that accidental concurrence in an Opinion, which is
out of distance from things of State and Government, be therefore
charged as teinted with the poysonous principles of Rebellion and
<pb facs="tcp:63789:7"/>
Regicide, wherewith the Schools of the Jesuites are deeply infected.
And it is yet more unreasonable, that the defence of an important
point of Christianity common to men of different Perswasions, be
wrested by a Dissenter to breed an ill opinion of the defendant; as
if he that defends the Justification of a sinner by Faith onely, must
needs be confederate with Rebels and Schismaticks, in denying obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and submission to the Powers sacred in Church and State,
which are Gods immediate Ordinances.</p>
            <p>But why do I (will some say) surmise that any man can or will
be so absurd?</p>
            <p>I wish heartily that none were, or be so. But I see too much of
this indirect dealing and foul play in the practice of Gladiatory. It
is enough, that I would (if possible) prevent the like collateral
strokes, when the contending for the Faith exposes me to danger. I
will detain my Reader no longer; whom I desire to receive with the
right hand, that which is offered with the right hand, and a hearty
prayer withal, that <hi>God give thee a right understanding in all
things.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> the undoubted Autor of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
tho he made use of another man, one <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
chap. 16. 22. for the engrossing of it, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi>
did <hi>Baruk</hi> for the writing out of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 4, 18. as he saith of himself, and
that qestionles most trulie, in regard of the rest
of his copartners in the Apostleship, that <hi>he laboured</hi> in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that his Office <hi>more abundantlie then they all,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 10. so in this particular employment of labouring to instruct
and edifie the Churches and faithful people, not onely that then
were, but that ar in being at this day, (for unto us are his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
now also beneficial, as-well as they were unto those that
then lived, and unto whom they were directed, being intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a more general good, Chap. 15. 4. 2. <hi>Petr.</hi> 3. 15.) by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to them, when he could not be personallie present with
them, the same may not without good ground be averred.
For we have twice as many more of his Epistles extant at this
day, I say not, then of anie one severallie, but then of all his
fellow-Apostles joyntlie put together, if that to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
at least be granted to be his, as by most it is deemed. And
yet that he wrote more then have come to our hands, it
seems evidentlie to appeer. Nor do I speak of those counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
ones that have ben thrust out under his name, those to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
which <hi>Jerome</hi> yet attributes too much unto; or that to
the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which <hi>Stapulensis</hi> hath inserted into the body
of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, grounding upon a mistake and mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63789:8"/>
of the Apostles words, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 16. But of one written
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> before that which we now generallie call the
First, himself makes expres mention, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. which were it
now extant, being written to an whole Church for direction
of their demeanure in matter of Church-discipline, would no
doubt be as Authentical and Canonical, as that to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
whether a Minister of the Gospel, or an eminent Christian one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
about a private busines, the reception of <hi>Onesimus</hi> his fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
servant.</p>
            <p>Now as this our Apostles Epistles are set before those of the
rest, <hi>James, Peter, John</hi> and <hi>Jude:</hi> so this to the <hi>Romans</hi> stands
in the front, or the first place of his, so disposed by those, who
at first gathered the Epistles, then commonlie had and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
together into one Volume, and digested them in that
order as now we have them, and which we finde to have ben
from time to time ever since generally observed. The reason
whereof I conceiv to have ben, not because it was the first that
the Apostles wrote: for as those that gathered together the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of some of the Prophets, so those that compiled the main
Body of these Epistles, did not observ that order in marshalling
of them wherein they were written; and it is justly deemed
from that passage, Chap. 15. 25, 26. that this Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
later then some of those that here ensu: nor yet do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
it to have gained this precedencie so much, as some other
have supposed, in regard of the pre-eminence and soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the place to which it was written, being at that time the
hed-Citie of the whole Romane Empire, and the seat of the
Emperors constant residence; but principallie rather in regard
of the eminencie and excellencie, yea deep profunditie of the
Mysteries of the Gospel, more fullie and largelie therein deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
then in anie other of them, I may boldlie say; what if
I should say, in all the rest of them, were they all put togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Ad we may hereunto, that the points herein discussed
and debated ar pursued and prosecuted with that nervositie of
argument and vivacitie of spirit, and the limbs and joynts of
the whole discours so aptlie knit togither and artificially rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into one another,<note place="margin">Jo. Picus <hi>Count of</hi> Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula.</note> that that noble Italian Earl so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

soundnes of judgement, that he was deemed the Miracle of the
Age he lived, in, is reported to have said, that all the humane
writings of lerned men &amp; great Schollers that ever he had seen
and read, seemed to him in comparison of this one our Apostles
Master-piece, as he esteemed it, <hi>tanqam scopae dissolutae,</hi> as it is
in the Proverb, but <hi>as besomes without bands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main Body of the Epistle divides it self into two
parts.</p>
            <p>The former part is Dogmatical or Doctrinal, spent mosdie
in opening, cleering and confirming the Doctrine concerning
the Redemption and Salvation of Mankinde by Christ. Chap.
1—11.</p>
            <p>The latter part is Practical or Parenetical, consisting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Rules and Directions for the ordering aright of a Christian
mans life. Chap. 12. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling the Doctrine of mans Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ, he layeth down and lays open,</p>
            <p>I. The principal parts and branches of it: to wit,</p>
            <p>1. Justification, whereby we are freed from the guilt of sin,
the condemning power of it, and stand reputed as just in Gods
sight. Chap. 1—5.</p>
            <p>2. Sanctification, whereby we are clensed from the filth, and
commanding power of sin, and have the image of God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again in us. Chap. 6, 7, and part of 8.</p>
            <p>3. Adoption, by vertu whereof we have right to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inheritance. Chap. 8. 13—16.</p>
            <p>4. Glorification, whereby we ar put in full possession and
fruition of it. Chap. 8. 17. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The original ground and root from whence all this
springs and hath its rise, Gods free Election and Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Grace and Glory, obviouslie propounded, Chap. 8. 29, 30.
purposelie prosecuted, Chap. 9—11.</p>
            <p>Now because those former are effects and fruits of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and as the root of a plant, and foundation of a fabrick, ly
usually out of sight under ground, but the shoots and branches
of the one, and the frame of the edifice with the other rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ground and offer themselvs unto view, so Election and
Predestination ly hid of themselvs, and cannot be descried and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63789:9"/>
discovered of us concerning our selvs save by their effects and
fruits; the Apostles according to the Rule, <hi>a notioribus inchoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
he begins with the former, that thereby as by streams is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
and flowing down from a spring we may ascend up to
the wel-hed, or as by tracing the cours and decurs of a river
running down into the Sea, we may be directed unto that brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and bottomles Ocean of Gods goodnes, from whence as
they had their first rise, so they ar to return and emptie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
into, his glorie being their ultimate end. Chap. 11. 36.</p>
            <p>Again, because the apprehension of guilt and wrath is that
which is wont most to affright men; nor can there be anie tru
peace or sound comfort of ought to a soul, until the discharge
thereof he obtained; the Apostle therefore in the first place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
of that Branch of Justification, whereby men may be
freed from and discharged of that guilt; and makes that the
first subject-matter of his Discours; having artificiallie linked
it to the later end and close of his Saluation; wherein he had
(as the manner of Orators is) endeavoured to insinuate himself
into the hearts and minds of those to whom he wrote this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
by declaration of his love and affection to them, that the
doctrine delivered in it might take the better with them. Chap.
1. vers. 7—15.</p>
            <p>Now the onelie means of Justification he affirms to be by
Faith in Christ, vers. 16, 17. which to cleer and confirm, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to shew that all mankind standing of themselvs guiltie
of sin in Gods sight, are therefore liable to wrath.</p>
            <p>This to make good, he divides the whole race of mankind
into two ranks, Gentiles and Jews.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the Gentiles he prooves that they ar so, from
the light of nature, reveiling a Deitie to them, and his wrath
against sin; the substance of his Law engraven in their hearts,
and the testimonie of their own conscience accusing them of the
breach of that Law, so that they carie about with them &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, both a Law whereby they ar to be tried, so that they
can not pretend ignorance, and a witnes, who when time shal
come, wil give in such evidence against them, that they shal not
be able to plead not guiltie. Chap. 1. 18. to 2. 16.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning the Jews, who would easilie yeeld it of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63789:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gentiles, but not of themselvs, who they deemed might be
sufficientlie cleered, either by the works of the Moral, or rites
of the Law ceremonial, he proves the self same, from those hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinnes that the writings of their own Prophets charge
them withal, Chap. 2. 17. to 3. 19. And the force of the Apostles
argument (not so commonlie observed) seems herein to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
that if sinne of all sorts were so rife and so rank among
that people, who had the greatest light to inform them of the
nature and haynousnes of sin, and the strongest means to courb
and restrain it in them, it must needs argu an universal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and depravation of mans nature, and a very sinful disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the whole race of mankind.</p>
            <p>Hence the Apostle inferres, drawing all that he had before
delivered to an hed, that the whole world, consisting, of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and Jew, stands guiltie of sin in Gods sight, Chap. 3. 19.
and consequentlie, that no man, be he Jew or Gentile, if he come
to be araigned, as a sinner at Gods Tribunal, and there tried
by Gods Law, whither written or inbred, can be justified by
his works, vers. 20.</p>
            <p>Thus having remooved the wrong means of the Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a sinner in Gods sight, he proceedeth to establish the
right. And that is by such means onelie as God out of his free
favor and grace hath assigned: now the means by God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
are the satisfaction to Gods Justice made by Christ with
his bloud, and Faith on mans part apprehending and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on him and it. Vers. 21—27.</p>
            <p>In prosecution whereof the Apostle layeth down the main
causes and means of Mans Justification.</p>
            <p>1. The contriving or designing cause, God, vers. 25.</p>
            <p>2. The procuring and producing cause, Christ, vers. 24.</p>
            <p>3. The purchasing or meritorious cause on Christs part, the
ransome paid, vers. 24. and satisfaction therby made with his
bloud, vers. 25.</p>
            <p>4. The instrumental cause on mans part apprehending him
and it, Faith, vers. 25.</p>
            <p>5. The impulsive cause of the thing done in general, Gods
free favor and meer mercie, vers. 24.</p>
            <p>6. The impulsive cause of doing it in this manner and by
these means;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63789:10"/>
1. The manifestation of Justice, vers. 26. on Gods part.</p>
            <p>2. The exclusion of Gloriation on Mans part, vers. 27.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29-31.</p>
            <p>There followeth lastlie hereupon in the words of my Text
the Main and Apostolical <hi>Determination</hi> of the Principal Point,
containing in it the Summe and Substance of all; and that <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qam
è cathedra,</hi> in a Doctoral manner, peremtorilie delivered, as
by necessarie and irrefragable consecution from the premisses
resulting;</p>
            <p>We conclude therefore that a man is justified by Faith without
the Works of the Law.</p>
            <p>In the opening whereof to proceed the more closelie and
cleerlie, and to remoov such rubs and scruples as we shall meet
with in the way, we shall take into consideration these fower
heds;</p>
            <p>1. What is ment here by the word <hi>Justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What <hi>Faith</hi> it is by which we ar said to be <hi>Justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. How by this <hi>Faith</hi> man is said to be <hi>Justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. How by <hi>Faith</hi> to be <hi>Justified without Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first of these, what is here ment by the word <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;</hi>
or what it is to <hi>Justifie,</hi> and how the word is here taken, I
shal in the first place examine, and endevor to remoov some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or meanings of the word given by divers, whom I conceiv
to be mistaken: and in the next place deliver and endevor to
assert what I take to be the right.</p>
            <p>Of those whom herein I conceiv to be mistaken, some there
are that give the word <hi>Justifie</hi> here a <hi>single,</hi> some that give it <hi>a
double sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the former sort, to wit, of those that give it <hi>a single sense</hi>
there are two <hi>classes</hi> or ranks.</p>
            <p>The one is of those, who would have the word <hi>Justifie</hi> here
signifie, to <hi>make reallie, inherentlie, habituallie, formallie just:</hi>
that which we commonlie according to the usual phrase of
Scripture ar wont to term, to <hi>sanctifie,</hi> or to <hi>make holie.</hi> For
<hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Righteousnes,</hi> and <hi>Sanctitie</hi> or <hi>Holines,</hi> taken in the
largest sense, (when not opposed either to other, or where not
distinguished either from other) seem both one and the same,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63789:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and signifie <hi>goodnes</hi> in general. as <hi>Job. 1. 1. Matth.</hi> 5. 20, 33.
and elswhere.</p>
            <p>Thus the Fathers of that <hi>Tridentine Councel</hi> or <hi>Conventicle</hi>
rather, after many windings and turnings, and ambiguous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
seem at length to pitch upon; when thus they conclude,
<hi>Session 6. de Justificat. cap. 7. Vnica Justificationis formalis
caussa est Justitia Dei, non qa ipse justus est, sed qa nos justos
facit, qa videlicet ab eo donati, renovamur spiritu mentis nostrae,
&amp; non solum reputamur, sed vere justi nominamur &amp; sumus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The
onlie formal cause of Justification, is the Righteousnes of God, not
whereby he is righteous, but whereby he maketh us righteous, to
wit, wherewith being by him endowed, we ar renewed in the spirit
of our mind, and become not reputed onely, but ar named and ar
indeed trulie righteous, receiving righteousnes each one in himself,
according to that degree, which the Holie Ghost imparts to each at
his pleasure.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore (whatsoever he or they
seem to say elsewhere) <hi>de Justificat. lib. 2. cap</hi> 2. maintains this to
be the meaning of the Councel there, <hi>Formalem causam justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis
esse justitiam inherentem: That the formal cause of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is inherent righteousness.</hi> And hence <hi>Suarez</hi> entituleth his
Books, wherein he debates the point of <hi>Justification,</hi> De Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione,
<hi>Of Sanctification.</hi> Hence that distinction so rife with
Popish writers, taken from that place of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>
before mentioned, and of which also <hi>Bellarmine de Justificat. l.</hi>
1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. concerning <hi>a first and a second Justification. Illa qa
ex impio justus, ista qa ex justo justior fit. A first, whereby a man is
of a bad man made good; a second, whereby he is of a good man
made better.</hi> The former whereof they say is done by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of grace inherent, the latter by exercise of such grace so
infused. Which indeed are no other but two degrees of that
which we usuallie, and more fitlie, term <hi>Sanctification,</hi> the one
the beginning, the other the growth and progress of it. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi>
1. 22, 23. and 2. 2 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>Now tru it is, 1. That it we respect the Notation or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the word <hi>Justifie,</hi> it should signifie <hi>to make just,</hi> as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
to make holie.</hi> But if we regard the common use of it, it
no more so imports, then as <hi>Sanctifie</hi> used of God, doth <hi>to make
holie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>magnifie</hi> in common use of speech <hi>to make great.</hi> And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63789:11"/>
it is the <hi>Ordinarie use</hi> of words, not their <hi>Original</hi> without it,
that must carrie it, and determine what they do import, and
how they ar to be understood.</p>
            <p>2. It is not improbable that the Hebrew and Greek words
which the Latine word <hi>Justificare</hi> (tho not found in any Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Author) and our English <hi>Justifie,</hi> verie rife with us, seem to
answer) are sometime, tho verie seldome, taken in Scripture for
<hi>to make</hi> a man <hi>inherentlie</hi> or <hi>habituallie just</hi> by a good qalitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
or wrought into him. so <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. the Hebrew word

               </gap> word for word <hi>Justificantes,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Pagnine</hi>
render it; or <hi>qi justificant,</hi> as <hi>Calvin; qi justificaverint,</hi> as <hi>Piscator.</hi>
that is, as he expounds it, <hi>crudientes ad justitiam; such as by
instruction bring men to righteousnes;</hi> or as our English hath
it, <hi>convert men to righteousnes:</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore is of the
mind that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in that place; tho being
terms of a divers notion, yet do design the same persons; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
also the former of them not passively or habituallie,
<hi>docti, sapientes,</hi> or <hi>intelligentia praediti,</hi> as some do, whom our
English following renders it, <hi>those that be wise,</hi> but as in an
active sens (which the form of it requires and the word <gap reason="foreign">

as <hi>Piscator</hi> also renders it, <hi>those that teach and instruct,</hi>
and by teaching and instructing <hi>make men wise,</hi> bring them to

               </gap> 
               <hi>sanctificetur,</hi>
seems to be taken in the like manner, whether the particle <gap reason="foreign">

rendred <hi>amplius</hi> as <hi>Piscator,</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> in his annotation, <hi>magis
ac magis,</hi> more and more, for the word wil admit either: the
whole series of the context seems to carrie it strongly this way,
<hi>He that deals unjustlie, let him deal stil unjustlie, and he that is
filthie, let him stil be filthie, and he that is just, let him stil be just,
or be more just; and he that is holie, let him be stil holie, or
more holie. Sanctitati amplius studeat, Piscat.</hi> as in way
of <hi>antithesis</hi> or <hi>opposition,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63789:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the term of <hi>Justifying</hi> or those answering it, is thus
used.</p>
            <p>3. It cannot be denied, but that some of the Antient Fathers
have expounded the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in some passages of this our
Apostle in the same sens that these men do. So <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in
his eighth Sermon on this Epistle, expounds it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>he that justifieth the ungodlie,</hi> that is, saith
he, doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>of ungodlie make him just.</hi> So <hi>Augustine</hi>
Ep. 120. c. 20. and <hi>in Joan.</hi> tract. 3. <hi>Qi justificat impius; hoc est, impio
facit pium. He that justifies the ungodlie,</hi> that is, <hi>of ungodlie makes
him godlie.</hi> And on Psalm 30. <hi>Serm. 1. Qis est qi justificat impium?
qi facit ex impio justum. Who is it, that justifies the ungodlie? he
that makes him of ungodlie just.</hi> And <hi>serm. 3. Si justificatur impius,
ex impio fit justus. If the ungodlie be justified, he is of ungodly made
just.</hi> Wherein howsoever, I suppose, they misse the right sens
of the word in that place, yet their meaning seems sound, to
wit, that where God pardons sin, there he purgeth it out too, and
that <hi>Faith</hi> infused <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> and enableth a man to live
righteouslie: and that everie justified person, is sanctified also.
so <hi>Chrysostom</hi> expreslie expounds himself in that place, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>That God is able
sodainlie not onlie to free a man from penaltie that hath lived in
impietie, but to make him righteous too.</hi> And <hi>Augustine</hi> in his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choate
Exposition of this Epistle; Venit gentibus justificatio fidei
in Christo, non ut qia justi erant crederent, sed ut credendo justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
deinceps juste vivere inciperent. Justification of or by Faith in
Christ came unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>not that they might believ because
they were just, but that by beleiving being justified, or made just,
they might thenceforth begin to live justlie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is a certain and undeniable truth indeed, that all tru
believers may be said to be <hi>Justified,</hi> taking the word <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
in that sens, wherein it imports <hi>habitual or inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes:</hi>
for all that ar <hi>Justified,</hi> are also <hi>sanctified, 1 Cor.</hi> 6.
11. and Christ is made as well <hi>sanctification</hi> as <hi>righteousnes</hi> to
all those that have interest in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Having <hi>the
Image of God</hi> consisting in <hi>tru holines</hi> and <hi>righteousnes</hi> reformed
and restored in them, <hi>Eph. 4. 23, 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10. And growing
up therein with growths of God, <hi>Eph. 4. 15, 16. Col.</hi> 2. 19.
Whence it is that <hi>Abel</hi> is called <hi>righteous Abel,</hi> Math. 23. 35.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63789:12"/>
and <hi>Noa a just man in his generation,</hi> or the age he lived in,
Gen. 6. 9. and Job <hi>a just man, fearing God and eschewing evil,</hi>
Job 1. 1. and Zacharie <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>just in Gods sight</hi> (sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelie
righteous, just there where God sees, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7.)
<hi>Walking blameleslie</hi> (not in some, and not in other some, but)
<hi>in all the commandements and Ordinances of God,</hi> Luke 1. 6.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Andradius</hi> a Papist and a stif maintainer of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Trent Conventicle,</hi> whereof also he was a member,
in his <hi>Orthodox Explications</hi> (as he entitleth his work) doth wel
observ, <hi>lib. 6. fol. 186. Diversae &amp; maxime disjunctae qesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
sunt, An ita se res habeat, &amp; utrum ex vocis significatione
concludi recte possit. They are two divers and far different qesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how the things themselves are, and what may be concluded
rightlie from the signification of a word,</hi> or what it is, that is
thereby intimated.</p>
            <p>Now that this cannot be the sense and meaning of the word
<hi>Justifie</hi> in this place, it is apparent enough.</p>
            <p>For 1. the qestion is here, how a man being a sinner, a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresser,
a wicked, an ungodlie one, may come to be <hi>justified</hi> and
discharged of his sins, and acqitted of them at Gods tribunal,
Chap. 3. 19, 23. and 4. 5. and 5. 6, 8. and the <hi>justification</hi>
here delt in consequentlie such a <hi>justification</hi> whereby may be
procured a discharge from the guilt of <hi>fore passed delinqencies,</hi>
vers. 25. But this cannot be attained or procured by such a
<hi>justification</hi> as they would have here understood, to wit, by
<hi>sanctification</hi> or <hi>inherent holines and righteousnes.</hi> For (to let
pas the defectiveness of it while we live here) have we never so
much of it, and do we never so much with it, it is no more all
then du <hi>debt,</hi> we ow it now to God, as well as formerlie we
did, <hi>Luk. 17. 10. Rom. 8. 12. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 6. And the payment
of one part of a debt wil in no reason discharge a man of the
non-payment of an other part; it would be a verie selie and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
plea for a tenant sued by his Landlord for the arrear of his
rent wherewith for manie yeers past he is behind hand, to plead
that he had some qarter or two begun now to pay him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
thence forward to do it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>justification</hi> here spoken of concerns the <hi>guilt</hi> of sin
and the removal of it, vers. 9. 19. as <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 12. Whereas
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63789:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such <hi>justification</hi> as they would have here entended, being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>sanctification,</hi> respects not the <hi>guilt,</hi> but the <hi>filth</hi> of
sin: the <hi>justification</hi> here spoken of is of <hi>acts</hi> of sin past, vers.
23, 24. <hi>sanctification</hi> is of the present inherent <hi>corruption,</hi> Ephes.
4. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>justification</hi> here handled is opposed to <hi>crimination</hi>
and <hi>condemnation,</hi> Chap. 8. 33, 34. Whereas <hi>sanctification</hi> is
no way opposed unto either of them, but to <hi>pollution, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>contamination,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. Heb. 9. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>4. The Apostle handles these two <hi>branches</hi> of mans <hi>restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from his natural condition apart. As he doth apparentlie
distinguish them elswhere. <hi>ye ar sanctified, ye ar justified,</hi> 1 Cor.
6. 11. so here he handles them distinctlie and severallie, <hi>justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
by it self, in Chap. 3, 4 and 5. and <hi>sanctification</hi> by it
self, in Chap. 6 and 7.</p>
            <p>And thus much may suffice for the removal of their notion,
who would have the word <hi>justifie</hi> here signifie, <hi>to make habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
or inherientlie just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Others would have the word <hi>justifie</hi> here to import nothing
els but <hi>to pardon, to remit, to forgive sin,</hi> and conseqentlie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>justification</hi> to consist wholie and entirelie in <hi>remission of
sins.</hi> This divers Protestant writers stiffie maintain, among
whom <hi>Piscator</hi> most directlie and largelie against <hi>Eglinus</hi> and
<hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Wotton</hi> in <hi>the second Book of the first part</hi> of his
prolix Treatise <hi>of Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tru it is, 1. that not onlie some of the Antients seem so
to say.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Bernard</hi> Epist. 190. <hi>Qid est ipsa (peccatorum remissio)
nisi Justificatio? What is remission of sinnes it self, but justification?</hi>
And manie Orthodox Divines of later times ar produced as
speaking somewhat to the same purpose, (see <hi>Wotton of Justif.
part. 1. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 3. 6.) who yet by their discourses elswhere seem
to have ben otherwise minded, however in eagerness of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that Popish Tenent of <hi>justification by inherent righteousnes,</hi>
sometime they so speak: nor doth the exclusive particle used by
them seem to intend anie more then to debarre and keep out
<hi>the collation of grace inherent</hi> or <hi>the exercise</hi> of it from having
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63789:13"/>
anie place or office allowed them in the <hi>justification of a sinner,</hi>
that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself ingenuouslie acknowledgeth of
<hi>Calvin,</hi> who is most of anie qoted and urged by the Patrones
of this Opinion as concurring therein with them. See <hi>Wotton</hi>
where above, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. throughout. And <hi>Bellarmine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lib. 2. Chap.</hi> 1. Who also himself in his <hi>disputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Penance, lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 10. hath let slip these words, the same
with <hi>Bernards</hi> above, <hi>Qid est peccatorum remissio nisi justificatio?
What is remission of sins but justification?</hi> and yet is far from
holding <hi>justification</hi> to consist wholie and entirelie in a bare <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is no les tru, that <hi>justification and remission of sinnes</hi> go
alwaies togither, and ar never sundred in Gods dealing with
those whom he accepts of and is reconciled unto in Christ, <hi>Act.</hi>
13. 31, 39. Chap. 3. 25. and 4. 7. And that both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the guilt of sinne.</p>
            <p>But yet that this cannot be the genuine meaning of the word
<hi>justifie,</hi> is as apparent, yea in some regard more apparent, then
the former.</p>
            <p>For 1. Neither the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> made use of in
the Greek Version of the old Testament, and from thence by
the Penmen of the New, to answer thereunto: (whereas in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
antient Greek Autors it is never found so taken but in a
far differing sense, as I have elswhere shewed at large) nor the
Latine <hi>Justificare</hi> framed to expres either of them, nor our
English term <hi>justifie</hi> drawn from the Latine, and in ordinarie
use with us, do ever so signifie, or ar ever so taken. For the
Hebrew of the old Testament, see <hi>Gen. 44. 16. Exod.</hi> 20. 7.

verie few, if anie, have escaped me, wherein the term of <hi>justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

and substitute weresoever you find the term <hi>justifie,</hi> insteed of it
<hi>pardon,</hi> where <hi>justification, pardoning,</hi> where <hi>justified, pardoned,</hi>
and see if in any of them so rendred anie fit or convenient
sense wil thence arise, yea, whether the notion in most of them
wil not be verie uncouth, and not inconvenient onlie but even
sensles and absurd. To instance in some few, (for to run over all
would be over-tedious) read we the words of <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
Gen. 44. 16. <hi>How should we pardon our selves?</hi> read we
<hi>Moses</hi> his of <hi>Judges,</hi> Deut. 25. 1. <hi>They shal pardon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
or <hi>guiltles, and condemn the wicked,</hi> or <hi>guiltie:</hi> read we <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
to God, Psal. 51. 4. <hi>That thou maist be pardoned; when
thou speakest. Jobs</hi> to his Friends, Job 27. 5. <hi>God forbid that I
should pardon you, till I dye:</hi> Christs of wisdoms children, Mat.
11. 19. <hi>Wisdome is pardoned of her children:</hi> those of his, Mat.
12. 37. <hi>By thy words thou shalt be pardoned:</hi> those our Apostles
concerning himself, 1 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my self;
yet am I not therefore pardoned:</hi> or concerning our Saviour,
1 Tim. 4. 16. <hi>Pardoned in the Spirit.</hi> Read, I say, these passages
thus (to let the rest pas) and you shall give them a sens clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
yea far differing from, and in some of them directlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the mind and meaning of the persons by whome
they were spoken. Herein therefore <hi>Andradius</hi> of whome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is in the right, and keeps within the bounds of truth,
when he affirms in his <hi>Orthodox explications,</hi> above mentioned,
<hi>lib. 6. fol.</hi> 185. That <hi>if a man examine all the places in Moses
and the Prophets, where the term of justification is used, he shall
scarce find anie</hi> (he might have said trulie, <hi>he shall finde none)
where pardon of sin is thereby signified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And its against reason, to reqire a term to be so taken in
this our Apostles discourse in such a sense, as it is no where
found used, either in holie Writ, wherein it so often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63789:14"/>
or in ordinarie speech, or in anie prophane writer.</p>
            <p>2. That the things themselvs ar divers and distinct eyther
from other, it is apparent. For it is an undoubted Axiome,
<hi>Qae subjecto differunt, inter se differunt. Those things that differ in
Subject,</hi> that is, the one whereof may be found in some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
where the other is not, <hi>are distinct and divers one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
But so it is with these two, <hi>remission of sin, and justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
for <hi>remission</hi> may be where <hi>justification</hi> is not; and <hi>justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
may be, where <hi>remission</hi> is not. If a man have wronged me,
I may <hi>forgive</hi> him, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Shimei, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. 23. and
yet not <hi>justifie</hi> him in his dealings, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 8, 9. And where
a man is falslie accused of wrong done to another, there may he
be <hi>justified,</hi> and yet nothing <hi>remitted,</hi> because no wrong at all
done: so <hi>Deut. 25. 1. Psal.</hi> 51. 4. Yea in Gods dealing with
the Sonnes of men, tho in regard of a mans state and condition
in general, he never <hi>remittes sin,</hi> where he doth not <hi>justifie;</hi> yet
in regard of some particular acts, he <hi>remittes</hi> sometime, where
he <hi>justifies</hi> not. <hi>Psal. 78. 37, 38. Tho their heart was not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with him,</hi> (their semblance of repentance was but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
not sound and sincere) <hi>yet out of the abundance of his
compassion he forgave their iniqitie, and destroyed them not.</hi> So far
forth remitted it, as not instantlie to destroy them for it. And
sometimes he <hi>justifies</hi> where he <hi>remittes</hi> not, as he did in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of <hi>Phineaz</hi> his act as a just and righteous deed, <hi>Psal.</hi>
106. 30, 31. And as he is said to <hi>justifie</hi> the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in
the discharge of his Ministrie, <hi>Esay</hi> 50. 8. Yea, wil you see a
manifest difference between these two, by an instance, that
may make it plain to the meanest capacitie. A partie offends
and wrongs his Neighbor, who therefore intends or attempts
to follow the Law against him: if now upon the Parties own
submission and bare acknowledgement of his offence, or at the
mediation and entreatie of some common friend to them both,
the Partie offended is content to let fall his suite, and doth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
forgive the wrong; here is <hi>remission,</hi> but no <hi>justification.</hi> And
if by his Heir or Executor after the wrongeds decesse the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
who did the wrong should be qestioned for it, he could not
stand upon his <hi>justification,</hi> he could onelie plead his <hi>pardon.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63789:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Again, say a man have wronged his Neighbor, but hath made
him ful <hi>satisfaction</hi> for the wrong done him, or if not able to
do it himself, hath procured some frend to do it in his behalf,
and the Partie wronged having accepted thereof, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>remit</hi> it and seeks no further remedie against him for it,
here the Partie that did the wrong, if he should at anie time
after be qestioned for it, he may stand upon his <hi>justification,</hi> and
plead <hi>not guiltie,</hi> because he can plead <hi>satisfaction</hi> made and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
and this latter, not the former, is the verie case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man in <hi>the justification of a sinner: satisfaction</hi>
is the main ground of the <hi>justification</hi> of him, not made by him,
but by Christ for him. So even the Papists themselvs in this
regard sounder then the <hi>Socinians.</hi> Bellarmine <hi>de justificat. lib.</hi>
1. <hi>cap. 2. Est hoc loco breviter annotandum, Christum non esse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam
justificationis meritoriam, qasi Pater in gratiam sllii nobis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata
dimiserit, qomodo saepe reges in gratiam amicorum potentium
reos absolvunt; sed qoniam pretium redemptionis exactum persol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,
&amp; ex rigore justitiae pro nostris omnium sceleribus satisfecit.
This is</hi> (saith he) <hi>breiflie to be here observed, that Christ is not the
meritorious cause of justification, as if the Father in favor of the
Sonne did forgive us our sinnes, as Kings oftentimes assoil guiltie
Persons out of favor to, and at the suit of frends; but because he
hath paid an exact price of ransome, and thereby in rigor of justice
made satisfaction for the wickednesses of us all.</hi> What could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Protestant writer say in this point more? And <hi>Calvine</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
manie other) albeit that manie parcels and long passages
ar produced out of him, from those places, wherin he bends
his discours against the former conceipt of <hi>justification</hi> consisting
in <hi>an infusion of habitual and inherent holines,</hi> as if he restrained
it unto, and would have it wholie consist in <hi>a meer pardon,</hi> and
<hi>bare forgivenes of sin;</hi> yet he places it, where he speaks his
mind out more expreslie, in such an absolution as is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a full satisfaction intervening. For so he speaks in his
<hi>Institutions, lib. 3. cap. 11. Sect.</hi> 3. entreating of that place,
Act. 13. 38, 39. <hi>Vides post remissionem peccatorum justificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
hanc velut interpretationis loco poni; vides apertè pro absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
sumi; vides operibus legis adimi; vides merum Christi bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63789:15"/>
esse; vides fide percipi; vides deniqe satisfactionem inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni.
You see,</hi> saith he, <hi>after remission of sinnes</hi> mentioned, <hi>that
this justification</hi> (to wit, such as we maintain, not such as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
writers manie of them would have ment) <hi>is by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
put; you see it is manifestly taken for absolution; you
see it is taken away from the works of the Law; you see it is a meer
benefit of Christ; you see lastlie that satisfaction is interposed.</hi>
Which last clause they do not well to clip off, who among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other, cite this place also of <hi>Calvine</hi> as patronizing their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
which we here oppose, in that point. And in the same
place, <hi>Justificare, nihil aliud est, qam eum qi reus agebatur, tanqam
approbata innocentia à reatu absolvere. To justifie is no other, then
to assoil the partie qestioned from guilt, as approved innocent, or
guiltles,</hi> which is another matter then meerlie to pardon. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this difference a slight matter or of light weight, and
unworthie much regard, since that herein <hi>Socinus</hi> states the
Controversie between the Orthodox Divines, and himself with
his adherents, in his <hi>Theological Prelections, cap.</hi> 15. thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>Qaeritur utrum in justificatione nostra per Christum, peccata
nostra compensatione seu satisfactione aliqa deleantur, an vero re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missione
&amp; condonatione. pleriqe satisfactione interveniente id fieri
arbitrantur; nos vero simplici condonatione. The qestion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our justification by Christ, our sins are done away by some
compensation or satisfaction, or by remission and condonation. The
most say this is done by satisfaction intervening; but we by simple
condonation.</hi> And the former way <hi>Calvine</hi> expreslie takes to,
where he delivers herein his mind more fullie.</p>
            <p>Thus having discovered and refelled the mistakes of two
sorts, who both give the Term of <hi>justification</hi> a single notion,
the one confounding it with <hi>sanctification,</hi> the other making it
all one with <hi>remission of sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to the examination of some others, who
amisse also (as I suppose) give it a double, or a complicate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
and of these also there are two divers parties.</p>
            <p>The former is of those that would have <hi>justification</hi> to consist
partlie in <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> and partlie in <hi>sanctification and the
renovation of the inward man.</hi> So the Fathers of the Councel
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63789:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Trent</hi> seem at least to determine, where they say, <hi>Sess. 6. c. 7. of
justificat. Est ipsa justificatio, non solum peccatorum remissio, sed &amp;
sanctificatio &amp; renovatio hominis interioris, unde homo ex injusto
justus fit.</hi> that is, <hi>justification it self is not onlie remission of sins,
but sanctification also and renovation of the inward man; whereby
of unjust a man is made just.</hi> And so <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also <hi>de justific.
lib. 1. cap. 2. Justificatio impii constat ex remissione peccati, &amp;
infusione gratiae. Justification consists of remission of sin, and infusion
of grace.</hi> Or as some others, <hi>remissione peccatorum &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusione
justitiae sive gratiae sanctificantis. In remission of sinnes
and infusion of righteousnes or sanctifying grace.</hi> And howsoever
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> charge <hi>Calvin</hi> with fraudulent dealing in his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
against the Doctrine of the Councel of</hi> Trent, <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Caussam Justificationis faciunt duplicem, &amp;c.</hi> that the
Fathers of that Councel <hi>make a twofold cause of Justification, as
if we were just, partlie by remission of sinnes, and partlie by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Regeneration.</hi> Yet the words of that passage above reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
seem to intimate no other: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself besides
what out of him before, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. of the same Book before
pointed to, terms <hi>remissionem peccati &amp; donum renovationis, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramque
partem Justificationis, Remission of sin, and the gift of
renovation, both parts of Justification.</hi> concerning which see
<hi>Wotton</hi> more largelie, <hi>de Justificat. part. 2. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 6.
Yea throughout the whole Chapter his main intendement is,
as himself propounds it, to prove, <hi>from Scripture, Reason, and
Autoritie, Justificationem non consistere in sola peccatorum remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
sed etiam in interna renovatione,</hi> that <hi>Justification consists
not in remission of sins onlie, but in inward Renovation also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tru it is, <hi>that in the restauration</hi> and <hi>restitution</hi> of man fallen
from God, and the <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>reconcilition</hi> of man unto
God, both these are done, both <hi>sin</hi> is <hi>remitted</hi> and the <hi>soul</hi> is
<hi>sanctified.</hi> But in neither of these (to speak distinctlie and
properlie) doth <hi>Justification</hi> consist, as hath of either ben shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if in neither severallie, nor in both of them joyntlie.</p>
            <p>2. Others, and those also of our own, would have <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
to consist, partlie in <hi>remission of sinnes,</hi> and partlie in <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of righteousnes.</hi> And I pass by that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63789:16"/>
in the place before mentioned cites out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> where having
charged him to have dealt fraudulentlie, as before was observed,
with those of <hi>Trent</hi> in saying they made <hi>a twofold cause of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
whereas they say elswhere that there is <hi>one onelie formal
cause of Justification;</hi> he retorts the charge upon <hi>Calvine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who howsoever in that place of his <hi>Antidote</hi> he affirm,
<hi>Vnicam &amp; simplicem esse Justificationis caussam, that there is
one onlie single cause of Justification;</hi> yet elswhere, to wit, in
his <hi>Institutions, lib. 2. cap. 11. sect.</hi> 2. doth in expres words
affirm, <hi>Justificationem in peccatorum remissione ac justitiae Christi
imputatione positam esse;</hi> that <hi>Justification consists in remission of
sins and imputation of Christs righteousnes.</hi> Which form of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manie others of our besides him use. But <hi>Calvines</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not as the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would have it, that these were <hi>two</hi>
several <hi>causes,</hi> or two distinct <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> remission
of sinnes, and imputation of Christs righteousnes; but he
joines these two together, as two <hi>argumenta consentanea,</hi> the
<hi>cause</hi> and the <hi>effect,</hi> the one being the ground and foundation
of the other. His words are these, <hi>Nos Justificationem simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
interpretamur, acceptionem, qa nos Deus in gratiam receptos
pro justis habet; eamqe in peccatorum remissione ac justitiae Christi
imputatione positam esse dicimus. We interpret Justification sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
or singlie, acception, or acceptation, whereby God accounts us for
just, being received into grace; and we say that it consists in remission
of sins and imputation of Christs righteousnes.</hi> Tru it is, that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
who also cites this place of <hi>Calvine,</hi> both in his Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>lib.</hi> 1. and in his <hi>Theses de partib. Justificat.</hi> tho he say,
<hi>Justificatio un<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ca est; Justification is but one;</hi> addes, <hi>sed ejus

(which <hi>Calvine</hi> sayes not) remission of sins and imputation of
Christs righteousnes, which latter he defines, <hi>ben<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ficium Dei, a
benefit of God,</hi> whereby he vouchsafeth, to account as ours
Christs obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby he sustained the pains of sin
for us, even as if we had sustained the same our selves. which
words of his implie that imputation to be rather the ground,
then anie part of <hi>Justification.</hi> Leaving <hi>Calvine</hi> therefore, and
those that use the like expressions; we shall applie our selves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63789:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the present onelie unto those, who make remission of sins,
and imputation of righteousnes two distinct parts of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So <hi>Ludovicus Lucius</hi> in his <hi>Christian Theologie, Justificatio
est tum peccatorum <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, atqe
ab ipsis praestita esset. Justification is both remission of sins, and
imputation of righteousnes; that, whereby God pardons all the
sins of beleivers for the satisfaction made by Christ for them, as if
they had never sinned; this, whereby unto those that believe he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
and accepts the perfect holines and righteousnes of Christ, as
if it were in them, and had been performed by them.</hi> Yea thus
beside others not a few, Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> of <hi>Justification, lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>cap. 4. sect.</hi> 16. but with some difference from those other,
<hi>There ar two parts of Justification; the one the absolving from
the guilt of sin and damnation; the other the accepting of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving
sinner as righteous unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tru it is, that wheresoever God <hi>justifies a sinner</hi> in
and for Christ, there he <hi>remittes sinne,</hi> and there he <hi>imputes
righteousnes,</hi> Act. 13. 38, 39. Rom. 4. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this exposition of the term <hi>Justification</hi> seems faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
as wel as the former: and that two ways.</p>
            <p>1. With the most of them, it draws <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> into
the verie nature of <hi>Justification;</hi> whereas <hi>remission of sinne,</hi> is a
divers and distinct thing from <hi>Justification,</hi> as hath formerlie
ben shewed; and therefore no part of it.</p>
            <p>2. With them al, it presumes in the matter of <hi>Justification</hi> a
needles twofold act, the <hi>not imputation of sinne,</hi> and the <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of righteousnes,</hi> as two distinct things; whereas <hi>not to
impute sinne</hi> in consideration of <hi>satisfaction</hi> made for it, is no
other thing then <hi>to impute righteousnes</hi> to the Partie therein
concerned. Since that a man can not be deemed or doomed
<hi>guiltles</hi> or <hi>faultles,</hi> but he must of necessity be deemed or doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>just</hi> or <hi>righteous;</hi> there being no <hi>medium</hi> or middle state be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63789:17"/>
a delinquent or a guiltie person and one guiltles or just.
He that can proov himself no delinquent, but free from fault,
must of necessity be justified, acqitted and assoiled as just. See
<hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1. If nothing but sinne can make a man unjust,
then surely the utter absence of sinne must necessarilie make a
man just. See <hi>Pauls</hi> plea, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 8.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have endevored to shew, what <hi>to justifie,</hi> as the
Apostle here takes it, and as the word is most commonlie used,
is not: we now pass on to shew what it is, and what indeed it
properlie imports.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Justifie</hi> therefore (as our writers do generallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Papists maintain) is <hi>forense vocabulum, a term taken
from Courts of Justice,</hi> and <hi>courses</hi> or cases <hi>of judicature,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
plainlie from <hi>Deut. 25. 1. 1 King. 8. 32. 2 Chron. 6. 23.
Psal. 82. 3. Prov. 17. 15. Esay</hi> 5. 23. and 43. 9. And it is
an act either of the <hi>Partie</hi> himself qestioned, or of his <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
or of the <hi>Jurie,</hi> or of the <hi>Judge,</hi> or of them all. Of the
<hi>Partie</hi> himself, when he pleads <hi>not guiltie,</hi> and stands upon his
<hi>defence,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 8. of the <hi>Advocate,</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
and maintains his Client to be <hi>not guiltie,</hi> as the convert
theif pleaded for Christ on the Cross, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 42. of the <hi>Jury,</hi>
when they give in their verdict in behalf of the Party accused
as not <hi>guilty,</hi> as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did in the behalf of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 23.
9. of the <hi>Judge,</hi> when he pronounces him <hi>not guiltie,</hi> and so
cleeres and <hi>assoiles</hi> him, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 14,
15. the <hi>Advocate</hi> justifies by <hi>pleading</hi> and <hi>defending</hi> as not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
the <hi>Judge</hi> by <hi>pronouncing</hi> and <hi>sentencing</hi> as such. and to
<hi>Justifie</hi> conseqentlie, in a judiciarie way, is to <hi>discharge from
guilt of</hi> sin, <hi>or declare free from it,</hi> either by <hi>defence,</hi> as an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
or by <hi>sentence,</hi> as <hi>a Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hence the term of <hi>Justifyeng</hi> is taken, and used out of
such solemnities, applied to other proportionable acts, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
stil its proper and genuine notion, even the same that
in those set and solemn courses and cases it had. Thus a man
is said to <hi>Justifie</hi> himself, when he stands upon his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and maintains his own faultlesnes and integritie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as charge him with ought amisse. So <hi>Job 27. 5. Luk.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63789:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
16. 15. John</hi> 8. 46. and others, to <hi>justifie</hi> a man, when they
stand in defence of him, and maintain his honestie and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
against those that qestion it, and either doubt of it or
denie it. So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 4.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Justifie</hi> then in general is <hi>to defend, or cleer, acqit</hi> or <hi>assoil
from fault or guilt, from desert of blame or penaltie,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qentlie

               <hi>you would make me a theif,</hi> or, <hi>you would make me a lier,</hi> that is,
you would aspers me with, or fasten such an imputation upon
me. as <hi>John</hi> sayes, of him that beleives not God, that <hi>he makes
him a liar,</hi> in not giving credit to him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. and, <hi>you
would fain make such an one an honest man;</hi> when our meaning
is, you would proov, or approov him, as such. so that as to
<hi>sanctifie</hi> when it is spoken of God, <hi>Esay</hi> 8. 13. is not to <hi>make</hi>
him <hi>holie,</hi> as he doth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. but to <hi>acknowledge</hi> him
so to be; and <hi>to glorifie him,</hi> Psal. 50. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. is not to <hi>make</hi>
him <hi>glorious,</hi> as he doth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. but to <hi>acknowledge</hi> his
<hi>glorie,</hi> and <hi>ascribe glorie</hi> to him; and <hi>to magnifie,</hi> is not to <hi>make</hi>
him <hi>great,</hi> but to <hi>acknowledge</hi> and set forth his <hi>greatnes,</hi> Psal.
34. 3. So <hi>to justifie</hi> is not to <hi>make just,</hi> but to <hi>declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
just.</hi> and as a mans <hi>righteousnes</hi> is said to be <hi>taken from</hi>
him, when he is <hi>censured</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> as unjust, tho he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so just, nor be anie whit the les just, because unjustlie so
deemed or doomed, <hi>Esay 5. 23. Job</hi> 27. 5. In a word, as a

he is <hi>convicted</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> as such; so is the <hi>righteous or

<hi>of the Spirit and Letter, Chap.</hi> 26. discoursing of that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the Apostle, Rom. 2. 13. <hi>Not the hearers of the Law,
but the doers of it shal be justified,</hi> he tread a while in his wonted
track, yet after some forced and far-fetcht expositions given
of the words, at length he pitcheth upon this; <hi>Aut certè ita
dictum est, Justificabuntur, ac si diceret, justi habebuntur, justi
deputabuntur; sicut dictum est de qodam, ille autem volens se justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficare,</hi>
id est, <hi>ut justus haberetur &amp; deputaretur. unde aliter dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
Deus sanctificat sanctos suos; aliter autem, sanctificetur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
tuum, nam illud ideo, qia illos ipse facet esse sanctos, qi non
erant sancti; hoc autem ideo, ut qod semper apud se sanctum est,
sanctum etiam ab hominibus habeatur. Or certainly it is so said,</hi>
they shall be justified, <hi>as if he should say, they shall be accounted,
they shall be reputed just; as it is said of one,</hi> he willing to justifie
himself, Luk. 10. 29. <hi>that is, that he might be counted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
righteous. Hence it is otherwise said,</hi> God sanctifies his
Saints, <hi>and otherwise,</hi> sanctified be thy name, <hi>for that therefore
because he makes them to be holie, who before were not holie; but
this therefore, that that which is alwaies holie of it self, may also of
men be accounted holie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the word <hi>Justifie</hi> is to be here so taken, appears</p>
            <p>1. From <hi>vers.</hi> 19, 20. for what is there taken from and
denied unto <hi>works,</hi> is here attributed and ascribed unto <hi>faith.</hi>
But of <hi>works</hi> it is there said that by them <hi>no man living can
plead not guiltie,</hi> or <hi>be assoiled at Gods tribunal.</hi> And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore must by necessarie conseqence be that by <hi>faith</hi>
they may.</p>
            <p>2. From <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 33. Where <hi>Justification</hi> is opposed to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation</hi>
or <hi>crimination,</hi> that is, <hi>charging</hi> a man with guilt, and
<hi>condemnation,</hi> or passing sentence against him thereupon, the
place taken from <hi>Esay</hi> 50. 8. and <hi>Justification</hi> therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seqentlie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63789:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a <hi>discharge</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Howbeit because <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> is by so manie said either
to be the verie same with <hi>Justification,</hi> or to be at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, I shall endevor further to shew what neer affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and necessarie connexion these two free gifts of God have
in the work of mans <hi>redemption</hi> and <hi>reconcilement</hi> to God,
and yet how they are distinguished the one from the other.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Remission of sinne,</hi> tho it be not the same with <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
yet is it a necessarie conseqent of efficacious <hi>Justification
grounded upon satisfaction tendred and accepted, made and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
For as one that hath done a wrong can no way now
be justified, but by making full <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the Partie wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the wrong that he hath done, and the offence that he hath
committed: So when such <hi>satisfaction</hi> is made &amp; accepted, and
the Partie that did it in regard thereof <hi>Justified,</hi> that is, thereby
thereof discharged; reason and eqity reqires that the <hi>offence</hi> be
<hi>remitted,</hi> that is, that the Partie wronged cease now to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with him, whome he was justlie offended with before.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Remission</hi> simplie and nakedlie considered in it self, is
a work of <hi>mercie</hi> or <hi>favor</hi> onlie: whereas <hi>Justification,</hi> to
speak properlie, is a work of <hi>Justice,</hi> Deut. 25. 1. Psal. 82. 3.
yea in the same act, where upon <hi>satisfaction</hi> in some other kind
is from a stranger admitted in the behalf of the delinquent, the
wrong is remitted, tho it be a point of <hi>favor</hi> and <hi>mercie</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of him to whome it is done, yet it is a point of <hi>Justice</hi> in
regard of him for whome it is done. if it be done at entreatie
and intercession onlie, it is meer <hi>mercie</hi> and free <hi>favor</hi> in regard
of either; but then, to speak properlie, there is no <hi>Justification;</hi>
if it be done upon a <hi>price</hi> paid, or valuable consideration per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
by a third Partie, it is a matter as well of <hi>Justice</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the one, as of <hi>mercy</hi> and free <hi>favor</hi> in regard of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is not then a naked or bare <hi>remission,</hi> but <hi>justification</hi>
properlie so tearmed. And this is the case of <hi>mans justification</hi>
for the <hi>satisfaction made by Christ.</hi> Whence that of <hi>Bernard,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratis hoc qoqe praestitum est: sed gratis, qod ad te attinet; nam
qoad Christum, non gratis salvus factus es pro nihilo, sed non de ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilo
tamen. This also</hi> (to wit, the work of thy <hi>redemption)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63789:19"/>
was freelie performed. but freelie, so far as concerneth thee; for
in regard of Christ, not freelie. thou art saved for nothing, but not
saved with nothing:</hi> for nothing laid down by thee; but not
without a price paid by him.</p>
            <p>For as for that which a learned Writer of ours hath of a <hi>Judge
or Ruler,</hi> upon some weightie considerations known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>remitting the penaltie of the Law, and so discharging a guiltie
Person as if he were innocent and righteous, not according to Law
and Justice, but out of a soveraign and absolute power;</hi> as if that
were the right meaning of the term of <hi>Justifyeng</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
discourse, it cannot hold here.</p>
            <p>For 1. the <hi>Justification</hi> here treated of, is such a <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
as wherein there is a special <hi>manifestation of Gods Justice,</hi> vers.
26. whereas in such case (which in plain terms is no other
then meer pardon) there may be an ample <hi>declaration of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
but no such demonstration of justice at all. nor doth that
bear anie weight at all with me, which a late Annotator of no
smal note doth largelie discourse upon the Apostles passages in
this place, wherein he would have the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
here not <hi>strict justice,</hi> but <hi>moderation, eqity, grace and mercie
in pardon of sinne;</hi> and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>or just,</hi> conseqentlie, as it
is here given unto God, to import a <hi>merciful and charitable</hi>
person; and to be taken no otherwise, then as it is given to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
Mat. 1. 19. where it is said of him, that being <hi>a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
that is, <hi>a pious and merciful</hi> man, he was unwilling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or subject <hi>Marie</hi> to publick and shameful punishment, to
execute the rigor of the Law upon her, or to urge it against
her: affirming withal for the better support of this Paradox,
which <hi>Socinus</hi> had broached before him in his Treatise <hi>de
Christo servatore, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 1. as a thing worthie the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the word <hi>seldome</hi> in these books (the writings of the
New Testament, I suppose he means) <hi>if ever,</hi> belongs or is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the act of <hi>Vindicative or punitive justice.</hi> All which is
apparentlie cross to the main intent and scope of the Apostle;
which is, as <hi>Cajetane</hi> also wel observes, to shew, that in the
justification of a sinner, <hi>concurrunt gratia Dei &amp; justitia Dei,</hi>
both <hi>the grace or free favor of God, and the Justice of God</hi> also
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63789:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>concur; for it were grace alone, if God should remit or pardon sin
without payment; which God</hi> (saith he) <hi>never did nor doth;</hi> but
<hi>gratiae suae inserit justitiam suam, he riveteth into his grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
his justice; and this his justice consists in the redemption or ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,</hi>
that is, <hi>the price that Christ paid to set us free. And the
Scripture therefore saith not that we are justified by grace alone, but
by grace and justice together, and both of them of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it seemes to me verie strange, that this learned man
should say that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>or just</hi> should in these bookes
be <hi>seldome</hi> or <hi>never</hi> ment of <hi>punitive justice.</hi> For the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
himself acknowledges that the word of <hi>Justifying</hi> here is <hi>a
juridical term,</hi> and <hi>as in juridical proceedings, so here there is a
Judge, a Client, and a Law,</hi> and that <hi>the Judge here is God: now
a Judge</hi> is called <hi>a just or righteous Judge,</hi> not in regard of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favor, or moderation and mercie, but in regard of doing
<hi>Justice</hi> eqalie and indifferentlie, according to the strict <hi>right</hi> of
each ones cause that comes to be tried before him. and <hi>Justitia
forensis,</hi> that <hi>Justice</hi> that is exercised in Courts and courses of
<hi>judicature,</hi> is as well <hi>absolutive</hi> as <hi>punitive,</hi> that is, consists as wel
in <hi>acqitting the guiltles,</hi> as in <hi>condemning the guiltie,</hi> Deut. 25. 1.
and <hi>Justice</hi> is the same in either; and that Gods Justice doth
as well appear in the acqitting us for Christ, as in exacting a
payment for us from Christ, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 7. Albeit the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or righteous, and its conjugates, is not verie freqentlie
found in the writings of the New Testament applied to <hi>Courts
and courses of judicature,</hi> because seldome occasion to entreat of
them, nor are they over-frequentlie attributed to God, as a
<hi>Judge,</hi> and to his <hi>judgement,</hi> yet where they are, it is apparent
enough, that they have an eye to <hi>retributive justice,</hi> consisting
in the <hi>assoiling of the guiltles</hi> and <hi>doing Justice upon the guiltie.</hi>
To such manner of <hi>judicature</hi> had our Saviour Christs words
qestionles respect (tho directed to <hi>private judgement</hi>) and not to
anie favorable or eqitable compliance, when he said to his
hearers, <hi>John 7. 24. Judge not according to sight or outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
but Judge <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, just or righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Yea, when of himself and the <hi>judgement</hi> that he wil in
his appointed time execute, he saith, <hi>John 5. 30. As I hear, so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63789:20"/>
I judge, and my judgement is just.</hi> Which place the Annotator
himself expounds, as <hi>of saving those that believe on him,</hi> so
of <hi>damning those that reject him.</hi> And what other sens can the
word bear in those passages of Gods people in the Apocalypse,
but of <hi>vindicative and punitive Justice,</hi> when praising God for
avenging them on their cruel Persecutors, they say, <hi>just and tru
are thy wayes,</hi> Rev. 15. 3. and <hi>just art thou, in that thou hast
judged thus.</hi> and <hi>tru and just ar thy judgements,</hi> Chap. 16. 5, 7.
and of Christ riding out furnished with his <hi>two-edged sword</hi> and
<hi>Iron Scepter,</hi> to execute vengeance on the Nations, and tread
the wine-pres of Gods wrath among them, <hi>he judges and
warres <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Justice,</hi> or <hi>with righteousnes?</hi> Chap.
19. 11. Let the Annotator consult himself on these places.
Or how can he with anie color of reason exclude such <hi>Justice,</hi>
from his own exposition of those words of the Evangelist,
1 John 2. 29. <hi>he is righteous;</hi> that is, <hi>Christ is a most just Judge?</hi>
which himself also expreslie inserts in the exposition of the
same term given to Christ, <hi>the just Judge, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. tho I
suppose there not so necessarilie, because the allusion is there ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>Judges</hi> or <hi>Triers</hi> at the solemn Olympick games, as
the Annotator also well observes. Yea, not to go far for such
use of the word, when our Apostle in this Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 32.
saith of the Heathen, <hi>who knowing</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
<hi>judgement or just judgement,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as it is termed Chap. 2.
5. <hi>of God, that those that commit such things ar worthie of death;</hi>
where it is apparent what <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Judgement</hi> is intended.
Again, where <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4, 5. he saith of God, citing <hi>Davids</hi>
words, Psal. 51. 4. <hi>that thou maist be justified;</hi> or as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
hath it, <hi>be just,</hi> that is, appear so to be; that the meaning is
of <hi>punitive Justice,</hi> as the drift of <hi>Davids</hi> speech plainlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates,
so the Apostle also sheweth evidentlie in his verie
next words, where the opposite term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used, <hi>is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
in taking vengeance?</hi> nor can the words be otherwise wel
expounded, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 28, 14. where the Apostle citeth a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
out of <hi>Esay</hi> 10. 21, 22. wherein God threatning to make
such a round reckoning with his people, that a poor remnant
should remain when the account was cast up, sayes he would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63789:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Prophet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>in justice</hi> or
<hi>righteousnes,</hi> as the Apostle, who also in the same Chapter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
whither there be anie <hi>injustice</hi> or <hi>unrighteousnes with
God,</hi> in dealing thus with the Jews. Lastlie, to conclude with
a most conspicuous place, the same Apostle, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5, 6. as
he calleth the <hi>judgement</hi> of God to be exercised in taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on the Persecutors of his people to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a just
judgement;</hi> so to proov it to be such, for that, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>it is a just thing with God</hi> so to do: which place how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Annotator contend not to be ment of the <hi>last Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical
judgement,</hi> yet he cannot denie to be spoken of <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
justice,</hi> which the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to give vengeance</hi>
or <hi>to take it,</hi> as we usuallie phrase it, do evidentlie in express
terms import. This exception and observation therefore is of
no force to weaken the received exposition of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, just or righteous in this place attributed to God, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a notion of <hi>retributive justice</hi> exercised in <hi>condemning the
guiltie</hi> and <hi>assoiling the guiltles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The justification of a sinner as it is here described and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
is such as is transacted and acted not by a meer <hi>soveraign
and absolute power alone,</hi> but in a <hi>legal way,</hi> and according to
Law. whence it is that the Apostle saith that thereby <hi>the Law
is not infringed or annulled,</hi> but <hi>established,</hi> vers. 31. and as our
Saviour himself speakes, not <hi>dissolved,</hi> but <hi>fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5. 17,
18. For the further clearing whereof, we ar to consider that
Christ in Scripture is termed not onelie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Mediator,</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. One that mediates and dealeth between God
and us, as a man may do between two persons, that ar at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
either with other, by persuasion and intreatie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of his interest in either, endevoring to compose the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between them, yet not engageing himself for ought to
either; but he is said to be also <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

nature, whatsoever could in Justice be reqired to that
purpose for their delinqencies and <hi>breaches of his Law.</hi> Hence
that of <hi>Esay 53. 6, 7. We all had strayed,</hi> had deviated from
the rule and directions of Gods <hi>Law;</hi> for that is the nature of
all sinne, 1 <hi>John. 3. 4. had turned aside</hi> each one <hi>to his own
way,</hi> betaking himself to some one wicked course or other, <hi>and
the Lord caused the iniqitie</hi> (that is, the guilt of our sin, as <hi>Psal.</hi>
32. 5.) <hi>of us all to meet on him. It was exacted,</hi> (as <hi>Junius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
renders it) <hi>and he answered,</hi> that is, undertook, engaged
himself, for the discharge of it; as a learned French writer <hi>Lewis
Cappel</hi> wel renders the word) yea he did reallie <hi>answer</hi> it, as we
use to say, of a partie or his suretie upon payment made, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
given, that <hi>he hath answered the debt.</hi> For the word
here used, even in the form here used, is taken in a notion of
<hi>answering, Ezek.</hi> 14. 3, 6. yea and that of a <hi>real</hi> kind of <hi>answering;</hi>
as by <hi>inflicting</hi> there, so by <hi>sustaining</hi> here; by taking vengeance
in the one place, by giving satisfaction in the other, either of
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by the term of <hi>payment,</hi> we ar wont to expres. Now where
<hi>ful satisfaction</hi> is made and accepted for the <hi>the breach or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of a Law,</hi> the Law is not thereby repealed or abrogated,
but it is rather thereby manifested to be firm and of force to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
those whom it concerns, either to the strict observation of
it, or to a just compensation in some kind or other made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
therein committed. and this hath our Saviour Christ in our
behalf exhibited. For howsoever I dare not run out so far as to
affirm as manie do, that our Savior suffered the verie self-same
torments, partlie in his Agonie and partlie on the Cross, that
the damned souls suffer, and those that have interest in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his sufferings, should have suffered in Hell; much les that he
suffered such an high degree of torments in those few how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
while he hung on the Cross, as did in the intension and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
thereof <hi>ad pondus</hi> for weight answer and was adeqate
unto all those penalties, made up into one Mass, and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in one lump, that unto all eternitie the whole multitude
of Gods elect, for all whose sinnes he satisfied, were to have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63789:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
endured, the power of his Deitie supporting and enabling his
humane nature thereunto: since that Christs humane nature,
in which the satisfaction was to be made, and was made, being
but <hi>a finite creature,</hi> could not be capable of admitting such <hi>an
infinite weight</hi> of torment, as such a masse of <hi>endles suffering</hi>
must of necessity have amounted unto. albeit for the allay
hereof, that were allowed,<note place="margin">Dr. Feild of the Church, l. 5. c. 17.</note> which a learned man of eminent
parts from <hi>Picus</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> suggests, that unto the sinnes of
the penitent, because they are broken off by repentance, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
penaltie is not du: which yet seems to want sound ground
of proof from Gods word; wherein the Apostle speaking of
the sinnes of the faithful, who had now cast off the service of
sinne, saith in general, theirs not excluded, <hi>the stipend of sin,</hi> (or
the pay du to it, a militarie term) <hi>is death;</hi> and that <hi>eternal
death</hi> is intended, appeares by its opposite, <hi>everlasting life,</hi> said
there to be <hi>Gods Donative,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> wel renders it, being a
term of the like nature with the former, that is, his <hi>larges</hi> or
<hi>free gift:</hi> such as the Roman Generals besides their pay used
to confer upon their Souldierie: and tho granted would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
withdraw weight enough, to make a finite creature capable
of it within so narrow a stint of time, as some <hi>three howrs</hi>
could make up. I conceiv, that keeping our selves within the
bounds of Christian sobriety in this profound mysterie, we may
safely say, that Christs humiliation through the whole cours of
his life, and his sufferings as wel in Soul as in Bodie, in his
whole humane nature consisting of both neer upon his death,
together with his death in that manner inflicted and sustained,
the eminencie of the person being even God as wel as Man,
that was content to expose and abase himself unto al this, <hi>Phil.</hi>
2. 6-8. being duelie weighed, was such and so great as God
deemed in <hi>Justice eqivalent</hi> unto, and wel worthie to weigh
down, whatsoever was reqisite to the discharge of the debt of
all those that had interest therein. For as for that which the
same Autor subjoins, and some other also have therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with him, that the <hi>worth and excellencie of Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
was onlie to make the passion availeable to manie, but was
not at all to dispens with the continuance nor the grievousnes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63789:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his pains; and that if it might dispens with anie degree of
extremitie of punishment due to sin, it might dispens also with
two, and so conseqentlie with all; seems to ty and stint Gods
justice to over-strict terms; and the worth and value of Christs
sufferings to such a precise rate, as their private estimation shal
deem fit to assign it. As on the other side they seem to raise it
to an higher estimate then there appears good ground for, and
to control <hi>Gods wisdome</hi> in the disposing the means of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>mans justification</hi> in such manner as he hath designed, and
in such a measure of sufferings and humiliations as he assigned
Christ to undergo, who stick not to affirm, that <hi>the least drop
of Christs bloud was of so infinite a valew, as was sufficient to
make a ful satisfaction to Gods Justice for the discharge of the
sinnes of the whole World.</hi> Which if it were tru, then the
bloud shed in the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of our Saviour had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to have answered <hi>Gods Justice,</hi> and to have made a ful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
to whatsoever the law of God could in utmost rigor
have reqired on the part of all that had ever transgressed it.
And so all that Christ afterward either did or endured, and his
<hi>death</hi> it self the upshot of all had been superfluous and needles;
which how it will consist with the <hi>wisdome of God, and love to
his Sonne,</hi> I shall leave to be deemed by others of deeper reach
then my self. Howsoever Christ having of his own accord
become our <hi>suretie,</hi> and undertaken the <hi>discharge</hi> of our debt,
and it being at the choise of the Creditor or Partie wronged,
even according to Law to reqire <hi>satisfaction of the debt,</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the wrong</hi> done, either from the <hi>Debtor</hi> and <hi>delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
himself, or from his <hi>Suretie,</hi> as it is a favor and mercie in
God to forbear the exacting it of us, who were <gap reason="foreign">

against, but according to his <hi>Law,</hi> even that <hi>Law</hi> unto which
we were obnoxious for the breach of it, to exact of our <hi>suretie
a ful compensation</hi> for all our transgressions.</p>
            <p>In a word, that <hi>Justification is an act of Justice</hi> and not <hi>a
matter of free favor or meer mercie</hi> alone, appeers evidentlie from
the verie term to <hi>Justifie,</hi> whence it is deduced, whither we
consider it, in its native notion, or in its ordinarie use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63789:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For 1. In its native notion and proprietie the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

               </gap> in Greek, as also whatsoever term we
can frame in Latine or English to answer in anie du analogie
unto either of these two, it doth and must include a notion of
<hi>Justice</hi> in it. For howsoever we trulie affirm that neither of
those, the Hebrew or Greek term do necessarilie intimate
<hi>a making just,</hi> save in such sens as hath formerlie ben hinted,
and might therefore in Latine be rendred by the word <hi>justare,</hi>
derived from <hi>justus,</hi> in the same form and sens with <hi>probare</hi>
from <hi>probus,</hi> which signifies not to <hi>make allowed</hi> or <hi>sound,</hi> but to
<hi>proov</hi> or <hi>approov</hi> as such, as wel as by the word <hi>justificare,</hi> which
tho not found in the Antient Latine Autors, but framed in
latter times by Christian writers to express those Hebrew and
Greek terms, yet is now grown into common use, whereas that
other is not: yet as wel the one term as the other, will as those
it answers to be, bear in the forehed of it, a notion not of <hi>favor</hi> or
<hi>mercie,</hi> but of <hi>Justice</hi> and right. and it is not unworthie the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that howsoever the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in
the better sens for to <hi>assoil</hi> and <hi>acqit,</hi> yet among the Antient
Greeks (as I have elswhere evidenced and evinced) that term
was used onlie in the wors sens for to <hi>cast</hi> or <hi>condemn,</hi> and to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute</hi>
or <hi>punish,</hi> because in such cases <hi>Justice</hi> is presumed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at least to be done on persons so dealt with; and we shal
find the word therefore in Heathen writers not distinguished
onlie from <hi>pardon,</hi> but opposed thereunto, as in that cited by a
learned French Divine out of <hi>Dio.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63789:23"/>

we either say, or hear others say, <hi>You justifie your self;</hi> and <hi>You
justifie him,</hi> and, <hi>Ile justifie such an one,</hi> and the like. And to
say then that the word in this place and this discours is to be so
taken, without some good proof from the Text it self, is but
<hi>petitio principii,</hi> a begging of that that is at present in debate.</p>
            <p>I wil adde a few not unfit <hi>Considerations</hi> or <hi>Observations</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and so leave this hed.</p>
            <p>1. That we must distinguish between these two things, to be <hi>in
the state of Justification,</hi> and to be <hi>actuallie or occasionally justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To be in <hi>a state of justification,</hi> is to be <hi>in a justifiable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
when a man is so disposed, and the case stands so
with him, that he may be trulie <hi>justified,</hi> that is, he
may justlie be defended, maintained, assoiled, declared, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
discharged as not guiltie, as faultles upon anie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
or as occasion shal reqire: for there is not always
a present use or need of justification. As a man ought at al
times to be patientlie disposed, to be continuallie of a patient
disposition; but there is no acting or exercise of it, save upon
some special occasion. <hi>Patientiae in prosperis nullus est usus,</hi> saith
Gregorie, <hi>There is no use of patience in times of prosperitie;</hi> when
all goes with a man according to his own hearts desire. So tho
a man be, and it meerlie concern him so to be, alwaies, and at
al times, in <hi>a state of justification,</hi> in a <hi>justifiable condition,</hi> yet is
there no use of <hi>justification,</hi> until he be qestioned, and unles
somewhat be objected against him. To affirm a man to be
an honest, or a just, or a wise, or a lerned man, when no man
makes qestion of him, or averres ought to the contrarie, is to
<hi>commend</hi> him, not to <hi>justifie</hi> him; but when his honestie, or his
integritie, or his wisdome, or his lerning shal be qestioned or
controverted, doubted of, or denied, then to vindicate his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
integritie, wisdome, or lerning is to justifie him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
then a man may be said to be in a state of justification, even
when no such thing is, if he be so qalified as that it may be
justlie and trulie upon good ground done, when occasion shal
reqire. Thus God is always <hi>justifiable,</hi> because ever in all
things <hi>just, Psal.</hi> 92. 15. and 145. 17. But is then said to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63789:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>justified,</hi> when the <hi>Justice</hi> and eqity of his courses is qestioned,
<hi>Rom. 3. 4. Ezeck.</hi> 18. 23.</p>
            <p>2. To be <hi>actually and occasionally Justified,</hi> is for one upon such
occasions emergent, to be <hi>defended, maintained, approved, and
sentence passed</hi> in his behalf, against those, that shall charge
him with ought, <hi>Esay 50. 8. Rom. 8. 33. 1 King</hi> 8. 32.</p>
            <p>Thus then upon a mans entrance into the state of grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
right to and interest in the satisfaction made by Christ, he
is presentlie discharged of and freed from the guilt of all his
fore passed transgressions, and put into a state of Justification,
and he is so now disposed, it stands so with him, he is in that
state and condition, that he may be justified, whensoever occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof shal be, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 7. but then may God be said
actuallie or occasionallie to justifie such, when against Satans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
or wicked mens aspersions, he cleers them and gives
sentence against the calumnies of their Adversaries in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. he commended <hi>Job</hi> to Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 8. he
justified him against Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>2. That it is one thing to be <hi>made or constituted just,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing to be <hi>Justified.</hi> And a man who before was <hi>not
just,</hi> cannot trulie be <hi>Justified,</hi> unles he be first <hi>made or constituted
just.</hi> for</p>
            <p>1. Tho the word <hi>Justifie</hi> do not signifie in proprietie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use to <hi>make just,</hi> as hath formerlie ben shewed, yet a man
that hath done a wrong and is a delinquent, that he may be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
must be <hi>made just,</hi> not inherentlie <hi>just,</hi> for tho he were so,
yet were not that sufficient to cleer him from the guilt of his
fore passed unjust act. a man that hath played the theif, albeit
afterward he become formallie just, that is, tho by wholesome
advice and good admonition he be brought to repent of his
former thievish courses, and thenceforth become a new man, a
tru man; yet wil not that discharge him from the guilt of his
theft formerlie committed; but he must so be made just, that
is, guiltles and blameless, as that he may answer the rigor
of Law and of Justice, ere he can trulie be justified: (for it
is the guilt of the offence that Justification regards) and
this cannot be done but by a plenarie satisfaction for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63789:24"/>
wrong done and the offence formerlie committed, exhibited
and accepted. and this is that <hi>justice or righteousnes</hi> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
intimates, when he saith, that <hi>by the obedience of one</hi> (to
wit, of Christ) <hi>manie are made</hi> or <hi>constituted,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>just,</hi> or
<hi>righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. not formallie or habituallie, but relativelie,
in reference to the Law, and the guilt of sinne arising from it.

                  </gap>. Hence we gather, that Christ

Justice</hi> or <hi>righteousnes for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That which is exhibited whither by doing or suffring,
or both in way of satisfaction and so accepted, being such as
makes a plenarie compensation for an offence formerlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
because it utterlie extinguisheth and abolisheth the
wrong, so taketh it away, as if it never had ben; it justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a guiltlesnes, a blamelesnes unto the delinqent, in whose
behalf it is performed; and makes him therefore to be reputed
in the eye of Law and Justice, as now no delinqent, but as
guiltles, faultles and just: there being no medium between these
two just and unjust, nor between guiltles and just. see <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.
1. this guiltlesnes therefore is justlie termed justice; and the

may be trulie <hi>justified.</hi> and such guiltlesnes a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Christs satisfaction made to Gods Law and his Justice, makes
the partie unto whom the same is imputed, and who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
therein, trulie named and justlie deemed <hi>just,</hi> and to be in
the state of <hi>justification,</hi> or in a <hi>justifiable condition. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21.
and this is that, not the <hi>satisfaction</hi> it self, but the <hi>guiltlesnes</hi>
thereby procured, that is so oft in his argument termed <hi>justice</hi>
or <hi>righteousnes,</hi> called <hi>the Justice of God,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. and 3.
21, 22. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. not, as some, for that the <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
was made by Christ, who is God, but because contrived,
prepared, propounded, and appointed us by God, for God as
the partie wronged, and Christ as the partie satisfying, for the
wrong, are in this argument distinguished, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25.
and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21.</p>
            <p>3. That everie tru Christian hath a two-fold justice or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63789:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
righteousness; the one in reference to the guilt of sinne, arise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from transgression of the Law; 1 <hi>John 3. 4. Rom.</hi> 4. 15.
and 5. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56. the other in reference to the filth
of sinne, being a pollution and depravation of the Soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
it of that purity and integritie wherein at first it was
created, <hi>Matth. 15. 18, 19. 2. Cor. 7. 1. Eph.</hi> 4. 22-24. and that
these two are to be distinguished is apparent, for that divers
things and acts that do not in their own nature pollute or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file,
yet by a special Law prohibited, do in the use of them by
vertu of that inhibiting Law produce guilt. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of this latter justice or righteousnes, consisting in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from the filth of sinne, the faithful ar trulie and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
but imperfectlie just, or righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. and 9. 3, 15,
21. and 23. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 6. in regard or the former, consisting
in a freedome from the guilt of sin, they ar fullie, compleatlie,
perfectlie just or righteous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. the one is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
of sanctification, the other the righteousnes of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
that in this life at least, uneqallie shared; this eqallie
imparted to each, being in common accepted for and imputed
unto all. Whence that of <hi>Luther, AEqè justus latro in cru<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>4. That there is a twofold Justification,</p>
            <p>1. General, in regard of all sin whatsoever in general;</p>
            <p>2. Particular, in regard of some special or particular crime.
And a man that is just and justifiable in regard of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
offence, yet may not be justifiable in general. So <hi>Job</hi>
charged by his frends with gros hypocrisie, oppression and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
<hi>Job</hi> 22. 5-9. stands stiflie in justification of himself, <hi>Chap.</hi>
23. 10. and 27. 5. and yet in general acknowledgeth that he
could not be justified, nor answer for one act of a thousand,
should God cal him to a strict account, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 2, 3. and a man
that is unjust and cannot be justified in general, yet may be
just and justifiable in regard of some particular. So <hi>David,</hi> tho
in the general he declines Gods strict dealing in way of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 2. yet in particular, upon false im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63789:25"/>
cast upon him, he appealeth solemnlie thereunto, <hi>Psal.</hi>
7. 3, 4, 8, 9. and 38. 19, 20. yea the wickedest man in the
world, and the Devil himself, may thus be legallie just and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
justified, because in that particular guiltles, when some cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
act shall be wrongfullie charged on him, that was never
committed by him. But it is general justification, that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of and intended in this place.</p>
            <p>And thus we have endevored to shew what the word <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
doth preciselie denote in this place.</p>
            <p>The Use whereof brieflie may be;</p>
            <p>1. To inform us aright concerning the distinct notion and
nature of divers graces of God, that tho they be knit and linkt
one to an other, hang all on one string or chain, are all fruits
of Gods favor towards us in Christ, concur all together in and
with all those that are reconciled to God in Christ; yet are
things of a several and distinct nature and notion, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is one thing, Justification an other, and Remission of sinne a
third, as hath been shewed. And yet again so far forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
and qalifie the differences of divers of those that seem
to mistake, and misexpound the word here used, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this their mistake, they may not maintain anie
error therefore in matter of faith: onelie they use some words
and Phrases improperlie; and misexpound some places; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
say nothing but what is orthodox and agreeable to the
analogie of faith.</p>
            <p>Yea to remoov some groundles controversies between us and
the Papists, and cleer some mistakes and misunderstandings on
either side. while the Papists charge us to hold, that a man is
made formallie, habituallie, inherentlie holie and righteous by
Christs holines and righteousnes imputed unto us, as if a <hi>black-Moor,</hi>
saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. l. 2. c. 7.</note> were made white by casting a white
garment upon him, whereas we say no such matter. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he acknowledgeth, that, if when our writers say, that
Christs righteousness is imputed unto us, their meaning were
no other but this, that Christs merits are imputed unto us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ar given unto us, and we may tender them unto
God for the discharge of our sinnes, in regard that Christ hath
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63789:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taken upon him the burden of making satisfaction for our
sinnes, and of reconciling us to God his Father, they held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein but what is right; tho (saith he) the manner of
speaking that they use, is vetie seldome or never found either
in the Scriptures or the Antient Fathers. And the truth is,
that precise form of speaking can hardlie be found in Scripture;
nor is that justice whereby we ar said to be justified, called, as
we have observed, the justice of Christ; but the justice of God.
But yet the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> elswhere confesseth,<note place="margin">Lib. e<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. C. 10.</note> that Christ
is rightlie called our Justice, or Righteousnes, First, because
he worketh righteousnes in us: and secondlie, because he hath
made satisfaction to his Father for us, and that his satisfaction
he doth bestow on us, and communicate unto us, when he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
us, that he or it may wel be called our satisfaction, and our
righteousnes. For tho (saith he) by righteousnes inherent in
us, we ar trulie just or righteous, and ar trulie so termed; yet
do we not thereby make satisfaction to God for our faults and
for eternal damnation du thereunto; but both that inherent
righteousnes, and the remission of the fault and eternal penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereto du, ar the effect of Christs satisfaction, which as the
Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> saith, is in Justification bestowed on us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
unto us. Nor were it at all absurd on this wise to say, that
Christs righteousnes and merits are imputed unto us, since that
they ar so conferred on us and applied unto us, as if we had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
God our selves. Speaks he not as much as anie Protestant
doth, or can do, in this point? yea it may be somewhat more
then some will approov of: so that herein and hitherto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
so manie of them at least as herein agree with him, and
most Protestants concurre: (howsoever in other points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the merit and worth of works and satisfaction</hi> made by
them <hi>for venial sins,</hi> to be expiated otherwise by <hi>Purgatorie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,</hi>
and some other the like differences we keep far asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
and much time and pains ar spent and wasted on either
part, by them on the one side, in contending against such <hi>an
imputation of Christs righteousnes,</hi> as none of ours ever dreamed
of; and by manie of ours on the other side, in confusing what
they deliver of <hi>Justification,</hi> when as by that term they mean
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63789:26"/>
not <hi>Justification,</hi> strictlie so termed, but <hi>Sanctification</hi> impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie
by them so stiled; and so the Air onelie is to no purpose
between them both beaten, while the one either wil not see, or
marks not what the other means.</p>
            <p>A second Use may be to minister much comfort to everie
sound and tru-hearted Christian:</p>
            <p>1. Against the <hi>temtations and accusations of Satan,</hi> and of
<hi>the wicked of this World.</hi> The Devil is stiled as <hi>the temter,</hi> so
<hi>the accuser of the Brethren, Revel.</hi> 12. 10. and the wicked of
the world are over-prone to <hi>traduce them as evil doers, 1 Pet.</hi> 2.
12. but the tru Christian may with the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap.
50. 8. and the Apostle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 33. bid defiance to
either, God wil defend him against either. If Satan shal offer
to traduce him with God, or to accuse him unto God, as he did
<hi>Job,</hi> or worldlie men censure him for an Hypocrite and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malist,
as <hi>Jobs</hi> frends did him, God himself wil vindicate him
as wel against the one as the other: <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. and 42. 7, 8.
he wil bring forth his righteousnes as the light, and make his
cause or case as clear as the noon-day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 6. everie
toung that enforms ought against him, shal it self be cast and
condemned, <hi>Esay</hi> 54. 17. what accuser or accusation can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to the conviction or condemnation of him, whome Christ
sues for, whome God assoils? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34.</p>
            <p>2. Against <hi>the remainders of sinne and corruption</hi> within him,
considering that notwithstanding them, he may be, and is, if he
have interest in Christ, in the state of <hi>justification,</hi> for <hi>justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
regards not the <hi>filth</hi> but the <hi>guilt</hi> of sinne; and tho <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
be never severed from <hi>sanctification,</hi> yet is <hi>sanctification</hi> here
but imperfect; whereas <hi>justification</hi> is grounded upon that that
brings a perfect discharge of guilt with it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>3. Against <hi>the fear of Gods indignation and wrath.</hi> for <hi>being
justified by Christs bloud,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>we shal much more by
him be saved from wrath, Rom.</hi> 5. 9. where the partie is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
faultles, there offence must needs cease, and vengeance
much more, <hi>Esay</hi> 54. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>4. Against <hi>the rigor of Gods justice.</hi> for <hi>justification</hi> is an act of
<hi>justice,</hi> nor can God in <hi>justice condemn</hi> those whom he hath
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63789:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>assoiled as guiltles</hi> in and for Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. God is not
like <hi>Pilate,</hi> who though he pronounced Christ <hi>guiltles,</hi> yet for
all that would scourge him, condemn him, and give him up to
be crucified, <hi>Luk. 23. 14. 16, 22. John</hi> 19. 6, 16. yea <hi>injustice</hi>
it were to exact that from anie of those who have interest in
Christ, for which he had received <hi>satisfaction</hi> from Christ their
<hi>suretie</hi> before, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>5. Against their <hi>want of worth,</hi> in regard of manie other of
far more eminent parts of pietie and sanctimonie. for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in regard of those graceful parts, that excellent lustre of
inherent holines, that renders them, as wel gratious in the sight
of God, as conspicuous in the eyes of men, there is as vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and as distant degrees between <hi>Saint and Saint</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon the earth, as there is between <hi>Star and Star</hi> aloaft in
the Heavens; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. yet as in <hi>remission of sin,</hi> so in
<hi>justification,</hi> and in <hi>Christs satisfaction</hi> the ground of either, the
meanest, weakest and poorest Christian hath an eqal share with
the most eminent and excellent. And therein doth eithers <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes</hi>
principallie consist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>6. Against <hi>condemnation and sentence of judicature,</hi> tho just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
past here upon him, and deservedlie inflicted. for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that also, having his peace made with God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him in Christ, he shal with the penitent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Theif on the Cross, for Christs <hi>satisfaction,</hi> stand discharged
and be pronounced guiltles at Gods tribunal, nor shal his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
suffering exclude him from entrance into the place
of his eternal rest and blis, no more then the like did his and
our suretie Christ Jesus, after his satisfaction finished and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which not for himself, but for him and al Gods elect,
was by him both undertaken and exhibited, <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Luk.</hi>
23. 43.</p>
            <p>Having thus dispatched the <hi>first Hed,</hi> which we propounded
to be handled, concerning the right meaning of the term <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
here used; we shal proceed now to the second, to wit, what
<hi>Faith,</hi> or what act of Faith it is, whereby we ar said here to be
justified.</p>
            <p>And herein following the same Methode, that we did in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63789:27"/>
the former, we shall endevor to shew,</p>
            <p>1. What act of Faith it is not, and 2. what it is.</p>
            <p>In the former I am encountred with two erroneous (as to me
seems) mistakes and extreams, the one falling short of the tru
nature of justifying Faith, or that act of faith whereby we ar
said to be justified; and the other, as in opposition it usuallie
falls out, going as far beyond it, as the other comes short of it.</p>
            <p>The former error or mistake is of those, who by Faith wil
have here understood nothing els but a general beleif, or assent
of the mind to the truth of Gods word in general, or at least,
to the doctrine of the Gospel in special, concerning salvation
by Christ, to wit, that Jesus Christ is the onlie Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of Mankind. that which is commonlie termed <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Faith,</hi> but of some learned writers rather by a fitter term
<hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> because it respects not so much the Historie
of the Scripture in general, or of Christs life and death in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as the doctrine contained in the word, or that more
specially concerning Christ laid down in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Some difference indeed I find herein, between the Papists,
and those of ours, the one makeing Gods word in general the
object of this Faith, the other restraining it to the promises of
the Gospel. but the difference is not great, and this latter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the former. Now tru it is, and must of necessity be
granted, that this <hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> or such an act of Faith as
it implies, is a necessarie antecedent of justifying Faith, and
layeth a ground and foundation for it. But that it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
justifying act of Faith, with most of our writers and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
I cannot admit and condescend unto; yet not because that
the Popish partie mostlie maintain it, (for even the Papists hold
manie truths in common, both with us and other orthodox
Christians.) nor because the most of ours oppose and impugn
it, (for we make no meer mans or mens judgement the ground
of our faith,) but because I deem it unsound and repugnant to
Gods word.</p>
            <p>My reasons ar these.</p>
            <p>1. That Faith, which the Devils and damned Spirits may
have, cannot be justifying Faith, or the justifying act of Faith.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63789:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For justifying Faith is a most <hi>pretious Pearl,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1. <hi>a special
gift,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>and grace of God,</hi> as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
<hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 29. And being so, it is consqentlie such an
endowment, as those damned Spirits have not, nor ar capable
of. But this beleif either of the word of God in general; or of
the doctrine of the Gospel concerning Salvation by Christ in
particular, even the Devils themselves may have, and have.
That there is a God, the Devils, saith <hi>James, beleiv, and tremble,
Jam.</hi> 2. 19. they beleiv there is a God, and beleiving that,
beleiv withal that he is a tru God, and that his word is tru; did
they not beleiv it, they would not tremble. and indeed what is
the reason why wretched Atheists, wors herein then the Devil,
tremble not at Gods word, but because they beleiv not that there
is a God, or that the word is the word of a God, or that it is a
word of truth? yea even the Devils, as they beleiv a God, so
they beleiv a Christ too. So themselvs professe, <hi>I know
who thou art;</hi> (say they, speaking to Christ) <hi>even that holie one
of God, Mark</hi> 1. 24. and again, <hi>What have I to doe with thee,
Jesus, the Sonne of the most high God? Mark</hi> 5. 7. and yet
further, if this be not sufficient, thou art <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Christ,</hi> or
that Christ, <hi>the Sonne of God, Luk.</hi> 4. 41. what more in this
kind could, or did <hi>Peter</hi> say? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16. compare <hi>Peters</hi>
confession there, and the Devils here, and see if not in substance
onlie, but in terms also, they be not the verie same. Hereunto
might be added, that <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 17. where the Spirit of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Damsel possessed therewith, avouches of <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas, These men are the servants of the most high God, who shew
unto you the way of salvation.</hi> he confesseth that the doctrine
taught by them, was the way whereby God had appointed that
men should be saved. It is apparent hereby that even the Divels
may have, yea and have that faith, which these men affirm to
be justifying faith; and which yet in truth it cannot be.</p>
            <p>But against this Argument some exceptions have ben given
me by some: which I shal endeavor to remoov.</p>
            <p>The first exception taken by a young Divine having some
employment in the Citie about the time, when I delt in this
argument, was this, that it followed not, because the Devil thus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63789:28"/>
spake of or unto Christ, that therefore they beleived him to be
so as they said. they might speak it in a colloging way, as did the
<hi>Herodians, Mat.</hi> 22. 16. when coming to tempt and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
him, they say, <hi>Master we know that thou art tru, and
teachest the way of God trulie without respect of or regard
unto the person of anie.</hi> which yet it may justlie be doubted,
whether in truth they beleived. and so may it be of what the
Devils are related to have said.</p>
            <p>For answer whereunto I shal not stand to discusse what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
hereof there is, whether the speech of the one and the
other be alike; or whether the Devils came at those times,
when those things were uttered by them, on purpose, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians</hi>
did, to tempt and entangle Christ.</p>
            <p>But I answer directlie,</p>
            <p>1. That it canot be, but that the Devils must needs know as
much as there they do confes. To make it evident by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
suppose the Grand Signior or <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as at this day he doth) in captivity the subjects of divers
Christian Princes and States not a few, some one of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whose subjects he so holds, should undertake an expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein he would go himself in person, for the deliverie of
his subjects so deteined, enter upon his territories, defeat him,
subdu him, release his captives and set them at libertie, take the
Captiver of them captive, and lead him in triumph; were it
now possible but that the tyrant thus dealt with should
know, that this Prince, who had done all this, were the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of his people? It is the verie case here. The Divel, the
Prince of darknes, the God of this world, held in thraldome
and servitude the greatest part of the world; our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
comes, he defeats him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 18. dispossesseth him, <hi>John</hi>
12. 31. disarmes him, rifles him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 21, 22. rescues
men dailie out of his hands and bands, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 13. leads
him captive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. triumphs over him, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 15. and
is it possible that this spiritual tyrant so defeated, disarmed,
dispossest, despoiled, bereaft of his prey and purchase, captived,
triumphed, should not know and beleiv this Jesus Christ by
whom all this was done, to be the Savior and redeemer of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63789:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mankind? it is a thing utterlie impossible and scarce credible,
that anie man should make qestion at all of it.</p>
            <p>But 2. to put this out of qestion; what some scriptures say
that the Devils acknowledged, others of them expreslie say that
they knew. so <hi>Mark</hi> 1. as <hi>vers</hi> 24. it is related how the Divel in
the man possest said to Christ, <hi>I know who thou art;</hi> so <hi>vers</hi> 34.
it is said of those fiends which Christ cast out, that he would
not suffer the Divels, (not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to say, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to speak;
becaus they knew him. they professed not onlie to know him,
but they knew him indeed. and more fullie yet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 41.
when they made that confession of him before mentioned, it is
said, Christ rebuked them, and would not suffer them to speak,
because they knew him to be the Christ. so that this first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is of no force, since that what the Devils professed to
know, the Evangelists expreslie affirm that they knew.</p>
            <p>A second exception is, that the Divels could not be justifyed,
tho they had the same kind of faith, or the same act of faith,
whereby men are justifyed, because there is no promise made
unto them, salvation was never tendred on anie such condition
to them, as unto mankind it is.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, 1. that the qestion is not, whither the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
should or could be justified, if they had that faith or act of
faith, whereby men ar said to be justifyed. but the qestion is,
whither they have, or may have, or are capable of such a faith,
for the nature of it, as that is, which those have, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ, and whereby they are justified. and the force
of the argument depends not upon the denial of the former,
but upon the denial of the latter. To make this plain by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the like. suppose some should maintain that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
spoken of by the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. where he
saies, <hi>godlie greif breeds repentance unto salvation never to be
repented of,</hi> were nothing els but a sorrow for sin, or a regret
and remors onlie arising from the apprehension of evil ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereupon, shame and confusion in regard of men, death
and damnation in regard of God. and to disproov this conceit,
a man should reason in this manner. That repentance which
the Divels themselves may have, cannot be that wholesome
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63789:29"/>
and saving repentance, which the Apostle speaks of. But the
Divels may have an inward remors and sorrow for sin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of those evils that for it have befaln them and ly heavie
upon them, and unto all eternitie shal so do. and it is not
therefore that repentance of which the Apostle there speaks.
The qestion here would not be whither the Divels might be
saved if they could repent, but whither they ar capable of such
a repentance as godlie greif produceth and works unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in men; and the stresse of the argument would rest upon
the denial not of the former, but of the latter. And in like
manner is it here, the pith of the argument consists not in this,
whither the Devils should be justifyed or no, if they had such a
faith as men have whereby they ar justified; which is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
nor is at all qestioned, but whither they have, or can
have such a faith as the Apostle here speaks of, and whereby he
affirms that men may be and ar justified; and this onlie is that
that is here denied. And trulie unto me it seems as strange to
affirm, that the Devils have or may have, that verie same faith,
(that pretious pearl, that verie same gift and grace of Gods
Spirit) whereby they ar justifyed, tho not for the work, but for
the object of it, as hereafter shall be shewn; as to say the Devils
have or may have that kindlie and godlie greif for sin as sin, not
for the evil ensuing it, but for the evil that is in it, &amp; the sincere
and genuine repentance springing from the same, which the
Apostle there speaks of: since that the one is a special gift and
grace of Gods Spirit, as well as the other: and look what is
spoken of the one in this kind, to wit, of Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.
31. and 11. 18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. the verie same is said of faith
in the places before mentioned.</p>
            <p>2. For the removal of this exception more fullie; consider
we, that tho it be tru, that there is no such promise or tender
of salvation on anie such condition made unto the Devils and
damned spirits: yet the tender of salvation and justification
upon this act of faith is made to all mankind in general, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception of anie, <hi>Mark 16. 15, 16. Go forth into all the
world,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and preach the Gospel unto everie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He that beleiveth and is baptised, shal be saved.</hi> If then it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63789:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can be made out, that some men that ar not justified, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
some wicked ones remaining unjustified, unsanctified, yet
notwithstanding may have the faith by these men maintained
to be here ment, to wit, a beleif onlie of the truth of the doctrine
of the Gospel, that Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
then this exception must necessarilie fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>And so I pas to a second argument, which may thus be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
That faith which wicked, ungodlie, irregenerate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
men, so remaining may have, yea and sometimes have
had, cannot be justifying faith, nor the faith spoken of by the
Apostle in this place. But this beleif of the Gospel, that Christ
is the Sonne of God, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind,
some have had, have known and beleived it, who yet coutinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stil, wicked, ungodlie, irregenerate, unsanctified. and this
cannot therefore consequentlie be the faith here spoken of. For
the proof of the Proposition, I shal not so much insist or rest
upon the necessarie conjunction of this faith and repentance
the one with the other, in regard of Gods ordinance; and tho
by means of his appointment there is a necessarie connection of
Justification and Sanctification;<note place="margin">See Peter <hi>Alliacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> ad Sent. lib. 4. qaest. 1. art. 3. conclus. 1.</note> which as some of the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have observed, might otherwise have ben severed; so that
justification might have ben, where sanctification were not, had
God ben pleased so to dispose it. and sanctification might
have ben without justification, if God had restored our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to their original condition,<note place="margin">See Ger. <hi>Vossius</hi> Defens. Grot. de satisfact. advers. Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperg. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 8.</note> freelie remitting their offence
without anie satisfaction; as by his absolute power he might
have done. for I dare not say as some do, that God may not as wel
without breach of his justice, remit a wrong done him by his
creature and vassal, as a man may an injurie offered to him by his
fellow &amp; fellow-servant, howsoever in his wisdome he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
and determined to dispose things otherwise; which yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
determination, disposition and ordinance were sufficient
ground to make the proposition good. But the main stress of my
proof I shal lay upon this, that therefore faith &amp; repentance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be severed, faith and holines cannot be sundred, in regard of
the verie nature and propertie, the condition and qalitie of this
faith it self; for that this faith, whereby a man is justified, is an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63789:30"/>
holie habit, or disposition, and the act issuing from it, an holie
act; termed therefore a <hi>most holie faith, Jude</hi> 20. nor in regard
of the objects of it, because it is conversant and exercised about
holie things, God, and Christ, and the goodnes &amp; mercie of God
in Christ; but because it is an holie disposition in the soul, whereby
the heart is purified, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and the partie possest of it is
sanctified, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. such faith is a fruit of regeneration, a limb
or a branch of sanctification, which it self is either a fruit or a
branch of Regeneration. either a fruit or a sprig, I say, because
regeneration may be considered two ways, either as an act of
God working in us, or as a change thereby wrought upon us.
Conceiv we this by the like concerning conversion. conversion
may be taken two ways, either as an act of God working in us,
or a change thereby wrought upon us. and we shall find both
together mentioned, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Convert me, O Lord;</hi> there is
the act of God working in him; <hi>and I shall be converted,</hi> there
is the change thereby wrought upon him. In like manner may
Regeneration be considered, either as an act of God working
in, or on a man, <hi>Jam. 1. 18. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 3. and so sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is an effect or fruit of it, or as a change wrought thereby
upon him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23. and so it is a principal branch
of regeneration; whereof one main arm is illumination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the minde and understanding, and sanctification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the wil and affections an other, shooting out and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
it self into many sprigs, as sincere repentance, the filial
fear, the tru love of God, and the like; all which and among
the rest this <hi>faith unfeigned, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 5. being branches of
sanctification, ar all holie dispositions, and the acts issuing from
them of no other nature or qalitie then the disposition, or first
act, as the School termes it, from which they proceed. Seeing
then that the habit of this faith, whereby anie ar justified, is
an holie disposition, such as makes the soul and person possest
with it holie, that purifies and sanctifies him that hath it, and
the acts of it conseqentlie such as proceed from an holie heart
and a sanctified disposition; it must needs follow, that no
wicked man, no unregenerated and unsanctified person, while he
so continues, can have the faith by the Apostle here intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:63789:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And thus much shall suffice for the proof of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
I shal now proceed to the proof of the assumption.</p>
            <p>That a man may beleiv the doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is the Sonne of God, and the Saviour of mankind,</hi> and
yet be never a whit the holier, but remain stil irregenerate and
unsanctified, is apparent. For first the Devils, as hath ben said
and shewed before, know and beleiv all this, and that now
doubtles, as undoubtedlie as anie man living doth or can do,
and yet are no whit at all the holier for all that, but remain stil
as evil as ever they were. yea manie wicked men, limmes of the
Devil have done the same. And here why should I not name
<hi>Balaam</hi> for one? for did not <hi>Balaam</hi> know Christ? yes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie,
how could he els have Prophesied of him? he had an
heavenlie revelation, a revelation from God concerning Christ;
that might be said of him, that Christ himself said of <hi>Peter,
Mat. 16. 17. Flesh and bloud did not reveil this mysterie unto him,
but God himself that is in heaven:</hi> tho he were not blessed, as <hi>Peter,</hi>
nor sanctified therefore, as he was. But hear we <hi>Balaams</hi> own
words, <hi>Num.</hi> 24. 15-17. <hi>Balaam the son of Beor, the man whose
eyes were opened, who heard the words of God, and knew the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the most High, and saw the visions of the Almightie, he
saith, I shal see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not
nigh.</hi> (as if he had said, The time shal come, when I shal see the
<hi>Messias,</hi> the Savior of <hi>Israel;</hi> I shall one day behold him, but
afar off; so as I shal not be the better for my sight of him, it
will be little to my comfort.) <hi>There shal come a Star out of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;
<hi>and a Rod, or a Scepter shal arise, or stand up out of</hi> Israel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> a plain Prophecie of Christ, as all confes, and is generallie
acknowledged. Yea mark we how far he proceeds, Chap. 23.
10. <hi>Let me dye,</hi> or, <hi>Oh that I might dye,</hi> (saith he) <hi>the death of
the righteous; and that my last end might be like unto his. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
would never have thus spoken, had he not beleived, that
if he did take the same cours that Gods people did, who
trusted in the <hi>Messias,</hi> and yeilded themselvs up to be ruled
whollie by him, he might be saved by him, as they were. but
for all that his beleif he would not, nor did condescend so to
do. But leave we him, and proceed to some other instances.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63789:31"/>
What is the <hi>sin against the Holie Ghost,</hi> of which our Saviour
Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 11. 31, 32. All manner of sinne and
blasphemie shal be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemie against
the Holie Ghost, shal not be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in
the world to come?</hi> Is it not almost generallie by most Divines
acknowledged, that this irremissible sin, is a sin always joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with knowledge? and what knowledge? not a bare spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
or notional knowledg, but a beleif of the truth of
the Gospel, accompanied with a malicious opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uuto.
No man therefore can commit that sin, but such an one
as knows and beleives the doctrine of the Gospel, which yet
he malitiouslie opposeth, and conseqentlie must needs have
that Faith, which these men would have to be justifying faith.
It was somtime the speech of a Reverend Divine, that if <hi>Paul</hi>
had had <hi>Peters</hi> knowledge when he opposed the Faith of
Christ, or <hi>Peter Pauls</hi> malice, when he abjured his Master;
they had both them committed that unpardonable sin. But
<hi>Paul</hi> did what he did in ignorance, and <hi>Peter</hi> what he did, out
of weaknes: and both repented of what they had done; which
none of those that have committed that sin, ever do. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6.
In which place further the Apostle plainly intimates, <hi>vers,</hi> 4. 6.
that men that have ben illightned, (with what, think we
means he, but with the knowledge of Evangelical truths?) and
have partaked of the Holie Ghost, (of the common graces of
the Spirit) and tasted of the heavenlie gift and the good word
of God, (as those compared to <hi>the seed sowen on stonie ground,
that receiv the word with joy, and beleiv for a time, Matth.</hi> 13.
20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13. and the powers of the world to come, may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet, not fal onlie, but fall utterlie away; (as those also in the
Gospel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13.) yea not fall whollie off onlie, but sin in
despite of Gods Spirit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 26, 29. and so sin, that it's
a thing impossible for them to be restored again by repentance,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 6. and what sin it is that is there so deciphered, is
no great difficultie to determine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which albeit I dare not say
that <hi>Judas</hi> committed; (for it seems avarice, not malice, that
run him hedlong into that guilt of impietie, little imagining,
it may be, but that his Master would rid himself wel enough
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63789:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of their hands, unto whom he had betraied him, as he had
sometime before done the like, <hi>Luk. 4. 29, 30. John</hi> 8. 59.
and 10. 39. and himself go away with their money the whiles)
yet it is verie likely, that he beleived that concerning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to be tru, that he preached unto others. Howsoever, the
former instances shewing that wicked ones so continuing may
have such a beleif of the truth of the Gospel, declare the same
not to be the faith here spoken of.</p>
            <p>But pas we on to a third argument. That faith which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
or a castaway may have, one that is not of the number
of Gods elect, cannot be justifying faith, or the faith of which
the Apostle here speaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for justifying faith, is a grace proper
and peculiar to Gods Elect; and is by the Apostle therefore
termed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the faith of Gods Elect.</hi> But a man
may know and beleiv the doctrine of the Gospel concerning
Christ and Salvation by him, and yet be a castaway, none of the
Elect. so the Apostle <hi>Peter, 2. Pet.</hi> 2. 20-22. implies, that men
who have known the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the knowledge
of him abandoned their former worldlie defilements, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
returning thereunto, <hi>like a Dog</hi> to take in again <hi>his vomit,</hi>
or <hi>a Sow</hi> washed <hi>to wallow again in the mire;</hi> may be in worse,
more irrecoverable state &amp; condition then ever before even as the
Apostle to the Hebrews, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6 4, 5. above mentioned, as there
is no possible means of restoring them again by repentance.</p>
            <p>4. That faith, whereby a man is justified, is such a faith as
brings a man home to Christ, such as causeth a man to come to
him, pitch upon him, adhere unto him. So our Saviour, <hi>John</hi>
6. 36. <hi>He that comes to me shal not hunger, and be that beleivs
in me shall not thirst.</hi> which words of our Saviour plainlie shew,
that that faith, whereby a man receivs anie benefit from Christ,
is such a faith, as carries him unto Christ. But a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiv
Christ to be the Savior and Redeemer of mankind, and yet
not in that maner come to him, as to pitch himself upon him,
and adhere to him. nor need we go far for an instance, we have
one in that verie Chapter, when Christ had fed a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
with a verie smal qantitie of food, <hi>This,</hi> say they, <hi>certainlie
is that Prophet that should come into the world, John</hi> 6. 14. That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63789:32"/>
Prophet, what Prophet, think we, ment they, but the Prophet
spoken of by <hi>Moses? Deut.</hi> 18. 15. he that was to be their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
and Redeemer, the Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22. and yet for all that,
albeit they were willing enough to follow him to be fed, <hi>vers</hi>
26. yet they would not come to him, that they might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. and what was the reason why they
would not? their credit and reputation, and other the like car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and worldlie respects lay in the way between them and
Christ, which kept them off from comming so to Christ as to
adhere unto him, tho they professed verilie to apprehend and
beleive him to be the <hi>Messias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastlie, justifying faith is such a faith whereby we imbrace,
entertain, receiv, admit Christ, not into our houses, but into
our hearts; and whereby conseqentlie we are united unto Christ,
so as that he is said to be in us, and we in him. <hi>To as manie as
received him,</hi> saith he, <hi>he gave this priviledge to become the
sonnes of God, even to those that beleiv in his name.</hi> Where
to receiv him, is to give him entertainment, not so much in
their houses, which <hi>Matthew, Zacheus,</hi> and others of them also
did, as in their hearts: according to that of the Apostle, that
<hi>Christ may dwel in your hearts by faith, Ephes.</hi> 3. 17. whence it is
that they that ar <hi>in the faith,</hi> ar said to have <hi>Christ in them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your selvs,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>whether ye be in the Faith:
do you not know that Christ is in you? 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
that if they be in the faith, then Christ is in them. For
howsoever I conceiv not the term of beleiving on Christ, for
our justification or faith in his bloud, as the Apostle terms it
here, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. doth in the proper and peculiar notion of it
signifie a receiving of Christ to be our King, Priest and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
or to contain and comprehend all Evangelical Duties;
yet it doth necessarilie implie an acceptance of him to be not
our suretie, Savior and Redeemer onely, but our Soveraign
Lord also, and as our Priest our Prophet. Since we cannot
with anie good ground relie on him or trust him for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of us from the guilt of our sinnes, unles we be content
to receiv, and do willinglie embrace him, on such terms as God
offers him, and as he offers himself unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on no other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63789:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
terms then these is he offered unto anie. But a man may beleiv
that Christ is the Savior of the world, yea that he cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
but by Christ, and yet for all that may refuse to receiv him
and yield himself up unto him, because he mislikes the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he is tendred unto him, or delay to do it at present,
in hope that he may timelie enough do it hereafter. As when
a companie of Rebels ar up in arms against their Leige Lord,
and a Proclamation of pardon and impunitie is published by
him unto all such of them, as will lay down their arms, put
themselvs upon his mercie, acknowledge their offence, and by
solemn oath engage themselvs to du allegiance and constant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
for the future; albeit that they all know him to be
their lawful Soveraign, and beleiv that he will be as good as his
word, to all that so accept of it, nor know which way to
escape, but that first or last they shal be surprised, if they do
stand out, and have execution done upon them; yet there may
be divers among them that will chuse rather to persist in their
rebellious courses, or refuse at least to yeeld themselvs up to
him, and to accept of his gratious offer, either out of a stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of stomack, and a stifnes of self-wil, or out of an extream
malice and inveterate hatred against the person of their Prince,
or out of a strong affection to some advers partie, or out of a
fond conceit that they may keep for some good space of time
out of the way, undiscovered and unsurprised, or that when
they perceiv themselvs neer to be attached, they may then by a
tender of themselves attain the benefit of the offer, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no limitation of time mentioned in it. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
altho a man do beleiv that Jesus is the Savior of mankind,
and that there is no way for him to attain salvation but by
Christ, yet for all that may he refuse to receiv Christ for his
Lord and Savior, or to accept of salvation by Christ, because he
mislikes the conditions, upon and under which Christ and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ is offered and tendred unto him, and without
which it cannot be had. But what ar those terms, that ar so
necessarilie reqired, and with so much difficultie received? why,
these ar: <hi>If any man wil come after me,</hi> saith our Savior, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>let him utterlie denie himself, Matth.</hi> 16. 24.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63789:33"/>
and, <hi>If a man hate not Father and Mother, and Wife and
Children, and Brothers and Sisters,</hi> his nearest relations, his
dearest affections onlie, be as willing to part with them
and leave them, when they shal stand in the way between
him and Christ, as if he did hate them and were wearie of
them, but over and beside all this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>even his

14. 26. and, he that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>doth not renounce all
that ever he hath, ibid. v.</hi> 33. yea all that ever he is, he is not
for Christ, he must not be his own man anie more, but he must
in resolution at least be Christs alone, whollie at his command,
wil and disposal. and is not this, think we, <hi>durus sermo, a hard
saying,</hi> as they somtime said, to flesh and bloud? is not this
self-denial a shrewd pil to swallow? <hi>who,</hi> say they, <hi>can hear it?</hi>
who can endure the verie hearing of it? <hi>John</hi> 6. 60. but much
more may it be said here, who can endure to admit it? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
This word or saying, that
<hi>Christ came to save sinners,</hi> it is a sure saying, such as we may
write and rest upon it, we may with good ground afford cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
unto it, yea and it is withal a verie acceptable saying, a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>worthie of all acceptance, 1 Tim.</hi> 1 15. and indeed who
would not accept of such a gratious offer? would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and gladlie entertain such tidings, the glad tidings of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of salvation not temporal, but eternal? See <hi>Esay</hi>
52. 7. <hi>Nahum 1. 15. Rom.</hi> 10. 15. yea but what is the
reason then, that this so acceptable message finds so little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
in the world, that so few do accept of it? that when
this Savior <hi>came unto his own,</hi> he found so sorie welcome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, <hi>his own refused to receiv him? John</hi> 1. 11. It is
not in the thing offered; that no damned wretch in Hel would
refuse to accept; but it is in the terms whereupon the offer is
made and tendred, which mans corrupt nature wil in no wise
condescend unto. Man by nature is so wedded to his own wil,
his corrupt heart is so fast glewed to his lewd, but beloved,
yea best beloved lusts, that he wil rather part with life, and
soul, and self, then endure to hear of a divorce from them, that
ar dearer to him then himself. Do we not hear wicked wretches
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63789:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
somtimes say, such a sinne they cannot leav, they wil not leav,
tho they be damned for it? <hi>Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle, was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated</hi>
of God, for this purpose, that he might become the
Autor of eternal salvation to all those that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.
yea that yeild obedience to him in all things, that do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he enjoynes them, <hi>John</hi> 15. 14. And wil we see how
avers mans nature is to this obedience, to this absolute, this
universal obedience? tho it be most tru, that our Savior saith,
(how can he say other then such, who is truth it self?) that
<hi>his yoak,</hi> the yoak that he would have us to draw in, is not
harsh and hard, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>good and gentle;</hi> and his burden,
the burden that he would impose upon us, and have us to bear,
is not heavie and cumbersome, but light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 36. it is
so in its self, in its own nature; it was so at the first unto mans
created nature; it would be so unto us, were it not for our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature; had we but a love and a likeing unto it. See <hi>Prov.</hi>
3. 17. and 8. 8, 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. yet such is the perversnes and
untowardnes of mans crooked and crosgraind wil, that it wil
not by anie fear or force be wrought or brought to a yeilding
thereunto. so that wel may that of <hi>Solomon</hi> be applied unto it;
<hi>That which is crooked cannot be made streight, Eccles.</hi> 1. 15. The

difficultie of self-denial, the strong bent of the heart unto its
own evil lusts, and its stifnes of opposition unto Gods word and
wil, the deceitfulnes of sinne and Satan in an other kind, those
wiles, whereby they suggest unto the soul of it self so loath to
denie it self, so unwilling to part with &amp; leav its beloved lusts, to
turn over a new leaf, and engage, or inslave himself rather, as he
esteems it, to the rigid observance of a strict tenor of life; that
for the present so to do is altogether needles, it may be done
timelie enough, and well enough hereafter; he may follow the
world, and take his pleasure, pursu his own courses, and persist
in his own waies, as long as he sees good, and hath libertie
and abilitie so to do; and afterward, when by age or cross oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents
he is so restrained that he cannot do as he did and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
stil to do if he could, when he is arrested upon his sick, or
lies upon his deaths-bed, he may then seasonablie begin to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63789:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think on those things, which he hath now no minde to, which
his minde at present goes so much against; and the applieng of
himself thereunto wil stand him then in as much steed, as if he
had put himself to such a tedious task before, &amp; undergone such
a toilsome pennance all his life long. And many doubtles build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on such vain imaginations, and gulling their own souls
with such groundles hopes, as like Castles in the ayer, they
thence raise and erect to their own ruine, refuse to receive
Christ so tendred unto them, albeit they beleiv him to be the
onlie Savior of mankind, and no salvation to be had without
him.</p>
            <p>And thus much may suffice for refutation of the former
mistake of those who hold the <hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> that is, the
beleif of the truth either of the word of God in general, or
of the Gospel in special, that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
of mankind, to be that Faith whereby we ar said here
to be justified.</p>
            <p>There remain some few Testimonies of Scripture to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that ar wont to be produced for the proof of that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
either by the Papists, or our own writers.</p>
            <p>Now for the proof of this, that justifying faith is no other
then a firm assent to the truth of Gods word in general,
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth onlie one place of Scripture, to wit, the
Apostles words, <hi>Hebrews. 11. 1. Faith is the substance of things
to be hoped for,</hi> and the argument, or, <hi>evidence of things not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
This he calls his first argument, tho it have no second,
as elswhere he doth the like. And in the prosecution of his
argument from this place he spends a whole Chapter, <hi>de justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.
lib. 1. cap.</hi> 6. wherein he takes for granted that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in these words gives an exact definition of justifying
faith: and the instances that after he gives concerning the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the world by Gods word, and the destruction of it by
a floud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shew that this faith is a beleif of the word of God
in general, as wel of Historical relations, as of doctrinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and of comminations as of promises.</p>
            <p>Unto all which we may thus answer.</p>
            <p>1. It is not denied that the Apostle in this Chapter doth at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63789:35"/>
large commend and set forth the strange and admirable power,
efficacie and excellencie, of that tru lively and saving faith
which he had before mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 38. but that he
intends to deliver in those first words an exact definition of
faith so far forth as it justifies, or either there or in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
ensuing, to point out that special act of faith whereby
it doth justifie, that is, is a mean of assoiling a man from the
guilt of his sinnes, is more then the Cardinal is able to make
good. and indeed who almost would be so absurd as to say,
that anie man should be so justified by beleeving that God made
the world of nothing? (the truth whereof some yet among us
have of late flatlie denied, and have not forborn to publish
their flat denial and disapprooving of it in print) tho tru it is,
that by that self same faith we beleiv as wel the worlds creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by God, as mans redemption by Christ; and ar thereby as
firmly assured of the one as of the other.</p>
            <p>2. Nor doth it follow that <hi>Noa</hi> was assoiled from his sins,
and became an heir of that righteousnes that is according to
faith, by beleeving that the whole world should by a deluge be
destroied: tho by the same faith he beleived also that he and
his should be saved from destruction in that universal deluge by
means of the Ark, which by Gods appointment and according
to direction received from him he thereupon to that end built.</p>
            <p>3. Yea to return <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument upon himself,
whereby he would proov that the justifying act of faith is not
such as we would have it to be, to wit, <hi>fiducia,</hi> a fiducial trust
or reheng on Christ and Gods promise of justification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ; because such a faith produceth not fear, but
produceth hope and expelleth fear: whereas that act of <hi>Noa's</hi>
faith, whereby he beleived that the deluge would undoubtedlie
come, bred in him that fear, that caused him to build the Ark.
For as the warning given of the floud, notwithstanding the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
and in humane reason incredibilitie, yea impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of it in natural power, yet certainlie apprehended and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
beleived upon Gods word, relating &amp; revealing it to
him, produced fear in him, even as the comminatorie prediction
of <hi>Ninevies</hi> destruction delivered by <hi>Jonas</hi> from God, and by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63789:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Ninevites</hi> beleived, bred a fear thereof in them, <hi>Jon.</hi> 3. 5.
so the promise of deliverance made withal unto him at the
same time by God, being as certainlie beleived and relied on,
bred in him an hopeful expectation of the undoubted perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it, and was the principal motive of his building the
Ark, which otherwise to have attempted had ben a most vain
and foolish project, and would have prooved of none effect.</p>
            <p>4. Hereunto might be added, that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> seems
to implie, that that deliverance from the deluge had somewhat
typical in it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21. and as in that promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
for the performance whereof his trusting upon God is
said to be <hi>imputed unto him for righteousnes, Gen.</hi> 15. 5, 6.
had beside the expression of the numerositie of his issue in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
mentioned also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 16. an intimation withal of
that blessed or blessing rather, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 26. Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.
and 22. 18. Jesus Christ in special, by whome all that relie on
him and trust to him were to be justified and saved; and the
possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> mentioned in the Covenant
that God at the same time plighted with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 8-18.
was a type of the right unto and interest in the heavenlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
procured and purchased for all the faithful by Christ,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 18, 19. and 4. 1-11. and 6. 20. and 9. 12, 24. and
10. 19, 20. so that temporal deliverance promised to <hi>Noa,</hi>
from the destruction by the deluge, proceeding from the special
favor and grace of God to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 8. might wel be a
type of that spiritual deliverance from the power of sinne and
Satan, which <hi>Noa</hi> no doubt beleived to be attained by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
seed, on whom by relieng he became heir of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
that is according to faith in him.</p>
            <p>5. That the Apostle speaks of the faith of Gods people in
general, whither ordinarie, and that either Historical of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as wel alreadie past, the creation, <hi>v.</hi> 3. as future, <hi>the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of Egypt, v.</hi> 22. or Dogmatical, <hi>concerning God and
his goodnes, v.</hi> 6. or extraordinarie, <hi>that of miracles, v.</hi> 33, 34.
is apparent by the varietie of instances given by him, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
also himself grants, and would hence proov, that faith in
all these instances, yea that faith in general, is but one and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63789:36"/>
same, which if it were tru, then everie one that hath justifying
faith, should have a power of working miracles also: which
is directlie contrarie both to our Saviors intimations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.
22, 23. and 17. 20. and the Apostles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 29,
30. tho it be not denied that some general notion of faith be
found in each of them.</p>
            <p>Lastlie, albeit that Historical or Dogmatical faith, or that act
of faith, whereby the truth of the Historie or Doctrine of the
word in general, or that of the Gospel in particular is beleived,
be of necessitie conjoyned with, or antecedent unto that act of
saith whereby a beleiver is justified, it doth not thence follow
that these two therefore ar one and the same. no more then
the <hi>slavish fear</hi> ariseing from a meer apprehension of wrath
and greatness, is the same with the <hi>filial fear,</hi> ariseing from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of Gods mercie and goodnes; <hi>Psal. 130. 3. Jer.</hi>
31. 39, 40. because the one is to the other, <hi>tanqam a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us ad
silum, as the needle to the thred,</hi> it goes before to make way for
it, and helps to introduce it: or that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> ar one
and the same, because the one is the foundation of the other,
nor ar they in time severed the one from the other.</p>
            <p>I shal not need to examine anie of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for this place of Scripture is not the principal onlie, but
the onlie one produced by him to proov that the assent to the
word of God in general, is that whereby we ar said to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
and the rest proov no more then this, that such <hi>a faith</hi> is
reqisite to <hi>justification and salvation,</hi> and that without it a man
cannot be justified or saved: whereas the qestion is not, whither
all that ar <hi>justified</hi> have such <hi>a beleif of Gods word</hi> in general, or
<hi>of the Gospel</hi> in particular; which no man denies; but wither
such a beleif, be that faith or that act of faith wherby we ar
justified; which is that alone that is here qestioned, Yea the
rest of his <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as himself acknowledgeth, ar intended
onlie to disproov <hi>the particular application of the promise</hi> to be
<hi>the justifyeng act of faith;</hi> whereof more anon, when we have
done with some others of our own, who of the <hi>Dogmatical
Faith</hi> or <hi>beleif of the doctrine concerning Christ,</hi> approov and
affirm the same, that of the <hi>beleif of the word in general Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
