            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>My Lord,</hi> It would seem a great piece of Folly to make any impertinent Repetitions, in a Case so well known to the World; wherein every Paragraph is an Abstract out of Matters of Record: Only I am bound to acquaint Your <hi>Honour,</hi> that the late Lord High <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Your Father, was much concerned in several Transactions thereof, who I presume (if he were now Living) would Study all ways and means possible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Differences and Controversies in this Case, rather then suffer those things to be Argued publickly in the Highest Court of Iudicature, and there to remain unto Posterity; wherein the Kings Honour and Iustice would be exposed, by recriminating divers persons that lie under such Circumstances of Grand Mistakes and Oppression.</p>
            <p>The Memory of Sir <hi>William Courten</hi> and Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar,</hi> who had so déeply suffered in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> and of their great Services otherwise for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> readily Inclined His now Majesty and the Ministers of State in the year 1660. to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Cases more especially for Satisfaction and Reparation, which were Solicited several years together with great Industry and Expence, both at Home and Abroad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, otherwise then some preparatory means towards relief in two of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as follows, (that is to say.) First, Concerning Sir <hi>William Courten's</hi> Title to the <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> wherein he was Absolute Proprietor by Original Right of Discovery and Possession, which was referred to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, who found that by the Laws of Nations, and of this Kingdom, the Heirs and Assigns of Sir <hi>William
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98953:4"/>
Courten</hi> retained a Freehold in the said <hi>Island,</hi> having no ways forfeited the same for any Offence: Aud that the Patent to <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> mentioning him to be Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of the said <hi>Island,</hi> was declared void; and against Law. The Councel of <hi>Courten</hi> further affirming, that no Soveraign Prince or State could Disseize a person of a Uacancy possest by him at his own proper Costs and Charges, without manifest Injustice: And that it was against the Honour and Prudence, as well as the Iustice of a Nation, to despoil any Subject that laid out himself for the good of his Country: Yet no Restitution hath been made for the said <hi>Island</hi> and Plantations to the Heirs and Creditors of <hi>Courten,</hi> either by the King or the Planters, out of the Old Servile Rents of <hi>Sugar, Cotton</hi> or <hi>Tobacco</hi> for every head, due to the Original Proprietor, or out of the four and half <hi>per Cent</hi> of all Goods Exported, granted by the General Assembly of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> in lieu thereof to the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and since Assigned to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Concerning the Spoils and Depredations upon the two Ships, the <hi>Bona Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura</hi> in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> particularly excepted for Reparation by the 15<hi>th.</hi> Article of the Treaty concluded at <hi>London</hi> the 4<hi>th. September</hi> 1662. (no ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:) It was therefore thought necessary and convenient upon the farther Applications, (of the persons Interessed and Injured) to the King, and to the Parliament; that a War should be declared against the <hi>States General of the United Provinces,</hi> which was carried on at the vast Charge of the Kingdom: His Majesty being Graciously pleased upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that War, to express himself in a Speech to both Houses of Parliament as follows.</p>

                        <p>ANd you Gentlemen of the House of Commons; I know not whether it be worth My pains, to endeavour to remove a vile Jealousie, which Ill men scatter abroad, and which I am sure will never sink into the breast of any Man who is worthy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>it upon your Benches; that when you have given me a Noble and proportionable Supply for the support of a War, I may be induced by some evil Councellors (for they will be thought to think very respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my own person) to make a suddain Peace, and get all that Money for my own private occasions.</p>
                        <p>But let me tell you, and you may be most confident of it, That when I am compelled to enter into a War, for the Protection, Honour, and Benefit of my Subjects: I will (God Willing) not make a Peace, but upon the obtaining and securing those ends for which the War is entred into; and when that can be done, no good man will be sorry for the determination of it.</p>

            <p>IN the Month of <hi>May</hi> following, His Majesty out of a Iust sense of Sir <hi>William Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar's</hi> and their Partners Injuries, Damages and Losses in their Shipe, Goods and Commerce; did in pursuance of His own Authority and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative-Royal, Grant a Special Commission for Reprizals under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> grounded upon the Law of Nations, and the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue effectual in Law at all times, until the sum of 151612 <hi>l. Sterling Money,</hi> with incident Costs and Charges, should be Recovered, and Received, as by the Letters Patents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the Plea to His Majesties <hi>Scire Facias</hi> brought in the High Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining upon Record in the <hi>Petty-Bagg-Office,</hi> hereafter set forth at large more plainly appears.</p>
            <p>It is to be remarked, that during the War, several <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Ships, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships were taken by the Kings Men of War, and made Free Prize; but no part thereof given towards the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura,</hi> although earnestly sought after: Those Spoils of War (the Sacred Returns due to the Injur'd and Oppressed) the price of much Blood and Treasure spent in the Expeditions of <hi>Courten</hi> and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were otherwise imployed; <hi>Which lies heavy at the Doors of those that have eaten the Bread of the Fatherless and Widows, for whom the Land Mourns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98953:4"/>
               <hi>IT is to be considered, when the said Letters of Reprizal were put in Execution by Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> and his Associates, in the beginning of the year <hi>1666.</hi> The prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof was Arbitrarily suspended by Proclamation on the Tenth of <hi>August</hi> following, without any Iudicial hearing, their Seamen frequently taken away for the Kings Ships; His Royal Highness and His Secretary also pretending that it was prejudicial to their Interest in obstructing ordinary Letters of Marque during the War; <hi>Carew</hi> Committed to the <hi>Fleet</hi> by Order of the Council Board, and Enlarged by the Dreadful Flames on the <hi>2</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following; so that instead of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it proved a Grievance, the Ships and Goods Reprized being not sufficient to repair one half of the Costs and Charges in Equipping out Frigots towards recovery of the Debt: The Iniquity and Corruption of the Proctors and Common Claimers being such, that discouraged all men concerned in that Affair of Reprizals, which in the Nations of old were esteemed as Chattels Real, and Sacred Decrees, like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless, in the Month of <hi>June 1667.</hi> a Treaty was concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi> wherein it was mentioned (as it's said) that all Offences, Injuries, Losses and Damages should be buried in Oblivion; and all Letters of Reprizal Revoked, which Peace and Alliance continued for the space of four years: The <hi>Dutch</hi> Trading in <hi>English</hi> Bottoms, having a War with the <hi>French</hi> King: Then His Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a second War in Conjunction with <hi>France</hi> against the <hi>States General,</hi> which continued for the space of two years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DUring which time the Proprietors and Creditors Revived their Demands, and made fresh Applications to His Majesty in Council to be Relieved in a publick way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon several Orders were made at the Council Board: That Instructions should be sent to the Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries for that purpose: Which being delivered to the said <hi>George Carew</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Kings Letter to the said Embassadors, in the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1672. Intimating that the Obligations of all past Treaties being Cancelled, it was just and seasonable that provision should be made in the next Treaty for intire satisfaction of the Spoils and Damages of the two Ships <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura,</hi> according to the Liquidation in the Letters Patents; wherein the Debt was stated and confirmed under the Great Seal for Reparation as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>But in the Month of <hi>August,</hi> the States of <hi>Holland</hi> Apprehended the said <hi>Carew</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> notwithstanding his Passport (from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commissioners or Embassadors at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>) to Travel all parts of the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> and committed him and <hi>John Sherland</hi> to Prison, and Condemned the said <hi>Carew</hi> for a Spie and an Enemy of their Country, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the Good Intelligence and Understanding between the Ministers of State of both Nations; and would have Executed the said Sentence, if Mr. <hi>John Van Watchtendunck</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner of the <hi>States General,</hi> and Advocate <hi>Sass,</hi> had not been Prisoners in the <hi>Tower,</hi> for Crimes of a very High Nature; where they continued Prisoners, even as <hi>Carew</hi> and <hi>Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did during the War, which ended in a Separate Peace, (excluding <hi>France</hi>) concluded at <hi>London Feb.</hi> 9. 1663/4. Whereby the <hi>States General</hi> were to pay 800000 <hi>Pattacoons</hi> to the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> for Damages, at four equal Payments in four years; The first whereof was paid to Alderman <hi>Backwell,</hi> upon Ratification of the Treaty, to the Kings use, and the other three were Assigned to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for old Debts contracted between His Father and Grand-Father, and the late King <hi>Charles</hi>; The <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> being left in <hi>Statu quo,</hi> without any other regard.</p>
            <p>WHereupon several Questions were propounded concerning the special Grant aforesaid for Reprizals.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Frist,</hi> Whether in such a Case, under those Circumstances, the Debt of 151612 <hi>l.</hi> and Damages were extinguished or discharged.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98953:5"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Remedy could be taken away, or the Patent made null and void, without any Satisfaction or Reparation to the Persons Interessed and Injured.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Being Resolved by Councel Learned in the Laws on the Negative, as follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>As to the first,</hi> That no Act of State, unless by Parliament, can bind the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Right of the Subject, without satisfaction first made; and that the King could not Release or Discharge any one that had done a private Injury, to a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but that still be might pursue his Right by way of Law.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Letters of Reprizal granted of Common Right, and not of Grace and Favour; when once the Power is vested in the Subject, pursuant to the Law, without any other Limitation, then until the Debt and Damages shall be Recovered and Received: The same cannot be bound or suspended by any subsequent Act of the King without Reparation; the Laws of <hi>England</hi> having so secured the Subject, that it's not in the Kings power to dispose of His Subjects Goods.</item>
            </list>
            <p>THe Arguments they used to make good their Assertions <hi>(inter alia)</hi> were, that the Letters Patents before-mentioned was a Iudicial Act, whereby there was granted and confirmed such a permanent and Legal Authority, vested with an Interest in Law for satisfaction of the Debt of 151612 <hi>l.</hi> (and not a bare Ambulatory and Temporary Authority or Commission recoverable at pleasure,) for that such special Grants are required in due form of Law after divers Proceedings, Citations, Admonitions and Chargable Process in making out the Debt and Damages that oftentimes exceede the demands before they can attain unto Letters of Reprizal, Iudicially to remain upon Record until satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reparation, otherwise the Consequences in Cases of Spoils might prove danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and destructive to Civil Society and Commerce, there being no other way or Remedy under Heaven left for Recovery and Reparations for Injuries, Spoils and Depredations done to the particular Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> since the old Writs, <hi>De Arresto Facto super bonis Mercatorum alieni genium pro Transgr' &amp;c.</hi> in the Register, and <hi>F. N. B.</hi> were taken away by the Statute Laws of the Realm, whereby Reprizals were to Issue forth without delay in lieu thereof, for satisfaction of Wrongs, Losses and Dammages, and the Law must not in any Case be rendred ineffectual.</p>
            <p>However, upon these Considerations several Addresses were made by the Proprietors and Interessed Creditors to the King, and the <hi>States General</hi> Respectively, not omitting the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whose Fortunes were raised by the last War, when he was restored to the Offices, Honours and Profits of his Father and Grandfather (through the Sweat; Blood and Labours of <hi>English</hi> men,) to have some satisfaction out of the Eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Pattacoons,</hi> or any other ways as might seem most expedient.</p>
            <p>But nothing could be obtained, no not so much as a Hearing of their Cause. Then least a failer of Iustice in this Case should be urged by the Foraign Creditors of <hi>Courten</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> or brought as a President against <hi>England,</hi> where there was always the severest profession of Iustice: Three Ships were entred into the Admiralty Court by the Proprietors, with the Commanders Names, number of Men, Guns and Provision, to Reprize what they could of the said Debt and Dammages, according to the purport and intent of the said Letters Patents: But upon notice thereof to the <hi>States General,</hi> they Interposed by their Embassador to obstruct the prosecution; then a pretended <hi>Super Sedeas</hi> issued forth, afterwards a Proclamation to hinder the due Proceedings at Law; yet all this while no offer was made of any Satisfaction, either by the <hi>States General,</hi> or the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or by the King of <hi>England,</hi> or any of their Ministers of State respectively.</p>
            <p>Afterwards a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship being Laden with <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Prunes,</hi> was taken by one of the said Commanders, near the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> in the Mouth of <hi>December</hi> 1680. in order to a Condemnation towards the Debt and Dammages aforesaid: Yet several persons were so Blood Thirsty, Malicious and Ignorant in the Laws of <hi>England</hi>; as to prosecute the said Commander and his Seamen, apprehending them with Warrants, which they procured in the Kings Name, whereby they were Arrested as Pyrats and Felons; the said Warrants being as follows in <hi>haec verba.</hi>

               <p>The matters of Fact in Issue were proved that they had taken such a Ship and Goods in the said Warrants mentioned; and it was insisted upon by the Advocate General, and Councel for the King, That the said Ship and Goods were taken Pyratically and Feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, without any Legal Authority or Commission, after two Treaties of State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they pretended the Letters Patents for Reprizal were extinguished, and made null and void, being so recited in a pretended <hi>Supersedeas</hi> under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; and likewise in the Kings Proclamation, mentioning that the said Letters Patents and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for Reprizals were revoked before the said Ship was Seized.</p>
               <p>It was also alleadged, that there was not a due Entry made with Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of the Admiralty of the Captains Ship, Named the <hi>George Bona Adventura,</hi> with the number of Men, Guns and Provis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Unto which the Prisoners at the Bar (and Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> who gave the Captain his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission) pleaded the Legality of the same, with the Entry in due Form: Which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission being read in Court, <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98953:7"/>NOtwithstanding the said Letters Patent were read in Court (hereafter recited at large in the Plea to the <hi>Seire Facias</hi>;) Sir <hi>Lyonel Jenkins</hi> persisted to the Iury, that by the Laws of Nations, the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> had made null and void all Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal: That the Kings Proclamation was of a sufficient Authority to bind all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and that His Majesty having the power of Peace and War, all people were to take notice thereof: Unto which the Prisoners replyed, that the putting the Letters of Reprizal into Execution, was no breach of the Peace, neither was any thing done <hi>Felo Animo</hi> in prosecution of the said Commission, or Piratically in pursuance of that Authority contained in the Letters Patents, and that they had used the <hi>Dutch</hi> Master and Seamen with all Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humanity, set them on Shoar with all their Apparel, and what else they pleased to take with them.</p>
               <p>Then one of the Learned Iudges insisted, that the Commission was voidable at the Kings pleasure, being but a bare Authority, and determinable at the Kings Will.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Prisoners at the Bar Craved to be heard by Mr. <hi>Wallup,</hi> Mr. <hi>Molloy,</hi> and others their Councel, to those points in Law; who replyed that the King had by His Graut vested the Subjects in this Case, with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir <hi>Lyonel Jenkins</hi> then further urged (erroniously) that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had not any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Monition</hi> for Examination of Witnesses that made proof of the Spoils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predation: And that the said Letters Patents for Peprizal being Granted in time of War, the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> could make no defence against it: Which was otherwise, the <hi>Monition</hi> being fixed upon a Piller of the <hi>Exchange</hi> in the year 1644. and partecular notice given to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embassador to Cross Examine the said Deponents (if he pleased.) And that the <hi>East-India</hi> Company had sufficient notice and warning two years together, by Memorials that the Grant for Reprizals would pass in that nature for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Debt and Damages, being so recited in the body of the Record. Several other Arguments were used, and the Major part of the Iudges seemed satisfied therewith.</p>
               <p>Then Iudge <hi>Raymond</hi> and Iudge <hi>Wyndham</hi> urged that the Iury might find the Matter Specially, which was opposed by divers of the Iudges; Sir <hi>Job Charleton</hi> sayi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon Sir <hi>Lyonel Jenkins</hi> bound over Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> in a Recognizance, under a great Penalty, with Caution to answer to an Information at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar</hi> the first day of <hi>Easter</hi> Term following; and would have kept his Original Patent under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which was Exhibited and read in Court as an Evidence on the behalf of the Prisoners at the Bar upon their Tryal; Sir <hi>Lyonel</hi> pretending that it ought to be detained by way of prevention, for that Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> intended to set forth other Ships upon the like occasion: But several of the Iudges answered, that the Patent being brought into Court as Evidence by Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> it ought to be returned to him; Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> alleadging it as a very unreasonable thing, that they who came to give Iudgment in Cases of Depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, should be guilty of it themselves, so the Patent was retur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We out of the just sense We then had, and still have of their unjust Sufferings in that business, both by Our own Letters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Sign</hi> Manual <hi>to the</hi> States General <hi>of the</hi> Vnited Provinces, <hi>and by Sir</hi> George Downing <hi>Knight and Baronet, Our Envoy Extraordinary, to whom We gave Especial Command so to do, required satisfaction to be made according to the Rules of Justice, and the Amity and good Correspondence, which We then desired to conserve with them firm and Inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And whereas after several Addresses made to the said</hi> States General <hi>by Our said Envoy, and nothing granted effectual for relief of Our said Subjects, (whom We take Our selves, in Honour and Justice, concerned to be satisfied and repaired) We lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the said Sir</hi> George Downing <hi>to intimate and signify to the said</hi> States, <hi>that We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their final Answer, concerning satisfaction to be made for the said Ships and Goods by a time then prefixed, and since elapsed, that We might so govern Our selves thereupon, that Our aforesaid Subjects might be Relieved according to Right and Justice: And yet no Satisfactory Answer hath been given, so that We cannot but apprehend it to be, not only a fruitless endeavour, but a prostituting of Our Honour and Dignity, to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Application, after so many Denials and Slightings. And whereas</hi> Iohn Exton, <hi>Doctor of Laws, Judge of Our High Court of Admiralty of</hi> England, <hi>upon Our Command, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify to Us the value of the Losses, and Damages sustained by the said</hi> William Courten <hi>and Partners, whose Interest is now vested in Our loving Subjects, Sir</hi> Edmond Turnor <hi>Knt.

               <p>ON the first day of <hi>Easter</hi>-Term the said <hi>George Carew</hi> appeared in person at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> and moved the Court by Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> his Councel, that his Appearance might be Recorded, which was done accordingly; But no Information was brought in against the said <hi>Carew</hi> all that Term: Then in <hi>Trinity-Term</hi> following, the said <hi>Carew</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Clerk in the <hi>Petty-bagg</hi> to give Rules that the <hi>Attorney-General</hi> might Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the said Plea, that Issue might be joyned in that Affair, to make all things ripe for a final determination in Parliament; either upon a Writ of Error, or otherwise as occasion should offer: But to this day no further Prosecution is made at the Kings Instance concerning the <hi>Scire Facias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore several of the persons Interessed, in pursuance of an Assignment indented, and made the 14<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1666. between the said <hi>George Carew</hi> of the one part, and <hi>Iohn Graham</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> and <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> Gent. of the other part; agreed to make a new Entry of five Ships and Pinnaces in due Form, with the Register of the Admiralty Court <hi>(de bene esse)</hi> the week after <hi>Trinity</hi> Term; and to set forth the same to Sea from time to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98953:11"/>
time, until the said Debt and Damages should be Recovered, or a Composition made for the same, according to the true intent and meaning of the said Letters Patents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the Plea to the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> aforesaid, which they entred accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> in several Acts of Parliament are very positive in it; that persons spoiled at Sea, shall have the Law of Reprizals for their relief: By the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> Goods taken wrongfully away were to be restored fourfold, which implyed the Damages sustained, and the Costs in acquiring restitution: By all Christian Precepts and Examples, since Christianity came into the World; it was practised in all Ages, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution was injoyned before any Absolution where the persons were of ability to do it.</p>
               <p>To inforce the Argument in this Case something further, it may be observed, (in the Patent recited in the Plea) that the King foreseeing it was against all Natural Justice to mention any Pardon, without a Restitution and Compensation to the Parties Injured; the Hand points at the words. ☞ <hi>That notwithstanding any Peace concerning General Reprizals, yet this Remedy remains until satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. Which imploys, that although he remits the <hi>Crimen Lasae Majestatis,</hi> the particular Injury relates to particular Persons: Nothing is more usual then Appeals of private persons after Soveraign Pardons; whereby the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals have suffered for not making their Peace with the particular persons next of Blood.</p>
               <p>But some will object, that a Soveraign Prince may <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> give away a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Debt of his Subject, although ascertained under the greatest circumstances: But whether that assertion be consistent with the Law of <hi>England,</hi> or that the particular should be satisfied out of the publick Purse, or left to the proper Remedy granted. I leave it to better Judgments upon Arguing the Plea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is remarkable,</hi> that the said <hi>Daniel Gyles</hi> made a Contract with the <hi>Dutch</hi>-Skipper, that he should give him the said <hi>Gyles</hi> 100. <hi>l. Sterling</hi> to Seize the said Captain <hi>Gwyther</hi> and his men, who lay at Anchor near <hi>Cows-Castle,</hi> with two of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen on Board in the Prize-Ship, and an <hi>English</hi> Pilot, that the Captain had Hired in the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi> to bring the said Prize-Ship to <hi>London,</hi> in order to her Condemnation.</p>
               <p>And that the said <hi>Daniel Gyles,</hi> in pursuance of his Contract, Hired several Boats with Soldiers, and came on board the said Prize-Ship, called the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and there demanded (<hi>ex officio,</hi> as he pretended) the Captains Commission, and took it from him, and the Money he had; and Secured the said Captain and Seamen in <hi>Cows-Castle</hi> about the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1680. then took away the Prize-Ship, wherein were seven pair of Pistols, Swords and Pole-Axes of the Captains, with all the <hi>English</hi> mens Bedding and Provisions that Boarded the said Ship, which the said <hi>Gyles</hi> Seized and kept, and alledged he might do it by virtue of the Kings Proclamation.</p>
               <p>THat in <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term following the said <hi>Gyles</hi> appearing upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> several Actions were brought against him in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for the said Ship, Wine and other Goods; whereupon he was Arrested, and carried into the <hi>Powltry-Compter</hi>: Who after several days Confinement, being not able to give Bail, moved the Court he might be Discharged upon Common Bail; notwithstanding the Actious were for <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Conversion,</hi> and Actions for Trespass on the Case, at the Suits of the Proprietors, the Captain and Seamen respectively, to the Damages of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards: Nevertheless the said <hi>Gyles</hi> was Discharged by Rule of Court upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bail; then the Ship and Goods were delivered in an Arbitrary way, by Order of the Councel Table to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and to Sir <hi>Robert Holmes,</hi> who dispossessed the <hi>English</hi> Interessed persons of their Ship and Goods, contrary to the Laws of Property, and the Established Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to the great Dishonour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Damages of the persons Interessed and Injured as aforesaid; who are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of their Right in the ordinary course of Iustice, against the said <hi>Daniel Gyles</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> for the Ship and her Lading; as also for False Imprisonment of the Men, and detainng their Arms and other Goods from them.</p>

               <head>A short Narrative of the Life and Death of Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>That Sir <hi>Paul Pyndars</hi> Estate in the Year 1639 was valued and cast up by Sir <hi>Pauls</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which then amounted to 236000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, besides desperate Debts, and that two parts of the same was then imbarqued with the King upon several assignments out of divers branches of the Revenue towards the ordinary charge of the <hi>Crown,</hi> the greatest part whereof remaines at this time unsatisfied, being charged upon the collections of the late Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> out of the Fines and Compositions of Popish Recusants Estates, in the Northern Countles, the Allom-Farm Sugar-Farm, pretermitted Customes and several Charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soap-Boylers and Dyars Companies and other persons as by the several Records there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of inrolled in <hi>Chancery</hi> appears.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> was born at <hi>Wellingbrough</hi> in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> bred up at school there, until the age of sixteen years, then put forth by his Father to be an Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Parvish</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant who sent him as his Factor at 18. years old to <hi>Venice</hi> where he resided several years and had divers Commissions from several Nations. At his return for <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company having received many kind Offices and Advertisements of Trade in his transactions abroad, and knowing him to be well learned in the <hi>Italian</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkish</hi> Languages, made their applications to <hi>King Iames</hi> in the year 1611. that his Majesty would be pleased at the said Companies Request to send him Embassador to the Grand Seignior at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he resided for the space of Eleven years and upwards to the great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company by his improving the <hi>Levant</hi> Trade.</p>
               <p>Soon after his return in the year 1623. King <hi>Iames</hi> having Knighted him, offered him as a Reward of his Services to make him his Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> which Sir <hi>Paul</hi> humbly refused, and the rather in regard his Majesty desired to purchase Sir <hi>Pauls</hi> Diamond Jewel of <hi>Thirty Thousand Pound</hi> value upon Credit, that he brought home from <hi>Turkey,</hi> which he lent King <hi>Iames</hi> to wear at divers times on days of great sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

first, (In regard there was an Imbargo upon that Jewel against any Transportation) and other Jewels of the Crown, which are not paid for to this day: The <hi>Allome</hi> Farm, and other Branches of the Revenue Assigned for satisfaction, being diverted to other uses.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the first made him one of the Farmers of his Customs in company with Sir <hi>Iohn Wolstenholme,</hi> Sir <hi>Abraham Dawes</hi> and others, who by Covenants in their contract gave exact yearly Accounts of their Profits, whereby that Branch of the Revenue, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly known, to the end that the Farmers Gaines were not to be exorbitant, to the prejudice of the Crown, or the damage of the Subjects.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi> having in his Life-time, given ten thousand Pounds towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, dyed in the year 1650. much lamented of the Poor, who wanted not his charity all his life time. <hi>William Toomes</hi> made Probate of his Will, and took upon him the sole Execution thereof, and dyed a <hi>Felo de se</hi> in the Year 1655: having wasted most of the Estate, and paid none of the Debts or Legacies.</p>
               <p>Then Administration with the Will annexed being granted to Sir <hi>William Powel</hi> aliàs <hi>Hinson</hi> Baronet, he got only the Sum of 500 <hi>l.</hi> from <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> Son and Heir and Executor of <hi>Spencer</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> in part of a Debt of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> due from the said Earl, <hi>Spencer,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Compton</hi> his Brother, to the Estate of Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar.</hi> The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the said Debt being yet owing and standing out upon bond; The Sones and Heirs of both the Obligors who enjoy their Fathers Lands refusing to pay the said Debt (which their Ancestors contracted in the year 1639. being ready Money lent them at Interest for their necessary occasions) and suffer themselves to be sued at Law for the same, while others want their bread that they eat.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Administration was granted to the said <hi>George Carew</hi> in the Letters patents for Reprizals before mentioned, wherein the most visible part of Sir <hi>Paul Pyndar</hi>'s Estate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, yet many difficulties and obstructions are laid in the way from coming to that poor remainder in this age of Forgetfulness. Yet I hope it will not be in these our days as it was in the times of old when the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> complained that <hi>Iudgment is turned backward, and Iustice Standeth far off, for Truth is fallen in the Street and Equity cannot enter. Yea, Truth faileth, and he that refraineth from Evil maketh himself a Prey,</hi> and the Text saith, <hi>that the Lord was displeased that there was no Iudgment, and when he saw that there was no man, he wondred that none would offer himself.</hi> From whence it may be inferred, that they who suffer Injuries and Oppressions without Process and Appeal for Justice, do not only betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Cause, but the Interest of their Country and the Laws of the Realm under which they have, or ought to have protection.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>THe Petitions mentioned in the Preface concerning the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts thereof, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Depredations, Debts of the Crown, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Demands from several persons Inhabitants in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> being all Contracted into the Proposals aforesaid; there needs no Recitals of them at large, especially since they were reduced into Orders of the Councel-Board Dated the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1677. and other References from the King to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ministers of State for Releif of the Respective Petitioners, who humbly present this Epitome to some few and proper Hands. The Old <hi>Maxime</hi> in the Law of <hi>England</hi> is, <hi>That the King can do no wrong</hi>: From whence the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is very plain and obvious, that the Officers and Ministers of the Crown, have not only been wanting to the King and His Subjects, in the due Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice, but have Exposed the Honour and Interest of the Kingdom to Reproach in Foreign Nations, where once the Government of <hi>England</hi> had the Glory and Reputation above all Soveraignties in the World, for Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Righteous Judgment and Equity.</p>
               <p>The Law being a tender point, and Property the same, ought to be warily and circumspectly handled: Wherefore he that voucheth any thing for Truth, (that is False) upon Record in Cases of this Nature, ought to suffer the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est punishment imaginable; for that not only the Judicature, but the Pollicy and Prudence of a Nation are all called into question from one Generation to another.</p>
               <p>Upon the Agreement in the Treaty between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> so Solemnly made at <hi>London</hi> in the year 1662. the Spoils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ships <hi>Bona Esperanza</hi> and <hi>Henry Bona Adventura</hi> were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Satisfied and Repaired, with the Restitution of <hi>Polleroon.</hi> Whereupon the said <hi>George Carew</hi> putting great Confidence in the said Stipulation, Satisfied and pay'd the persons mentioned in his Plea to the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> aforesaid, by Sale of his Land in <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> to Mr. <hi>Thomas Foley</hi> for 3800 <hi>l.</hi> and Mortgaged his other Estate in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Richmond</hi> for the further Prosecution of his Right, whereby he hath pay'd Interest 13 years last past; and now the remainder of his Estate being like to be Torn in pieces by Sir <hi>Iames Butler</hi> and the said <hi>Thomas Coleman</hi> for 4680 <hi>l.</hi> due upon the said Mortgages respectively after great Fines formerly Exacted by Lords of the Manor and their Agents in the said <hi>Carew</hi>'s Absence for non-payment of Interest at the days certain. Notwithstanding all the Advantages made by some persons out of the vast Sums of Money given by the Commons in Parliament (for Protection of the Subjects) in maintaining the Wars against <hi>Holland</hi>; the Effects whereof applicable to <hi>Carew,</hi> were As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Strangers: While other Creditors of a different nature were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon him in his quality as Administrator, for Debts amounting unto two hundred and fourscore thousand Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> ready Money Lent to <hi>Courten</hi> and <hi>Pyndar,</hi> some now wanting Bread, others Necessaries and Moneys, all crying out that their Reparations are in Prospect by one means or other, divers prompting on the Proposals, others the Reprizals: Under all those sad Circumstances aforesaid, yet none of them despairing, but that at last the Eyes and Ears of all persons in Power and Authority to do Justice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will be open, (after all the Addresses made to His Majesty through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, and His most Gracious answers thereunto) to relieve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and Oppressed, according to the Rules of Law.</p>
