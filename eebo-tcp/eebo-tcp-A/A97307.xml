            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Few Words in Tenderneſs TO THE WELL-MEANING PROFESSORS, ſuiting the Preſent Seaſon.</head>
            <p>UPon the ſerious Conſideration of the various and long continued Conteſts and Oppoſitions of all Sorts of People againſt us, the contemptible People of the Lord, called <hi>Quakers;</hi> it hath ſeemed moſt ſtrange and grievous, that any of the Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who have had any Simplicity of Heart to God, and known any inward Work of the Spirit of Truth, ſhould joyn with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who know not God, to make void that Bleſſed Work, which the God of Heaven by his pure eternal Spirit hath begun to work in our Dayes in theſe deſpiſed People, who have given up their Souls to ſerve him, and for whom their very Lives would not be dear unto them to give up for his Name <hi>ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O unto you, who have had any experimental Knowledge of God and of Chriſt, through the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit in you; unto you is my very Soul drawn out in tender Love and Compaſſion, deſiring that the God of Heaven would open your Eyes, and give you a clear, ſpiritual and certain Knowledge of the inward State of your Souls before him, and bring you to the Obedience of his Heavenly Will, for, for this very Cauſe, for not being Obedient &amp; anſwering the Lord in his Requirings Hardneſs of Heart is come over you, and Darkneſs hath covered you; ſo that that Simplicity and Tenderneſs that was once in you in the Time of God's Viſitation, is much defaced, and an Enmity ſprung up in you againſt the Appearance of God amongſt us.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you bear with me; for the Zeal of God is upon me, and dear and tender Love to your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls: Know you this all you who have any Simplicity and Tenderneſs left in you, that I now directly ſtand for God, and in his Name I plead with you and for you, that you may be reconciled to him, and that the Enmity that is yet in any of you againſt God's Heavenly Appearance and Revelation of his Son in us might be taken away; for God is exalting his Son over all, even this is the Work of God <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this his Day, to exalt his Name above every Name, and we, the deſpiſed Remnant, are made Witneſſes of the Heavenly Appearance of the Son of God, and cannot but teſtifie of him: I ſay, we are made Witneſſes by God, through the Revelation of Chriſt in us, a Holy Conſtraint is upon us, and not of or from our ſelves or any Act of our own, but through the Begetting of Life we are made willing to exalt his Name in the Earth: And herein our Hearts are ſingle before him, having no other Thing in our Eye, but the lifting up and ſpreading that bleſſed Name; and herein I can appeal to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth of the Integrity of my Heart to him, having this Faith begotten in me of the Lord, that while I ſtand in Simplicity and Singleneſs of Heart to him, he will be my Strength, and keep me in the Hour of Temptation, that I fall not, or ever turn my Back upon him; for truly I muſt confeſs that this Way of Truth which the Lord hath brought me to, is a very narrow and ſtreight Way, ſo ſtreight, that if I could have found Peace and Satisfaction out of it, I had not now been a Travailer in it: for being once tempted by the God of this World to withdraw my ſelf from the Lord's People, and to retire and get from under his Yoak, the Lord purſued me with his Judgments, and Reſt and Peace was taken from me, that I cryed out, <hi>That it was a great Strength to be willing to live in the Earth:</hi> But the Lord fetched me in from my Wandering, and I was made to return to the God of my Life, and in my very Soul bowed to him, who is become my Defence and Holder up of my Head in the midſt of many Enemies raiſed up by the Power of Darkneſs againſt us, to lay us waſt, and to make void our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the God of Heaven in this Generation: But God will exalt his Name, and in vain do Men ſtrive againſt him; for their very Strivings ſhall turn to the Advantage of his Name and People, and the Shame of his Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Oh my Soul hath travailed for our Adverſaries; for having in Years paſt been one with them in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I cannot but have Love to them, and have cryed to the Lord for them; Oh that they had an Ear to hear, they would then certainly bow to that bleſſed Truth miniſtred in God's Authority by his choſen Ones: And a ſtrong Belief is in me, that the Lord will bore the Ears of many ſimple Hearts amongſt them, and cauſe the Sound of his Everlaſting Goſpel to enter; and it ſhall be a Day of glad Tidings to as many as ſhall receive it.</p>
            <p>The God of Heaven open the Eyes of all the Profeſſing People in this Nation, that all may dread and fear before him, and conſider what they are doing in ſetting themſelves againſt that living Word of God revealed in us. O Friends, it will be too ſtrong for you; for it is not any fine coyned Notions that we publiſh to pleaſe the Ears of the Curious, Wiſe and Lofty; No, no; but it is the living Word, the mighty Word, the very Word of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth that we exalt among Men, that Word that redeems from the Power of Satan all ſuch as in Love receive it: It is that Word that comes not to us by the Will, Power or Wiſdom of Man, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt; nor no Man on Earth can attain to the Underſtanding of it, but by the Spirit of Jeſus; a Man muſt be born of the Spirit before he can know the Things of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And here lyes the chief Ground of all that Warring and Contendings againſt us, a different Birth, Children of an other Birth, though high and lofty in their Notions of God, and Chriſt, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that if they were indeed what they ſpeak, they were honourable; but the Root of the firſt Birth, and all Words from it are of another Nature, and want a living Spring: It is the firſt Man in his beſt Robe, that runs before he is ſent, and in his own Wiſdom would mannage the Things of God and his Kingdom, before he knows the Power from on high, to break and confound all his curious Wiſdom of Words, and to make him as a little Child; <hi>firſt,</hi> to deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that he might grow thereby, and then in the Strength of the Word of Life, to miniſter according to the Gift recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>And in this firſt Birth are all the Children of the Fleſh and Shadow exalting themſelves, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Heavenly Appearances of Life in all their ſeveral Forms of Religion; and herein lyes their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Unity one with another, in ſetting themſelves againſt the enlightned People of the Lord, who own their Enlightnings and Teachings from himſelf alone, and cannot ſatisfie themſelves in their own Willings and Strivings in their own Wiſdoms and Underſtandings, but wait for the Miniſtration of the Spirit of Life and Power.</p>
            <p>Now wherefore is it that you all joyn together againſt us, and have Enmity to us? Have you Peace in ſo doing? Are you juſtified before God herein? And have you Hope hereby to lay us waſt? O know aſſuredly, ſuch Hope is vain, and ſhall certainly periſh; for our Foundation ſtandeth ſure.</p>
            <p>O the Sen<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e I have had of the Power of Darkneſs, ſtrong Workings at this Day againſt us, to render us infamous in the Eyes of all People, not only as <hi>No Chriſtians,</hi> but as <hi>Deceivers, Juglers, Equivocators</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> and as having a <hi>Diabolical Spirit.</hi> O thick Darkneſs, that we ſhould be ſo judged by a <hi>Profeſſing People;</hi> but we know we have a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> in the Hearts of many, which the Enmity of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> cannot deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Lord, what have we done? Whoſe Cauſe have we eſpouſed? What Kingdom and Intereſt ſeek we to exalt, but the God of Heavens? We can in the Integrity of our Souls appeal unto him, and ſtand over the Heads of our Adverſaries, and in true Patience bear with all the Revilings and Reproaches of Men of all Sorts, counting it not a new Thing for the true Servants of the Lord to be ſo dealt with, when Chriſt himſelf found the hardeſt Meaſure from the ſtricteſt Profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> who doing ſuch wonderful Things, even to Aſtoniſhment, and which they were Witneſſes of, and could not deny; yet their Darkneſs and Enmity was ſuch, as to ſtrike at his very Root and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which he did thoſe wonderful Things, ſaying, <hi>He had a Devil, a Diabolical Spirit, and that by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of Devils he did thoſe mighty Things;</hi> and never reſted till they murthered him. Oh that the ſame Spirit were not to be found among ſome of you.</p>
            <p>But I dare not charge all among you, believing that ſome have true Deſires after God and his Truth, and truly deſire more of the Knowledge of him, for whoſe ſakes I had ſome Conſtraint upon me to publiſh theſe Things, to provoak you to a Retirement of Spirit, and to an inward Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your States before the Lord, what you are in his pure ſpiritual Light; and if in the true Meaſure of the Light of the Lord in you, you feel not a cloſing with our Teſtimony, and have ſome Savour of our Life, then wait in that true ſpiritual Light, that the Lord may reveal it to you; and judge not thoſe Things you know not, nor turn in Enmity to us, leſt Hardneſs come over you, and Darkneſs cover you.</p>
            <p>But if in the Singleneſs of Heart before the Lord you can receive our Teſtimony, then be not haſty, but wait in the Light of the Lord for Strength, that you may come to the Obedience of his Heavenly Will; <hi>For it is the Obedient that inherit the Good of the Land, and whoſe Souls delight in Fatneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And until I was brought to Obdience and Subjection, I could never witneſs Satisfaction; for great and long hath the Travail of my Soul been after the Lord, even from a Child the Fear of God was upon me, and ſome Deſires ſtirring in me after him under ſeveral Forms of Religion, and ſtill I followed that Miniſtry and People where I found moſt of the Life of Jeſus, and when I ſaw too much exalting of Form and idolizing of them, and an inward Decline of that firſt Simplicity and Zeal that was once among many, and that Religion was grown a Worldly Intereſt and a Foot-ſtool to Promotion, my Soul loathed it.</p>
            <p>And upon the very hearing of a poor deſpicable People in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of their Behaviours, Words and Converſations, my Soul cloſed with them, with Senſe and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, that they were <hi>the Choſen of the Lord,</hi> and then ſaw and declared of the Seaſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their coming forth, <hi>That when the pure Simplicity and living Teſtimony was juſt expiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Profeſſors of the Nation; the Lord, who would not leave himſelf without Witneſs in every Age &amp; Generation, in due Seaſon raiſed up his Witneſs afreſh in a poor inconſiderable People to bear up his Name in the Earth, whoſe Teſtimony was in Spirit, and in Life, and Power:</hi> Upon which moſt of the Prieſts and formal Profeſſors in the Nation was ſtirred, and provoaked, and joyned together to oppoſe them; and though they themſelves in their Zeal had cryed to God, <hi>to ſend f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rth his Light and his Truth, and that the Kingdom of Chriſt might be exalted, and that he would pour out of his Spirit upon his Sons and Daughters:</hi> yet when the Lord had choſen and raiſed a People thus to bear his Name, and to exalt his Truth on Earth, and to proclaim the Great Day of the Lord <hi>to level the Mountains, and to lay low the Lofty of the Earth, and to bring Proud Fleſh into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to raiſe the Poor to inherit the Kingdom:</hi> Inſtead of meeting with the Lord, who was about to perform thoſe great Things themſelves deſired in the Day of their Tenderneſs, they evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated thoſe bleſſed Meſſengers, and overlookt them for their Meaneſs, and ſpake all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Evil of them, <hi>Impriſoning, Whipping, Stocking and reproachfully reviling them,</hi> many of whom dyed in their Impriſonment: And I do believe had not the Lord in his Righteous Judgment taken Power from them, they would have been farther deeply guilty of the Blood of the Innocent.</p>
            <p>But my hearty Deſire for all that are tender-hearted among you, who have the Fear of the Lord upon you, that you take heed that you be not leavened with that Perſecuting and Anti-chriſtian Spirit; for the very ſame that now reproach us, and would <hi>unchriſtian</hi> us, would deſtroy us if it had Power.</p>
            <p>But the Hand of the Lord is to be ſeen in ſuffering all theſe Storms of Oppoſitions againſt us, to provoak us to the more Watchfulneſs and Diligence, and to brighten our Teſtimony for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, whom in Spirit and Truth we ſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore unto him do I commit our Cauſe, who ſets Bounds to the Seas, and ſtills its Raging, who can appeaſe the Wrath of Man, and ſcatter the thick Clouds of Dark<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
