            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Narrative of a Prodigious Toad, ſeen at the <hi>Devils-Arſe</hi>-o'th-<hi>Peak,</hi> in <hi>Darby-Shire.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere is nothing ſo common as Natures variation through luxury or poverty of matter, and ſome concurrent accidents, which taking the opportunity of time and place, aſsiſt in producing ſuch an Animal Mineral, or Vegetine, as becauſe of it's rarity will ſeem ſtrange to the world.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Barnicles</hi> ſome years ago, nay now, are not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ninth part of ten of the Nation, though ſeveral Authours have writ, and many thouſands ſeen the manner nature has contrived for them; they therefore that can have little belief for any thing, of which they have not had an occular demonſtration are not expected to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this enſuing Relation.</p>
            <p>HAlf a Dozen of the meaner ſort of <hi>Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> deſigned a Hunting, Courſing or Potching rather, having for that purpoſe got Beagles, Grey-hounds, and a Peece or two, thus furniſhed, they beat about the Peak, where they ſtarted a Hare as ſome held, others a Rabbet, which they eagerly followed, until that frightned Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151826:2"/>
ran into a hollow in the earth; at the entrance of which ſtood the Dogs, not daring to go in; but when the company came together, and had conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a while, they reſolved to enter and drive out the prey, the cavity being large enough, the moſt couragious went in a good way, but one whoſe heart or wearineſs had cauſed to ſtay behind, ſat him down on a great ſtone looſe and moveable; and whether by fitting down he ſtirred the Stone, he preſently conceived his fellows were gone too far, he called them back, telling them, that what they looked for was under the ſtone he ſat on: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they returned, carrying a Beagle or two in, which durſt not voluntarily approach, then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſpectly they turned the ſtone, but found their expectations jilted, for which they called the Informer a ſilly Coxcomb, who had hindred their further ſearch; but he confidently aver'd he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſomething move, and laying his hands an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly upon the ſtone, laid his fingers upon a round hole in't, into which he try'd to thruſt his hand, but failing, cry'd, he would lay his Soul to a Pot of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-Ale,</hi> that the prey got in at that hole, upon which they all try'd, and one whoſe hand was ſlenderer, thruſt it in, arm and all, and finding his utmoſt fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to touch a hairy live body, ſwore bloodily, and curſt himſelf to the Devil, it was a Rabbit, for he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151826:3"/>
felt it; upon which the Inventor reply'd, I knew I could not be deceived, then they all agreed to roul the ſtone out, being near to the mouth, but they were never the better to further their deſign.</p>
            <p>The moſt ingenious of them cut a Bryer, ſlitting the end of it a croſs, and afterwards cut it to point towards the middle, and gently thruſt it in, until he found it ſtopt upon ſomething that was ſoft, then he began tenderly to turn it, and drew out a hoary furr, which they concluded to be the belly of the Rabbet; after many eſſays, finding themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, they reſolved rather then looſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, to get ſome Iron Mawls and Barrs, and ſo break the ſtones to pieces; which they borowed, and preſently fell to Work, and after conſiderable pains they ſplit the ſtone, in the midſt of which to their amazement and great diſappointment, they found a Toad of prodigious ſhape and ſize.</p>
            <p>After their aſtoniſhment was ſomething over, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger took place, which they intended to vent againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent poor creature; when by meer accident a Stranger came by, and ſeeing in what confuſion they ſtood, drew near and was equally ſurprized, but finding that they had prepared to brain the poor Creature with part of his own Caſtle, entreated them to forbear, and to recompence their pains in ſome meaſure, he would gratifie their Civility with a Dozen of Ale, which they gladly accepted of, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151826:3"/>
immediately went to Drink, whilſt he had the liberty of viewing this monſtrous creature, which he found to have all the parts of a <hi>Toad</hi> and more; therefore having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent skill in Limning, and having the advantage of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Paper about him, did with all exactneſs Draw this ſtrange Animal, which from his own hands came to mine, whoſe Deſcription you ſhall now have, and when the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graver with whom the figure is, has finiſhed it, that ſhall be alſo preſented to you.</p>
            <p>This Creature was in Length exactly Fourteen Inches: as it Sat it was Ten Inches and a Half over; upon the hinder parts of his Back, and the fore-part eight and a Barley Corn, how high it might ſtand he knew not, for it ſat all the while crooling down; its noſe was as black as jet, proportionable to the reſt of its body, and of each ſide adorn'd with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; under his Eyes was a perfect Seaming made Ciſtern-faſhion, of a Green colour, whilſt his eyes moſt delicately beautiful, ſeem'd to drop that way; over which were placed briſtles of a muddy green; under his Gills were Flapps like two ſcollop ſhells, of the Colour of a Gurnets fins, admirably blew and ſhining, &amp; always expanded; under them were two Pouches or Bladders, of a deep Orange colour, larger then the Fins, being a big as ordinary Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plumbs, and ſomething of that figure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the head had a Sea-Green ſcaly Armour on, which ran along its
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151826:4"/>
back within four Inches of its tail; the hinder-part was covered with perfect Hair, but dusky, hoary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, of the ſame manner was that as went along the ſides and feet. But what is yet moſt ſtrange, is his Tail, which was thrice as long as its body, which it wore on its back, ſomthing like the True-Loves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knot, and tho' it ſeem'd ſo intricate, yet when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to turn this creature on its back to view its bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it flung its Tail as ſudden as the jirk of a Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Whip, &amp; had not he ſtood ſideways, he might have had too much cauſe to have repented his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; but as it hapned it's tail fell into a ſlit of that ſtone which was its former Manſion, and though the poor Creature ſtrove hard, yet it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe it thus engag'd; upon which there appeared as cloſe as might be, onely reckonable, a hundred ninety ſeaven ſcaly rings, jetty, black, and ſhining, which he made a ſhift by this means to reckon, and may be gueſs'd to be the indications of its Annual extenſion; at the end of the Tail was a forked ſting, within an Inch of which was a ſmall Pouch, of the colour of Gum Bugiae.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman finding his Over-grown Toad in this poſture, would have gagg'd the Toad, but no ſooner had he touch'd its Noſe, but it recoil'd back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, even off the Stone, which it ſeem'd ſo to Hatch, and Cheriſh before. But there being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151826:4"/>
hollow or miſs of ground, where this rare Animal falling, &amp; not coming quick enough to the ground, the ſaid Satchel or Pouch neer the ſting broke, out of which there iſſued the moſt Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Yellow Liquor as ever was ſeen, deeply ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtone, upon which the Toad that then hung above-ground fell down, his Tail freely coming to him; which he had not enjoy'd above three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes e're he departed this ſcurvy world: but before it received its change, it gave three ſuch ſhrieks that the ſtranger was not onely forc'd to ſtop his ears: But this Lamentable Dirge, forc'd the Neigbours out of their Houſes: He perceiving the Creature quite dead, took a freſh reſolution, and turn'd it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its back, and found its belly to be as white as the driven ſnow; cover'd with a moſt delightful down: about that time when he was buſie viewing this pleaſing Object, his Noſe was ſurpriz'd with a moſt ungrateful Stench, which he found to proceed from that Limpid Yellow ſubſtance that the Toad had ſpilt, in which (it ſeems) its Seal of Life was plac'd. Juſt at its Departure its Head mov'd, and it vomited forth a Triangular Stone, being an Inch from each Angle, and in Depth according, which he drew to him with a Staff, keeping his Fingers upon his Noſe: and when he had got it at a Convenient Diſtance, he Doubled ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151826:5"/>
Paper and took it up, folding it in ſeveral folds of the ſame Paper, and after lapt it carefully in his Handkerchief, and preſented it me, with the Figure: And tho' before, I was in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Incredulous, and ſo far from giving credit to the many Excellencies of this Stone, that I queſtion'd its Exiſtence, and gueſs'd it to be onely the off-ſpring of ſome pregnant, yet impoſing fancy: Yet now upon my ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I dare aſſure the World, that the vertues aſcribed by Authors to it, come far ſhort of its performance: And queſtionleſs had ſome curious Virtuoſus of our times been preſent at this Prodigious Accident, they might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Medicines of equal Memory with their Fame.</p>
