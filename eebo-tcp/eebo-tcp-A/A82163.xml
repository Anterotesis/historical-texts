            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration of the Grounds and Reaſons why we the Poor Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>VVellinborrow,</hi> in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> have begun and give conſent to dig up, manure and ſow Corn upon the Common, and waſte ground, called <hi>Bareſhanke</hi> belonging to the Inhabitants of <hi>VVellinborrow,</hi> by thoſe that have ſubſcribed, and hundreds more that give Conſent.</head>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE find in the Word of God, that God made the Earth for the uſe and comfort of all Mankind, and ſet him in it to till and dreſſe it, and ſaid, That in the ſweat of his brows he ſhould eat his bread; and alſo we find, that God never gave it to any ſort of people, that they ſhould have it all to themſelves, and ſhut out all the reſt, but he ſaith, The Earth hath he given to the children of men, which is every man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We find, that no creature that everGod made was ever deprived of the benefit of the Earth, but Mankind; and that it is nothing but covetouſneſſe, pride, and hardneſſe of heart, that hath cauſed man ſo far to degenerate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We find in the Scriptures, that the Prophets and Apoſtles have left it upon Record, That in the laſt days the oppreſſo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and proud man ſhall ceaſe, and God will reſtore the waſte places of the Earth to the uſe and comfort of Man, and that none ſhall hurt nor deſtroy in all his holy Mountain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have great Encouragement from theſe two righteous Acts, which the Parliament of England have ſet forth, the one againſt Kingly Power, the other to make England a Free Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We are neceſſitated from our preſent neceſſity to do this, and we hope that our Actions will juſtifie us in the gate, when all men ſhall know the truth of our neceſſity: We are in Wellinborrow in one Pariſh 1169 perſons that receive Alms, as the Officers have made it appear at the Quarter Seſſions laſt: we have made our Caſe known to the Juſtices, the Juſtices have given Order that the Town ſhould raiſe a Stock to ſet us on work, and that the Hundred ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to aſſiſt them; but as yet we ſee nothing is done, nor any man that goeth about it; we have ſpent all we have, our trading is decayed, our wives and children cry for bread, our lives are a burden to us, divers of us having 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. in Family, and we cannot get bread for one of them by our labor; rich mens hearts are hardened, they will not give us if we beg at their doors; if we ſteal, the Law will end our lives, divers of the poor are ſtarved to death already, and it were better for us that are living to dye by the Sword then by the Famine: And now we conſider that the Earth is our Mother, and that God hath given it to the children of men, and that the common and waſte Grounds belong to the poor, and that we have a right to the common ground both from the Law of the Land, Reaſon and Scriptures; and therefore we have begun to beſtow our righteous labor upon it, and we ſhall truſt the Spirit for a bleſſing upon our labor, reſolving not to dig up any mans propriety, until they freely give us it; and truly we find great comfort already, through the goodneſſe of our God, that ſome of thoſe rich men amongſt us, that have had the greateſt profit upon the Common, have freely given us their ſhare in it, as one Mr John Freeman, Thomas Nottingam and John Clendon, and divers others; and the Country Farmers have proffered divers of them to give us Seed to ſow it, and ſo we find that God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading Japheth to dwell in the tents of Shem: and rruly thoſe that we find moſt againſt us are ſuch as have beenconſtant enemies to the Parliaments Cauſe from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>Now at laſt our deſire is, That ſome that approve of this work of Righteouſneſſe, would but ſpread this our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the great Councel of the Land, that ſo they may be pleaſed to give us more encouragement to go on, that ſo they may be found amongſt the ſmall number of thoſe that conſiders the poor and needy, that ſo the Lord may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them in the time of their troubles, and then they will not be found amongſt thoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, which withhold the Corn (or the Land) from the Poor, which the people ſhall curſe, but bleſſing ſhall be upon the heads of thoſe Rulers that ſell Corn, and that will let the poor labor upon the Earth to get them Corn, and our lines ſhall bleſſe them, ſo ſhall good men ſtand by them, and evil men ſhall be afraid of them, and they ſhall be counted the Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Breaches, and the Reſtorers of our Paths to dwell in. And thus we have declared the truth of our neceſſity; and whoſoever will come in to us to labor with us, ſhall have part with us, and we with them, and we ſhall all of us endeavor to walk righteouſly and peaceably in the Land of our Nativity.</p>
