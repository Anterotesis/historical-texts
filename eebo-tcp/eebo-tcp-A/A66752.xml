         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE to the following
REVIEW, offering ſomewhat
therewith conſiderable.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Preface,</hi> and the following <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi>
were not without good reaſon
perſonated as written by a <hi>Third
perſon;</hi> yet perhaps may make it
queſtionable, Whether they were done by the
<hi>Author</hi> of the Books abreviated, or by another
hand; but that is not material: For, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
nothing ſave what may be by him juſtified
in every circumſtance; and therefore it ſhall
ſo paſs. He was Thirteen years old when Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> reigned; and even at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to obſerve both the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD, and
the <hi>Actions</hi> ef <hi>Men;</hi> ſo continuing to do, from
time to time, whereby (with GOD's gracious
aſſiſtance) he was preſerved from groſly falling
into, and perſevering in thoſe ſins whereto he
was naturally prone; and came into the world
at a time which gave him ſuch an <hi>Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
knowledg</hi> both of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> as he
could not have had in many preceding <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi>
for he hath lived to ſee Eleven <hi>Signal
Changes,</hi> in which, not a few <hi>Signal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions</hi>
Providentially occurred; to wit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106767:3"/>
King <hi>James, Charles</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Parliament</hi> together, the <hi>Parliament</hi>
alone, the <hi>Army, Oliver Cromwel, Richard
Cromwel,</hi> a <hi>Council of State,</hi> the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
again, and now King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
during all which times, he lived in
thoſe <hi>Places,</hi> and in ſuch <hi>midling Stations,</hi>
between perſons of the higheſt and loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
exerciſed in Employments, which gave
him opportunity to heed what was done, both
by thoſe who were <hi>above</hi> and <hi>below him.</hi>
GOD had alſo beſtowed upon him a <hi>Faculty,</hi>
which (though it be deſpiſed, and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
but meanly endowed) would not permit
him to be altogether idle or ſilent; for, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him to a conſciencious exerciſe of his
<hi>Talent,</hi> in that, which he thought required at
his hand; and to take all <hi>occaſions</hi> from time
to time happening, to commemorate, and offer
to conſideration, thoſe things whereby GOD
might be glorified, and his Countreymen bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
in ſome degree; which duty (though not
ſo well as he would) he hath ſo well as he could
proſecuted to this day.</p>
            <p>He begun very early, by expreſſing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
thoſe <hi>Conceptions</hi> which the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> had awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him; endeavouring to ſeaſon them with
as much <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> as <hi>Subjects</hi> of
that nature are capable of; ſuiting them to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
<pb facs="tcp:106767:3"/>
of <hi>young men,</hi> who delight to ſee
their own <hi>Natural Paſſions</hi> repreſented as it
were in a glaſs; wherein, they not onely met
with ſome better things then they looked for,
but, with ſuch <hi>Notions</hi> alſo therewith mixed,
as inſinuated into their hearts that ſeaſoning,
which made them much delighted with his
<hi>Poems,</hi> and rendred him ſo generally known,
that many thouſands were deſirous to peruſe
his <hi>future Writings,</hi> and to take better heed
of that, whereof elſe perhaps they had taken
little or no notice, though expreſſed by a more
elegant and learned <hi>Author.</hi> It likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him to aſſume all <hi>Occaſions</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
that, which might moſt redound to
GOD's Glory, and the edifying of men in
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> though it were to
his perſonal diſadvantage in <hi>carnal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
And GOD hath given him comfort
therein, carrying him on hitherto through all
difficulties occurring, though by impartially
diſcharging his <hi>Conſcience</hi> in ſuch a <hi>mode</hi> as
had provoked many <hi>powerful perſons</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
him with Indignation; for, his <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
reproofs</hi> have been very offenſive, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they were in <hi>general terms</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without <hi>perſonal aſperſions,</hi> and with as
much charity, and tender reſpect to every mans
infirmities, and unwilling failings, as to his
own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106767:4"/>
Length of time hath given him ſo many
ſeveral <hi>occaſions</hi> to declare what he thought
neceſſary or expedient, that his <hi>Publiſhed
Poems</hi> and Writings amount now to about a
hundred, beſides many never Printed; In
which, though he hath expreſt much to the
ſame purpoſe (in various <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>words</hi>)
yet the ſame or like <hi>occaſions</hi> warrant the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the ſame or like matter and words,
as the practiſe of the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
hath evidenced to be ſometimes neceſſary.
For, that <hi>Medicine</hi> which operates not at one
time, doth work effectually at another, on the
ſame perſons, or upon thoſe of another conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
<hi>Meats</hi> alſo, variouſly dreſſed, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to their <hi>appetites,</hi> and well digeſted by
their <hi>ſtomacks,</hi> who almoſt loathed them when
often eaten cook't the ſame way. And ſo it is
in this caſe. Wherefore he hath endeavoured
to put his <hi>Matter</hi> into ſuch a dreſs (otherwhile
in <hi>Proſe,</hi> and otherwhile in a <hi>Poetical Mode</hi>)
that it may ſuit with <hi>vulgar capacities,</hi> and
not be deſpiſed by the moſt <hi>Judicious;</hi> mixing
ſo far forth as may be decent, <hi>Delight</hi> and
<hi>Profit,</hi> according to this old Verſe,
<q>Et prodeſſe ſolent, &amp; Delectare Poetae.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His preſuming to give counſel to them who
neither deſire it, nor care for his advice, hath
much offended many, and made them heedleſs
of that which might have prevented their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
<pb facs="tcp:106767:4"/>
but it hath pleaſed and benefited ſome;
and that makes him ſlight their <hi>Proverb,</hi>
which <hi>forbids coming to give Counſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are called.</hi> And he hath nevertheleſs
proſecuted the multiplying of <hi>Doctrinal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances,
Exhortations, Precautions</hi> and
<hi>Predictions,</hi> (to prevent that which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of them will produce) until they amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that numerouſneſs which appears in thoſe
Books whereof this is an <hi>Abridgment.</hi> And
by conſidering upon whoſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> and
<hi>Threatnings</hi> they are grounded, he hath not
been affraid to <hi>predict conditionally</hi> thoſe
<hi>Mercies</hi> aud <hi>Judgments</hi> which are promiſed
and menaced in thoſe Books here abreviated.
And ſome will find, that which is not yet veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
upon <hi>Wilful Delinquents,</hi> to be at laſt as
truly fulfilled, as thoſe which they have ſeen;
though the world hath made it one of her <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
to believe and profeſs, That <hi>Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
hath long time ceaſed; becauſe her <hi>wiſe
men</hi> think as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <hi>prophane
men</hi> would do in the later times, who ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly
ſay, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for, ſince the Fathers fel aſleep, all things
continue as they were from the Creation,</hi>
1 Pet. 3. 4. Indeed, Propheſying is at an end,
as touching <hi>ſaving-Faith,</hi> or any new <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles</hi> thereto pertaining. But, the
<hi>Spirit of Propheſie,</hi> as foretelling what ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:106767:5"/>
come to paſs in relation to thoſe <hi>Mercies</hi> or
<hi>Judgments,</hi> which ſhall be the reward ef <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,</hi>
and the puniſhment of <hi>evil-doers,</hi> in
this life, is not taken away or ceaſed, as it
hath been manifeſted <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> many, who
have had in our dayes <hi>Revelations</hi> of ſuch
things before they came to paſs, and have been
<hi>living Witneſſes</hi> of their predicting them
before-hand; as alſo of their being afterward
fulfilled; and in particular, of that <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
whereby the glory of <hi>London</hi> was this
year conſumed, (though that will not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every mans Creed:) For, before the ſaid
<hi>Fire,</hi> this <hi>Author</hi> was informed by a credible
perſon, (who was afterward a great Sufferer
thereby) of a <hi>Viſion</hi> repreſenting ſuch a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> as there befel ſoon after.
He himſelf alſo, had confuſed preapprehenſions
of the like effect, when he ſent forth his
<hi>Warning-piece to London,</hi> publiſhed 1662,
occaſioned by a <hi>ſudden Fire</hi> in the Night at
<hi>Lothbury,</hi> near the middle of that <hi>City,</hi>
which then conſumed the Houſe of an eminent
Citizen, with all the Inhabitants therein.
Dr. <hi>Gell,</hi> a Learned and Conſcientious Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
to this City, ſeemed alſo to have had the
like impreſſions upon his heart, both by what
he communicated to ſome Friends in private,
and by a Printed Sermon of his, preacbed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24,
<pb facs="tcp:106767:5"/>
wherein the coming of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> is
parallel'd with the coming of the <hi>Flood</hi> in
the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi> The ſame <hi>Sermon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a <hi>Narrative</hi> (which he averrs was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by many Witneſſes) to wit, That about
two years before his Preaching of that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
The ſign of the Son of Man,</hi> even
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Croſs, wounded in his hands
and feet, and <hi>Angels</hi> round about him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at <hi>Frankendale</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> to the
view of Thouſands, Three hours together at
mid-day. Moreover it is credibly avowed, That
a Book was brought to be publiſhed a little before
the ſaid <hi>Fire,</hi> fore-declaring what we have
ſeen come to paſs, and was refuſed by the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
becauſe not Licenſed; and that the ſame
<hi>Printer</hi> being afterward buſie to help quench
the Fire, and then ſeeing that ſame <hi>perſon</hi>
paſſing by, told him, he ſuſpected his hand to
be in the kindling thereof: Whereto the man
anſwered, That had he been acceſſary to ſuch a
a wicked <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> he ſhould not
have offered that to publication, whereby it
might probably have been prevented; adding
theſe words, That ere long there would be a more
dreadful Execution by the <hi>Sword,</hi> then that
was by the <hi>Fire;</hi> (which, whoſoever that
man was, or upon what ground ſoever he
ſpake, it may probably come to paſs) and a
<hi>Famine</hi> follow that, if God ſhould deal with
<pb facs="tcp:106767:6"/>
us according to our demerits.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Review</hi> is in the firſt place entituled,
<hi>An Eccho from the Sixth Trumpet;</hi> becauſe,
it alluſively reverberateth, and <hi>Ecchoes,</hi> as it
were, to what was predicted ſhould come to
paſs between the ſounding of the <hi>Sixth and
Seventh Trumpet,</hi> upon pouring forth the
<hi>Sixth Viol,</hi> the ſad Effects whereof are part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt at this day, by many who conſider not
from whence they proceed, that they might have
been as effectual to make them happy, as they
will alſo be to make them more miſerable both
here and hereafter. Now if upon the whole
matter it ſhould be queſtioned (as perhaps it
may) upon what warrantable grounds this
<hi>Author</hi> preſumes this Generation is guilty of
ſuch and ſo many <hi>Provocations,</hi> as have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it liable to Gods <hi>Judgments</hi> conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
predicted in his former Writings; he
thereto anſwers, That beſide his <hi>perſonal
knowledg</hi> thereof acquired by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
(and the witneſs which he believes the
<hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> beareth in his heart thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
<hi>Common Fame</hi> is a good <hi>concurrent Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
(eſpecially in this caſe;) for, though in
many things <hi>Fame</hi> is a <hi>Lyar;</hi> yet in ſuch
caſes as this, <hi>Vox Vulgi</hi> is <hi>Vox Dei, The
Voice of the People is the Voice of GOD</hi>
to their Conſciences, bearing witneſs againſt
themſelves, as juſtly meriting all the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:106767:6"/>
predicted</hi> by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> againſt
ſuch ſinnes as they have committed; and they
alwayes carry in themſelves (though ſeldom
heeded) their <hi>Accuſation</hi> and <hi>Sentence of
Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no marvel, if GOD's <hi>long-ſuffering</hi>
is little regarded, whilſt he is ſlow to wrath,
and executes fore threatned Plagues upon
ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> with leſs terror and
ſeverity then upon ſome other, or upon the ſame
perſons at other times: For, now when they
came thick, fell heavily and more dreadfully
upon them, than heretofore, the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
are ſo far from being reformed; that they
grow more impudent Malefactors, as it was
predicted it would be in theſe laſt times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they on whom the <hi>Viols of Wrath</hi> ſhould be
poured forth, <hi>blaſphemed</hi> when they ſhould
have <hi>repented.</hi> But this excuſes not thoſe
whom GOD qualifies for ſuch Services (though
they ſhall be bemired and rent in pieces by ſome)
if they ſhall not ſeaſonably proclaim and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Precautions</hi> and <hi>Exhortations</hi> as often
as juſt <hi>occaſions</hi> are offered; and therefore
this <hi>Review of Neglected Remembrances,</hi>
is thought pertinent at this time, though they
were heretofore ſcoffingly termed <hi>Propheſies,</hi>
and will at this day be as little regarded by
many; and it is hoped alſo, this labour will
not be quite loſt, but have a kindly operation
<pb facs="tcp:106767:7"/>
on thoſe who are not hardned into a <hi>final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence</hi>
by cuſtomary ſinning, and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſpiſing GOD's <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Mercies;</hi>
and that they may be likewiſe helpful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the like obduracie in thoſe who are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
depraved.</p>
            <p>Many who are forgetful or heedleſs of <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings,
Counſels</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> which
concern their preſent duties, are ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to liſten after thoſe <hi>Predictions</hi> which
preſage their happineſs or unhappineſs hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that, if the contrary were not apparent, it
might probably be thought, they were leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſecure their <hi>preſent,</hi> then their <hi>future
enjoyments;</hi> for, they rake together all <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>
new and old, which have a ſhow of
preſaging that which they <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>hope for;</hi>
entertaining each other at their <hi>Meeting-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
with mutual Repetitions of what they laſt
heard to ſuch purpoſes, how frivolous or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
ſoever. This Vanity, the Seducer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the Deceitfulneſs of mens hearts,
makes uſe of to divert the proſecution of their
Duties to GOD, to themſelves, and to other
men; and to fruſtrate thoſe rational and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<hi>Predictions</hi> and <hi>Precautions,</hi> which
might have prevented the greateſt Plagues
conditionally menaced by the moſt holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
By delighting more to hear <hi>what is to
come,</hi> then what <hi>men ought to do;</hi> they ſeem
<pb facs="tcp:106767:7"/>
to think all good Counſels and Endeavours
leſs pertinent to their cognizance and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
than an unprofitable, uncertain <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi>
of what is but conditionally predicted,
and ſhall onely come to paſs according as the
conditions are performed or neglected. But,
toward the cure of this diſtemper, <hi>humane
Prudence</hi> can extend no further than the
circumference of its own <hi>Sphear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Predictions</hi> expreſſed in ambiguous Terms,
and having neither certain ſignification or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon ought following or preceding,
are ignorantly inſiſted upon as pertinent to
thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Places</hi> whereto they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
no relation. Such are many groundleſs
Figments cry'd about the Streets, and pickt
out of <hi>Gypſie-like Prognoſtications,</hi> to the
abuſing of ignorant people. Such are alſo the
ridiculous <hi>Welſh Impoſtors,</hi> entituled <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefen,</hi>
the Fiction termed the <hi>Panther-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie;</hi>
and <hi>Mother Shiptons</hi> Propheſies, ſo
called, are thought conſiderable by ſome who
ſuppoſe themſelves no fools; and hereby <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>
and <hi>Premonitions</hi> grounded upon
ſound Reaſon, and Divine Truth, are unheeded
or neglected.</p>
            <p>However, there is and ſhall be a <hi>Remnant</hi>
preſerved, who can diſtinguiſh between ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and trivial <hi>Precautions;</hi> and to them,
that which is here collected, will at ſome times
<pb facs="tcp:106767:8"/>
be of good uſe, though the <hi>Author</hi> be yet in
contempt, and in a ſuffering-condition. Let
thoſe therefore, into whoſe hands theſe come,
be pleaſed to accept and improve them as they
find cauſe, giving praiſe to God, who vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
timely <hi>fore-warnings</hi> to all <hi>Places, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
and <hi>Societies</hi> in every Age; and <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi>
of that which brings on Confuſion and
deſtruction, to the glorifying of his <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
to the ſhame of preſumptuous
Tranſgreſſors, and to make future times more
cautious; ſpeaking as well by the <hi>ſimple</hi> and
<hi>mean,</hi> as by the <hi>wiſe and honourable,</hi> in
terms fitted unto every capacity; as alſo in
ſuch various Modes as might rouze them up out
of ſecurity. And, now of late, ſeeing both
<hi>dreadful and calm Voices</hi> have been long
ſlighted or neglected, he hath ſpoken to us by
all the <hi>Elements;</hi> yea, by <hi>Peſtilence, Warr,</hi>
furious <hi>Hurricano's,</hi> and devouring <hi>Fire,</hi>
joined together in a terrible <hi>Conſort:</hi> To
which is added a <hi>concurrent Preſage</hi> in the
hearts of moſt men, portending a <hi>general
Ruine,</hi> by their agreeing in that <hi>fear,</hi> how
differing ſoever their, <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
be in other things; and doubtleſs a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
execution of <hi>Judgment</hi> is not far off, in
regard their grand Affairs in moſt places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to reſemble the Conſtitution of that <hi>Senate</hi>
whereof it was ſaid, That all the reſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:106767:8"/>
               <hi>Senators</hi> were ordered according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of one among them; he governed by his
<hi>Wife,</hi> ſhe by her Childs <hi>Nurſe,</hi> and the <hi>Nurſe</hi>
by her <hi>Nurſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to our vulgar Computation, this
is the <hi>Thouſandth ſix hundred ſixty and
ſixth year</hi> after our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Birth, and
will queſtionleſs, be a <hi>ſignal year,</hi> according
to the pre-conjectures of many; yet, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the total extirpation of his <hi>Malignant
Kingdom,</hi> whoſe <hi>Reign</hi> is to end in the 666th
year after he was compleatly enthroned upon
the Seat of that <hi>BEAST,</hi> which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Thouſand years in a declining eſtate,
until the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of it to the full height; which time,
(though they heeded it not) was myſtically fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared
in their own <hi>Numerals,</hi> which in an
orderly conjunction, according to their ſimple
valuation, extends no further than to make
<hi>MDCLXVI,</hi> comprehending the whole term
limited to the <hi>Fourth Monarchy,</hi> with what
ſhould ariſe out of it, from the higheſt exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Beaſt.</hi> The
higheſt pitch of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(as he hath frequently hinted in his <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
publiſhed upon ſeveral <hi>occaſions</hi>) was
even then at full, when the <hi>Lord of Life</hi>
was crucified under that Power; for, till then
it flouriſhed. The number of years comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:106767:9"/>
the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> and <hi>Papal Antichriſtian
Tyrany,</hi> being <hi>MDCLXVI</hi> in the whole, was
not to be reckoned as beginning immediately
after <hi>Chriſts</hi> birth, but after his <hi>crucifying</hi>
or <hi>aſcenſion;</hi> allotting the greateſt <hi>Numeral
M,</hi> to wit, a <hi>Thouſand years,</hi> to the ſaid
Firſt <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>DCLXVI</hi> years, to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Beaſt,</hi> that being the number of the
<hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of that <hi>Myſtical Man of
Sin,</hi> whoſe Reign will probably determine in
or about the Three or four and thirtieth year
yet to come, if Chronologers have truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
us of the times paſt; and Hiſtory
rightly ſtated the Progreſs of the <hi>Second
Beaſt,</hi> to the height of his Power, that we
may know from what year to begin that <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi>
But this is certain, though nor the year,
nor the day can be preciſely known, he hath
not long to reign; for, all <hi>predictions</hi> will
ere long end in <hi>one;</hi> and as it was ſaid a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before the <hi>Flood, GOD will not much
longer ſtrive with Fleſh;</hi> but, for the ſakes
of his <hi>Elect,</hi> ſhorten the time of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi>
which might elſe have been lengthned out to
the end of 6000 years after the <hi>Creation,</hi> but
that his fury will haſten his own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>This—66<hi>th</hi> year ſhall be a <hi>preparative</hi>
thereunto, though the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> inſult, as if
the <hi>Saints</hi> have miſtaken the time of their <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106767:9"/>
for, the late Execution of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
by devouring <hi>Fire,</hi> (the like whereof
(conſidering it was not accompanied with the
<hi>Sword</hi>) was never, or very ſeldom heard of
ſince the conſuming of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomarrah</hi>)
as are alſo other Epidemical Judgments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
upon thoſe of GOD's own <hi>Houſe,</hi> not
to deſtroy, but to purge it. When their <hi>fierce
Trial</hi> hath conſumed the <hi>Hay, Stubble</hi> and
<hi>Wooden Structures,</hi> which they have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
when <hi>ſelf-love, hypocriſie,</hi> the Reliques
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and ſuch other <hi>Babyloniſh Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi>
(as of old, or newly crept in) are
purged out; when the abominable <hi>Pride, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>Exceſs,</hi> which have here abounded,
to the parallelling of <hi>Sodom,</hi> (conſidering
what they wanted of what we had) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
which nothing can burn up, except ſuch
irreſiſtable Fires as that of late, or ſomewhat
thereto equivalent; and, when the <hi>Saints</hi>
have drunk ſo much of this <hi>bitter Cup,</hi> as
will ſuffice to cleanſe them; Then ſhall the
<hi>Scarlet Whore,</hi> and her vaunting Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
ſwallow down the Dreggs, finding
themſelves deceived in the expectation of thoſe
<hi>Conſequents</hi> which their <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in ſilly <hi>Rimes</hi> diſperſed ſince the ſaid
<hi>Fire,</hi> to inſinuate that the Executions now in
Act, will be deſtructive to them onely who are
departed out of their <hi>Babylon,</hi> and proteſted
<pb facs="tcp:106767:10"/>
againſt it. For, though the purifying of
Gods <hi>Family</hi> is thereby principally intended,
the ſame <hi>Judgments</hi> will have concurrent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
from year to year, toward the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that, which will be the <hi>final Doom</hi> of
<hi>Rome's Babylon,</hi> when 666 years, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
are determined after their <hi>Myſterie of
Iniquity</hi> was at height.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Author</hi> believes, That the <hi>Saints</hi> laſt
<hi>Purgatory</hi> is now commencing, and that it is
made <hi>ſignal</hi> by the <hi>Fire</hi> which in this year
hath eclipſed the glory, and defaced the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London,</hi> which is to our <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD,
the ſame which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was
to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time. <hi>London</hi> was the
greateſt, the moſt famous, and the moſt potent
of all the Cities wherein the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
was viſibly profeſſed in oppoſition to the
<hi>Papacy;</hi> and among other conſiderable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that <hi>Mercy</hi> whereby the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> was managed, during
this years Viſitation hitherto, do manifeſt,
that they have a ſpecial relation to <hi>Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
The moſt Magnificent, and the
Nobleſt part of this <hi>Ancient City</hi> was wholly
and ſuddenly conſumed; her ſad Inhabitants
looking on, were diſabled to quench it, till it
had deſtroyed (with many thouſands of other
<hi>Structures</hi> great and ſmall) above a Hundred
<hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> beſides Colledges,
<pb facs="tcp:106767:10"/>
Schools and Halls; one of her <hi>Temples</hi> being
reputed the greateſt in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and
wherein the Goſpel had been preached, and
GOD worſhipped, and (though not at all times
by all according to the purity of his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi>
yet) by ſome with as much ſincerity, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the degrees of their underſtanding) as
by any other <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Congregational
Aſſemblies;</hi> until <hi>Humane Authorities</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to ſet up their <hi>Poſts</hi> by GOD's <hi>Poſts,</hi> and
Magiſterially impoſed more than was enjoyned
or required by him; which preſumption was
aggravated by falling from their <hi>firſt love</hi> to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and their <hi>Brethren;</hi> which <hi>Love</hi> is
the moſt <hi>ſignal mark</hi> of his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> yea an
over-peremptory and too ſtiff an adhering by
all parties diſſenting in Judgment, to their
<hi>ſingle Opinions</hi> as touching things <hi>indifferent
in their own nature,</hi> hath partly (if not
principally) occaſioned that overflowing and
complication of <hi>Plagues</hi> wherewith we are
now afflicted throughout theſe three <hi>Nations,</hi>
and in this our <hi>Head-City,</hi> in which (if we
may believe Travellers) both her own <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
and <hi>Strangers</hi> were preſerved in more
ſafety by night and by day, and as well and
civilly governed according to <hi>Moral Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and <hi>External Forms of Piety,</hi> as in
any City throughout the world, ſo great, and
ſo populous; yet the fury of the late <hi>Fiery
<pb facs="tcp:106767:11"/>
Storm</hi> moſt raged, and made the ſaddeſt ſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and the moſt deformed marks of <hi>Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
even in that part of this City wherein
they lived who were then reputed among the
moſt generous, the moſt civil, the moſt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and the moſt pious of her Inhabitants;
and though the beſt men had not the leaſt ſhare
in that <hi>Calamity,</hi> it was made tollerable by ſo
many <hi>Mercies</hi> wrapt up therewith, as do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that God had a conſiderable number ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and that the generality were no greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
then they whoſe Dwellings eſcaped that
<hi>Judgment.</hi> The <hi>Out-parts</hi> (except at the
Weſt end) were graciouſly ſpared, as <hi>Zoar</hi> was
heretofore, for the ſake of <hi>Lot,</hi> to be for the
preſent time a <hi>Refuge</hi> both to them who were
chaſed away by the <hi>Fire,</hi> and to their Brethren,
whoſe habitations were preſerved for their
joint comfort; and of this <hi>Mercy</hi> the beſt
and worſt of men had equal portions, in ſome
reſpects, becauſe their time is not yet come,
wherein GOD will be fully avenged on his and
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Though probably that <hi>Fire</hi> was both kindled
and encreaſed by wicked hands, <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
(who permitted thoſe to be his <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners</hi>)
carried it on as well againſt the
<hi>Wind,</hi> when it blew very ſtrongly, as with it;
and by taking away their hearts who were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully
active at other times in preventing
<pb facs="tcp:106767:11"/>
ſuch beginnings, permitted it to proceed ſo far:
And when GOD's <hi>Fiery Meſſenger</hi> was in the
height of his Career, bounded his rage at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-buildings,</hi>
after it had broken irreſiſtibly
through thick and ſtrong Edifices of <hi>Brick</hi>
and <hi>Stone.</hi> It is conſiderable alſo, That this
<hi>Fire</hi> was not permitted to extend into thoſe
Contiguous Buildings, Streets and Allies,
wherein the greateſt <hi>Oppreſſors,</hi> the moſt
<hi>prophane,</hi> the moſt <hi>impudent,</hi> the moſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,</hi>
and the moſt <hi>irreligious perſons</hi>
were commonly famed to have their dwellings
intermixt with ſuch as were of a civil and
pious converſation; for few or no places were
then touched by the <hi>Fire,</hi> wherein either a
<hi>publick Theater,</hi> or a <hi>common Gaming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi>
or a <hi>notorious Brothel-houſe,</hi> or a
<hi>May-pole,</hi> or a <hi>Popiſh Chappel</hi> was at that
time ſtanding, which it may be ſome think, ſo
hallowed the <hi>places,</hi> that the <hi>Fire</hi> could not
prevail againſt them; whereas it rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates,
That this <hi>Viſitation</hi> extends pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
to GOD's <hi>own People;</hi> and that the
utter extirpation of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Aſſociates,</hi> is deferred until a time yet
to come. Yet, in the mean while, (though few
lay it to heart) GOD will inflict upon every
<hi>particular Member</hi> of that <hi>wicked Society,</hi>
in his generation, ſo much of their temporal
dooms as will amount to the whole at their
<pb facs="tcp:106767:12"/>
lives end; and therefore ſeeing their <hi>laſt
doom</hi> (for ought they know) may be too mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or this preſent hour, it will be dangerous
to defer penitence, becauſe they think the laſt
<hi>day of Judgment</hi> may be far off. This, and
the preceding <hi>Affirmatives</hi> will peradventure
be diſtaſtful to thoſe Time-pleaſing <hi>Paraſites,</hi>
(as alſo to them who delight in groſs flatteries)
who preach <hi>Peace,</hi> and prognoſticate glorious
<hi>Conſequences</hi> to the Proceedings of this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
But the <hi>Wrath</hi> of ſuch will not
prevent the failing of their unwarrantable
Expectations.</p>
            <l>GOD's <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> unto all</l>
            <l>Predicted are, with a <hi>Conditional</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Expreſs</hi> or <hi>Tacit;</hi> and (although they ſeem</l>
            <l>Pronounced <hi>abſolutely,</hi> at ſome time)</l>
            <l>May be <hi>reverſible</hi> according to</l>
            <l>Our Faith, and acting what we ought to do:</l>
            <l>For, we are taught by many <hi>Preſidents,</hi>
            </l>

<pb facs="tcp:106767:13"/>
ſince the late <hi>Peſtilence</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> that nor he
nor they now know where to find each other
without much difficulty; he being wearied,

a <hi>Retreating place</hi> for himſelf and his
<hi>Conſort,</hi> which he hath prepared at a lonely
Habitation in his <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> (where

he can, there to wait upon Gods future <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations</hi>
during the remainder of his life,
or until <hi>Providence</hi> otherwiſe diſpoſeth of
him; not doubting, but that he ſhall reſt
therewith gratefully contented, whereſoever
it ſhall be, becauſe he hath had aſſurance by
many demonſtrations of GOD's <hi>good will
to the whole humane Nature,</hi> of a ſpecial
love to him; and well knows his <hi>Eternal
Mercy</hi> to be Infinite over all his works.</p>

—But, fear them not, for he that in all places,</l>

            <p>In folio 106, and in the following leaves, this
<hi>Author</hi> declared how deſolate that Plague had made
many places in and near <hi>London;</hi> particularly, the
<hi>Kings Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Innes of Court, Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi>
and the <hi>Parliament-Houſe;</hi> which produced this
expreſſion, amounting to a Preſage:</p>
            <l>—there did I</l>
            <l>Behold two <hi>Traitors heads</hi> which pearcht on high,</l>
            <l>Did ſhew their <hi>teeth,</hi> as if they had been grinning</l>
            <l>At our Afflictions, which are now beginning;</l>
            <l>For their wide <hi>Eye-holes,</hi> me thought, ſtar'd, as tho</l>
            <l>They look't to ſee that <hi>Houſe</hi> ſhould overthrow</l>

            <l>Had not GOD <hi>them,</hi> and their <hi>device</hi> o'rethrown.</l>
            <p>Alſo in the 107<hi>th</hi> leaf, he taking notice of the
deſolate Houſes of the <hi>Citizens, Peers</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
at that time, hath words to this effect:</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106767:16"/>
—wiſh I ſhall,</l>

            <l>Some fear <hi>Arreſtings,</hi> where no <hi>Serjeants</hi> are;</l>
            <l>For, this portends, that, if they who profeſs</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Laws,</hi> continue on their practiſes,</l>
            <l>Till they (as heretofore the <hi>Clergy</hi> were)</l>
            <l>Are more in number than the Land can bear;</l>
            <l>Their goodly <hi>Palaces</hi> will ſpue them forth</l>
            <l>As Excrements that are of little worth;</l>

            <p>In the 120<hi>th,</hi> and in many following leaves, the
ſaid <hi>Author</hi> having contemplated how numerouſly
the <hi>Fields</hi> near <hi>London</hi> were frequented for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with people of all ſorts, before that <hi>Infection;</hi>
how deſolate they then were, and what ſudden ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
would probably enſue, if GOD ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
that <hi>Plague</hi> before we were truly penitent;
other future <hi>Judgments</hi> are there mentioned, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
preſaged in theſe words:</p>
            <l>If GOD ſhould whiſtle for thoſe armed Bands</l>
            <l>Which now are waſting other <hi>Chriſtian Lands,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To put in action on our <hi>Commick Stage</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Tragedies of War,</hi> and brutiſh rage,</l>
            <l>What <hi>Lamentations</hi> would here then be made,</l>
            <l>And calling into mind the peace we had?</l>
            <l>Should we in every houſe at board and bed</l>
            <l>Have <hi>Soldiers</hi> and rude <hi>Captains</hi> billeted,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106767:17"/>
That would command and ſwagger as if they</l>
            <l>Kept all the <hi>Townſhips</hi> where they lodg, in pay,</l>
            <l>To wait upon their pleaſures? Or ſhould ſee</l>
            <l>Our own <hi>Defenders</hi> our <hi>Devourers</hi> be?</l>

thus proceeded, <hi>fol.</hi> 123.</p>
            <l>As heretofore the unpeopled Fields I walk'd,</l>
            <l>To this effect my thoughts within me talk'd;</l>
            <l>Yea, when all preſent Objects gave content,</l>

            <l>Well, <hi>Parliaments</hi> we had, and what in being</l>

            <l>The <hi>King</hi> hath ſhown me favour. At this hour</l>
            <l>I do not know that living man whoſe Pow'r</l>

            <l>Or whom, of any malice I ſuſpect</l>

            <l>This <hi>Meſſage:</hi> And this peradventure ſhall</l>
            <l>My hopes defer, or quite deſtroy them all.</l>
            <l>Yet, is this bluntly told, that you may ſee</l>

And that it may be known my heart diſclaims</l>
            <l>All thoſe <hi>poor ends</hi> at which ſome think it aims.</l>
            <l>Such arguments and words, therefore, as may</l>

            <l>And ſtamp, and roar, and tear, and rage, and rave</l>
            <l>More dreadfully, and louder then a man</l>
            <l>Infected with ſix <hi>Peſtilences</hi> can:</l>

            <l>Though <hi>Wiſhes</hi> are but words, <hi>Thanks</hi> are no more;</l>

To this effect was the annexed <hi>Petition;</hi> but all
this was neglected, ev'n when the Petitioner was
thereby conſtrained to live upon Charity, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
by his <hi>Poem,</hi> called <hi>Weſtrow revived.</hi>) until
GOD providentially beyond his hope, almoſt in a
miraculous way, enabled him to purchaſe a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Eſtate, by means of their acting againſt him,
who thereby intended their own benefit and his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
And that Eſtate was alſo loſt again by their
<hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> who thereby loſt likewiſe
their Power, as that Petitioner often predicted it
would come to paſs. For, after preferring the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<hi>Petition,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Parliament</hi> ſold unto him a
<hi>Mannor</hi> worth about 300 l. <hi>per an.</hi> in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a part of his Debt, and of about 1600 l.
more by him paid. The Deeds were ſealed, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
delivered, and he enjoyed it a while; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
they ſold it again to a <hi>Member</hi> of their own,
who pretended to a concealed Mortgage thereof,
(probably forged) whereupon by a <hi>ſuit in Law,</hi>
this Petitioner was ejected without any ſatisfaction,
having loſt, beſides his <hi>Purchaſe</hi>-money, about a
<hi>Thouſand Marks</hi> in charge of Suit, with other ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Expences, and the loſs of the whole <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,</hi>
without likelihood of one penny toward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for ever. Moreover upon further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the <hi>Parliament</hi> allowed Intereſt for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
1681 l. 15 s. 8 d. charged upon the Exciſe,
with 300 l. formerly due for <hi>Intereſt;</hi> which 300 l.
with much difficulty was procured by <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s
Order; but all payments out of the <hi>Exciſe
Office</hi> being retrenched for the <hi>Publick Service,</hi> the
Petitioner having forborn that great ſum almoſt
twenty years, never received more of the <hi>Intereſt</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:106767:78"/>
or <hi>Principle-money,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Parliament</hi> being
quite diſſolved, gave over that Debt as quite loſt
for ever; yet he loſt not all, for he had thereby a
true <hi>feeling</hi> of that whereof he had experience
formerly by <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>report</hi> onely; as alſo both of
GOD's <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>

            <l>It is almoſt too late; and 'twas too ſoon:</l>
            <l>At this time therefore, he expects that <hi>Boon</hi>

            <l>From one who better knows him, and from whom</l>
            <l>This <hi>Voice</hi> doth both to ſight and hearing come:</l>

And peradventure alſo, he hath now</l>

            <l>A blunter Language, and to worſe intents:</l>
            <l>For dreadful things are murmur'd; and unleſs</l>
            <l>Men more conform to that which they profeſs,</l>

            <l>Your perſons none more loves, or more eſteems;</l>
            <l>None ſeeks your Honour or your Safety more</l>

            <head>Letters of Advice touching the Election of
Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in
PARLIAMENT.
Imprinted 1644.</head>
            <p>AMong other things offered by this <hi>Author</hi> to be
heeded, as pertinent to the <hi>Common Welfare,</hi>
he publiſhed a Book ſo called, touching the Choice of
<hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> to repreſent the <hi>Commons</hi> in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> and other <hi>Publick Miniſters;</hi> to which
purpoſe he offered ſomewhat in his <hi>Perpetual Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
mentioned in this <hi>Review.</hi> Therefore this being
overlarge to be wholly inſerted, no more ſhall be here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but ſome part of what is therein contained, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the due Qualification both of the <hi>Electors,</hi>
and <hi>Perſons</hi> to be <hi>Elected</hi> which perhaps will give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of better heeding what hath been heretofore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.
It was thus expreſſed, pag. 2, in Proſe.</p>
            <p>Being wofully experienced in the manifold Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
whereinto this <hi>Nation</hi> hath been plunged by
the Corruption or Inſufficiency of Perſons hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
choſen (or preſumptuouſly intruding upon
that <hi>Truſt</hi>) and perceiving no publike means provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for preventing the like Miſchief hereafter, nor
any thereto privately contributing his Advice, I have
haſtily ſent abroad theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> not arrogating a
ſufficiency to give ſuch directions as may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
againſt, but rather in hope it would give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106767:91"/>
to ſome of <hi>better Judgment</hi> to perfect what I
have imperfectly begun according to my Talent:</p>
            <l>Leſt by that Courſe which we at preſent run,</l>
            <l>Both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> together be undone.</l>
            <p>That my Propoſals may be the more willingly
entertained and proſecuted, I will briefly offer to
heed, firſt, The <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> we incur by inconſiderate
<hi>Elections,</hi> and how traiterous thereby we are to our
<hi>Countrey,</hi> and to our <hi>ſelves.</hi> Secondly, I will preſent
you with the neceſſary <hi>Qualifications</hi> of thoſe who
are to be <hi>Elected.</hi> And laſtly, By what <hi>Expedient</hi>
I conceive Abuſes in that kind may be beſt prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if we are not grown ſo corrupt a Body, that we
neither will nor can be repreſented by honeſt and
diſcreet perſons.</p>
            <p>I need not particularize into how many Miſchiefs
this <hi>Nation</hi> is now, and hath been heretofore plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the rottenneſs and giddineſs of ſome former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
choſen to repreſent the <hi>Commonalty;</hi> or how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly
they have diſſerted or betrayed their <hi>truſt,</hi>
to an endangering of our being everlaſtingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the ſlavery of temporal and ſpiritual Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies,
no leſs accurſed and intollerable then the
<hi>Egyptian Bondage:</hi> For, we give them power not
onely to make us <hi>Slaves, Beggars,</hi> and liable to the
<hi>Hangman</hi> at their pleaſure; but to ſubject us alſo
unto thoſe <hi>Decrees</hi> which may (gradatim) bring us
or our <hi>Poſterity</hi> to be <hi>Papiſts, Turks, Pagans,</hi> and
<hi>Vaſſals to the Devil,</hi> if the Profeſſors of <hi>Popery,
Turciſm,</hi> or of any other damnable Impieties ſhould
obtain a temporal <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over us. If this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you
believe not to be poſſible, (becauſe not yet come
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106767:92"/>
to paſs) believe at leaſt, that which you ſee of their
practiſe and condition who have been unworthily
and unwarrantably choſen; and how far they have
already brought back upon us thoſe <hi>Antichriſtian
Slaveries</hi> which we thought paſt fear of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>But perhaps <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of leſs
concernment will ſtir up ſome to be more cautious
in their <hi>Elections</hi> then theſe. Let ſuch take notice,
That by beedleſneſs in this duty, they ſhall make
<hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> Lords over them, who will fawn
and court them, till they are in Power, and then
ſcorn and trample them under foot; putting ſuch
immeaſurable differences between themſelves and
others, as if the reſpect due to the whole <hi>Nation,</hi>
were due to their ſingle <hi>Perſons.</hi> And they will then
ſo take upon them, and ſo demean themſelves, as if
to favour the <hi>Clients,</hi> to ſuppreſs thoſe whom they
<hi>diſaffect,</hi> to ſtrengthen their own <hi>Faction,</hi> and to
maintain their Uſurped <hi>Perſonal Priviledges</hi> (though
to the utter ruine both of all <hi>Publick Liberties,</hi> and
true <hi>Piety</hi>) were the chief End of their <hi>Power;</hi>
What good can be expected from ſuch a <hi>Choice?</hi> or
what <hi>better Choice</hi> can be made, unleſs you more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
more prudently, and more conſcienciouſly
manage your Elections?</p>
            <l>When <hi>Wolves</hi> are by the <hi>Sheep</hi> for Guardians
choſe,</l>
            <l>Who marvels if their <hi>Skinnes</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> they
loſe.</l>
            <p>The onely means in <hi>Humane Prudence</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from ſuch miſchiefs, is by humbly ſupplicating
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106767:92"/>
               <hi>Divine Mercy</hi> by truly <hi>repenting our ſins,</hi> and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
more heed hereafter, that we be not Traitors
to our ſelves, in fooliſhly giving the diſpoſure of
our Eſtates, Lives, Liberties, and Conſciences, to
them who will ſell us for old Shooes; and ſerve us
onely to ſerve their own turns, though to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Therefore I beſeech you to be wary
whom you ſhall now and hereafter <hi>Elect;</hi> and make
us not irrecoverably unhappy, by liſtning to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations</hi>
of unworthy perſons, who will importune
you by themſelves and others, to put our <hi>Bodies</hi> and
<hi>Souls</hi> into their hands; complying with all ſhews of
<hi>Curteſie</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> till their purpoſes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and never afterward regard our <hi>Petitions,</hi>
our <hi>Cauſe,</hi> our <hi>Miſeries,</hi> or our <hi>Perſons;</hi> but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
us with ſuch pride, as if they had neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Power from us, or for our <hi>Welfare;</hi> but
meerly to exalt their own vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to remedy <hi>preſent Evils,</hi> and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
your juſt <hi>Priviledges,</hi> for preſervation of the
<hi>Common Intereſt</hi> hereafter, let your care be to avoid
the choice of ſuch as theſe:</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Men overlaviſh in ſpeaking,</hi> and in taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
pleaſure in hearing themſelves talk; for
a man full of words is neither good to <hi>give,</hi> or <hi>keep
Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>Notorious Gameſters;</hi> for, I never knew a
prudent or juſt man, a <hi>Common Gameſter:</hi> How can
they be <hi>juſt,</hi> whoſe practiſe is to cheat other men of
their Eſtates? Or <hi>prudent managers of publike Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
who expoſe their own Eſtates to the uncertain
hazard of <hi>Chance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106767:93"/>
III. <hi>Men much addicted to Hunting or Hawking;</hi>
for moſt of theſe, ſo they may preſerve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their <hi>Game,</hi> and enlarge Priviledges for their
own pleaſure, will not much care though it were to
the depopulating of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of wild Beaſts deſtructive to the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>The Houſhold Servants,</hi> or dependants on
ſuch <hi>Peers,</hi> as expect from their <hi>Creatures</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of their own <hi>Deſigns</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
ſoever to the <hi>General Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>Courtiers</hi> depending meerly on the <hi>King</hi> or
<hi>Queens Service;</hi> for the enlargement and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their <hi>Favour,</hi> depend on that which they
call <hi>Royal Prerogative;</hi> and the more that may be
improved to an infringement of the <hi>Subjects</hi> Right,
the richer and the more powerful theſe will grow.</p>
            <p>VI. Chuſe not ſuch as are evidently <hi>Ambitious</hi>
or <hi>Covetous;</hi> for how prone theſe will be to ſell
their <hi>Countrey</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> too, for <hi>Titular Honors</hi>
and <hi>Wealth,</hi> we have had too frequent experience.</p>
            <l>"The <hi>Peoples Truſt</hi> and Freedoms to betray,</l>
            <l>"To be a <hi>Lord</hi> is now the neareſt way.</l>
            <p>VII. Elect not perſons enſlaved to <hi>Wantonneſs,</hi>
and impudently perſevering in <hi>Carnal Vncleanneſſes;</hi>
for ſuch will not onely give away your and their
own <hi>Eſtates</hi> to ſatisfie their <hi>Luſts,</hi> but betray alſo
their <hi>Countrey,</hi> and their <hi>Saviour,</hi> to pleaſe their
<hi>Dalilahs.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:106767:93"/>
VIII. Take heed of chuſing men <hi>ſuperlatively
proud:</hi> For they will be ſo puft up with their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatorſhip,</hi>
that after they have ſate a while in the
Houſe, you will hardly know how to ſpeak unto
them, or of them, without being queſtioned either
for tranſgreſſing againſt <hi>good manners,</hi> or for breach
of their <hi>Perſonal Priviledges;</hi> which they prefer
before the Priviledges of the whole <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. Chuſe not men over-much affected to <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi>
or factiouſly oppugning <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> for
they will not be juſt or true to the Intereſt of <hi>King</hi>
or <hi>People,</hi> but ſo far onely as it may advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e their
own <hi>Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>X. Chuſe none generally reputed <hi>vicious in any
kind;</hi> for they will be open or ſecret Oppoſers of
all <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Ordinances</hi> reſtraining Enormities, and
hinderers of bringing <hi>Delinquents</hi> to condign pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
            <p>XI. Make not choice of <hi>Irreligious perſons,</hi> or
ſuch as are inclined to <hi>ancient Superſtitions,</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Novelties;</hi> for theſe will not willingly aſſent
to the eſtabliſhment of ought ſave what may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their private <hi>Fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>For how can he affect true <hi>Reformation,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who neither hath right <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>firm foundation?</hi>
            </l>
            <p>XII. Make not choice of <hi>Children under Age;</hi> for
we ought not to commit the management of the
moſt weighty Affairs of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to them
who are not capable by <hi>Law</hi> of diſpoſing their own
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106767:94"/>
               <hi>Eſtates;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the major part of <hi>Voices,</hi>
(which an ignorant Child may help to make up)
will be ſufficient ſometimes to confirm a Reſolution
to the <hi>Publike Damage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIII. Chuſe not <hi>Perſons Outlaw'd;</hi> or ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted,
that they dare not walk abroad without a
<hi>Protection;</hi> for what can be more unjuſt, then to
let them ſit as <hi>Law-makers,</hi> who ſubmit not to the
<hi>Laws</hi> in force, and to render the <hi>Fountain of Juſtice</hi>
obſtructive unto it ſelf.</p>

Or,
Britan's Second Remembrancer.
Imprinted 1641.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of a <hi>Review</hi> of <hi>Neglected Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions,
Predictions</hi> and <hi>Remembrances,</hi> was
begun with the <hi>Author</hi>'s firſt Book, called <hi>Britans
Remembrancer;</hi> and this <hi>Second Remembrancer</hi> ſhall
conclude it: For, though compoſed in a Mode
much differing from the former, it was an <hi>Expedient</hi>
which might have produced good Effects, had it not
been as much neglected as all other good means
are to this day. It is our duty to make <hi>trial</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, when one fails; and the <hi>Prophets</hi> are
herein exemplary to us, who often declared the
ſame <hi>Truths</hi> in various dreſſings, and otherwhile in
the ſame words, when the ſame or like <hi>Occaſions</hi> were
given. That Book containing Two hundred thirty
three ſpiritual <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Songs;</hi> is too large to be
abreviated; and therefore to inſtance the uſefulneſs
of the reſt, here ſhall be inſerted but two or three
<hi>Hymns</hi> out of each Book, the firſt relating to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Occaſions;</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Times;</hi> the third to
<hi>Perſons;</hi> that all men of all ſorts, might be thereby
minded of their Duties at all <hi>Times,</hi> and upon all
<hi>Occaſions,</hi> as appears by this brief <hi>Narration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Friend of the <hi>Author</hi>'s, much affecting that
<hi>Expedient,</hi> (as tending to the advance both of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106767:107"/>
and Virtue, diſtributed many of the Books
among his Acquaintance, at his own coſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
one of them to a Perſon of Quality,
who loved <hi>Song</hi> and <hi>Muſick;</hi> but before he had
read two lines thereof, he rejected it with much
contempt; whereupon the other ſomewhat griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
asked the reaſon of his diſlike, and received this
Anſwer; Such a <hi>Character</hi> of it hath (ſaid he) been
given by a Learned and Pious <hi>Divine,</hi> upon whoſe
Judgment I relye, that I will not loſe time in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it. Yet at laſt being importuned, he took it up,
and turning to a <hi>Song</hi> which was to him inſtanced
as demonſtrating the frothineſs of all the reſt, he
began to read it aloud in ſlighting manner, and in a
ridiculous Tone; but after the reading of a few
lines, changing his voice, ſate ſtill a good ſpace,
peruſing it in ſilence; then ſuddenly ſtarting up,
ſaid thus to his Friend, I heartily thank you for this
Book, and for importuning me to read it; I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
it ſhall teach me whilſt I live, not to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Judgment of other men, (how religious or
judicious ſoever they ſhall be reputed) in thoſe
things wherein I ought to uſe my own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as well as theirs. This is the effect of what was
told the <hi>Author,</hi> and it is here inſerted, in hope it
may make ſome other as wiſe as that Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> before the whole, and
each particular Book of that Volume, hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

delighted in, which are become ſo numerous, and ſo
affected, that pious <hi>Meditations</hi> are nigh quite out
of faſhion with many; for, not in private onely,
but at publike Feaſts and Meetings alſo, <hi>scurrilous</hi>
and <hi>obſcene Songs</hi> are impudently ſung without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the preſence of <hi>Matrons, Virgins, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
and <hi>Divines;</hi> yea, ſometimes are in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
called for, ſung, and acted with ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
geſticulations, as are offenſive to all modeſt
hearers and beholders; and befitting onely the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of <hi>Bacchus, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Priapus;</hi> for the
aboliſhing of which Abuſe, the <hi>Author</hi> was a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
that ſome proviſion might be made; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
alſo this <hi>Expedient</hi> to promove it; but the
carnal prophaneſs of ſome, and the ſullen Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of others, who cauſleſly pretended a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
