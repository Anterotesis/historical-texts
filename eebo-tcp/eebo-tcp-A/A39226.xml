            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL
That love the Lord Iesus Christ in
sincerity, and have a zeal for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gospel-light, to those who sit
in darkness, Grace and peace be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT <hi>was the holy ambition and strife of the
Apostle</hi> Paul (<hi>that chosen Vessel to bear
the Name of Christ before the Gentiles</hi>)
to preach the Gospel where Christ was
not named, lest hee should seem to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another mans foundation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 20.</p>
            <p>To hand on a good work begun by another is
very commendable, and shall not loose its reward;
but to break the ice and begin a good work is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
honourable, and shall surely have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
I am much perswaded it hath been the
gracious strife, I am sure it hath been the lot of
many of our faithfull Brethren, in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to preach the Gospel where Christ was not
named before; and the Lord hath given a signal
Testimony, that they have not laboured in vain.
Wee reade of the <hi>First-fruits of</hi> Achaia <hi>unto</hi>
Christ (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. and again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 15.)
<pb facs="tcp:31272:3"/>
Wee have also heard both of the <hi>First-fruits</hi> and
<hi>Second-fruits of</hi> India in New England <hi>unto
Christ;</hi> and these are a fair assurance of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
harvest there in due time. A blessed Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is laid, yea, the Building begins to appear
above ground, in the visible profession or professed
subjection of many poor Souls unto the Gospel of
Christ. May wee not therefore hopefully expect,
that the <hi>Top-stone</hi> shall be set up with a shout
of <hi>Grace, Grace</hi> to it?</p>
            <p>Hee that attentively readeth the Report, which
is made in the following Collection of the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Confessions of several Native <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who have been wrought upon by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word in the Wilderness, will see much
cause to admire the free grace and goodness of
God to them, as also his mighty power and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
of his arme in them. What strong and
clear convictions of sin, both of the sinfulness of
their natures, and of the sins of their lives have
they been under, who lay (before) dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
and sins, wholly alienated from the life
of God through the ignorance that was in
them? What strugglings and strivings with
corruption and temptation do they speak of,
before they could come off from sin, and from
<pb facs="tcp:31272:3"/>
that vain conversation received by tradition
from their Fore-fathers? What wrestlings had
they with unbelief, before they could close with
Christ in the promise? What full resignations of
themselves have they made to the commands of
Christ after closing with him by faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise?
Yea, what hungrings and thirstings do some
of them express for more intimate communion with
Christ in attendance upon all his Ordinances in a
Church-state or holy Fellowship with his People?</p>
            <p>Surely, what these <hi>late Aliens from the
Common-wealth of Israel</hi> have found and
declared (as their spiritual experiences) about the
dealings of God with their hearts, in bringing
them off from sin, and home to himself, may
shame many among us, who have been born and
bred up in the aire and sound of the Gospel all
their dayes.</p>
            <p>I may, not unfitly, make use of those
Prophesies of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Esaias</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Iewes and Gentiles (and so applyed by the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 19, 20, 21.) in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case between us in <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Indians.</hi>
The Lord hath begun to <hi>provoke us to Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
by them that were no people, and by a
foolish Nation hee hath angred us, hee is
<pb facs="tcp:31272:4"/>
found of them that sought him not, hee is
made manifest to them that asked not after
him, but all the day long hath hee stretched
out his hands unto us a disobedient and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying
people.</hi> Conversions are grown some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
rare (that's sad) in <hi>England;</hi> and such
accounts of Conversion much more rare. And as
we finde but few able to give any passable account
of their conversion to God, so wee finde not a few
offended at the requiring and taking of it, before
admission into compleat Church-communion. Wee
have many who profess the Religion they were
born in, but wee have (comparatively) only a
few, who profess Religion upon the evidences of
their New-Birth. And that's one great reason
why the Church and the world, the pretious and
the vile, are in so lamentable a mixture in most
places at this day.</p>
            <p>It were a very desireable mercy, that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
and example of our native Brethren, yea,
of the native <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> might
kindle in us the fire of a blessed emulation in this
matter; and that the Ministers of the Gospel would
every where exspect and diligently enquire after
some hopefull proofs of the work of Grace from
all those, who, in their own right, partake of those
<pb facs="tcp:31272:4"/>
higher Priviledges, the Seals of the Covenant of
Grace. Doubtless, then, Churches would appear
more like Churches in the beauties of Holiness, and
the fruits of the presence of Christ would be more
gloriously visible in them. The great thing which
wee (upon whom the ends of the world are come)
should earnestly pray, endeavour and wait for is,
that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> may be seen coming down
from heaven, like a Bride adorned for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and to be any way, rightly, instrumentall
for the bringing in of this glory, is a piece of the
best Glory which wee are capable of on this side
our heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore a very gracious as well as a noble
Design, to create and establish a Corporation in this
our <hi>England,</hi> to receive, improve, mannage, and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
a free contribution and the profits arising
from it for the constant support, encouragement,
and promotion of this work of Christ in That
Other <hi>England.</hi> Nor can wee but with much
thankfulness to God take notice of the liberal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of many who have already contributed to it,
as also of the faithfulness, diligence, prudence, and
Godly zeal of those worthy Persons who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with the disposal of those Contributions.
And because, as the whole Work is great, so there
<pb facs="tcp:31272:5"/>
are some great parts of it now in hand, as the
Printing of <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> and the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(besides an intendment of printing the
whole <hi>Bible</hi>) in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, which
must needs be a work of great charge as well as of
excellent use, (for these reasons I say) it would
be a most acceptable Charity, either to procure or
advance additional Contributions. How can any
honour the Lord better with their perishing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
then by forwarding a Design which may be
a means to keep thousands of Souls from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Yea, what an honour will it be to this whole
Nation, that the Holy Bible should be printed in
our dayes and at our cost in a Language and for a
Nation which never had it to this day? That this
blessed and beautifull Vndertaking for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in of those poor Souls, who yet wander in that
Howling wilderness, to the Flock and fold of Christ
(the Great Shepherd of the Sheep) may not want
their compassionate and chearfull assistance, who
are already (through grace) gathered into his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flocks and folds, is the hearty desire and prayer of</p>

            <head>A brief Relation received from Mr John
Elliott of the late Proceedings with
the Indians in New England, in
order to their admission into Church-fellowship.
In <date>the year of our Lord
1659. The fifth day of the fifth
Moneth.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THis is the third time that the Praying <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
(some of them) have been called
forth into publick, to make open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Name of Christ, to come
under the publick tryal of Gods people,
whether they be indeed Christians, as fit matter for
a Gospel Church. Truth loveth and seeketh the
light.</p>
            <p>I was stirred up hereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quickened by Letters
from <hi>England.</hi> The Lord put it into the hearts of such
as are honourable, reverend, and of eminent service
to Christ in <hi>England,</hi> to move mee, before I moved.
When I moved this last time, I perceived that it was
the general inclination of the Spirit of the Saints, both
Magistrates, Elders, and others, that (at lest some of
the principal of them) should (for a season) be seasoned
in Church-fellowship, in communion with our <hi>English</hi>
Churches, before they should be Churches among
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31272:6"/>
themselves. And when it was <hi>Objected,</hi> What should
the rest of the people do, if the principal and most able
should not keep their Sabbaths among them? It was
<hi>Answered,</hi> That their usual Sabbath conversation
should be at home among their own people, only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to be among the <hi>English;</hi> viz. for participation of
the Seals, the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords
Supper, and for any special Exercise of Discipline.
When it was Questioned what <hi>English</hi> Church they
should joyn unto? All with one mouth said, that <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
Church was called of God to be first in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Christ to receive the praying <hi>Indians.</hi> In the
accomplishment whereof, I yielded my self up to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
counsel in the Lord. The Elders offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
on some Lecture day, to meet (if need were) at
<hi>Roxbury</hi> Lecture, then to speak with the Church, to
perswade to an unanimous accord, in receiving the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
for a season; which accordingly they did: and the
Lord was so effectually present in that meeting, that all
Objections, so far as I know, were silenced. Soon
after, our Church passed a Vote for the receiving of the
<hi>Indians.</hi> The Elders of <hi>Roxbury</hi> called eight of them
to a private preparatory Confession, in order to our
publick proceeding. Wee gave notice of the time and
place of this meeting, and many were present to hear
them, both men and women; which Confessions I
shall here set down, for reasons which seem to mee
to have much weight; and they are as followeth.</p>

and that Image of <hi>Satan</hi> hee did communicate to us,
so that wee are all born in sin, and so I lived.</p>
                  <p>After wee pray'd to God about three years, my heart
was not yet right, but I desired to run wilde, as also
sundry others did. Then I understood, that the Lord
did make heaven, earth, sea, and all creatures, and also
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31272:7"/>
man, and therefore I understood that God made mee.
Yet I being young, I was still vain, and ran about; and
I liked to do acts of youth and vanity, and lust, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did. And I went to <hi>Pawwauing</hi> among others, and
these things I loved throughly, and they grew in my
heart, and had nourishment there, and especially lust;
if I cut my hair, it was with respect to lust, to please
women; if I had long hair, it was with respect to lust,
and all I did was with respect to lust and women;
when there was meetings, drinkings, sports, they respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
lust, and these things I perfectly loved. When the
Minister came to teach us, hee taught, and I came to
meeting; but I came to look upon women, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not what hee taught; sometimes I came, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
nothing at all, only I look't on women. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two years after, I began to understand what the
Minister preached: I understood that Scripture <hi>Iam.
1. Hee that doubteth is like a wave of the sea, driven of the
windes and tossed; and if any man lack wisedom, let him
ask it of God.</hi> This I understood, yet I only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it, but it was very hard to believe. Afterward,
I heard out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that God spoke concerning man,
<hi>I will destroy man whom I have made, because God saw
that the way of man was corrupt before him;</hi> and this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
mee. And again, in the same Chapter it is said,
<hi>That God saw that the iniquity of man was great upon the
earth, and that every imagination of the thought of his
heart is only evil continually;</hi> this troubled mee, for I
saw the roots of sin in my heart: yet it was hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
Again, in that 6. of <hi>Gen.</hi> God rebuked that
sin in man, which was my sin, and then my heart
was troubled. Sometime my heart said, it is better to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31272:7"/>
run wilde as I did before, then to pray to God; for if
now I sin, or commit lust, I shall be punished, or put in
prison; but if I run wilde, I have liberty to sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger: but I was ashamed of such thoughts, and
repented; but yet I doubted.</p>
                  <p>After half a year I heard the Minister preach this;
That <hi>Christ his death is of infinite value, but our death is
little worth; God is satisfied with the death of Christ, and
promiseth to pardon our sins for Christ his sake, if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ: wee deserve to die, but Christ standeth in
our stead, and dyeth for us, and so saveth us from death.</hi>
Next time the Minister came, hee asked, what I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
of this I now spoke of: and I did remember it,
and do remember it to this day; and I desire to pray
to God as long as I live. I believe Christ dyed for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but I doubted concerning my self. Then I heard
this promise; <hi>If you repent and believe, you shall have
pardon and be saved:</hi> and therefore sometime I believe,
and sometimes I doubt again. Afterward, I had tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to drinking, and to vain courses, nigh half a
year; yet when Sabbath came, my heart would turn
to God; when the Soldiers came upon us on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
while wee were at meeting, and made us bring
our guns hither: then my heart said, Sure God hath not
said, Keep the Sabbath day holy; and then my heart
cast off God, yet it was only in my heart. When wee
came to the Magistrates, and <hi>Cutshamoquin</hi> asked, Why
they came on the Sabbath day? my heart was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and I did believe, when wee went from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.
I was thirsty, and I drank a great deal;
and I was drunk, and was carried before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and then I was ashamed. Then I came to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31272:8"/>
Ministers house, and I was greatly ashamed; and my
heart said, Sure I have now cast off praying to God;
but I repented and cryed to God, Oh God, pardon all
my sins, and this my sin; for my sins are great. I had
other temptations to drinking, and I found my heart
weak, and doubting, but my heart was troubled, and I
was ready to stumble like a little weak childe.</p>
                  <p>After this, I heard that word of God, Mat. 12. <hi>Do
yee not remember what David did on the Sabbath day, and
was blamelesse?</hi> Then I thought the Souldiers did not
sin; but then I saw that I was a great sinner, and that I
had broken the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Again, I heard that word, Mat. 3. <hi>Every tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down and cast into
the fire:</hi> and this troubled mee, because I had evil
fruits.</p>
                  <p>Again, Mat. 6. Christ saith, <hi>Be ye not like hypocrites,
which seem to pray before men.</hi> I thought this was my
case, I did only pray before men, but I doubted of
Christ and his Grace.</p>
                  <p>Again, Mat. 5. <hi>Who ever breaks the least of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and teach men so to do, shall be least in the
Kingdom of heaven.</hi> Then I was troubled, because I
had been an active sinner, in lust, and other sins, and I
was worse then a beast in my sins. Then I cryed to
God, Oh Christ pardon all my great sins, Oh Christ
have mercy on mee, Oh God remember mee, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all my sins. Thus I cryed and desired pardon, but
I was weak in believing. But then, about two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I was greatly troubled about my weakness: I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to do well, but I was weak: Then I cryed to God,
Oh God help mee by thy spirit in mee, and send thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31272:8"/>
spirit into my heart. Sometimes I read and taught
on the Sabbath day, but weakly. Then I heard, <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. Christ bid the people <hi>do what the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
said, but not do as they do.</hi> I said (Lord) that is my
case; I teach better then I do: and therefore I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
repentance for my sin, and to forsake my sin. Then
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. Christ saith, <hi>Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam
out of thy own eye, and then thou mayst see clearly to cast
the mote out of thy brothers eye.</hi> My heart said, Truly it
is so; I teach others, but I do not well my self; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
sin, and yet I do it. Then was my heart weary,
and I desired again to do well, and amend, but I found
my self very weak. Sometime my heart hated pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, and meeting on the Sabbath dayes; and
therefore I see I deserve hell torments: and then I cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Oh Christ pardon all these my sins. Then afterward
my heart desired strongly to pray unto God, but I saw
I deserved misery and punishment, and I was weak.
Then I desired my heart might be made strong by
Church-covenant, Baptism, and the Lords Supper,
which might be as a Fort to keep me from enemies, as a
Fort keepeth us from our outward enemies. Yet my
heart was sometime backward, and said, No matter,
do it not, but still do what thy heart would have thee.
And I saw Satan did thus follow mee with these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to misbelief and doubting. But now I see Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
tempteth mee, because hee desireth I should be ever
tormented with him. Then I learned that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
<hi>I am the true bread, and hee that eateth mee shall live for
ever, and hee that drinketh my blood shall have life; but
hee that doth not eat my flesh and drink my blood shall not
have life.</hi> Then my heart saith, Truth Lord, that is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31272:9"/>
my case. Again I learnt, <hi>Iohn 3. Hee that believeth
shall not perish, but have eternal life:</hi> And my heart said,
Yea Lord, let it be so.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Christ saith, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter <hi>a Rock,
and on this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of
Hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> Therefore my heart
said, I desire this; because <hi>Christ dwells in the Church,
and is in the midst of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where two or three are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my name.</hi> Oh! I do therefore desire Church
Ordinances, that I might be with Christ, and that I
might have the Seals. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. Christ sayes, <hi>Let it be:
for it is necessary that I should fulfill all righteousness:</hi> My
heart said, Oh that I might also so do O Lord, now
my heart desireth and thirsteth; Oh God have mercy
on mee and pity my weakness, that I may have pardon
in Christ, and strength from Christ in all his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that I might leave all my sins; and Oh God
pardon all my sins for thy mercies sake; I know not
what to do I am so weak, Oh God help, and have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on mee. And the same I desire of you, before
whom I am in this house, help mee; for <hi>Mat. 16. whom
yee binde on earth are bound in heaven, and whom yee loose
on earth are loosed in heaven:</hi> and my desire is, that
Christ would pardon all my sins, and that I may be
helped.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, I make confession in the presence of God,
and of all these Elders: and this I confesse, that
I am not able to speak before the Lord, yet I do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God requireth I should. Assuredly I am a
sinner, but now I hope Christ hath taught mee his
Word; Oh let him (my Lord!) help mee to speak it.</p>
                  <p>I confesse, that in my mothers belly I was defiled
in sin: my father and mother prayed to many gods, and
I heard them when they did so; and I did so too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my parents did so: and in my childhood, (afore
I could act sin) I did delight in it, as dancing and Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waug:
and when they did so, they prayed to many
gods, as Beasts, Birds, Earth, Sea, Trees, &amp;c. After I
was born, I did all such things. I loved lust when I was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31272:10"/>
a youth, though I did act these lusts but a little. But
when I had a little begun, my heart did very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more to do such sins: I saw the <hi>English</hi> keep Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
I cared not, but played, and catch't birds, or any
thing: yet when I saw <hi>Englishmen,</hi> I ran away, on the
Sabbath day, because they should not see mee. As yet
I knew not of great sins, as Murder, Adultery: then
some <hi>Indians</hi> said we must pray to God. When I was
in <hi>English</hi> houses, I saw them pray, and I thought it a
vain work. They said there was but one God; I
thought, nay, there be many Gods. When <hi>Indians</hi>
said, Wee will pray, my heart said, No; I will not so
long as I live. Yet I heard more and more of praying
to God, and that my brothers prayed to God;
but my heart said, Praying to God is vain. After
I heard <hi>Waban</hi> did pray, and my brothers, <hi>Wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

well enough. I have not so sinned as other men, I am
no Murderer, Adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I ran away; yet I
was not much troubled, because my brothers prayed.
A little after I came, and my brother said to mee; I
pray you pray to God. I answered him not, but my
heart said, No: yet I was troubled, because I heard my
brothers. I thought, if any should kill my brothers, I
would kill him: if any Warrs were, I would go with
my brothers; only I thought of my love to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and then that, if my brother make Warr, I

on Sabbath dayes, then I thought I would do so: but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31272:10"/>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Roxbury.</hi> My brother said to
me. Go you, because you may learn <hi>Smithery:</hi> For
that reason I did go, but desired not to learn to pray:
all these things were vain. When we came to <hi>Roxbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
I said, I desired to learn <hi>Smithery:</hi> But my Master
said, I may not teach him my Trade, lest <hi>Indians</hi> learn
to make Locks and Guns. Then I would not dwell
with him, and thought to cast off praying, and thought
I would forsake my brothers. My brother perswaded
mee to dwell one year there, but I would not: yet at
last I did dwell there one year, and went to meeting, but
in vain, for I understood not one word. After that
year, I returned to <hi>Noonantam,</hi> and then I heard that
God made all the world, but yet I did not pray to God
one jot, but still sinned, and especially the sin of Lust,
&amp; I made light of any sin. I heard, and understood the
Commands of God, <hi>Thou shalt not murder, commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
steal, bear false witness, covet;</hi> and that made me
afraid to commit sin afore man, lest I should be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or put to death, but I feared not God. After I
heard the Minister ask, <hi>Who made you?</hi> A. <hi>God:</hi> and
<hi>Who redeemed you?</hi> A. <hi>Christ:</hi> and <hi>Who must sanctifie
you? The holy Ghost,</hi> and that God made Heaven,
Earth, Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I a little considered of God, who
made all this world, and then I was afraid. I saw that
no man could make these things, and that therefore we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31272:11"/>
must pray to God, Then my heart said, Assuredly it
is so; God made all things, and made mee, and I must
pray to him: After this, my brothers were sick, and I
prayed God, Oh that they may live! and then I
heard, that now God tryeth mee whether I will pray or
no. I confesse I have done many sins, especially lust,
though I had not been a Murderer, or the like. But
then my brothers and kindred dyed: then my heart
said, Sure it's a vain thing to pray to God; for I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet my friends dye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> therefore I will run wilde, and
did cast off praying, I did not pray morning and
night, and at meat, only on the Sabbath day I came to
meeting, but I cared not for hearing, nor did I believe
any thing I heard, but I still lived in sin, and my heart
said, I will run away; for here we are hindred from sin,
in other places I may freely sin. Then my brothers
which lived were troubled for mee. Then I said I will
abide with my brothers, because I love them, but not
because I would pray.</p>
                  <p>Then that Winter God broke my head; I knew
but little, I was almost dead: Then my heart said, Now
I know God is angry with mee for my sins, and hath
therefore smote mee; then I prayed hard, when I was
almost dead. I remembred my sins much, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them much: I remembred that God made all the
world, and therefore assuredly there is a God. I heard
that God made <hi>Adam,</hi> and made him in his own image,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and assuredly none but God could make all the
world, heaven, earth, sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I did believe that
God did make the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, I confesse, I saw that I had offended against
God, and sinn'd against him, and that I had the root of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31272:11"/>
sin in me, and that I had deserved all miseries, and death,
and hell. I heard, that God made a Covenant with
<hi>Adam,</hi> and forbad him to eat of the Tree in the midst
of the Garden; and yet he did eat, and therefore God
was angry with man: and I was born in sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God was angry with me: and because I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
forsaken God, and run wilde, therefore I now
know my sin and my offence against God. I desire no
more to cast off God and prayer, for now I know my
sins, and that I have deserved misery: therefore now I
desired to pray to God, as long as I live. I desired
pardon of my sins, and I thought it may be God will
pardon mee: and my heart prayed to God, Oh God
if thou give mee life again, I will assuredly believe and
obey; and now I know my sins by the sin of <hi>Adam:</hi>
but when I had thus done, quickly my heart would be
vain again. After my wound, when I came to my self
and awaked, I saw my sin, and promised God to pray
unto him, when I saw the mercy of God was so great
unto mee: I heard that word, Say not, I will pray
hereafter, but now, <hi>Today if yee will hear his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
not your hearts,</hi> but pray to God; and that made
my heart to yield to do it. Then I understood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
that <hi>God formed man out of the dust of the earth, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
into him a living soul:</hi> by this I did believe that
God made me. And I heard that <hi>God caused Adam to
sleep, and took out a rib, and made it a woman:</hi> and by this
I believed, that surely this is the work of God. Again
I heard, that <hi>wee are born in sin, under the guilt of Adams
sin:</hi> and by that I believed that I was a sinner. Again
I heard, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that <hi>all the thoughts and imaginations of
the heart of man, are only evil continually;</hi> and that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31272:12"/>
God did threaten <hi>to destroy man whom hee had made, and
all beasts and living creatures which hee had made:</hi> and by
this I saw, that surely sin is a very great evil.</p>
                  <p>Again I heard, that <hi>Noah found grace, and hee onely
was upright before God,</hi> and that <hi>God drowned all the world,
except Noah, and his sons, and their wives, eight persons:</hi>
this did make mee remember my sinnes, and confesse
them, and I saw that God is angry with sin. <hi>It rained
forty dayes, and so drowned all the world:</hi> then I said,
Surely this is Gods work, and hee doth as he threatned
to do to sinners; and the same may God do to me, who
am a sinner; and my heart is full of sin, and evil
thoughts, &amp;c. And then I prayed, Oh God be not
angry with mee, but be mercifull to mee, and shew mee
what I should do. Then I considered why did God bid
<hi>Noah</hi> make an Ark, and saved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, and
their Wives: and by it my heart saw, that this is Gods
work, who does what hee speaketh, and hath mercy on
whom hee will. And my heart thought, does God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
mee, and love mee? It may be God will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on mee. I heard that promise, Mat. 3. <hi>Repent and
believe, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand:</hi> then my
heart said, Oh that God would help mee, and pardon
my sins. And God made mee wonder at Gods mercy
to mee. I heard of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and their great sin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and that did make me to remember my great
sins, and the great work of God that hee had almost
kill'd mee; Oh, I thought this is Gods work, to shew
mee my sinnes: and as God saved <hi>Lot</hi> by the Angels,
and sent him out of the place, but burnt <hi>Sodom</hi> and all
the people, this I saw to be Gods work, &amp; now I desired
to fear God and pray unto him all the dayes of my life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31272:12"/>
Again I heard, Mat. 3. <hi>The axe is laid to the root of the
tree, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen
down, and cast into the fire:</hi> then I feared my own case,
because my fruits were sin, and I deserved to be cut
down; then I desired to believe in Christ. I did believe
that Christ is the Son of God, by that word <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.
Satan tempted Christ, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi>
but Christ conquered Satan; and therefore assuredly
hee is the Son of God. Then I considered that place,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. Many came to Christ, the halt, and blinde, and
lame, and deaf, and sick, and hee healed all, and if they
did but touch Christ they were healed; and therefore
my heart believed assuredly, hee is the Son of God:
and therefore now I will pray, and Oh let Christ save
mee. And Christ hath promised, <hi>Whatever yee ask in
my name, it shall be done:</hi> therefore now I prayed, Oh
Christ Jesus pardon mee; but my heart is weak and
doubting, and I cannot believe. And I heard that
word, that <hi>every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is
cut down and cast into the fire:</hi> then I said, I deserve
that. Again, that word, <hi>Not every one that sayeth, Lord,
Lord, but hee that heareth the Word, and doeth it.</hi> Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
it is so; and I desire not only to hear the Word,
but to do it: then my heart was ashamed of my sinnes,
and grieved. I heard that word, Matth. 6. <hi>Blessed art
thou Simon bar-Ionah, flesh and blood hath not revealed
this unto thee, but my heavenly Father:</hi> then my heart
said, Yea Lord, no man has taught mee Christ, onely
God hath taught my heart to know Christ.</p>
                  <p>Again, I heard that word, Mat. 1. <hi>Hee will save his
people from their sins:</hi> then my heart said, Be it so to
mee, Oh Lord. Again, I heard that Christ rose again
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31272:13"/>
the third day with an Earth-quake; and the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were afraid, and fled: then my heart said, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is Christ the Son of God; and whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in Christ, his soul shall go to heaven: For again,
I heard of the Ascension of Christ, and more then
five hundred saw him ascend; and therefore I believe
this is Christ the Son of God. Again, I heard that
in John 14. <hi>No man cometh unto the Father, but by mee:</hi>
my heart answered, Yea assuredly, Oh Lord, Christ is
the way, to believe in, and come to God.</p>
                  <p>Again, I heard that <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Christ saith to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<hi>Depart yee cursed:</hi> I said, God might justly say
so to mee, and send mee to eternal death. But I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
cryed to God, Oh God, set mee into the right
way, and give mee Christ, that I may ever walk with
Christ; for I am poor and weak: and Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that <hi>what wee ask hee will grant;</hi> and I say, Let
God do with mee what hee will: but I beg mercy in
Christ, onely I desire to pray to God as long as I
live.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="confession">
                  <head>Iohn Speen.</head>
                  <p>THis I confess, that I assuredly am a great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before the Lord: but now I beseech God to
help mee; Oh Christ, lead mee in the right way, that I
may speak that which is right.</p>
                  <p>This I confesse, that before wee prayed to God, I
was wholly a sinner, and not only before, but since
praying to God, I have been a great sinner: and now
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31272:13"/>
I desire to make a short confession [for we desired that
they would be shorter, the time requiring so]. At first
when I prayed, my prayer was vain, and only I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with my mouth; and on the Sabbath, only I came
to the House of Prayer. I prayed morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and when I eat, but I considered not what I
prayed for; I was sometime angry and passionate about
wordly matters; and I was troubled when I saw my
brother was chosen to be a Ruler, who was younger
then I; because now I saw that I was a sinner; and
though I repented, yet presently again I fell into sin:
therefore I thought, surely God hath cast me off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I thus sin; and still my heart was full of sin, all
my thoughts were full of sin, all my talk and doings
were sinfull.</p>
                  <p>But now of late, about 2 yeares ago, I heard this
word, Mat. 12. <hi>When the unclean spirit was cast out, hee
went up and down unquiet; then hee returned and took</hi> 7
<hi>devils with him, worse then himself, and dwelt in that man,
and the latter end of that man was worse then his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
When I heard this I feared, my heart feared; I
feared that my repentance and praying and all was
nought, and that God hath almost quite cast me off.
Then I considered how I fell into these sins: I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that the Serpent did deceive the woman, &amp; she the
man, and thereby brought sin; and thereupon God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
both the man and the woman. Hearing this, my
heart thought; Surely I am a great sinner, and I was
born in sin, because my parents were sinners, and so am
I. I have sinned against God, and I was born in sin. My
Parents broke that Command, <hi>Thou shalt have no other
gods but Mee;</hi> but they served many gods, and so did I,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31272:14"/>
and therefore the earth bringeth forth thorns and
weeds unto man, when he laboreth: therefore by this
I remembred my troublesom life, and all is because
God is offended at me, because of my sins. And then
I remembred that many of my children are dead; this
is Gods punishment on me, because of my sins. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
men punished me, and were offended at me, but
now I remembred my sins against God, and I saw that
the punishments of God are a greater matter. Again,
I heard that word, that <hi>hee that keepeth his word shall
finde mercy.</hi> I thought so it is indeed; but I am a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I considered what I should do, because I was a
sinner, and born in sin, and have lived in sin. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
assuredly there is a God, and God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, and all that is therein, and all destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and deaths are the work of God. I remembred
my vain praying to God, and considered what to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I confessed my sins before God, and begged pardon for
Christ his sake. I did finde I could not deliver my
self, but Christ only is my deliverer; and my heart
desired to believe, and pray to him, and yet knew not
what to do, nor how to please God, and get pardon;
only I prayed, Oh Christ deliver mee, because I am a
sinner, and know not what to do.</p>
                  <p>Then I remembred that God layeth on us two
deaths in this world: First, the soul is dead, and wee
are made guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and have lost Gods
Image, and hereby my soul is a fool, and hereby my
soul is dead: and a man dead can do nothing, nor speak,
nor go, nor stand, and verily so is my soul dead, and I
shall fall to eternal damnation by sin. Therefore now I
cry to God to help mee, for I am throughly a sinner.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31272:14"/>
After I heard that God pardoneth penitent believers:
and I remember the word of <hi>Ionas,</hi> when he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
cast off, he repented, and God made a Whale to
eat him up; and then he looked to God, and cryed for
mercy; and then I saw that if I cry for mercy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
I shall have pardon. I heard that Christ healed
all manner of diseases; therefore I believed that Christ
is the Son of God, able to heal and pardon all. Now
I confess I know nothing, almost nothing at all. Again,
Christ saith, <hi>Hee that is not with mee is against mee;</hi> my
heart said, True it is so, so must I do, I must be with
Christ: and, <hi>Hee that gathereth not, scattereth;</hi> I said,
So it is with mee, I have so done; I scatter, and am a
stranger to Christ. And I did not truly love them that
prayed to God, but I was a stranger in heart unto
them. But now I desire in my heart to do as they do;
and our poor teaching, I desire to obey it, and do what
God bids; and what he saith you shall not do, that I
desire not to do: But yet again I do sin, and my sins
troubled me by hearing the word of God, and yet I
would do them. I heard that God will pardon all
kinde of sins, that men sin, <hi>but the sin against the Holy
Ghost shall not be pardoned in this world, nor in that which
is to come.</hi> Then I fear'd that I was such an one, and
that God would not pardon me. Then I earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
God to pardon and deliver me, because he was
the true deliverer. Again, I heard that word, that <hi>they
that are well need not the Physitian, but the sick.</hi> My
heart said, True; I did even so, I sought not help
when I was well, but now I remember my sins, and
now my soul is dead, and now I desire that my soul
may live, and I desire the Physitian of my soul to heal
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31272:15"/>
mee; and Christ will not in vain heal souls, but such
as convert from sin, and believe in Christ, their sins
Christ pardoneth: this my soul doth earnestly beseech
of Christ, and else I know not what to do. Again, I
heard that <hi>Christ dyed for our sins,</hi> when we are sinners.
Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. Christ saith, <hi>This is my blood of the
New Testament, which is shed for many, for the remission
of sins:</hi> my heart said, Yea (Lord) let it be so for my
soul, and let me not be a stranger any more before
thee. I know not what to do, Lord help. I desire
to be washed from all my filthy sins, and to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as a sign of it. I am as a dead man in my soul,
and desire to live.</p>

                  <head>Ponampam.</head>
                  <p>A Little I shall speak. I was young, about 8
years old when my father lived. I did play as
other children did, and my father did chide me for
playing. I wondered at it, for he said we shall all die.
I wondered and sat amazed about half an hour, but I
soon forgot it. That Winter the Pox came, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all our kindred dyed. I and my mother came
to the Bay, and there dwelt till we pray'd to God; but
I did nothing but sin, as the rest of the world did.
Then hearing the word of God, I heard that <hi>from the
rising of the sun to the setting thereof, my Name shall be
known among the Gentiles:</hi> therefore all must pray to
God. But my heart did not desire that, but to go away
to some other place. But remembring the word of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31272:15"/>
God, that all shall pray to God. Then I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to go away, but to pray to God. But if I pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sachems pray, I fear they will kill me, and
therefore I will not pray. But yet when others prayed,
I prayed with them; and I thought, if I run away to
other places, they will pray too, therefore I will pray
here. Then on a Sabbath, none taught, and some
bid me teach, what the Minister had taught us; but I
feared, and durst not for fear of the Sachems, yet they
urged me, and I did. And I taught them what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
and they were angry at me, and we fell out,
and I went away. I thought that my praying would
be in vain, and I laid by praying; and there was Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wauing,
but I doubted to do that, because I had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I did think they would laugh at me. After I
returned again, and was among them which prayed, but
my heart did not rightly pray, though I came on the
Sabbath day. Then about the time that my Son (who
was at School) was born, the Minister taught on
1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>Thou Solomon my son, know the God of
thy fathers, &amp;c. if thou seek him, hee will be found of
thee; if thou forsake him, hee will cast thee off for ever:</hi>
Then I feared, for I said, This already I have done,
I have cast off God, and therefore he will cast off me;
for every such one God will cast off, I know not what
to do. It repented me for my sin, I feared Gods wrath
and damnation. Then I prayed, and call'd upon God,
yet only sometimes I repented, and after I found my
heart full of sin again: But then I was angry at my self,
and knew not what to do; alwayes I did fear, God hath
cast me off, for all my many sins which I have done.
Hereby I was troubled and angry at my self. Then I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31272:16"/>
heard that word, <hi>Who ever repent and believe shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Il'e pardon them:</hi> Then my heart cryed, Oh
Christ let it be so, that my sins may be pardoned, and
that I may pray alwaies. Then I begged, Lord give
me repentance and faith, and I did pray to God much.
Then I did beg, that I might give up my self, wife, and
children to God as long as we live; and then I prayed.
Then I heard that word, <hi>Mat. 5. Hee that looks on a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to lust after her, hath committed adultery in his heart.</hi>
I then remembred my sins; that though I had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to pray, yet I had thus sinned, and my heart was
now troubled about this. My heart said, Cast off pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because you are filthy in lust, your heart and eyes
still commit adultery; therefore run away from these
that pray to God, and go to <hi>Qunniticot,</hi> or some other
place; and if you be in other places, you may do what
you will, and my heart almost inclined to this sin:
But after that, this merciful word of God I heard, That
<hi>Satan led Christ into the wilderness to tempt him,</hi> and so
I thought hee would do me. Then I desired God to
be merciful to me; then I turned to God, and cryed,
but knew not what to do, for I feared God had cast
me off, and I shall perish for ever; God has cast me
off, and I have deserved hell fire. Then I heard that
word, Joh. 14. 6. <hi>None come to the Father but by me:</hi> I
did pray, Oh Christ let it be so, that by thee I may
come to God; and I pray Christ Jesus pardon all my
sins, this mercy I beg. Then I repented my casting
off praying to God; then I promised I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again to sin, and if Christ help me, I and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall serve God. Then that Spring my mother
and two children dyed, and I was troubled, and knew
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31272:16"/>
not what to do; my heart said, Lay by prayer, but
that I did not: but I saw Christ came to give eternal
life, and therefore what Christ will do for me, so let it
be. Therefore I believe only in Christ for eternal life;
and what Christ will do with my soul, so let it be;
and my soul desireth that I may receive the Seals to
make strong my heart.</p>

                  <p>ASsuredly, I have nothing that I should confesse as
I ought, for my heart is full of foolishness and
darkness; stopt up is my heart, and deaf are my ears.
I know not by what way I can get life. I was born in
sin into this world, and therefore I am in folly, and
I know my heart is full of foolishness and ignorance.
I am a great sinner ever since I saw light in this world;
my foolishness appeareth in every thing I do in this life.
I know not what God hath given me, but now I hear
of the mercy of God, who hath made the world, and
all things in it; by this great work of his I know
there is a God, and because my heart checketh mee
for sin, and I fear the punishment of God: And the
Word of God now sheweth me that there is a God;
therefore my heart sayes, I desire to pray to God:
and because God is angry with me for all my sins, I
know nothing by my self but that which is evil. I
heard that word Mat. 5. <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Then my heart
said, So be it Oh Lord to me, and I love thee as long
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31272:17"/>
as I live. Then said my heart, I am a poor man, and
desire to pray to God. Again, God said, <hi>Blessed are
they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall
be filled.</hi> Then when I heard that word, my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced;
and yet again I doubted, and my heart mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed
and feared. Then that word came, that
Christ saith, <hi>Be ye mercifull, as your heavenly father is
merciful.</hi> And again, <hi>Hee maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good; and sendeth rain on the just and on
the unjust.</hi> When I heard it, my heart rejoyced to
hear of the mercy of God; yet I doubted, and my
heart was hard again. Now I confess before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God is a great God, and a mercifull God, and
I pray to him. I heard of Gods great mercy, to give
us his only Son to dye for us; therefore I loved God,
and I begged, Oh God pardon all my sins, and I give

not know that there was a God, only I lived for
nothing, for no end or purpose; but I alwaies did wilde
actions. I kept no Sabbath, nor Lecture, nor any
work of Prayer; nor did I remember my works. I
now know that all my words and works are naught,
my eyes and ears are stopped, and mad works I dayly
did. After I went to <hi>Dorchester</hi> Indians, the praying
Indians; and they that were my friends, did say it was
good to pray to God; and said, Tomorrow is our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31272:17"/>
and the Minister cometh to teach us; then my
heart desired to see the Minister, and hear what he
said: next day he came, and taught the Indians; I
went and desired to see: when I came, my son <hi>Sam.</hi>
came with mee; the Minister call'd my son, and set
him afore, and asked him, <hi>Who made him?</hi> and he was
taught to answer, <hi>God.</hi> Then he commended my son,
and asked whose son he was; they said, <hi>Mine.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
gave him two apples: then the Minister said to
me, Do you pray to God? you see your childe saith,
God made him;<note place="margin">[Note here that God hath so blessed this youth, that hee is one of our School-masters, and an hopefull young man.]</note>
and therefore it
is your duty to
pray to God:</p>
                  <p>Then I considered what he said, I could not sleep
that night. I considered whether I should pray to God;
my heart did much doubt that night! Shall I pray?
my heart said, No; yet I doubted. Then <hi>Waban</hi>
came to my house to <hi>Nipmuk,</hi> and perswaded me to
pray to God; I said, I know not how to pray. Hee
said, God will teach you; God is a great God, and
made all the world. I answered, Who knoweth that?
and who can witness that? He said, The Minister is
sent of God, and sheweth us Gods Word, and hee
by that teacheth us, Then I promised <hi>Waban,</hi> that
when hee came again I would pray to God. Then
<hi>Toteswamp</hi> came, and exhorted me to pray to God, and
told me of Christ, and pardon of sin; and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
my heart prayed to God. Then I said, <hi>English</hi>
men understand not me, and does God understand
me? They said, God made all<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and understands all:
then I said, I will pray to God. Then I heard first,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31272:18"/>
that <hi>God made heaven, and earth, and all things, and in six
dayes finished them;</hi> and also <hi>made man in his own Image,</hi>
wise and holy like God. Then I heard that <hi>Satan
came and tempted Eve,</hi> and cozened her, and she tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
the man. And God had said, <hi>Eat not of the tree
in the midst of the Garden, if yee eat thereof yee shall dye;</hi>
yet she did eat, and gave unto man, and he did eat:
and thereby he sinned, and all his posterity became
sinful, and deserved damnation. Then my heart said,
What shall I do? and I prayed for my children, for
now I hear of eternal damnation, and sure I am a
great sinner. Again, I heard the Minister preach,
That Christ was born like a man, and was both God
and man, and dyed for us, and sheweth us the way of
eternal life. Then I cryed, Oh Lord give me Christ,
because Christ hath dyed for us, and hath made his
righteousness ours, and our sins are Christs, as <hi>Adam</hi>
made his sin ours. Now my heart was broken, and I
saw that I was a great sinner. When I heard of the
great works of Christ, I said, Oh what shall I do,
that I may get Christ? &amp; I said in my heart, Oh let the
holy Spirit help me, for I am ashamed of my sins;
melted is my heart, and I desire pardon of all my sins;
now I desire to forsake all my sins, and now I desire
dayly to quench lusts, and wash off filth, and cast out
all my sins, by the blood of Jesus Christ, and this I
do by believing in Jesus Christ. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. there was
only one <hi>Noah</hi> righteous, and God saved him: then
my heart said, Oh mercifull God, who savest them

now I desire to have this Covenant, and to receive

                  <p>OH Christ help mee! I confess my sins before
God, and before men. We are all born in sin,
because <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, and made his sin ours. Our
Parents knew not God, nor the way of life; we In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
are all sinners, and did all sins, afore we heard
of God; we did pray to every thing that is in the
world, and knew not the way of life. When <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
men came first, we did pray to the Devil, and
many were our sins; and God doth know all our sins,
all which we have committed, before the <hi>English</hi> came.
After the <hi>English</hi> came, I went to <hi>Sudbury,</hi> to Mr <hi>Browns</hi>
house, and he said to me, Pray to God; but I did not
like it, nor to hear of praying to God; but afterwards
I heard <hi>Waban</hi> prayed to God, and I was not glad of
it; yet after <hi>Waban</hi> prayed, he told us of it, and that
the Minister came to <hi>Noonantam.</hi> I heard him, and
he taught, that the souls of good men die and go to
heaven, the souls of the wicked, when they die, they
go to hell; but I only heard it. Then we resolved we
would pray to God, and carry our children to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
that they might learn to pray, but we feared that
we should not learn to pray. After the Minister taught
that word, that every man himself must pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be saved; and though your sons be at <hi>Roxbury,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:31272:19"/>
and learn to pray, yet if you pray not, you must be
damned.</p>
                  <p>Again, I heard many words of God; this was one,
<hi>Therefore watch, for ye know not the day, or hour, when
the Lord will come:</hi> When I heard that, I knew not
what to do, nor do I know when is the day of death.
But I am full of sin, and when I die Christ will not
receive me, because I am so full of sin. After that
my wise dyed, and then weak was my heart, almost I
left praying to God, but yet I did not so. But after,
I heard that word of God, <hi>Who ever heareth the word,
and doeth it, is like a wise builder, who built on a rock;
and when the storms and floods came and beat upon the
house, it stood, because it was built upon a rock: But
hee that heareth the word, and doth it not, is like a
foolish builder, who built upon the sand, and the
storms and floods came and beat upon that house, and
it fell, because it was built on the sand.</hi> By this I
saw that I was a foolish builder, because the death
of my wife did almost make me leave praying to God.
After I had another wife, and shee dyed also: Then I
heard that word, That it is Gods love, by afflictions, to
call us to repentance; and therefore my heart said, Oh
Lord I will pray, Oh Lord help me. Again, I heard
another word, that <hi>at the end of the world all must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Iudgment Seat of Christ:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now confess all your sins, and repent, because
Christ hath writ down all your actions, both good and
bad, and all shall be opened; and therefore repent
of your sins, that they may be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Then I said, I am a great sinner, and ever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sin; I confesse I have deserved hell, and I cannot

deliver my self; but I beg of God, Oh Lord give me
Christ; and I give my soul to Christ, that all my sins
may be pardond, and I now confess my sins before man
but at the end of the world I must be judged by Jesus
Christ. Now I desire the spirit of God would help
me to confess all my sins to God, that they may be
pardoned in Jesus Christ.</p>

their Confession, after the Lord

and before the Elders made his
Confession as followeth.</head>
                  <p>UNto this day I do understand but little of the
<hi>English</hi> Language; the Word of God came
not first unto my heart by the <hi>English</hi> Language. I did
not know what state I was in at my first birth, and my
sin by birth I knew not: When I was young I knew
not what I was, as now I do know; for now I know
that I am a sinful man. Since I prayed to God, I know
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31272:20"/>
more of my self; but afore, I cared not for such things,
nor what they said. If I heard any thing, I took no
heed to it; if any asked me whether I knew God, I did
not regard it; yea, I hated the knowledg of God,
nor did I regard any word of God: but other kinde
of praying (which we used) I did love; to pray to
the Devil, this I loved.</p>
                  <p>But afterward, I began to think; it may be they
say true, that speak of God; it may be it is true, that
God is in heaven; and should any teach me in my
language, I might know God: but if I should pray,
it may be it is in vain to pray in my language; could
I speak <hi>English,</hi> I might learn to pray. And I see the
<hi>English</hi> love us, and therefore it is like, that is true
which they say of God, and I desire to live for ever
where they do. When I first heard the Word, it said,
God is good; a little I believed it, but I did more
doubt.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Iackson</hi> asked me if I did pray to God: I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him whether God understood our language, if I
prayed to him: Hee said, yea, all things God doth
know, and all languages. Then my heart said, It may
be I may attain to pray. But my heart was hard, and
therefore I could not pray, afterwards it may be I
may. Sometime I thought if we did not pray, the
<hi>English</hi> might kill us; but if I prayed, I thought I
did not pray right. When I saw, and considered,
that all men in the world dyed, I knew not how I
might come to live for ever, how my soul might live,
and therefore I desired I might pray to God aright;
because they that so pray, are all one as if they dyed
not, but live for ever. I wish't I could pray aright,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31272:21"/>
but could not tell how to do it. I did in my heart love
wandering about, and our wilde courses alwaies; and
when I did pray, it was but out-side praying, for in my
heart I understood not right praying to God; I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not how to pray, and I regarded not my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
of that which was good, many things hindred
my heart; I was ashamed, because my heart was full of
evil. Sometimes I thought of my sins, but it was but
a little, and I was soon weary of any good. I did
not think God was not mercifull, but I saw my heart
was naught, and very little did I know the evils of my
heart. No humility was in my heart, and to this day
my heart is evil, and hard is my heart, When you
taught us the Word of God, my heart did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but went contrary to the Word of God. I saw
my mourning for sin was not good: I do confess my
heart did not submit to God, only I hoped I might
might learn the Word of God, which you taught us.
My heart did afore love praying to the Devil, but I
do not finde that I so love praying to God: therefore
I did pray, Lord break my heart, that I may pray to
God aright. My heart was weary of praying quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and therefore my heart said, Surely my heart is
nought, and I am like a dead man: and therefore I
prayed, Lord help me now to pray aright to God.
Now I knew that God knoweth all the thoughts of
my heart, and my many sins, and contrary doings, and
how little I know of God. Surely I am a great sinner,
and this I do throughly know, that great are my sins,
and that my heart is contrary to praying to God, and
my heart desired wilde courses, and I see that my heart
loveth not praying to God. Yet now my heart began
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31272:21"/>
to desire to pray, and to love those things which are
according to right praying; but I knew not what to
do. Then I asked what I should do; then I heard this
answer, I should desire Christ to break my heart by
his spirit, none else in the world could do it; no man
could work faith in me, but the Word which I heard
doth it. I could not my self repent of sin, or be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
but this I know, that the Word of God saith,
<hi>Those that believe in Christ shall not perish, but have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life:</hi> Then my heart said, Oh Lord, let it be so
to me, and let not my heart say contrary. Again I
heard, <hi>If any be foolish, let him ask wisedom of God,
who giveth freely:</hi> Then my heart said, I am foolish,
Oh Lord teach me. Then I feared that my heart in
vain seeketh, and then I desired humility, and that I
might not pray in vain, and that I might not pray only
outwardly. But my heart had contrary and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
thoughts dayly, and my heart did not dayly
desire after God, and but a little could I remember of
God. Sometime my heart desired not to be like to
such as prayed aright unto God; therefore I desired
the Image of God upon me, and that I might be like to
them w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> prayed to God aright; alwaies I thought that
what God said in his Word was right. I heard this
word, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds have nests,
but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</hi> Then
my heart said, Truth (Lord) the riches of this world
are of no value; and therefore I desire not this worlds
goods, but only heavenly blessings and grace, &amp; I desire
the way to the Heavenly Kingdom. And always my
heart saith, touching my poverty and misery, I give
myself and my soul to God and to Christ, because
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31272:22"/>
that is right. Again, I learn in the Catechize, Q. <hi>What
hath Christ done for us?</hi> A. <hi>He dyed for us, hee was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
he rose again for us, and by his resurrection hee
raiseth our souls unto grace, and also at the last day:</hi>
And my heart said, Oh let it be so in me! Again it is
said, <hi>What else hath Christ done for us?</hi> A. <hi>He ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to heaven, to raise our hearts first to heaven, and
then to carry us to heaven also, to be with him for ever.</hi>
My heart saith, Oh God I am not able to save my
self, I cannot save my own soul, this is only thy work
Oh God, and my heart believeth it; and with God is
mercy and goodness, but in this world is nothing but
weariness, and I know my weakness; therefore I am
ashamed, and Oh let God put grace into my heart;
and my heart saith, Oh let me not say in vain that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
Oh Lord help that I may truly believe, not by
my works, but by thy Word Oh God. Again it is
said in Catechism, <hi>Why is Christ a Prophet?</hi> A. <hi>To
teach me the way to heaven:</hi> therefore my heart desireth
that Christ may ever lead me by his Word; and it is
only the mercy of Christ that must do this for me, and
he giveth me true comfort only by believing in him.</p>

               <p>THe Lord was so graciously with them in these
Confessions, that they had good acceptance.
Wee advised with the Church touching our further
progress; the conclusion whereof was, that we sent
Letters to all the neighbor-Churches, informing them
of our progress in this matter, in order to our receiving
them; desiring them, or any among them, that had any
just offence against any of these eight Indians, whom we
named, that they would orderly communicate the
same unto us, and seasonably; or if they had such
knowledg of any of them, as to give us encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we should be thankfull; or their silence, we
should take in good part also. We had both incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and testimony from some Churches, only
the paucity of Interpreters to co-attest with my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
was a matter of much difficulty, and no
small impediment; for which cause I sent to Mr <hi>Peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
to old Mr <hi>Mayhu,</hi> to <hi>Thomas Stanton,</hi> to be present
with us, losing no known opportunity to bring our
waies into the light, and to make all things clear. We
proposed it to our Church, to agree about the publick
day of Confessions; the conclusion was, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was called, we sent unto ten Churches about us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
them by their Messengers to be present on
<hi>Roxbury</hi> Lecture day, being the 5th of the 5th Moneth,
1659. acquainting them that that day was set apart to
hear the Indians Confessions, and we requested coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and direction from them, and concurrence with
us.</p>
               <p>After Prayer, I first declared to the Congregation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31272:23"/>
what supply of Interpreters we had for co-attestation
with my Interpretation of the Indians Confessions.</p>
               <p>First, here was Mr <hi>Peirson,</hi> and we had (for clearness
of our way, because of his unacquaintance with our
dialect) ordered the confessing Indians to keep Sabbath
at <hi>Roxbury;</hi> we spent half the Sabbath among them,
a good part whereof was spent in hearing some of their
Confessions, and all the second day we so spent, so
that Mr <hi>Peirson</hi> had taken in writing all their Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
so that, if the Assembly pleased, they might
hear the Confessions which they made before the Elders
of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> which I have here in writing, and had
been already seen by sundry of the Elders; also they
might hear the Confessions which Mr <hi>Peirson</hi> and I had
taken yesterday; which (compared with what the
Lord shall assist them to utter this day) may help to
clear up the verity and reality of their hearts in these
their Confessions.</p>
               <p>Moreover I declared, that here was a godly brother
of <hi>Martyns</hi> Vineyard, named <hi>Peter Fouldger,</hi> who had
for many years taught the Indian School in Mr <hi>Mayhu's</hi>
life time; &amp; since, he hath been by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners
imployed to teach the Indians each other Sabbath; who
told me, when I spake unto him about this work, that
by reason of the different dialect, he durst not alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to give in a testimony; but if he brought one of
his Indians with him, (as need might be to help him)
then he durst undertake to give a testimony upon Oath,
if need were. This man, and his Indian with him, are
this morning come, and are present in the Assembly,
and set in a convenient feat together. Again I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that my son was present, who doth in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31272:23"/>
understand the Language: Also here are present
two sons of <hi>Thomas Stanton,</hi> one of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
maintain at the Colledg. And lastly, here
are the Indian Scholars present; so that if the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
think meet to make use of any of these youths
in this grave business, they might so do.</p>
               <p>Further I declared, that in all this matter we did
submit our selves to the guidance of the Reverend
Council here present, and desired them to direct us and
order us, as they saw meet to do in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Then we proceeded to hear the Indians Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are as followeth.</p>
               <div type="confession">
                  <head>Nishóhkou.</head>
                  <head type="sub">I called him forth, and said, Stand up and make your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee said,</hi> I Desire to confess before God and all
these wise men, and God helping by
the mercifull help of his gracious spirit, that I may
confess all my sins.</p>
                  <p>I heard that word, Gen. 5. that <hi>God made Adam in his
own Image, both male and female;</hi> and after many years
<hi>Adam</hi> begat a son in his own Image, having lost Gods
Image. And God did form man in the womb of
our mother, in <hi>Adams</hi> Image, and so I was formed in
the Image of <hi>Adam;</hi> and when I was born I lived in
the same way, in the Image of Satan, and original sin
was rooted in my heart, and grew up there; also I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31272:24"/>
confess, that when I was a Child, my Parents and I
were all wilde, we prayed to many Gods, and many
other sins we did, and all the people did the same,
both men and women, they lived in all lusts, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to every creature; the Sun, Moon, Stars, Sea,
Earth, Fishes, Fowl, Beasts, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all these
things I saw when I was a youth, and all these things
I liked and loved to do, and was delighted with these
things; in all these things I lived, and with these things
my memory was exercised, and in my youth I did
what I listed, as <hi>pauwauing,</hi> or what else I would;
when I was grown up, I loved lust, and delighted in
it, I knew it not to be a sin, but an excellent delight:
I loved all sin, but especially lust, and all that I did,
was for the sake of lust, such things as women might
like of; if I cut my hair, it was to please women; if I
cut my hair in another fashion, and left a Lock on one
side, it was with respect to lust; if I got fine cloaths,
stockins, shoes, all was for to serve lust; our meetings
and drinkings were with respect to lust: so that this was
the chief thing I did delight in; and these things were
in my bones, and there grew; then the Minister came
to <hi>Channit</hi> to teach us: I came to the Meeting, but in
vain; I came for lust to look on women, alwayes I did
thus, and I thought teaching to be madness, and so
I continued two years after we prayed to God; after
two years I heard a little, my ears were a little open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I first understood that word, <hi>He that doubteth, is
like a wave of the Sea, driven to and fro, and tossed;</hi> and
that word, <hi>If any man lack wisdome, let him ask it of
God, who giveth freely, and upbraideth no man.</hi> Also
the same Winter I heard that word, <hi>Gen. 6. God said,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31272:24"/>
I will destroy man whom I have created, and he repented
that he had made him.</hi> These things I understood and
remembred, but I confess before God, that I did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hear and know these things, as I did sometimes
speak of what I did remember, but I believed not,
yea I laughed, as other youths did, at all these
things, because thereby did original sin grow in me,
and hard it was to root it out, and hard to believe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this I heard still, and more I understood; I heard,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 16. that the people were full of sin, lust, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sin, and therefore the Lord destroyed them; and
I knew that I had the same sins, and therefore I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;
but I feared only this bodily life, and not for
my Soul: After this, my heart did a little desire to
pray to God, because God found <hi>Noah</hi> righteous, and
did save him, therefore I desired to pray; but again I
laid it by, and I said it is vain to pray, for if I pray,
and should commit sin, I shall be punished, or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
but if I pray not, I may commit what sin I
will, and have no punishment for it. About a year
after, I heard the Minister teach another word, that the
Death of Christ is precious, and our death is nothing
worth, therefore God promiseth pardon of all sins for
Christ his sake; he bid us remember this against next
time: When he came again, he asked me, and I did
remember it, and do to this day; but I confess I did
not believe, only I did remember it, and answered
when I was asked: And then again, I desired to pray
to God, and would not go away, but it was because
I loved our place and dwelling; I prayed, but I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not, I considered not Eternal Life, but only this
worldly life: And thus I went on, till they chose Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31272:25"/>
at <hi>Natik,</hi> they chose me, and I refused, because I
believed not: After that, my Wife and Child died,
and I was sick to death, but lived again, and being
well, I thought I could not pray, I was a Child, and
therefore could not, I put off praying to God, my
Relations died, and why should I pray? but then I
considered, why does God thus punish me; yea, the
Minister spake to me about it, and said, it may be it
was because I refused to do Gods work, as <hi>Moses,</hi>
when he first refused, God was patient, but when he
persisted in his refusal, God was angry; and then my
heart saw my sin, and then my heart almost believed:
I desired to do right, and to keep the Sabbath, for I
further heard in the 4th Commandment, <hi>Remember the
Sabbath to keep it holy;</hi> and <hi>Psa. 101. I will walk wisely
in a perfect way:</hi> Also in <hi>Isay 58. If thou turn away thy
foot from the Sabbath, and do not thy own works, nor
find thy own pleasure, nor speak thy own words;</hi> therefore
my Soul desired to keep the Sabbath, then the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
came upon us on the Sabbath day, while we were
at meeting, and took away our Guns, and caused us to
bring them as far as <hi>Roxbury;</hi> that night my heart was
broken off, my heart said, God is not, the Sabbath is
not, it is not the Lords Day, for were it so, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
would not have then come; then my heart cast
off praying, then we came before the Magistrates, and
<hi>Cutshamoquin</hi> asked, Why they came on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:
It was answered, that it was lawful; but I did
not understand it: That day I being very thirsty, did
drink too much, and was brought before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and was ashamed: I came to <hi>Roxbury</hi> to the
Minister, and there I was ashamed also, because I had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31272:25"/>
greatly sinned; then I cried to God for Free-mercy,
because precious is the Death of Christ, oh pardon this
my sin: Yet again I had temptations to drinking, and
then I considered what a great sinner I was, even like
a beast before God: Then I heard that word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
<hi>He that breaketh the beast of Gods Commands, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
others so to do, shall be the least in the Kingdome of
Heaven:</hi> My heart said, <hi>Lord, such an one have I been,</hi>
for I have been an active sinner; yet I cried again for
mercy, O Lord freely pardon my great sins. Again,
I confess I am very weak, even like a very child, and
I so walk, and know not what to do; if I die, I fear
I shall die in my sin; yet I cried again, O God pardon
me for Christ his sake. Again, further I confess, that
when I was troubled about our wants, poverty, and
nakedness, I considered that text, <hi>Foxes have holes,
and Birds have nests, but the Son of man hath not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to lay his head.</hi> And again, <hi>Mat. 6. The Birds plough
not, and the flowers spin not, and yet God doth both feed
and cloath them;</hi> and therefore be not over-much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about these things, yet I desire to follow labour
with my hands, because <hi>Gen</hi> 1. God gave <hi>Adam</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the creatures, and commanded him to
Till the ground: And <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. He set him in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and commanded him to dress it, and keep it:
Also <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. he said, <hi>Thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat
of thy face all thy dayes, till thou returnest to thy dust.</hi>
When I remember these things, my heart doth bow
to labour: also I heard that riches were the root of all
evil, and <hi>Dives</hi> with his fine apparel, and dainty fare,
was in hell, and poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in heaven: When
my heart is troubled about our Land, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd about riches,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31272:26"/>
I quiet my heart with these meditations. Also I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard, when my heart was troubled about Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and doubted, I heard that there is no means
of Salvation but Christ, not any thing in the world
can carry us to heaven, only Christ, which I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
by <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. where <hi>Iacob</hi> dreamed a dream, and
he saw a Ladder which stood on earth, and the top
reached up to heaven, and that Ladder is Christ; who
is Man, and so toucheth the earth; and God, and so
is in heaven, and by believing in him, we ascend to
heaven as by a ladder. This helped me almost to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and I cried, Oh Christ be thou my Ladder to
heaven! Again, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. Christ saith, <hi>None cometh
to the Father, but by me;</hi> therefore I believe, nothing
can carry me to God, but only Christ, if I penitently
believe in him. Again, I confess I do still find my
self very weak to resist sin, for if I read, and teach
on the Sabbath, I teach indeed, but I do not as I
ought; and therefore that Word of Christ doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Hear, and do what they say, but
do not as they do. When I do, among others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
sinners, that Word of Christ reproveth me:
<hi>Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye, and
then thou mayest see clearly so cast the moat out of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eye.</hi> Again, when I pray, I find hypocrisie in my
heart, to do it to be seen of men, and that Word of
Christ reproveth me, <hi>Mat. 6. They pray to be s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en of
men, verily they have their reward;</hi> and then I cryed
mightily to God, O Lord help me, pardon me, what
shall I do. Again, I heard <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. The Son of Man
hath power to pardon sin on earth, and therefore me
O Lord; then my heart did desire Christ, and to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31272:26"/>
pray as long as I live, and my heart was stirred up
thereunto, by <hi>Luke</hi> 18. Christ spake a parable, that
we should pray, and not be weary, because the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
tyred the unjust Judge, and made him help her;
how much more shall God the righteous Judge, hear
and help his children, that cry night and day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desired to pray unto God as long as I lived:
Then my heart said, What shall I do, for I am weak,
and I fear I shall perish; then I heard that word, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.
<hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life.</hi> And again it is said, that God loved his
Son, and gave all things into his hand: I am weak,
and though I pray, yet I am weak, therefore I desired
to be in Christs hand, as in a Fort; in a Fort we are
safe from exercise, they cannot easily catch us; out of
a Fort we are open to them: So I desire Church-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
the Seals of Baptisme, and the Lords Supper,
and all Church-Ordinances, as a Fort unto my Soul:
I heard that Word of Christ, <hi>Mat. 16. Thou art</hi> Peter,
<hi>and on this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> Oh I desire to be
there kept! Again, I heard <hi>Mat. 3. God is able of these
stones to raise <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p seed to</hi> Abraham; therefore raise up
me O Lord: And again, Christ came to <hi>Iohn</hi> to be
baptized, <hi>Iohn</hi> refused, but Christ said, <hi>Suffer it to be
so:</hi> It is necessary to fulfill all unrighteousness, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so I desire to do all that is right, and I desire to be
baptized. Again I confess, I fear I shall sin again,
and defile my self, after I am washed and baptized, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the dog returneth to his vomit; therefore I
cry, O God help me for thy free mercies sake. Again,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31272:27"/>
I heard that in <hi>Mat. 18. where two or three are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my Name, Christ is in the midst of them:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to have the Ordinances of Christ, to be
with Christ; but my heart saith, if I be bound by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
then I shall be imprisoned, but yet I desire
to be there in pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on with Christ; if my heart say, I
shall be as dead, but yet I desire to be so with Christ.
Again, I heard in <hi>Iohn,</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Who ever cometh to
me, I cast him not away, but he shall have life:</hi> But <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.
Christ doth say, <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that you might
have life:</hi> Therefore my heart did greatly fear, and
pray, Oh that I might come to Christ! and Christ is
the everlasting Son of God; therefore my Soul desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to be with him: And this I confess, that though I
believe in Christ, yet I am still weak; and therefore
I desire to be made strong by the Seals; but I fear I am
unworthy, because of that word, <hi>Mat. 7. Cast not
Pearls before Swine, nor holy things to dogs;</hi> yet my
heart saith, O Lord remember me, and yet let me a
dog come under thy Table to get a crum; and I cry to
God because of all my weakness! I confess I cannot
deliver, or help, or save my self, only Christ Jesus can
do it, and let Free-grace pardon me, and save me, O
God have mercy on me! Again, <hi>Mat. 18. Whatever ye
bind on earth, is bound in heaven; and whatever ye loose
on earth, is loosed in heaven;</hi> therefore I desire to be
loosed both in earth, and in heaven, and to be sealed
with Gods Seal.</p>

                     <head>When I had read this Confession of his, I said,
because the Lord hath said, that in the
mouth of two or three Witnesses, every
Truth shall be established; therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that the rest of the Interpreters might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
unto this which I had read.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, Mr. <hi>Peirson</hi> said, so far as I discern, I doubt
not of the truth of what Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> hath delivered,
and for that which he hath now uttered, though some
things the <hi>Indian</hi> hath added more then he spake in
private, and some things left out, and some things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
placed, yet for the substance of his present
Confession, it is the same with that which he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in private, where we did carefully try all things,
that we might be sure that we understood him right.
Then Bro. <hi>Fouldyer</hi> was desired to speak; who saith,
That he did not expect to have understood so much of
his speech, and so plainly as he did, and his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did perfectly understand all; and to his best un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that which Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> had delivered, was
the very same which he spake.</p>
                     <p>I said unto the Assembly, In that he spake so plain
to his understanding, it is because I had advised him,
and so all the rest, to express themselves in the most
plain and familiar words and expressions they could,
for my more easie and perfect understanding. Again,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31272:28"/>
for that my Bro. <hi>Peirson</hi> observed, that they left out
something, and added other, and varied in sundry
expressions: It is true, I observed the same, and it
may well be so, for they have not any writing, or like
helps, only their memory, and the help of Gods
Spirit, to read in their own hearts, what they utter.</p>
                     <p>Then the two Sons of <hi>Thom. Stanton</hi> were called,
to testifie the Schollar spoke first, and said, that he
did understand perfectly all that the <hi>Indian</hi> said, and
he did not observe any difference in what Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> had
delivered, but it was the same which the <hi>Indian</hi>
spake.</p>
                     <p>The other spake, and said, he did not perfectly
understand all that the <hi>Indian</hi> said, but so far as he did
understand, Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> had delivered the truth.</p>
                     <p>My Son was called to speak, who said, I did, for

                  <p>I Confess my sins before the Lord, and all these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and godly men, for ye throughly know that we
are great sinners, not only before God, but before
man also.</p>
                  <p>I confess that in my Mothers Womb I was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31272:28"/>
in sin, and that I was born in iniquity; my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother were sinners, and lived in fin, they
prayed to many Gods, the Sun, Heavens, Beasts,
Trees, and every thing in the world, they made
them their Gods, and throughly we followed these
sins: When I was born, I was in the Image of Satan,
I knew not that God made all this world, I was only
wise to sin, and I did all those things which I liked to
do, even all lusts, from my youth up; and now I
confess my sins before God, and all men, for God
and men do know them: I did all my delights. When
I was a youth the English came, but I regarded them
not: Afterward I heard that the <hi>Indians</hi> prayed, but
my heart-said, I will not pray so long as I live, for
they be vain words to pray unto God, my Parents
taught me to pray unto many Gods: Sometime I came
to English Towns on the Sabbath day, and I played,
for I did not regard that sin; I thought it vain to keep
one day, yet I feared that the English should see me
play, least they should be angry, but not because I
offended God. Afterwards I heard that my Brothers
prayed, and therefore I disliked them, and I thought
I will forsake my Brothers, because they do a vain
work, and I did run away into the Country, but they
soon found me, and asked me to pray, and they pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
me, and loved me, and therefore I returned, not
because I loved God, but because I loved my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
My brother said, Go dwell with the English,
and learn their manners; I yeilded, because I loved
my brother: I dwelt here at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> and came to
this meeting house, but in vain, I prayed not one word,
and my heart did misbelieve; I heard the Minister
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31272:29"/>
preach that there is one God, and he made the World,
and all things in it, but my heart thought it was a vain
word; I thought my Father made me, and not God.
Again, I returned from this Town, but yet I did not
pray; I heard the Commandements, <hi>Thou shalt not
murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not
steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
Thou shalt not covet, &amp;c.</hi> and other sins and
punishments I heard of, and I feared to sin because of
man, and because of punishment, but not for fear of
God; therefore vain were all my wayes. When I
came back to <hi>Noonantam,</hi> I did the same sins again, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
I loved lust; yea, after my praying and being
among them, I loved it more then before: When the
Minister came and taught, I went to the meeting, but
in vain; I learned nothing, but I still loved all our sins
and lusts: Afterward hearing the Catechism, <hi>Who made
you?</hi> God. <hi>Who redeemed you?</hi> Jesus Christ, &amp;c.
my heart misbelieved, and said, I will not believe, I
will go away into the Country. Again, I heard that
God made all the world, and then a little I believed,
and thought I will pray to God, but weak it was. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
I heard <hi>Mat. 7. Ask, and ye shall have, seek, and ye
shall find, knock, and it shall be opened to you:</hi> Then I
prayed a little, and then I thought there was a God
who made the whole world, I thought man could not
make the world, but only God; and therefore I did
pray unto him. Afterward my Brothers were sick,
and others also, I remembred that word, <hi>Ask, and ye
shall have;</hi> then I prayed, to try if that word was true,
but they dyed; then I thought that was a vain word,
and that God heareth not our prayers, and that God is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31272:29"/>
not; therefore I thought I will cast off praying, and
run away. I did not believe in God; my heart said,
I shall die, whether I pray, or not pray, all is one:
Then I heard that praying was the way to Everlasting
Life, but yet I regarded not praying, I thought of
running away, and yet I thought, whether I go or stay
I shall die, and therefore I was troubled, but I did
not pray: Afterward I was at work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my head was
broken in the Saw-pit, and then I knew God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with me, because I prayed not; and then I did
much know my sins, I thought surely God is angry;
I remembred that I had heard that Word preached,
<hi>Watch, for ye know not the hour that the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
this I remembred when my head was broken, I
heard that God made all the world, and <hi>Adam,</hi> and
set <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, and bid him eat of all the Trees,
saving of the Tree in the midst of the Garden, if he
eat thereof he should die; but <hi>Adam</hi> did eat thereof,
and died; then my heart believed, surely God is, and
he made the world, and man, and me. I heard <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.
God said, <hi>Let us make man in our own Image, and let
him have dominion over all the creatures:</hi> Then my
heart believed, sure God is good to man, and man is a
sinner against God; and therefore God is angry with
me for my sins. I heard that God formed man of the
dust of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of
Life; and then my heart said, surely God made the
world, and man, and me, and all things, and my
heart believed: And now I know God is angry with
me; now I will pray to God as long as I live, and no
more return to sin, but I will do Gods Word all my
daies. Again, I heard that God made <hi>Adam</hi> sleep,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31272:30"/>
and took out of him a rib, made it a woman, and
brought her to man; then I thought, sure God made
us, and the world, and these great works shew, that
there is a God. Again, I heard that God called her
the Mother of all living, and by that means we have
life, and then I believed that God made us; and
therefore I will pray to God as long as I live, and no
more cast it off. Again, I heard <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that <hi>God saw
the sin of man, that it was great, and that all the thoughts
and imaginations of his heart are only evil continually;
and therefore God was angry, and repented that he had
made man, and therefore drowned the world, and every
living creature; he caused it to rain fourty dayes on the
earth;</hi> then my heart said, sure there is a God, and he
will perform all his threatnings, he is God, and
therefore he will do it. Again, I heard that God found
<hi>Noah</hi> righteous, and he found favour in his sight; he
believed in God, and did obey his Word, and God
saved him: Then my heart desired to believe that God
is, and to pray unto him. Again, I heard <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
that the Angels of God came to <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
just <hi>Lot,</hi> but did burn up with the wicked <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
with fire from heaven, who had cast off praying
to God, and did commit great sins against God;
therefore I saw that I had deserved to be burnt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I had done their sins: And when God sent his
Angels, and did deliver just <hi>Lot,</hi> and then the rest
were burnt, then I saw in my heart, sure God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to them that love him; and therefore my heart
said, I will no more return to sin, but I will follow
God; but yet, sometimes I doubted, but I believed
the mercy of God, according to that I heard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31272:30"/>
                     <hi>she called his Name</hi> Jesus, <hi>for he saveth his people from
their sins:</hi> Then my heart thought, surely it is true,
that Christ is the Son of God, and was made man, and
is merciful; but yet I still did doubt whether Christ
was the Son of God. Again, I heard <hi>Mat. 3. Repent,
for the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And again,
<hi>The voice of one crying in the Wilderness, prepare ye the
way of the Lord, and make his paths straight:</hi> My heart
said, I desire to repent, and to make ready my heart
for God, that I may have mercy and pardon in Christ
Jesus. Again, the word saith, <hi>The Tree that brings not
forth good fruit, is cut down, and cast into the fire:</hi> My
heart said; sure so is my heart, and I have deserved to
be cast into the fire; I have brought forth such fruits
as may justly cut me down. Again, I heard the word
of Christ, <hi>He that heareth the Word, and doeth it, shall
be blessed:</hi> Then my heart said, I have deserved not to
be pardoned, but I beg for mercy. Again, the word
saith, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:</hi>
My heart said, sure God is merciful to send his own
Son, and Christ is merciful that he came and died for
us. Again, I heard that the Tempter came to Christ,
and said, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, make these stones
bread:</hi> But Christ said, <hi>man liveth not by bread only,
but by every word which cometh out of the mouth of God:</hi>
Then I believed that Christ was the Son of God, and
that my Soul liveth not by bread, but by the Word of
God. Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. the Leper came to Christ, and
said, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me whole, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
touched him, and he was healed:</hi> Then my heart said,
surely Christ is the Son of God, and he only can heal
my sins. Again, I heard in <hi>Mat. 6. If ye forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31272:31"/>
God forgiveth you:</hi> Then my heart said, I desire
to do this, else God will be angry with me. Again, I
heard <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. all diseased came to Christ, the blind,
halt, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and he healed them; therefore I believed
that he was the Son of God, and I begged of Christ to
pardon my sins, and save me, because sure he is Christ
the Son of God. Again, the word saies, <hi>Not every one
that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdome, but he
that doth the will of my Father:</hi> Then my heart said, I
do fear, because I do very weakly obey the Word of
God; and therefore Christ saith, <hi>Depart ye workers of
iniquity:</hi> My heart said, such an one am I but now I
cry to, and trust to Christ, to pardon all my sins. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I heard <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. that Christ said <hi>Capernaum</hi> was
lifted up to heaven by the Gospel, but should be cast
down to hell, for refusing it: I thought I did now pray,
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I now fall off I shall perish. And again, Christ saith,
<hi>It shall be easier for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>in that day:</hi> Then
my heart said, I have deserved the worst of Gods
wrath, for I believed not the great works of God; and
therefore I desire pardon of all my sins, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all my sins, and to pray to Christ as long as I live.
Again, I heard <hi>Mat. 5. That Heaven and Earth shall pass
away, but not one jot or tittle of the Word of God, but all
shall be fulfilled:</hi> Therefore my heart did desire, that
I may both hear and do the Word of God, which
will never perish. Again, I heard <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 Christ
saith, <hi>Who say ye that I am?</hi> Peter said, <hi>Thou art Christ,
the Son of the living God;</hi> Christ said, <hi>Blessed art thou</hi>
Peter, <hi>flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my
Father, and on this Rock I will build my Church, and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> Therefore my
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31272:31"/>
heart believed that God helped me to receive Christ,
and I desire to take that promise to <hi>Peter,</hi> and my heart
joyed more and more in Christ, and in the Word of
God. Again, I heard <hi>Mat. 26. Iesus took bread, and
blessed it, and brake it, and gave it, and said, Take eat,
this is my body which is broken for you, and likewise the
Cup,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>saying, This is my blood in the New Testament,
which was shed for remission of sins, &amp;c.</hi> My heart said,
sure Christ is full of love, and hath given us great
mercy, and I desire to partake of it. Again, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
did kill Christ, but he rose again, and ascended to
heaven; then my heart believed Christ. Again, I
heard <hi>Iohn 14. No man cometh to the Father, but by me:</hi>
My heart said, so be it Lord; I desire to come to God
by Christ; and I said, Why did the wicked kill Christ?
My heart said. I believe that Christ died for my sin;
and therefore I desire to believe in Christ: Then my
heart did joy in Christ, and to heartle Word of God;
but yet to this day I have doubts in my heart, my heart
is weak to this day: And now I know that in six daies
God made the world, and before that God I desire to
confess my sins, and forsake them, and no more to do
them. Sometimes my heart is in an ill frame, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
sin, and my heart hateth good; therefore I desire
the free Mercy of Christ to hold and keep my Soul.</p>

                  <p>I Confess my sinnes before the Lord, and his people
this day. While my Father lived, and I was young,
I was at play, and my Father rebuked me, and said, we
shall all die shortly. [In private we asked him what
ground or reason moved his Father so to speak? he
answered, it was when the English were new come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and he thinketh that his Father had heard that
Mr <hi>Wilson</hi> had spoken of the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> how God
drowned all the world for the sinnes of the people.]
Then I was troubled, and thought sure what God
saith, shall be, and not what man saith; but I quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgot this, and thought not of any good. That
same Winter the pox came; all my kindred died, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31272:32"/>
my Mother and I lived, we came to <hi>Cohannit,</hi> by
<hi>Dorchester,</hi> where I lived till I was a man, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
All those daies I sinned, and prayed to all gods,
and did as others did, there I lived till the Minister
came to teach us. When I heard that they prayed,
my heart desired it not. Sometime I prayed among
them, and sometime I neglected it. I feared to pray
because of the <hi>Sachems,</hi> therefore I put it off, for the
fear of man. Afterward I considered in my heart, to
pray to God, not because I loved the word, but for
other reasons. I heard that Word, Mal. 1. <hi>From the
rising of the Sun to the going down thereof, my name shall
be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering, for my
name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of
hosts.</hi> Then I was troubled in my thoughts about
running away, yet then I thought if I should go to
another place, they must pray also, and therefore I
cannot flie from praying to God, therefore I tarried,
and when others prayed, I prayed with them, only I
still feared man; after I heard the same word again,
to perswade us to pray to God; and I did so,
but not for Gods sake, only it was before man. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
the Sabbath, and I heard Mr <hi>Mathews</hi> also
preach of it, and therefore I thought I would keep the
Sabbath, but still I feared man. Upon a Sabbath, they
wished me to teach what I remembred, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
had taught. I did so, and we had talk about what
I said, and we fell out. Thereupon I went away, and
left praying to God. I went into the Countrey, but I
remembred my wife and children, and quickly
returned, but not for Gods sake. Again the Minister
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31272:33"/>
preached on 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. And thou Solomon my son
know the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
heart, and with a willing mind, for the Lord search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all hearts, and understandeth all the imagination of the
thoughts; if thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but
if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</hi> This
greatly troubled me, because I had left praying to
God, and I had deserved eternall wrath. Then I desired
to pray, I begged mercy, but I knew not what to do, for
my sins were many, my heart was full of originall sin,
and my heart was often full of anger; but then I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at my self, for I found my heart quickly carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sin. Afterward, through the free mercy of God, I
heard that word, <hi>He that penitently believeth in Christ
shall be pardoned and saved;</hi> then my heart did beg ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
for pardon and mercy. I heard <hi>Ioh. 15. Whatever
ye ask the Father in my name, he will give it you;</hi> therefore
my heart did now greatly beg for mercy in Christ
and pardon. Afterward I heard <hi>Mat. 5. 28. Who ever
looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
in his heart.</hi> Then my heart was troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many were my sins, in my eies, and heart, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
too. My heart did love the having of two wives,
and other lusts of that kind: Then Satan said to me,
You are a great sinner, and God will not pardon you,
therefore cast off praying, and run away, it is a vain
thing for you to pray. Here you want land, but in the
Countrey there is land enough, and riches abundance,
therefore pray no more. My heart did almost like it,
but I heard that word, <hi>Mat 4. Satan tempted Christ, and
shewed him the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and promised to give them to him, if he would worship
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31272:33"/>
him.</hi> Then my heart said, that even thus Satan tempteth
me to cast off praying to God; and therefore my heart
desired to believe that word of Christ, <hi>Thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> Then
I prayed again, but still I was full of sin, and very
weak I was, and I loved sin. Again I heard, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.
<hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Father but by me.</hi> Then I fully saw that Christ
only is our Redeemer, and Saviour, and I desire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ; and my heart said, that nothing that I
can do can save me, only Christ: therefore I beg for
Christ, and a part in him. Then said my heart, I give
my heart and my self to Christ, and my wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
let him do with us what he will. Then my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and two children died, and my heart said, What
Christ will do, so be it; I have given them to him, and
I begged pardon and mercy, if God will please to
pardon me a poor sinner, blessed be his name.</p>

                  <head>John Speen</head>
                  <head type="sub">Hee was next called forth, and thus spake.</head>
                  <p>I Confess my sins this day before the Lord, and not
only before God, but before all these people. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I prayed, verily I was a great sinner, yea, in my
mothers womb I was a sinner: my sins are such as not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31272:34"/>
only God knows, but people also know them. Before
our praying, I did thorowly sin, and did commit all
sins; and now I confess these my sins before God.
After I prayed, I did alos live in sin. At first when I
prayed, I did not worship God, nor believe in Christ;
but I did therefore pray, because my brothers, and
friends, and <hi>Waban,</hi> and the rest did pray, for their
sakes I prayed. And again I therefore prayed, because
many <hi>English</hi> knew me, that I might please them; and
because I saw the <hi>English</hi> took much ground, and I
thought if I prayed, the <hi>English</hi> would not take away
my ground, for these causes I prayed. When I prayed,
it was but with my mouth, yet I thought I do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in that I pray thus, and I thought, that for it
God will pardon all my sins; and I thought that my
praying was good enough. But yet again I sinned, and
did the like sins as before, only I did outwardly pray,
but I mourned not for my sins. I thought, if we pray
and leave Pauwauing, who shall make us well when
we are sick. But again, I thought man could not
make us well, because he must die himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Pauwauing is a vain thing, and they die though
they Pauwau. But still my heart did not believe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God: then I heard that word, <hi>Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and if we repent and believe, God will pardon all
our sins.</hi> Then sometimes I repented, yet again quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I committed sin; and sometimes I thought I am
throughly a sinner. I heard that God made the world,
and all things in it, and lastly man, and that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him of the dust of the earth, and breathed into
him the breath of life, and he became a living soul,
and that God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> that he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31272:34"/>
should eat of all the Trees of the Garden, save one in
the midst of the Garden, and if he eat of that Tree, he
should die. Then I understood that <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, &amp; fell,
and thereby I uneerstood that I became a sinner, born
in sin, my heart full of sin, and God will not pardon
sinners; and yet again I sinned, and therefore I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that God will not pardon me, because more and
more I sinned: and thus I sinned after praying, as well
as before praying. When they chose Rulers, and
chose my brother, and not me, my heart was in an evil
frame, and then I thought sure I am a great sinner, and
yet still I was more and more a sinner. After my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
loved me still, and then I repented of my sins,
but not for Gods sake, but for my brothers sake; then
I desired to pray as long as I live. My brother died,
which troubled me; the people said, Be you in your
brothers place: then my heart thought, I will no more
do as I had done, but sure I was weak, my praying was
but words, I was a great sinner. After this, a while
since I heard that word, Mat. 12. <hi>The unclean spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cast out of a man, he walketh about seeking rest and
findeth none; then hee returneth and bringeth 7 other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
with him worse then himself, and the end of that man
is worse then his beginning.</hi> When I heard this, my
heart feared. I thought now I repent of my many
sins, for verily I am a great sinner, &amp; I have offended, I
am 7 times worse then before I prayed; then I repented.</p>
                  <p>Again I heard that Word, <hi>He that penitently believeth
shall be saved,</hi> and then my heart did desire to repent
and believe, then I thought that men will not forgive
me, and therefore it is not good to abide in this place,
but I remembred that I had learned to read the Word,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31272:35"/>
and if I should forsake my friends, I should lose the
Word of God. Then I heard that Word, <hi>Repent, for
the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand,</hi> my heart said ô let
it be so, and then my heart rested; but yet quickly it
was unquiet again. Then I did strongly desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of my sinnes. I heard that Word, that <hi>God Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
good seed, but evill seed was sowen by the Enemy,</hi> and
such were in my heart, and as in my field there were
many roots, and weeds which spoyled the corne, and
I plucked them up, and cast them out; my heart said,
verily just so is my heart, the Word is but a little in
my heart, and there be many ill roots in me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God may justly cast me out from among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
because of my many sinnes. Then my heart said,
I desire to pray to God as long as I live, and now I
forsake my sins, who have been a great sinner. Now
I beg of Christ, O give me thy spirit, that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my sins before God, and not only before men; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
I remember that I cannot pardon or help my self,
but only Christ must help me. Again I heard that
Word, <hi>All manner of sin shall be forgiven to a man, but
the sin against the Holy Ghost, shall not be forgiven in this
world, nor in the world to come.</hi> Then my heart feared,
because many and great were my sins since I prayed to
God, and I cried to God for mercy and pardon: and
then I thought I will pray to God as long as I live. But
verily I am a sinner, for I am guilty not only of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
sin, but of my own sins also, and they are many.
I remember that in Catechisme I learn, that God
made a Covenant of works with <hi>Adam, Do the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and thou shalt live, and thy seed also; but if thou
sin, thou shalt die, and thy seed also;</hi> therefore by that I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31272:35"/>
know I am a sinner, and have deserved to die. Then
I crie to God, O God have mercy upon me, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me. Again, I heard of the mercy of God, but I
am forgetfull, and cannot remember Gods mercies to
me. God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and said,
<hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee,</hi> then
my heart said, O let it be so to me O Lord. And now
<hi>Abraham</hi> is in heaven, who believed, and kept Gods
Covenant; So I, if I believe and keep Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
God will have mercy on me. I remembred the
Covenant of Circumcision to him, and all his family;
and such a Covenant I desire for me and mine. Again
I heard, Mat. 3. In those daies <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized in <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi>
saying, <hi>Repent for the Kingdome of God is at hand.</hi>
When I heard this my heart said, the same is now with
us, not <hi>Abrahams</hi> signe but baptisme, and therefore
I desire to repent, and Confess before God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church: and I desire not only to confess, but
to have repentance, and faith, that I may have grace,
mercy, and pardon: and such repentance as workes
obedience. Again, the same Word saith, vers. 6.
<hi>They were baptized confessing their sins;</hi> So I desire to
do. I do confess before God, and desire to cast off,
and forsake my sins, and to go to Christ. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of pardon is to them that penitently believe, and
rest on Christ. In the same Baptism of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he said,
<hi>I baptize you with water, but he that cometh after me, is
mightier then I, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
fire.</hi> Now this Baptism I desire, and not to receive
the signe in vain: I desire to purge out evill thoughts,
and therefore I confess these sins before God, that
they may be purged, and I desire the spirit of God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31272:36"/>
may dwell in me for ever, to turn me to Christ. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
of my self do any of these things, but only
Christ Jesus can by his spirit in me.</p>
                  <p>Again I heard another word, <hi>As the Eagles are about
a carkass, so believers come to Christ:</hi> then my heart
said, So be it Oh Lord; when I receive the Covenant
of God, I am like the Eagles; when I come to Christ,
I desire not to come in vain; but if I feed not, I shall
die, my soul will die. Then I greatly begged that I
might feed my soul on Christ; and Oh Christ send
thy spirit into my heart, that I may not only know, but
do the Word of God. Again, <hi>Christ, near his death,
took bread, and blest it, and broke it, and gave it to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and said, Take yee, eat yee, this is my Body which
was broken for you:</hi> And so also he did the Cup, <hi>and
said, Drink yee of it, this is the Cup of my blood in the
New Testament which is shed for the remission of sins.</hi>
Now this believers in Christ must do, not only to eat
Bread, and to take the Sign, but soul food: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ sending his spirit, and helping me, I desire
to receive the Sign, not in vain, but to help my faith.</p>

                  <p>HElp me Oh Jesus Christ, to confess before the
Lord; Oh I am full of sin, because <hi>Adams</hi>
sin made mine, and so was a sinner in my mothers
womb. When I was a youth I found many sins, and
after I was grown up, I did the same alwaies, all the
daies of my life I lived in sin. After the English
came, I went to their houses; they would teach me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
God, but I hated it, and went out, I did not love
such teaching. Afterward the Minister taught, and at
first <hi>Waban</hi> perswaded me to pray, and taught us; I did
not at first like it, yet afterward I did. Four years the
Minister came to <hi>Noonantam;</hi> I came, but I only came,
I lost all he taught. After I considered one word; the
Minister said, That God sent him to teach us; then I
thought surely there is a God, therefore I must believe
and pray: a little I believed, but when I heard, I did
only outwardly hear. After, my wife and children
died, and then I almost cast off praying. I had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wife, and she died also; and then my heart said,
Surely God is angry with me, who doth thus afflict
me. Then I heard that word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. God made a
Feast, and invited his Guests, and they would not
come, and therefore God was angry with them: So
did I; for I came not to the Word of God, when he
called me, I cared not for the Feast of Christ. Again,
after many of my friends were destroyed, I thought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31272:37"/>
it was because they prayed not to God, therefore I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that God is angry with me also, because of his
punishments. I fear, I believe not Christ; and my
heart feareth, because of my sins; daily I break Gods
Commands. Another Word I heard, Mat. 5. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for
they shall be satisfied;</hi> this is the Word of Christ, and
I desire to hunger for Christ, and begged O Christ
help me. Again, I remembred that Word, <hi>Blessed
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God;</hi> my heart
saith, O Christ help me to be so, that cleane may be
my heart. Again, I heard that Word, <hi>Blessed are the
peace-makers, for they shall be called the Children of God;</hi>
then my heart thought, O that I had peace with God
in Christ, that I might have that blessing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I now confess my sins before God, and I beg
mercy from God in Jesus Christ. When I had read this
short confession, (for the day spent, and brevity was
called for) we called upon the witnesses who spake
as formerly.</p>

                  <head type="sub">He was next called, who thus spake.</head>
                  <p>I Have heard the word, and prayed to God several
yeares. And I confess that before I prayed, I was
full of sin, and yet I do not know my sins. I thought
they were all good waies, and therefore I did them. I
knew not the Sabbath, nor Lecture daies, nor any good,
only I knew wild Actions, daily I desired falshood,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31272:37"/>
vile actions, singing <hi>Indian</hi> songs, these things I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to do: but all good things I was ignorant of, and
very much I sinned, daily. Then I heard of praying
to God. I came to <hi>Cohannit</hi> at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> from <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muk</hi>
where I lived, but my heart laughed at praying,
and said its a vain action, only those actions that I was
bred up in, I liked and esteemed, but these new things
I derided. The <hi>Sachims</hi> disliked it, and therefore so
did I. The rich men disliked it, and therefore so did I.
I believed not, that God is; I went to <hi>Cohannit,</hi> not
for praying, but to gather clams: When I came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they exhorted me to pray: and said, The Minister
cometh to morrow to teach, it is lecture day. I desired
to see him: he came, they met together. I went, and
carried my son <hi>Samuel:</hi> I saw the Minister, he called
my son; asked him, <hi>Who made you;</hi> they bid him say
<hi>God;</hi> but I had not so taught him. He asked, whose
son he was, they said mine: he said, <hi>do you pray to God?</hi>
I said no, for I am a poore man, and naked: they that
pray are cloathed. Therefore I will not pray, can
poore men pray? Therefore I would not pray: I went
home. Then <hi>Waban</hi> and <hi>Totherswamp</hi> came to my house,
and taught me to pray. They intreated me, now pray
<hi>to God;</hi> My heart liked it not. They said, <hi>God is a
great God, and made all the World.</hi> I said, who is witness
of that? They said, the Minister will answer you. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>they taught me the Commandments of God;</hi> but I
did not believe. <hi>Totherswamp</hi> promised to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he did so; and said, <hi>now pray to God,</hi> because <hi>God
is good.</hi> I thought it a teadious thing to pray to God.
Then he strongly intreated me: I said I will try; but
not for praying, but in vain. Then my kindred said,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31272:38"/>
praying is a vain thing, why will you pray? therefore
returne again: then I went, and prayed. When I first
came, <hi>Waban</hi> taught that Word. <hi>The night is farre
spent, the day is as hand, therefore let us cast off the works
of darkness, and let us put on the Armour of light.</hi> My
heart asked what are dark workes? They answered,
<hi>sianes;</hi> and what is day? they answered, <hi>praying to God,</hi>
and the wisdome of the Word <hi>is light:</hi> And this is now
almost come unto us. Then my heart smile, I will
pray to God. Again, I heard the Minister who said,
these words, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me; thou
shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image, nor the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any thing in Heaven above, in the earth below, in
the waters under the earth: thou shalt not bow down to
them, nor worship them;</hi> Then my heart said, that I did
worship many false gods, therefore if I pray, it may
be God will kill me: but they said no, he is a good
God; then I prayed, and then my kindred hindred me.
Therefore my heart said, If my kindred pray, then I
will pray. Then I was taught more, and I did heare
the Word, that <hi>God made Adam of the dust, and made
him sleep, and took out a rib, and made a woman,</hi> and
thus God made man. My heart said, It may be God
made English men, but not us poore naked men, as
we are of a strange language; and therefore I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pray. Then I heard of <hi>Nimrod</hi> his building of
<hi>Babel,</hi> and that God was angry, made strange to each
other their language, and brake their work: Then my
heart said, Surely so it is, as I did believe. Again I
heard, that <hi>God found one man just, Noah, and saved him
in his Ark, and did drown the world:</hi> then my heart said,
I desire that God may find many just persons with us,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31272:38"/>
therefore I pray to God: then I more prayed. Again
I heard, <hi>that God made a Covenant with Abraham and
his seed, to be their God.</hi> My heart said, so let it be: I
desire to be in this Covenant of God, and to pray so
long as I live. I thought, if I do well, God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
all my sinnes: the Minister said no; If you do all
good, as perfectly, yet God will not pardon: God
will pardon, only <hi>for Iesus Christ his sake.</hi> Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<hi>Iesus Christ was both God and man, and made peace
betwixt God and man: Christ</hi> did for us <hi>all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, and died for us, he payed death for us;</hi>
and therefore for his sake God will pardon us,
if we believe in Christ. I heard that which Mat. 7.
<hi>Ask and ye shall have, seek and ye shall find, knock, and
it shall be opened, &amp;c.</hi> Then my heart said, I will pray
as long as I live, and knock at heaven dore. Again I
heard that word, <hi>Enter in at the streight gate, &amp;c.</hi> My
heart said, Sure it is so, <hi>narrow and hard is the way to
Heaven, broad and easy is the way to hell;</hi> I desire to
walk in the narrow way to heaven. Again, <hi>Christ
died for us,</hi> and thereby saveth us; and saith, <hi>Come to
me all that are weary, and I will give you rest.</hi> Then my
heart said, Great is my weariness, for many are my
sinnes, and I desire rest in Christ. I heard that Christ
only is our redeemer and Saviour, my heart did much
joy in it; and I desired to pray and heare the Word
as long as I live. Another Word of Christ I heard,
<hi>Whoever forsaketh father or mother, or brother or lands
for my sake, &amp;c.</hi> My heart said, ô Lord let it be so, I
have for Christ his sake left all, and come to pray.
And I desire now to confess before the Church of
<hi>Roxbury,</hi> and do submit to your government, and
Gods Ordinances among you. He was going on, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31272:39"/>
shortness of time made me take him off. When I had
read this confession, and the witnesses had spoke as
before, some of the Elders present, did move that
seeing there be two more to speak, and the time streight;
and seeing Mr <hi>Peirson</hi> had in private taken in writing
their confessions, which they perceived by his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
to be for substance the same which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in publick; What if the Assembly should
heare Mr <hi>Peirson</hi> read those two remaining confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
according as he had taken them? The motion was
acceptable to the Assembly, and he did read them,
which are as followeth.</p>

                  <p>First, THis I say in the presence of God, and in
your presence, Verily I knew not how or
what to confess or God, before I prayed. I knew not
who gave me life and being, but I thought my life was
of my self. I confess I was born in sin, my Parents
were sinners, and I thought I had life from none but
my Parents, therefore my sins were very great: from
the first time that I saw light, untill this day, I do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but sin; hard is my heart, proud is my heart,
and hypocriticall: I do hypocriticall acts, to this day.
I act foolishly, and deceitfully; therefore so many are
my sinnes, that I am not able to express them; only
this I say, that I am naught. Then I heard that <hi>Waban</hi>
prayed, and they said to me, pray to God: but I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, for I had a wife, and many children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31272:39"/>
I cared not for praying. I thought if they were
any of them sick, the <hi>Pauwaus</hi> could make them well,
therefore I believed not <hi>Waban,</hi> when he exhorted me
to pray to God. Then my wife and children died:
then my afflicted poore heart came in, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
came to me and said, pray to God, because <hi>God
afflicteth and tryeth you;</hi> my heart said, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
spake to me, let it be as you say, that God may
shew me that mercy: then my heart said, I will pray to
God, from henceforth, as long as I live. Then I
heard the Minister Preach of the great works of God,
<hi>in making Heaven and Earth,</hi> and therefore fear the
great punishments of God; and because my heart so
feared, and condemned me, therefore I did believe
that God is, who had punished me, and took away my
children. Again, I heard from Mat. 5. <hi>Christ</hi> saith,
<hi>Blessed are the poore in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdome
of God: and blessed are the mercifull, for they shall find
mercy;</hi> my heart said, I am a poore man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will pray to God so long as I live: and I desire
to find mercy with God. Again, now my heart saith,
I am weak and doubting, and full of misbelief. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I heard that Word of Christ, which saith, <hi>Come
unto me all yee that are weary and heavy laden, and yee
shall find rest;</hi> my heart said, be it so O Lord: and now
I will pray to God, as long as I live; my heart said,
surely I am greatly laden with many, and great sins:
and therefore I will go to Christ, and pray unto him,
as long as I live. Again, Christ saith, <hi>Take up my hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and learne of me, for I am humble and meeke;</hi> then
my heart said, surely I am a great sinner, and therefore
I desire to learne of Christ, and to follow him. Again
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31272:40"/>
Christ faith, <hi>Yee shall find rest to your soul;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my soul desired to pray as long as I live, that I
may find rest to my soul in Christ. Again, my heart
did gladly hear the Word of Christ, and the great
redemption of Christ. Again, I learned in a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
that Christ sendeth his Spirit into my heart, to
break it, to make it repent, to convert me, to cause
me to believe: my heart said, therefore I desire to pray
to God, and to believe for pardon, and adoption, and
peace with God. Then hearing of the mercy of
Christ, my heart said, I am like a dead man, and
therefore I desire to be with Christ as long as I live:
my heart did not know how to Convert, and turn to
God, therefore my heart did gladly pray to God for
it; my heart did desire to pray, because I heard,
Christ is our redeemer, and doth deliver our soules.
I cannot deliver my selfe, therefore I desire that
Christ may be my deliverer: therefore I betrust my
soul with Christ as long as I live; and because Christ
is my mercifull God, therefore let him do with my
soul what he will.</p>

                     <p>When Mr Peirson had read this Confession,
he was desired to go on, and read the last,
which was Wabans Confession, and is as

                  <p>First, I Confess, that before I prayed, it was hard
to love another fashion then my old course:
my Parents were sinners, and in my Mothers belly I
was in sin: after I was born, the same way of sin I
followed. When I was a child I grew up in sin, and
I did not know that they were sins, but now of late I
know them; in my youth also, in the same sins I lived,
and did not know them to be so, but by the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my waies, I do remember my sins, and
hereby I am made to understand, that my Parents
taught me to love sin. And after they were dead, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taught me to sin: I liked to be taught to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sin; those that taught me, said to me, Choose to be
a Pauwau: they said, If you be a Pauwau, you may
make others to live; and if you he a Pauwau, God
will blesse you, and make you rich, and a man like
God. Then I desired so to do: also I alwaies desited
other sins, for my heart did desire to grow up in those
sins, alwaies lust I desired, alwaies my heart labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and desired to know how to adde to, and to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
my sins. Thus it came to pass that I knew abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31272:41"/>
of sins, before I knew my waies were sin. When
the English came hither, they said, when I came to the
Englist houses, that I loved the Devil: then I was very
angry, and my words were, You know the Devil: I do
not know the Devil, and presently I would go out of
the house: Sometime they spake meekly to me, and
would say, God is in heaven, and he is a good God: yet
I regarded not these words, but strongly I loved my
sins: it was hard for me to believe what the English said:
after many yeares, I sometime believed a word, but
I left not my sin. When I began to understand more,
I began to doubt, but I desired not Conversion from
sin. Afterward, when the English taught me, I
would sit still, because they would give me good vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals;
then I sometimes thought, certainly God is
in heaven: then my thoughts said, It may be I have
sinned.</p>
                  <p>Again I thought, if I prayed, God could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
mee; then I found it hard to believe, and love
God, because I was almost an old man, because I
thought, if any could read the book, he would love
God. I asked Mr <hi>Iackson,</hi> Whether God knew our
language? Hee answered, Yea: God knoweth all
languages in the world, and therefore now pray unto
God; then I first thought, I will pray unto God; a
little I thought of praying; sometimes I would a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pray when I eat; about that time you came to
teach us; then I remembred the Word, <hi>Glad tidings
was sent us from Heaven;</hi> then my heart said, Now
I will pray, because the Minister is come to my
house, now I heard the Word of God. Then you
called the Children to Catechism: and one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31272:41"/>
is, <hi>Who redeemed you?</hi> then you taught, that
<hi>Christ died for our sinnes.</hi> Then my heart thought,
that Christ is a very great life-giving God. Then I
feared not Pauwaus, nor loved them; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
taught, that we must take heed of all these sins.
Then my heart said, I will leave off my sins; and again
my heart said, I will pray to God as long as I live.
Further you taught, that <hi>Christ died for sin, was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
rose again, ascended:</hi> then my heart hoped and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
Oh that it might be so, that I might have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life by Christ, because Christ is a great life-giving
God. But then I found that I did not understand
right words, and therefore I walked not in the right
way: when the Word of God said, <hi>Six daies shalt thou
labour,</hi> then I was strong, yet I did not labour; and I
was soon weary of praying to God: and therefore I
saw, I found not the right way unto righteousness;
therefore now I verily see that I am a sinner, and did
not believe: my heart feared because of my great sins,
and my heart feareth that I do not yet much know the
Word of God. Sometime my heart saith I believe,
I am a believer: but my heart wandereth away, and
the deceits of my heart I sometime know, and my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
I know, but my heart careth not for that; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
riches, but my heart saith strongly, I will pray to
God so long as I live; I do not throughly know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of my mind. I have heard the Word but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it not. I remember that Word of Christ, the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> said, <hi>Why doth you Master eat with Publicans
and sinners:</hi> Christ said, <hi>Those that are not sick need not
the Physitian, but they that are sick.</hi> My heart said, sure
I do not need the Physitian: but my desire is now, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31272:42"/>
I may need him, and spirituall life by him. Again, I
heard that Word of Christ, <hi>A leper came to Christ,
and worshiped him, saying, Lord if thou wilt, thou canst
make me cleane: and Christ touched him, and he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
healed.</hi> Then my heart said, that outward heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which he had, my soul desireth, that I may have
it in my soul: for Christ healeth the outward diseases
of the body, but especially the inward filth of the soul;
this I desire may be healed. Again I heard that Word,
go learn what that meaneth, <hi>I desire mercy and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
Then my heart said, my own righteousness
cannot obtain mercy for me; then my heart said, Oh
I fear that Christ the truest righteousness is not in my
heart: I am almost ready to die; and now I desire to
know Christ.</p>

               <p>WHen Mr <hi>Peirson</hi> had done reading these two
last Confessions. Mr <hi>Wilson</hi> spake to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
though they have all spoken well of Jesus Christ,
in their Confessions, and especially the last viz: <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunkani<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
yet he desired further to heare how they
were instructed in the knowledge of Christ. This
question touching Christ, I called <hi>Piumbathou</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and his answer was to satisfaction: and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Catecheticall questions were propounded,
which would be too long to rehearse, as touching
Grace, Ordinances, Sacraments, Baptisme and the
Lords Supper: about Repentance and Faith, all which
they readily answered, &amp; so as that there was no reply.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> answered the question what Faith is, Mr
<hi>Allin</hi> asked him, whether he had that Faith in his heart,
which he now spake off; to which after a pause, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
to this purpose, that he feared himself about
it, and if he spake, he must say no! but he hoped in
the Lords mercy that he would work it in him, and
help him to believe.</p>
               <p>Then Mr <hi>Danforth</hi> said, I ask you <hi>Nishohkou</hi> this
question, and answer me in English whether the same
lusts which you have so much confessed, do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you still; and what you do to resist them? I said
that a question to the like purpose was asked him,
when he made Confession in private, to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in broken English, if the Assembly pleased I
would read that: but he was desired to answer now,
and his answer was to this purpose; that the Word of
God is all one like a sword: and he did with that, resist
his temptations. He was asked further, if he did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
watch against his sins: he answered, he did
not well know what a diligent watch is, but he hoped
that Jesus Christ would keep him.</p>
               <p>Then Mr <hi>Danforth</hi> called <hi>Anthony</hi> and asked him,
whether he believed that it was the duty of men to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
six daies in the week? After a pause, he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he believed it was Gods command, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
he did not obey it so much as he ought to do;
and saith Mr <hi>Danforth,</hi> that I would have asked you
next, whether you obey it, for you ought to do so;
and follow labour, and cloath your selfe and family
better, and you ought to give towards the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Gods Ordinances. After this I remember
no more questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:31272:43"/>
Then I declared to the Congregation, that they
having heard their Confessions; if they thought meet,
they might hear what testimonies we have to produce
touching their Conversation, but it went not forward,
and so we ceased the work, and Reverend Mr <hi>Wilson</hi>
concluded with prayer. After the publick meeting,
the messengers of the Churches met together, and
considered what answer to give to our Church: and
the vote among them all was, that as touching their
Confessions, which was the work of the day, they were
satisfactory, and they appeared in that respect, to be
fit matter for Church estate.</p>
