         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and so magnified of many, that they blush not wiih bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I come to the precise description
or definition of Vssurie, I must require
thee (gentle reader) to obserue two things
with mee. First, that it is one thing to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
speake of vsurie it selfe, an other thing
to speake of the sinne of it. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that these words are fitly and plainely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
in the Latine tongue;<note place="margin">A distinction very necessary to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> to wit, <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modatum, locatum,</hi>
and <hi>mutuum,</hi> which are confounded in our English tongue, and
taken onely for loane or the thing that is lent. When therfore
and so often as I shall speake of loane or the thing lent, my
meaning euer is to speake of that loane, or of that thing lent,
which is called in latine <hi>mutuum.</hi> which I heere admonish
once for all; to auoid confusion and tedious repetition, in this
my discourse following.</p>
               <p>The sinne of vsurie,<note place="margin">The definition of vsurie.</note> is the exacting, intending, or receiuing
of the vsurie, or of that gaine which is giuen for the loane.
Usurie it selfe is that gaine, which is exacted or principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the loane of our money, or of other things estimable
with money.</p>
               <p>I say first, (exacted,) because a thing giuen voluntarily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in the way of gratitude,<note place="margin">A deformed adiunct.</note> is not vsurie; neither doth it make the
receiuer to be an vsurer, if it haue not a deformed adiunct.</p>
               <p>I say secondly, (principally intended) because gaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
secondarily doth not make vsurie, nor him that desireth
it to be an vsurer; though the principal intention of it be inough
for mentall vsurie, as shall appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>I say thirdly, (of money, or things estimable with money)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
because vsurie may be aswell committed in other things as in
money, although many of the vulgar sort, and some also that
otherwise bee learned; seeme not so to conceiue the matter.
This definition of vsurie, may be euidently prooued out of the
holy Scriptures in the olde and newe Testament; as also
by the vniforme consent of the ancient Fathers, and by


<pb facs="tcp:13543:4"/>
the constitutions made in councels of best approoued antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Which thing shal be prooued copiously, in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>WHen I consider Gods holy will reuealed in his sacred
word, the manifold testimonies of the ancient fathers,
and the decrees of approoued Synods; I cannot but admire
the condition of many in these our daies; who are so farre from
condemning vsurie, that they doe not onely practise it, but
without blushing defend the same, as an honest and lawfull
thing. I will therefore by Gods holy assistance, so discouer the

For (the Prophet Ezechiel) placeth vsurie and all that

the Law doth expresly forbid the same. But the couetous man
seeing the poore man enforced with necessitie, fallen prostrate

continueth in deniall. Besides this he sweareth and protesteth
that hee hath no money at all, but that himselfe seeketh, where
to finde an vsurer; and so swearing falshood to be trueth, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
impudent periurie to naughtie and cruell merchandise:
yet so soone as the silly poore man maketh mention of vsurie,
and willingly offereth the ouerplus aboue the principall, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth

               <p>FOr the exact vnderstanding of this chapter wee must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first, how <hi>commodatum</hi> differeth from <hi>locatum: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modatum</hi>
is, when we lend a thing to a certaine day, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
any price or consideration for the loane.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We must obserue secondly, that <hi>locatum</hi> is, when we lend
a thing to a certain day, requiring a certain price or considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We must obserue thirdly, that as I saide in the beginning
of the first chapter these three wordes, <hi>commodatum, locatum,
&amp; mutuum,</hi> are confounded in our vulgar tongue, and that <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi>
is euen as <hi>locatum,</hi>

                  </note> when we lend a thing to a certaine
day, requiring a certaine price or consideration for the same.
But the difference is this, because in <hi>locato,</hi> we keepe still the
dominion and proprietie of the thing which wee lend; but in
<hi>mutuo,</hi> the dominion and proprietie of the thing lent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
from vs to him that borroweth the same. This obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
ought neuer to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> We must obserue fourthly, that of things some be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptible,
and some inconsumptible: inconsumptible things
are those, in which we can separate the vse from the dominion
and proprietie of the thing: consumptible things are those, in
which the dominion is transferred together with the vse.
Whereupon it commeth, that when wee lend thinges incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptible
with the vse;<note place="margin">Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptible and things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptible.</note> as our horses, our oxen, our kine, our
sheepe, and such like; we may take competently for the loane,
vse, or increase of the same; because after the loane of such
things, the dominion and propriety of the same, stil remaineth
in our selues. Contrariwise it falleth out, in things consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with the vse; because the dominion and proprietie of such
things which before was in our selues, passeth from vs to the
borrowers, <hi>ipso facto</hi> with the loane thereof. Such things are
mony, wine, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these things it is impossible to separate the vse from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the thing it selfe: and consequently, whensoeuer ye lend
me any such thing, <hi>ipso facto</hi> yee change the propertie of the
thing, and make me the owner and lord of the same.</p>

               <p>THere be two kinds of vsurie,<note place="margin">Vsurie mental and reall</note> to wit, mentall vsurie, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
reall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13543:9"/>
Mentall vsurie is, when one wisheth or expecteth ouerplus
for the loane, but doeth not exact the same by any externall
word or couenant. This kind is not subiect to restitution.</p>
               <p>Reall vsurie is of two sorts, to wit, manifest, and palliate:
manifest vsurie reall is, when surplussage is exacted for
the loane, by expresse words of couenant: and this kind is not
only a damnable sinne, but also bindeth to restitution.</p>
               <p>Palliate vsurie reall is, when more then the principall is
exacted for the loane, yet not by expresse and plaine termes,
but in a secret and bid kind of bargaining. This palliate vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is a very detestable sinne, and bindeth the receiuer to resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
although it be this day frequent (alas for pitie) in all
kind of bargaining.<note place="margin">Note this point well.</note> For, howe often soeuer the seller selleth
better cheape, because he receiueth the money before hand; or
dearer, because he forbeareth his money till a day; so often
doubtlesse is this palliate vsurie committed, and the ouerplus
indeede exacted for the loane of the money. Prouided euer,
vnlesse the day be to his hinderance.</p>
               <p>The example of the former, to wit, when things are solde

               <p>An honest poore neighbour being in great distresse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

shal haue present money to serue your neede? and because the
poore man must needs haue money in hand, such is his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
the rich man, (though he will not in precise termes exact
more money and manifest vsurie, because he would not be
reputed an vsurer) yet doth he enforce his poore neighbour,
on whome he ought by Gods lawes to haue compassion, to
sell his goods at vnder value, and that he doth indeede for the
very lone of his mony. For first the poore man might as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
haue giuen him more mony in the kind, as for to prouide him
come at his day and rated price.</p>
               <p>2 Secondlie, the poore manwould not haue beene bound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to prouide corne at his day and price to his great losse and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
if by any reasonable meane, he could haue prouided mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

3 Thirdly the ouerplus of the corne indeed,<note place="margin">Note that this corne is vsualy bought of them, that haue none to deliuer, which is too too abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</note> was onely er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted

the example of the former,<note place="margin">Lucrum cessans.</note> I haue in ready mony an hundred

found. For in your deliuerie of present money, increase is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
only and solely for the loane. But in the other deliuerie,
increase is required for assecuration sake: that is to say, the


<pb facs="tcp:13543:14"/>
partie that deliuereth money or gold at Paris, is in feare to
fall among theeues, and so to be dispoiled of all he hath: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof he commeth to a banker, who partly of charitie,
and partly to get an honest liuing, keepeth seruants at Milan,
Lions, and Genua, with a stocke of mony in euery place. To
this banker the traueller giueth a competent consideration,
that he may haue his ticket to receiue so much mony, when he
comes to such a place, or to his iourneis end. Which increase
this banker taketh not for the loane of his money (for hee may
rather be said to borrow then to lend) but for the safe deliuerie
of my mony at such a place, and for the charges he is at, by ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
seruants to that only end. Which thing is so farre from
being vsurie, that it is a very commendable and charitable act.
Yea in those countries where these bankes be allowed, al vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is vtterly condemned. And such as die knowen vsurers

haue lands in fee simple, out of which they graunt for so much
in hand, either a yeerely rent of so many crownes for euer, or
at least for terme of life. Which to do is a lawful contract, as
which is nothing else but to sell for an hundred crownes in

                  <p>I answer, that here I behold great charitie, but vsurie I
can find none. For nothing at all is taken for the loane of the
mony, but for the necessarie maintenance of the seruants, who
attend continually for the conuenient helpe of the borrowers.
To which consideration, if the borrowers shoulde not yeelde,

be hurt or miscaried any way, by the negligence or default of

                     </gap>ent to my present


<pb facs="tcp:13543:19"/>
theame, but necessarie also for many other respects) I thinke
it to the purpose, to lay downe some strong foundations in
that behalfe.<note place="margin">The first foundation.</note> First, this is a constant maxime, approued by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme
consent of all learned diuines; <hi>cessante fine legis cessat
lex ipsa;</hi> when the finall cause or ende for which the law was
made, ceaseth, then doth the law euen of necessitie also cease.
This foundation is grounded vpon the holie Scripture in the
15. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Whereby the flat decree and setled law of the
Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 15. v. 28. 19.</note> we are bound to abstaine from bloud and strangled
meates. This notwithstanding, no man hath this day anie
scruple of conscience to eate the same: and yet hereof no other
sound reason can be yeelded, saue onely that the end for which
that law was made, did long sithence cease. For euen at that
time there was no precise necessitie to abstain from bloud and
strangled meates.<note place="margin">Let this point be welmarked</note> But this law was only made in respect of
the state of that time, that the Gentiles and the Iewes might
liue more peaceably together, and thereby auoyde al occasion
of quarrelling. And therefore as soone as that end ceased, this
law also ceased with it; and so we this day are freed from the
same. Yea this maxime is euident <hi>lumine naturali,</hi> euen by
natural reason. For euerie law is made for some end; which
end how ofte soeuer it may be accomplished without the law,
so often the execution of the law is needelesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The second foundation.</note> we must hold this for a constant foundation, that
albeit the ciuil magistrate be commaunded to punish malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
yet is neither the kinde of the punishment, nor the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
thereof taxed by the law of God; but it still abideth indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
to be determined by the supreme ciuill magistrate. For
although there were speciall punishment prescribed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The vsuall punishment of malefactors may bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> for transgressors of the sabboth, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers,
for murderers and such like; yet neither by the lawe
moral, neither by the law of the new testament, to which laws
only we christians are this day bound, is any such punishment
determined. And therefore the ciuil magistrate (if it so seeme
good vnto him) may change the vsual punishment of theeues,
(which with vs is to be hanged) and cause them to be cast into
the bottome of the sea, with milstones about their necks. And
the same may be said, of the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for other malefactors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13543:19"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third foundation.</note> we must repute this for an vndoubted foundation,
that the end for which Gods lawe appointeth malefactors to
be punished, is the publike peace and good of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
For this is so euident by the course of the whole
scripture, as it can neither with learning nor reason be denied.</p>
                  <p>Out of these three foundations thus firmly stablished,<note place="margin">The first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollarie.</note> these
two corollaries may euidently be inferred. First, that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
any member of the common-weale committeth any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
crime, for which he ought to die by the lawe, whose life
notwithstanding is more profitable to the weale publike, than
his death, in such a case the prince may pardon such a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> thereby sinne at all. Which thing christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
seeme to respect, when in the time of warres they set such
felons at libertie as are able to doe seruice in defence of the
realm.<note place="margin">The second corollarie.</note> Secondly, that when any malefactor is so mightie or so
strongly seated, that the prince cannot without probable daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his royal persm, or great domage to the commonweale
punish the said malefactor; in such a case the prince may tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
such a malefactor vnpunished, and not thereby sin at all.
These foundations and these illations once well vnderstoode
and marked, this important controuersie can not but be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest:

tendeth to the common good of the publike weale. The
