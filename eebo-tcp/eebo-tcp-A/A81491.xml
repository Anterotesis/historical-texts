            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SO ſoon as I received this printed Pamphlet from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> (which came to me incloſed in a letter, dated <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> the 10. 1646.) from an eminent perſon of that place, who advertiſed me, that it was all that the Printer had publiſhed ſince his reſiding there,) I did forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to ſome members of the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to acquaint them with it, deſiring to know whether they had ever received any ſuch letter. And upon ſearch finding it to bee a meere forgery, I thought fit to publiſh this Antidote to preſerve the people from being poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by it.</p>
            <p>I have peruſed it: and muſt cenſure them very ſimple that will bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with ſuch a notorious fiction, invented by ſome prophane Atheiſt: for none elſe durſt dare ſo often to blaſpheme the Name of God to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſuch abominable lies. A ſtranger hee is indeed, but ſo unlike Doctor <hi>Deodate,</hi> that the good old man will be full of ſorrow to heare that a Preſſe ſhould be conveyed to Newcaſtle to the King, to ſurprize him with ſuch a ſcandall.</p>
            <p>Take this cordiall (therefore) to heart, which I have prepared to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the malignancy of that corroſive, and corroborate the ſimple-hearted people, who are too apt to drink in ſuch ſugred potions.</p>
            <p>Who this pretender of tranſlating the Doctors letter, is, I know not; but this I am ſure that he appeares a Cheater, a Jeſuite, a Digby (what ſhall I ſay more?) an Ormond, a meer Machiavil.. And therefore the ſcandals that he hath written againſt the Parliament and the Aſſembly, are no more to be valued then what wiſe men expect from ſuch: All which doth amount to a very poore juſtification of the Royall actions.</p>

            <head>Some Animadverſions upon the Letter pretended to be Doct. <hi>Deodates,</hi> but written by a Malignant at Newcaſtle, to the Aſſembly of Divines.</head>
            <p>AS the Printer at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> pretends this Book to be printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſo the Epiſcopall Malignant at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> pretends the matter of it to be Doctor <hi>Deodates</hi> letterr from <hi>Geneva;</hi> by which they both approve themſelves to be a couple of cheating knaves.</p>
            <p>And if any be not ſatisfied that this letter is forged, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the Aſſembly at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſee that which is the right.</p>
            <p>And although this might be a ſufficient anſwer to it for rationall men, yet leſt ſome poore ignorant ſouls ſhould be overcome before they diſcern the danger of the poyſon, I will paſſe ſome Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon it.</p>
            <p>For that paſſage in the Marginall Note pag. 5. obſerve the Lyer: Did the Church of <hi>England</hi> flouriſh by the publiſhing of prophane Books of ſports on the Lords day? By ſtopping the mouths of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters, cropping off both branch and fruit of all godlineſſe, and planting Popiſhly affected, covetous, and proud Clergy in all the chiefe places of the Kingdome? The Pope indeed had a flouriſhing party waging warre againſt the Proteſtants and Parliaments of <hi>England.</hi> This Metropolitan of our diviſions was fomented by the Hierarchy; they divided between the King and Kingdome, head and body, father and ſon, brother and brother: a right Babyloniſh divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Scorpion ſtings himſelfe, pag. 6. &amp; 7. His note is <hi>ſtill under Epiſcopacie,</hi> which carried ſuch a glorious face with their Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals and Courts, (as the Cardinals and Fry of <hi>Rome</hi> with their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies and Monaſteries?) And therefore it was that they ſtirred up the King to force the Popiſh Service-book upon the <hi>Scots:</hi> and when that could not be effected, they animated him to raiſe an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and cauſed the Sheep and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to goare each other, till the land wallowed in blood, yet ſtill as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, they have <hi>conſcientia mala &amp; tranquilla,</hi> no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, no ſting of conſcience, nothing but a dead ſlumber, a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hardneſſe of heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113939:3"/>
And whereas he magnifies the Kings benignity, as of the beſt of Princes; and that he is the moſt abſolute in wiſdome to redreſſe theſe miſeries; I wiſh that his Majeſty may confirme the ſame by paſſing the Propoſitions of the wiſeſt of Counſells, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both Kingdomes preſented to him at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the eight page you may ſee what a diſparagement hee would caſt upon the Parliament and Citie of <hi>London,</hi> as if they ſhould (by driving away the King) be the cauſe of the warre and bloodſhed; when as his Majeſty left them againſt their will, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and laboured that juſtice might be executed according to law.</p>
            <p>There were many Popiſh and Prelaticall Tares ſowne in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And as God hath hitherto, ſo I doubt not but he will perfect his work by the Parliament, as his Angell with the ſharp ſickle to cut down that harveſt before it doth attain Ripeneſſe in theſe Kingdomes. Blame not therefore the Citie, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Aſſembly (though they deſerted thoſe Vipers) to joyn in hand and heart with the Parliaments, to preſerve the Church and people of God.</p>
            <p>And how ever the Libeller vapours for the Hierarchy, in the note of the eight page: yet we know how oppoſite they were to Chriſt, and that by wofull experience. Chriſts commands to preach the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 2; But they forbad more then one Sermon a week, nay would have had preaching but once a moneth. God commands the Lords day to be kept holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20; but they prevailed with the King to have ſports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations allowed on the Lords day. Gods word requires ſpirituall worſhip, <hi>John</hi> 4. 23; They forced human Traditions upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people. And the firſt Biſhops we read of, were no more but Presbyters, preaching Elders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3; They proved Prelaticall Tyrants.</p>
            <p>It is true, as page 9. there have been many overtures for peace; but the Prelats have ſo wrought into his Majeſties affections, that the Prelats and evill Councellors of their faction, have ſtill hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the good iſſue, they have ſtil been the chiefe incendiaries. How many proteſtations have they forced from his Majeſty to ſtick to them, and not to leave them?</p>
            <p>They would be held up, though three kingdomes be ruined, chuſing rather to ſee <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> all in a ſea of blood, then the pomp of their Prelaticall kingdom ſhould bee overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
<pb facs="tcp:113939:3"/>
Theſe have alwayes been the men that have ſet the whole earth in a combuſtion.</p>
            <p>Though they have unhappily engaged the King in their cauſe, yet let them know, that there is no Law that allowes their actions lawfull by that power to deſtroy the Land.</p>
            <p>The King governes his people by power, not onely Regall, but politick. If the Kings power in <hi>England</hi> was Royall onely then he might change the lawes of the Realm without conſent of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But here the Kings government being politick, hee cannot wage warre againſt his Parliament.</p>
            <p>And ſurely (we may obſerve upon the notes, pag. 9.) there is a woe to theſe Prelates, Papiſts, and Malignants, who have thus traduced the King, and cauſed the warre: And God will find them out with their Babyloniſh garments, and wedges of gold; and not only ſtrip them, but bring them to condigne puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And for the other note, of ſuffering, rather then reſiſting with armes; it is true, we muſt let God work his work, yet wee muſt doe our duty in ſerving him, every one in his own place, we muſt uſe the means.</p>
            <p>And let me tell the Prelates; (which is no more but truth) The Court of Parliament is ſo tranſcendent, that it makes lawes, and inlargeth lawes, diminiſheth, abrogateth, repealeth, and revive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinances, concerning matters Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, Capitall, Criminall, Common, Civill, and Martiall. It is of that high Honour and Juſtice, that none ought to Imagine any thing diſhonourable, that proceedeth from that high Court, <hi>Mitt. Cap 2. Sect 4. 7. 10. 14. Cap. 4. de default, and Cap de Homicid. Cap 1. Sect. 13. Cap</hi> 4 And thoſe that reſiſt that power; reſiſt the Ordinance of God, which is a damnable Act. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
            <p>As for the adjurings, and conjurings, by the pretended holy grones, Sacred Cenſers, and hypocriticall extaſies; I cannot look upon them as tending really to a peace. And we may daly ſee how big the Malignants hearts ſwell with poyſon, to foment (if it were poſſible) a new warre. why do they pleade for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and yet kick againſt our faſts? What inclination of a good minde can they have towards the people of God, whilſt they burn in malice againſt the Parliament, the Aſſembly, and the City?</p>
            <p>So that (notwithſtanding the Marginall notes pag. 11.) It is
<pb facs="tcp:113939:4"/>
cleare that the Malignant party ſeeke peace onely for themſelves, that they may be able to raiſe a new warre: and though the forger of this letter would lay the guilt of all the blood that hath been ſhed in this warre, upon the Parliament, and their party; yet it is moſt certaine, that the Prelates, &amp; Papiſts have been the very cauſe of all this blood-ſhed that hath been ſpilt in the 3. Kingdomes, wherein ſo many thouſands of Innocent people, have been barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murdered for no other cauſe, but that they were Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; and could not profeſſe the ſuperſtitions Commanded by the Prelates Authority. And for the latter Annotations in pag. 11, we may eaſily ſee that they are ſtill the ſame Incendiaryes as before, not repenting unto this very day, as is before expreſt.</p>
            <p>And for that excellent State of the Church, obſerved by the notes on page 12. whence is it? Their Councelling of the King to theſe courſes, ſo diſtructive both to himſelfe and Kingdome? Their Activity in cruell oppreſſions perpetrated by them upon the Innocent people and exorbitant illegall and tyrannicall invaſions upon the juſt Lawes of the Kingdome, and naturall Liberties of the ſubject? Could theſe put the Church into an Excellent State? who can endure ſuch abominable untruths. Theſe alwayes were our blemiſhes.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, He that will approve this peece of Newcaſtle forgery; muſt be either a papiſt, or an atheiſt: A Proteſtant he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be except (to uſe his own words) he be a Malignant, and a right Malignant too, even ſuch a one who ſeekes to foment a new Warre; from whom, good Lord deliver us</p>

But alas, as the ſcantneſſe of our capacity in this; kindſo the Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceof the more inward cauſes of ſo many miſeries, &amp; chiefly the perplex &amp; dangerous nature of matters now in agitation among you: All theſe put together, ſtrike us quite dumbe we are as men wholly at a ſtand, able only (in a kind of ſilent aſtoniſhment or holy horrour) to admire, &amp; to adore that finger of God, which is now lifted up over you all.</p>

               <p>Our affaires, yea the generall intereſt of all the reformed Churches are ſo cloſely involved in yours, and ſo mutually depending thereon, That your ſafety once procured, aſſures us all of our own good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>

What a ſad ſpectacle is this to ſee that Church thus trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot? To ſee that glorious Fould of our Lord thus ranſackt, yea worryed, not by the wild Beaſts of the Forreſt, not torn in pieces by the mercileſſe pawes of the Lyon, or of the Woolf, but utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by its own unnaturall ſheep inraged and exaſperated one againſt another.</p>
               <p>An horrid example this, and till now never heard nf among the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes, heretofore, like Chriſts own true ſheep, they were kept tame by the feare of God, united by the ſame bond of Faith, knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the apprehenſion of the common enemy: and ſo long they did both expreſſe and exerciſe holily and faithfully their mutuall charity, quiet and unity amongſt themſelves: in all which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves from the rage of the Wolfe by the Chriſtian ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their own conditions, by the innocency of their pious lives, by the ſunctity of their Religion, by the conſtant undantedneſſe of their holy Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now we are wholly ſtruck with horrour at the change of that ſo glorious Face of your Church, whileſt we hear at this diſtance the loud report of thoſe deadly wars that are now flaming up between the King and his People: to ſee at Daggers drawing indeed Brethren againſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Parents againſt their own Children, Chriſts ſheep puſhing againſt and goring their own Fellowes, nay their own Shepheards: At all this we are utterly amazed, and would ſcarce have believed, that in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame pitched field, one and the ſame God and Father, in the name of one and the ſame Mediator, at one and the ſame time, could be invocated for help on both ſides, to ſhed the bloud of thoſe, that for the Major-part had hitherto by ſo many clear Demonſtrations in the whole equall courſe of their lives, equall in their Piety towards God, equall in their love and loyalty towards their Country, approved themſelves ſuch faithfull and srue Brethren one to another. Strange, that theſe ſhould now againſt their own Bowels, turn all their war like power, far better if imployed in the juſt puniſhments of their own treacherous Neighbors, or towards the relief of their deareſt Brethren ſo long bowing the back under the weight of their bondage, and even at the laſt gaſp for help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What marvell then, if theſe your cruell diſtractions have awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yea, divided even to a variety the judgements and affections too of Chriſtendome?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:113939:6"/>
Neither do we our ſelves deny but that for a while we did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtagger at, and as it were fluctuate about it; yet that demur of ours did neither proceed from prejudice againſt, nor from partiality towards either ſide, as not being called upon by either, neither pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely nor privately, till now of late in your reference unto us, which we do reckon as no ſmall piece of honou, ſince in your eſteeme, our judgment may ſeeme of ſo much weight, as able to advance or bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance down either party, both being of ſuch extraordinary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>We have contained our ſelves within the bounds of a conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment, and impartiall charity towards both parties, for indeed we are both Brethren; We have neither way exceeded the compaſſe of our own meaſure, but ſtill kept a mean, as rejoyeing on the one hand at thoſe good things which we did heare were entertained with the generall applauſe of all good men; So on the other hand, we could not but behold with griefe thoſe other Siniſter paſſages that in themſelves did carry a more fatall appearance.</p>
               <p>We were overjoyed at the iſſue of the Scottiſh troubles, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at firſt to preſage a combuſtion, not unlike this of yours, and yet far ſooner quenched, for as by Gods own admirable handy-work (So by the never-enough-magnified of your moſt gracious King, &amp; by the Concord of that wary Nation) that fire was in time put out, ere it did burſt into a more open flame.</p>
               <p>At the firſt report of theſe your own Commotions, our mindes were poſſeſſed with a good hope that all paſt offences might with the ſame promptitude and facility be forthwith repaired, and all matters compoſed.</p>
               <p>So that what actions or counſels ſhould appear amiſſe, might by the benignity of the beſt of Princes be eaſily redreſſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both Church and Common-wealth without noiſe or bloud ſhed, be kept in due order:</p>
               <p>In purſuance of all which, we could not but admire the happy and glorious beginnings of the Parliament, and the more then Fatherly affection of his moſt gracious Majeſty, evidenced by his enacting thoſe Lawes, from which for the time to come, there was a cleare hope of a Government full of equity, and freed from all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
               <p>An example not ſo rare, as indeed ſingular in this our wild Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb facs="tcp:113939:7"/>
ſo fertile of violent Powers and Princes. But all theſe our goodly hopes were ſoone blaſted by that raging ſtorme and tempeſt of popular tumults among you, that did force away both your moſt gracious Prince from his Parliament, as alſo a great part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from it ſelf. Since which we have heard indeed of many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and enterpriſes, many Propoſitions and Projects, but all of them come to nothing, nothing is yet brought to perfection, nothing is yet rightly ſetled or eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The buſineſſe of the Church might ſeem the chief object of your care and ſollicitude: If it had been handled and debated at times, &amp; with mindes calm and quiet: had the oppoſite judgments been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and impartially weighed one with another; ſuch an orderly courſe might happily have purchaſed a laſting Peace to your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and alſo rendred unto your Church that moſt deſired Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive face of the Apoſtolicall times: <note n="a" place="margin">Such was Epiſcopacy in its firſt Apoſtolical vigour of Diſcipline &amp; Government, the which as at the Synode of <hi>Dort</hi> this very man did both acknowledge unto Biſhop <hi>Carlton</hi> to bee the beſt Form of Church-Government, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did heartily wiſh for it in his own Church; ſo doth he ſufficiently commend the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it above pag. 5. in that full paſſage of his conteining the Superlative Praiſes of the former flouriſhing eſtate of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as before theſe troubles it ſtood under <hi>Epiſcopacie:</hi> The Reſtauration of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good Eſtate, is again by this Author at the latter end of this Epiſtle, pag. 12. earneſtly wiſhed and prayed for.</note> but behold how quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the event hath fallen out? for the mindes of both ſides being averſe from, yea, violently bent one againſt another, this very matter hath proved the great rock of offence by exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wound, and tearing it wider and wider, by diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more aſunder the hearts of each party, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered enough already through former partiality and diſcord of affections. Nay, if the report be true, theſe <hi>Church Diſtractions</hi> have opened a wide gap to ſo many boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and private ſpirits, which we hear have aſſumed to themſelves the moſt miſchievous Title of Independents, then which Deſtructive Sect nothing could more undermine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Beſides all that, we have bin extreamly grieved at this, That the <hi>ſpirit of diviſion</hi> hath ſo plentifully ſown among you his pernicious <hi>Tares</hi> of <hi>Feares and Jealouſies,</hi> that they have not onely fructified, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

It had been farre more eaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and all good men elſe, to deliver our judgements upon your caſe: had the Major part of either ſide differed from the other, either in the more eſſential poynts of Religion, or elſe diſſented about the Fundamental Lawes of the Common-wealth: or had either party been oppreſſed <note n="b" place="margin">Wo be to them that firſt began that warre whoſe <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> yea <hi>Injuſtice</hi> ſtrangers themſelves can ſo far off ſo plainly perceive and condemne too.</note> by the other in a direct way of open perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or had there been an introduction of publick tyranny againſt the lawes through the baſeneſſe and puſillanimity of the other party: But as for you, you have abundant cauſe of comfort or ſeeurity againſt all theſe evils. <note n="c" place="margin">To wit, in a faire, quiet, legall Parliamentary way, not in a Martiall way: therefore he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not at all the power of Armes, but onely the power of the Lawes.</note> ſince by vertue of your own moſt juſt and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lawes, <hi>thoſe Lawes that already have been indifferently agreed upon by the generall conſent of all parties concerned,</hi> you may with eaſe prevent, or put all thoſe forementioned evils which in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes may ſeem almoſt unavoidable.

                  <hi>an honeſt and ſure Peace</hi> among you. Indeed wee have been much <hi>ſcandalized,</hi> that <hi>all the Mediations</hi> of ſeveral Kingdomes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in league with you, have been tried and uſed all in vaine: Howbeit it came into our mind to propound this <hi>one Medium more,</hi> whether now at laſt there be yet any hope to obtain from the <hi>Kings</hi> moſt gracious Majeſty, and from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that, of both ſides, <hi>Eccleſiaſticall perſons</hi> may bee choſen of unqueſtioned Truſt, and Fame-proofe beyond all ſuſpition, to whom this great buſineſſe may be committed; Namely, that comparing the chiefe points now in controverſie, they may chalkout ſome good way towards an <hi>holypeace.</hi> But firſt theſe men muſt by Gods good Spirit themſelves be <hi>diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of all factious inclinations,</hi> that ſo they may become fit <hi>Vmpires and Truſtees</hi> of the publick Peace, and <hi>impartiall Embaſſadours of Reconciliation</hi> between both parties, and alſo able and ſtudious too by all their Speeches, Exhortations, and Sacred Obteſtations to charm the hearts that on both ſides are ſo obdurate in War and Bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>This were the ready way, by thus interpoſing the Sacred Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in the very midſt of theſe publike flames, to quench all the heart-burnings: for who knowes whether at the devout Prayers and holy groanes of Perſons Sacred, thus proſtrate at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole of the Heavenly grace, the Divine power and glory may not break out once more, and ſhew forth it ſelfe by moving the hearts of both Parties to lay downe all hatred, and publike enmities? The onely way to procure ſuch ſound Councell of both ſides, and to purchaſe again the precious bleſſing of a generall Peace, is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when all humane helps faile, to call in the Divine Aſſiſtance, which no man did ever try in vaine. By theſe good meanes that may be brought to paſſe (what cannot be hoped for from Civill Warre, however the ſucceſſe prove) that by a voluntary Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mindes, the wound ſhall be ſo fully cloſed up, as that Love and Charity may in time perfectly be recovered.</p>
