         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the said severall Writs, before the said Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and the said Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> respectively. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as We are given to understand, that many of Our subjects being misled against the Rites and Ceremonies now used in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have lately taken offence at the same, upon an unjust supposall, that they are not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Our laws, but also introductive unto Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish superstitions, whereas it well appeareth unto Vs upon mature consideration, that the said Rites and Ceremonies which are now so much quarrelled at, were not onely approved of, and used by those learned and godly Divines, to whom at the time of Reformation under King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, the compiling of the Book of Common Prayer was committed divers of which suffered Martyrdome in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes) but also again taken up by this whole Church under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and so duely and ordinarily practised for a great part of her Reign (within the memory of divers yet living) as that it could not then be imagined that there would need any Rule or Law for the observation of the same, or that they could be thought to savour of Popery.</p>
            <p>And albeit since those times, for want of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:69:4"/>
Rule therein, and by subtile practises, the said Rites and Ceremonies began to fall into disuse, and in place thereof, other forrain and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in; Yet foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in Our own Royall Chappels, and in many other Churches, most of them have been ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly used and observed, We cannot now but be very sensible of this matter, and have cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the authors and fomentors of these jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, though they colour the same with a pretence of Zeal, and would seem to strike onely at some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed iniquity in the said Ceremonies; Yet, as We have cause to fear, ayme at Our own Royall person, and would fain have Our good Subjects imagine that We Our Self are perverted, and do worship God in a superstitious way, and that we intend to bring in some alteration of the Religion here esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Now how far We are from that, and how utterly We detest every thought therefore, We have by many publike Declarations, and otherwise upon sundry occasions, given such assurance to the world, as that from thence We also assure Our Self, that no man of wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious entertainment to such brain-sick jealousies; and for the weaker sort, who are prone to be misled by cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and the malicious aspersions of the professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Religion; the one fearing Innovations, the other flattering themselves with a vain hope of our backslidings unto their Popish superstition, by reason of the situation of the Communion Table, and the approaches thereunto, the Synod decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as followeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>That the standing of the Communion Table, side-way under the East window of every Chancell, or Chappell, is in its own nature indifferent, neither commanded nor condemned by the Word of God, either expresly, or by immediate deduction, and therefore that no Religion is to be placed therein, or scruple to be made thereon. And albeit at the time of reforming this Church from that grosse su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of Popery, it was carefully provided that all meanes should be used to root out of the mindes of the people, both the inclination thereunto, and memory therof; especially of the Idolatry commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Masse, for which cause all Popish Altars were demolished: yet notwithstanding it was then ordered by the Injunctions and Advertisements of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore we judge it fit and convenient, that
<pb facs="tcp:69:19"/>
all Churches and Chappels do conform themselves in this particular, to the example of the Cathedral, or Mother Churches, saving alwaies the generall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty left to the Bishop by Law, during the time of Administration of the holy Communion. And we declare that this situation of the holy Table, doth not imply that it is, or ought to be esteemed a true and proper Altar, whereon Christ is again really sacrificed: but it is, and may be called an Altar by us, in that sense in which the Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other.</p>

               <p>And because the Administration of holy things is to be performed with all possible decency and reverence, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
