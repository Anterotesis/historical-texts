         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>WIthout corruption or that corrupted Cave,</l>
            <l>From out that body from the head divided,</l>
            <l>From mortall life, from death, and from the grave,</l>
            <l>And from the Elizian by immortals guided,</l>
            <l>Into the world I come for to reprove thee;</l>
            <l>Because the World reports that I doe love thee.</l>
            <l>Proud <hi>Prelate,</hi> dost thou startle at a shade?</l>
            <l>What substance have I to make thee affraid,</l>
            <l>Or art thou fearefull of thy sociat's Ghost,</l>
            <l>A voyce, a shade, or fancy at the most?</l>
            <l>Surely your Grace cannot so soon be danted;</l>
            <l>'Tis not the first time we have bin acquainted.</l>
            <l>Why! I am <hi>Wentworth,</hi> canst thou not abide me?</l>
            <l>Nay surely then I must begin to chide thee.</l>
            <l>Oh would i'de been as loathsome in thine eye,</l>
            <l>When first to Honour <hi>I</hi> was rais'd so high?</l>
            <l>Or had I never thy confederate beene,</l>
            <l>The tree that's fallen might still have flourish't greene:</l>
            <l>For if i'de never to thy wayes consented,</l>
            <l>Untimely death had surely beene prevented;</l>
            <l>Nor had mine Honours at that day beene stained,</l>
            <l>If I such wicked courses had refrained:</l>
            <l>Then had my wife her husband still enjoyed,</l>
            <l>Nor had my childrens father beene destroyed,</l>
            <l>Whose life was lately tane away by force</l>
            <l>That longer might have liv'd by Natures course,</l>
            <l>And yet to dye I truely had deserved,</l>
            <l>Because with thee, I from the truth had swarved:</l>
            <l>My Lord, you know, it is a trayterous part,</l>
            <l>That any man should seeke for to subvert</l>
            <l>The fundamentall Lawes and Government,</l>
            <l>Confirmed by the course of <hi>Parliament</hi>:</l>
            <l>And yet my Lord you formerly could say,</l>
            <l>You'd make the proudest Subject to give way</l>
            <l>To what you list contrary to the Law,</l>
            <l>As if you'd make the Kingdome stand in awe</l>
            <l>Of your great power, such was your foule ambition</l>
            <l>To pull down truth and set up superstition,</l>
            <l>And held the power of Prelacy more great</l>
            <l>Then his that ruleth in the Royall seate:</l>
            <l>Nay more then that, with threatnings interrupted</l>
            <l>The Iudges, that their Iudgements were corrupted;</l>
            <l>Yet now my Lord, the Law will not forbeare you,</l>
            <l>Since neither Iudge, nor Iustice needs to feare you.</l>
            <l>But stay my Lord, what meane you thus to tremble?</l>
            <l>Can you not still, with God and man dissemble;</l>
            <l>They went beyond a <hi>Canterbury</hi> pace,</l>
            <l>That ran so fast to overtake your Grace,</l>
            <l>And yet you see how sudden alterations,</l>
            <l>Move mighty men with Melancholy passions,</l>
            <l>I know my Lord when you was in your prime,</l>
            <l>You'd not have kept your study halfe this time:</l>
            <l>Oh no my Lord, you then enjoy'd your pleasure,</l>
            <l>Your betters then would stand &amp; waite your leisure,</l>
            <l>The greater sort of persons seem'd to feare you,</l>
            <l>The poore men durst scarce speak, nor come too ne're you,</l>
            <p>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <l>But now you see the matter's alter'd quite,</l>
            <l>They bid you shew the ut most of your spite,</l>
            <l>And yet my Lord it is not many yeares,</l>
            <l>They durst to use such speeches for their eares:</l>
            <l>My Lord as I unseene past through the streets,</l>
            <l>I see the multitudes of paper sheets,</l>
            <l>Sent from the Presse, and thus they cry them still,</l>
            <l>Come buy a booke concerning little Will:</l>
            <l>In truth, my Lord, if you your freedome had,</l>
            <l>This were enough to make you run starke mad,</l>
            <l>Therefore I at your grace doe marvell much,</l>
            <l>Your love unto the World it should be such,</l>
            <l>But rather seeke for to be separated</l>
            <l>From such a world, where you are so much hated:</l>
            <l>In any place where men abroad doe walke,</l>
            <l>When dyes the Bishop? thus they use to talke;</l>
            <l>All which my Lord would be but 9 dayes wonder,</l>
            <l>If once your head and shoulders were asunder:</l>
            <l>Alas my Lord why are you loath to dye?</l>
            <l>You have ossended full as much as I.</l>
            <l>What feare you meeting <hi>Bensteads</hi> Ghost in Hell?</l>
            <l>Why? he's in Heaven, for ought that you can tell,</l>
            <l>And if he be in Heaven, yet never feare,</l>
            <l>It may be long ere he doe meet you there,</l>
            <l>And yet me thinkes you did but ill in that,</l>
            <l>To hang the man, and knew not well for what:</l>
            <l>Hang'd him said I? nay hang and draw and quarter,</l>
            <l>And yet my Lord, you thinke to dye a Martyr;</l>
            <l>On <hi>London</hi> bridge you may behold a Head,</l>
            <l>How much is't worse then yours, when once you'r dead,</l>
            <l>And others more my Lord you put in danger,</l>
            <l>who fear'd the rack, more then they did the manger,</l>
            <l>And thus my Lord, you see how times can alter,</l>
