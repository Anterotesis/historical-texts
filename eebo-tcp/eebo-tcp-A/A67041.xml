            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Word in Seaſon about G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>INEAS, and the Poor's CLIPP'D MONY.</head>
            <p>GUineas at Thirty Shillings is a very great Evil to us; the Nation's Loſs thereby is one third of the value of the Coined Gold we have, and no Remedy, unleſs they who intoxicated us do the like (for no other will do ſo wickedly) to ſome other Country, and they take our Gold from us at that price, which, I believe, to be impoſſible; tho', if they could, to do it to them were leſs Unnatural, than their having done it to their own Country. I need not name the chief Projectors and Promoters of this Evil: It is well known who pleaded for it, and who againſt it the laſt Summer at the Council-Board, their Excellencies the Lords Juſtices then preſent; and who, before and ſince, have all along been remitting Mony to fetch in Gold from <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is agreed by all, That Guineas ought to fall unto Twenty Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; every one ſeems content that it ſhould be ſo in time, and why not now? The Loſs will be more to the Nation ſix Months hence, becauſe there will be daily more Gold and Guineas in it than now, and no Man can be ſure that he ſhall have leſs of them. But what ſhall we have for Payments? Why, our New-Coined Mony and the Guineas we have; for no other Country will take either from us, if we reduce Guineas to that Price. When Foreign Exchanges are in our Favour (as they will then be) our New Coin and our Broad Mony will remain with us, otherwiſe it will not; and theſe, with the Bank of <hi>England</hi>'s Bills (now acceptable to the Nation, and more uſeful for great Payments) will ſupply and quiet us.</p>
            <p>If the meaner People (as they did a while ago in Old Groats and Half Crowns, with much Eaſe) would now cry down Guineas to 22 <hi>s.</hi> or 22 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> the Rich will pay them ſo; for that it can be no Man's Intereſt to Hoard them at that Price: Beſides, continuing Guineas at 30 <hi>s.</hi> will coſt the Nation 500000<hi>l.</hi> extraordinary, in Paying our Armies and Fleet abroad, and render it very difficult; the ill Conſequences of which are obvious.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament pleaſe to make the Stock-Jobbing of Guineas Penal, it would prevent many Inconveniences to the Nation in general.</p>
            <p>I hear of no Proviſion made in the Coin-Act for thoſe who are unable to lend to the King; theſe are Numerous, their Neceſſities are great, they will be Clamorous, our Enemies will improve it, and the Conſequences may be very ill to the Kingdom. Why might not every Pariſh or Hundred be obliged to take from the meaner People and Poor, all their baſe Silver Mony, and give them Credit for it at preſent, and New Coin when they can? The ſaid Pariſhes or Hundreds may pay their Taxes with it, and lend to the King, whereby they will be repaid in New Mony.</p>
            <p>All this may be done with Eaſe, and with little or no Charge, and it will prevent the putting Guineas upon the meaner and poor People at Thirty Shillings, which when they come to loſe by (as they muſt) will renew their Neceſſity and Complaints, and then our Enemies will put the Nation into a ſecond Ferment, more dangerous than the firſt, and at a worſe time when the King is abſent, and no Parliament Sitting.</p>
