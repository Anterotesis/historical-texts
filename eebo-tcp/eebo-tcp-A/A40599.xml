            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True Relation of the Taking CORK, by the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Malborough,</hi> Lieut: Gen. of their Majeſties Forces: Together with the Articles of their Surrender.</head>
            <p>LAſt Night we received the joyful News of a Surrender of <hi>Cork,</hi> and the Perticulars of that Seige, which were as followeth.</p>
            <p>On the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 169<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the whole Fleet ſent with the Earl of <hi>Malborough</hi> having made the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> towards Night, lay by, and next Morning by break of day they ſtood in for the Harbours Mouth. There were on each ſide two Block-houſes, on each of which were 4. peices of Cannon, and which plai'd very warmly; but as ſoon as 2 of our Friggots had plai'd a Broa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſide, they quitted thoſe Forts and run away. About 12 at Noon the Ships came as high as <hi>Paſſage,</hi> where was alſo another Redoubt: But as ſoon as the Enemy eſpied our Men landing in Boats, they ſcoured as hard as they could drive. Here part of our Men landed that Night, and encamped. The next Morning being the 22<hi>d,</hi> the reſt were debarqued, and began to march up towards the Town, which was 6 Miles thence, they arrived at Night within a Mile of it, and there encamped. The 23<hi>d.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Malborough</hi> ſent a Summons to the Governour to Surrender, which he very peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily anſwer'd, and hung out a Bloody Flag; firing ſeveral Guns. But there being an Outwork which the Enemy had lately made to ſecure a Hill, which commanded the Caſtle. My Lord <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> reſolved to attack it, it giving him ſo advantagious a Poſt; accordingly a 1000 Muſqueteers were detached out of the whole Body, and about 3 in the afternoon they marched to attack it. The Enemy that were in it, as ſoon as they ſpied our Men approaching fired one Volley, and then ran into the Town. The Great Guns fired mightily, however our Men took Poſſeſſion hereof, and of the Hil, and that Night made a very good Lodgment. The 24<hi>th</hi> they prepared Batterys on this Hill; alſo took Poſſeſſion of ſeveral Out-poſts, which were very neceſſary to annoy the Enemy. There was great firing with Muſquets all that day. Several Deſerters came to us out of the Town, giving an account, that on the 20<hi>th</hi> 2 Regiments came into them from <hi>Kinſale</hi>: That the Garriſon was 400 ſtrong, and that they ſeem'd reſolved to defend it. We were alſo inform'd, that General <hi>Scravenmore</hi> was 5 Miles on the other ſide of the Town, with 1500 Horſe and Dragoons. That Night our Battery was finiſh'd and 6 Cannon plac'd thereon. On the 25<hi>th</hi> about one in the Morning, the Enemy made a little Sally, but our Men were ſo watchful that they were preſently beat in again, and about 20 kill'd of them. About break of day our Guns began to play againſt the Caſtle: And by the advantage of this Hill our Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets annoyed them very much; and about 12 at Noon our ſmall Friggots came up to the Key with Tide of Flood, and battred the Caſtle. Towards Night we could ſee ſome of the Stones of the Wall begin to ſhake down. That Night ſeveral Deſerters came to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and informed us our Cannon had done great execution that Day; had kill'd ſeveral, and put them into great conſternation. The 26<hi>th</hi> by break of day our Guns began to batter again; and the Wall began to tumble down, ſo that by Night there was a pretty good breach. That day 500 Horſe joyned us, and brought in with them a great Prey of Cattle. They left Monſieur <hi>Seravenmoore</hi> on the otherſide with the reſt, to prevent any releif that might come. That day alſo arrived the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> with 2 Daniſh Regiments of Foot. On the 27<hi>th</hi> our Cannon contined battering, ſo that by about 4 in the afternoon it had made a very fair Breach fit to enter. Therfore at Night it was reſolved that next Moning our Men ſhould Storm the Town: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being laid that 200 Grenadiers, with Hand Grenades ſhould lead the Van; and theſe to be ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 300 Fuſileers, and then 2 Battalions of Foot to ſuſtain all in Caſe of Neceſſity. The 28<hi>th</hi> at 8 in the Morning, all theſe things being diſpoſed, and the Signal upon point of giving: The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my perceiving our deſign hung out a White-Flag, and beat a Parlee: Which being agreed to they ſent an Officer to My Lord <hi>Malborough</hi> to treat of Conditions; and that they might march out with Colours flying and Ball in Mouth: But that being refus'd they ſurrendred at Mercy, as by the Capitulation appears.</p>
            <p>On the 29<hi>th</hi> my Lord <hi>Malborough</hi> entred the Town, and all things being performed according to the Articles, the Iriſh were made Priſoners of War; and put under a ſtrong Guard into the Caſtle. And immeditely 500 Horſe were detached to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> which we do not doubt but is ſurrendred, ſince they had weakned themſelves by ſending two Regiments to <hi>Corke.</hi> Never was ſuch Joy ſeen in a Place, when all the Proteſtants were releaſed, the Bells were immediately ſet a ringing, and all other demonſtrations of Joy. There were very great Magazines and Stores found, but as yet we have not the Particulars.</p>
