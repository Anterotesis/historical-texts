            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Royal Ancestors, makes me presume to Dedicate to your Majesty this little Treatise, which was almost lost in the Ruins of Time, as well as the Subject Matter of it. I must confess indeed, that this Art or Exercise holds not the same Rank and Place in Military Discipline, that it did before the Invention of Guns; but yet to assign it none at all, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And methinks that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Victories which our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:93176:3"/>
(famous for their Bows) owes to that sort of Arms, may at least recommend the Exercise to us, though it be but in Sport and Triumph. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we are sure the Labour will not be wholly lost (if there were no Pleasure in it) it being (it may be) one of the most wholsom and manly Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons us'd in this Nation, and Conduces as much, or more than other, both to the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Health, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Strength. But I fear I am unmannerly, your Majesty knows better than any body else, both the Usefulness and Pleasure of the Bow; and
<pb facs="tcp:93176:4"/>
we were unjust to distrust your Countenancing it. Long may we live under the Government of so good a Prince, and may this, and all other worthy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, fit and qualifie your Majesties Subjects to Defend your Crown and Dignity. This is the Prayer of</p>

                  <p>FOR me that am so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and Ignorant, to speak of the Antiquity and Worth of Archery,
<pb facs="tcp:93176:5"/>
were a great weakness; for I find it to be almost as old as <hi>Adam:</hi> For in Holy Writ, <hi>Gen. 21. 20.</hi> it is said, <hi>That God was with</hi> Ishmael, <hi>and he became an Archer.</hi> And for the fierceness of the Bow and Arrow, Gods Vengeance is sometime in Scripture compared to it. But to come nearer home, and to speak of one or two of those great Victories that have been obtained against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>England</hi> by Archers. As for Instance; first, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Cressy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, where he himself in Person, with the Black Prince his Son,
<pb facs="tcp:93176:5"/>
with an Army of Ten thousand Archers, overthrew and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished his Enemy, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and his Army, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of near One hundred thousand Men; in which Battel were Thirty thousand slain: See the Story more at large in <hi>Baker's Chronicle, pag. 124,</hi> and 125. But this is not all the harm that <hi>Archery</hi> hath done to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor honour it hath won to our selves; for in the Year 1415. in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, there was at <hi>Agin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> in the Territories of <hi>France,</hi> such a Victory obtained, over the French, by the help of the <hi>Archers,</hi> that can scarce, if
<pb facs="tcp:93176:6"/>
ever, be parallel'd in any Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; where a considerable Number of Archers, under the Command of Sir <hi>William Orpington,</hi> who with an Ambush of no more than Two hundred <hi>Archers,</hi> gave the first Onset, (which take in Sir <hi>Rich. Baker's</hi> own words,) <hi>Causing the Bow-men to let fly their Arrows, which so gawled the French Horse, that either they cast their Riders, or through their unruliness so opened their Ranks, that the right Wing of the English Horse had way to come in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the French Foot. The English Army being in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not above Nine thousand,
<pb facs="tcp:93176:6"/>
and the French six times, nay, some say ten times as many in Number. The Number of the French slain was above Ten thousand, whereof One hundred twenty six were of the Nobility bearing Banners; of Knights and Gentlemen Seven thousand eight hundred seventy four; and of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers about One thousand six hundred, with a very small damage to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;</hi> as may be seen at large, <hi>pag. 175.</hi> in Sir <hi>Richard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:93176:7"/>
It were endless to recount what great Battels have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the help of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> and what high Esteem the Turks have of it to this day, I'le refer you to Travellers and Historians; more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to that Ingenious Book of Sir <hi>Paul Rycaut,</hi> in his <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Turks:</hi> and 'tis much to be lamented, that those Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons by which our Ancestors gain'd so much Renown, should now be almost totally laid aside, save only by your Honours, and those Gentlemen that use it for their Health and Recreation.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Learned in time past have greatly commended the penning of Histories, because that by them their Posterity is certifyed, what hath been done in the days of their Ancestors;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93176:29"/>
the benefit whereof is greatly considered in the wisest of this Age, and I would it were unknown to none. Our Elders heretofore that have registred the great Battels and Skirmishes in times past, mention that the Long-Bow hath done great acts, and been the overthrow of mighty Armies: Wherefore considering what profit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> hath gained by the Long-Bow, I have thought convenient to set down in Memory that most honourable Show of Archers, which was at <hi>London</hi> on the Seventeenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1583. chiefly for two Causes: First, To exhort our Country men to continue at home this laudable Exercise, the better to discourage our Enemies when they haply hear thereof, that by so notable a thing shewed but in a Merriment, may the better conjecture what English men could do, if necessity compelled them to the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To follow the Custome of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, which is, to leave Enrolled such Matter as is worthy Memory, that so good a Work might seem new in such our Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and procure them to the furtherance of the like Causes in themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of famous Memory, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, having red in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93176:29"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and seen in his own time how armies mixed with good Archers, have evermore so galled the Enemy, that it hath been great cause of the Victory, he being one day at <hi>Mile-end</hi> when Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Knights were there shooting, did greatly commend the Game, and allowed thereof, lauding them to their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>This noble King at another time keeping a Princely Court at <hi>Windsor,</hi> caused sundry Matches to be made concerning shooting in the Long-Bow: and to which came many principal Archers, who being in Game and the upshoot given, as all men thought, there was one <hi>Barlo</hi> yet remaining to shoot, being one of the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Guard; to whom the King very graciously said, Win them all and thou shalt be Duke over all Archers. This <hi>Barlo</hi> drew his Bow, and shooting won the best. Whereat the King greatly rejoiced, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him for his good Archery; and for that this <hi>Barlo</hi> did dwell in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> the King named him <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Shoreditch.</hi> (A sign of a Princly mind to the encouragement of his poor subject.) The memory of all which, both by Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> hath been greatly revived, and within these five years set forward
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93176:30"/>
at the great Cost and Charges of sundry chief Citizens, whose Names I omit. And now this present year 1583. much more beautified than ever it was, as hereafter is expressed. The worthy <hi>Shoreditch</hi> Duke, as Successor to the former Dukes his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, gave warning to all his Marquesses, Earls and Barons, with all their Train of Archers whatsoever, in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> to be in a readiness to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him into the Field, every one with a Long-Bowe and four Shafts, upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of <hi>September,</hi> and to meet him in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> which they did for the most part.</p>
                  <p>On which Day in the Morning, the Duke being at <hi>Marchant-Taylors Hall,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired unto him all those that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Conducting of his Person to the place of Meeting, as Barons, and a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of good Archers under his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; who, with sound of Trumpets, Drums, and other necessary Instruments for the beautifying of the same, passed along <hi>Broadstreet,</hi> where the Duke dwelleth, marching through <hi>Moorgate</hi> to <hi>Finsbury-Fields,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where a great many attended for him: then the black Train, and the Goldsmiths went forward into <hi>Holborn,</hi> the Duke and his

Company following in a seemly order; where coming against <hi>Hatton-House,</hi> the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths staid, and cast themselves into Ranks, that the Duke might have fair passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: So that the Train being now marching along, and the Duke passing by the Marquess <hi>Barlo,</hi> aliàs <hi>Covell,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his Nobleness a Wedge of Gold, in sign of good will, which the Duke very thankfully accepted; then came the black Train, offering by a Page a Speech to this effect, <hi>That he was ready to aid him with all his Power, for his safety, into the Field:</hi> Whereat the Page, out of a Box, flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, glistering like Gold, certain Spangles, in sign of Liberality.</p>
                  <p>Then came the Marquess of <hi>Clarkenwell</hi> with Hunters, who having been abroad with their Hounds, did wind their Horns, so that the noise of them, together with the yelling and yelping of the Hounds, and the whooping and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Duke, came with their power of Knights, Barons and Squires, accompanied with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good and excellent Archers, taking place, to the honour of the Duke, into the Field. Then the Goldsmiths took their place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Duke, whose Gunners, when the Duke was even past, gave a worthy Volley of Shot, which rung in the Air like a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Clap; and so took place in the hindward.

Then upon a Staff was borne in the midst of the same Show, a Coronet, whereat hung three Arrows of Silver, very workmanly made; then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Consort of broken Musick, playing all the way, to the great delight of all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders and Hearers of the same: And last of all an hundred Shot, being very ready and nimble to discharge, and these were well appointed with Powder. Thus went they along through <hi>Cheapside</hi> up <hi>Coruhill,</hi> and turned by <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> to <hi>Bishops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> where at the end of <hi>Houndsditch</hi> the Street was chained in, and there placed the Image of a monstrons Giant, which in times past dwelt in that place, being stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended with long Morrice-Pikes, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, and Wheel Guns of great shot ready charged against the Duke's Gunners and Archers, who valiantly shot many Arrows into the Giant, and discharged their Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which the Giants men would not put up, but shook their Spears, shot off their Pieces in show to defend the Place, which since that Giant lived belonged to Prince <hi>Arthur:</hi> Thus for sport on both sides, the Trumpets sounded, the Drums, struk up, the Ensigns were tossed in seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The true number of Archers that shot, was Thirty hundred: The number that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him into the Field, of Archers, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, Whiffiers, and those which guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Bills, was Forty and one hundred and odd Persons, besides Pages and Henchmen, which was in number Three hundred and odd. The Attire worn by all this Company (for the most part) was very gorgeous; some in black Velvet Jerkins, Dublets of Satten, with Hats of Velvet; the most part in Satten and Taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Hats of Taffety, a great many wearing Chains of Gold. The true num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of Chains of Gold worn among the Company, that I saw, was Nine hundred forty two; the rest of the Company did all wear green large Skarfs, some white Scarfs, othersome green Ribbons, Oringe tawny Ribbons, some black and white, green and white, but the most part was green.</p>
                  <p>Before they came to the Tent, the Train marched about the Field in Warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and forthwith cast themselves about and broke their Ray, every one hasting to the Tent where the Duke purposed to begin shooting. Then every Ensign brought in his Archers, and there with sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet proclaimed by the Herauld, That every man should avoid Forty foot from each side of the Butt; otherwise to stand to their own perils. Thus went they to shooting, where by then three Ensigns had shot, which was about three of the Clock; word was brought to the Duke, That certain of Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Knights was coming into the Field, desirous to speak with his Nobleness; having answer that they should be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained courteously. Forthwith the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths made forth to meet them, staying at their own Stake against their coming, who anon came, and then the Goldsmiths En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and some of their Pages very orderly,

with some of the Archers in Chains of Gold, went and met these courteous Knights, mounted upon stately Palsreys, with ten Pages also on Horsback, and Irish Lackies with Darts running by their Horses on foot, besides a Trumpeter, a Herauld, and a Messenger, upon good Geldings: The Knights were apparelled in Cloth of Tissue, or Crimson Silk and Gold; their Pages in green Silk; having likewise a seemly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Archers very richly apparelled in Sattin Dublets and Chains of Gold, to the number of Two hundred, attending on Foot, half going before, the residue coming behind. (A worthy Show beseeming so noble a Game). Thus with great reverence they came near to the Tent, the Messenger clad in a Jacket of black Velvet, with a black Velvet Cap, and green Sattin Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; pronounced an Oration to the Duke, the Copy thereof followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Most noble Duke, first to your good self and next unto all your worthy Society and Company in general; I in the behalf of the most noble and renowned Prince</hi> Arthur, <hi>and all his noble Knights, gratifie you (and yours) with the choice of a thousand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations:</hi> Fame <hi>blowing abroad, and in the Court of the Noble Prince</hi> Arthur

                     <hi>that this day (in this place) should be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the most excellent quality of shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Long-Bow. Which news were no sooner blazed in that most Royall Court, but by the consent of their renowned Prince, these noble Knights mounted themselves on Horseback, (calling to mind) the great courtesie they received of your Nobleness, at the late Royal Show of their famous Prince. For requital of which your great Friendship, this Troop of noble Knights (for the honor they owe to the Long-Bow) are repaired hither to present unto your Nobleness a friendly Gift; which is, five Bows of Gold, and five Silver Arrows; requiring your Nobleness to bestow them on five of the most valiant, most active, and most expert of all your Train, in shooting in the Long-Bow, requesting (friendly) we may presently see the delivery of them to those persons most worthy: hoping you will accept these their friendly Gifts, springing from well willing minds, loth to hinder your worthy exercise, we omit for expence of time, that which else more largely shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Duke with hearty thanks accepted these their presents, promising with great protestation to match the Prince every way in good will and curtesie, wishing that this their amity might long continue.</p>
                  <p>Then the Knights departed with great grief to the Duke, because he had provided a Bankquet for them, which could not be served in by reason of the unruliness and throng of the People.</p>
                  <p>The Marquess <hi>Barlo</hi> chief of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, to gratify them with some Show of curtesie, bestowed on them to Jugots or Wedges, one of Gold the other of Silver, and after did conduct them into their own liberties with a Volley of shot, which they very thankfully accepted.</p>
                  <p>And this one thing is worthy of memory, that upon the day of Prince <hi>Arthur's</hi> shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was five weeks before this Show, The Duke willing to beautifie the same in some seemly sort, sent a Buck of that season by the Marquess <hi>Barlo,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many Goldsmiths; who coming in Satten Dublets and Chains of Gold about their Bodies, with Horns at their backs, did all the way wind their Horns, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93176:39"/>
the same to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was at his Tent, which was at <hi>Mile-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green;</hi> he not only accepted the same, but also promised to have the Dukes curtesie in mind if God lent him life.</p>
                  <p>Having now digressed in brief, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Duke, who seeing the night draw on, broke up the shooting untill the next day, which was Wednesday, where they all met again to try who could depart Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of those Games then to bee won. Which were in value as followeth; The first Fifty three shillings four pence, the second five nobles, the third four nobles, the fourth Twenty shillings, and the fifth ten shillings. Thus every one having one shot at the But, the best five were young men; four of the best Games did the Earl of <hi>Pankridge's</hi> men win; the fifth one of the Dukes men did get. The best and the second were won by two of S. <hi>Dunstans</hi> in the East; the best was a Skinners man, the second a Brewers man, and he that won the first did dwell in S. <hi>Brides</hi> Parish, being a Sadlers Son, all which three were brought home in this manner. First, for that it was dark, they were brought out of the Field with Torch lights to the number of two hundred, and the Winners mounted upon great Geldings, sent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93176:40"/>
to them from out of those parts where they dwelled, very sumptuously trapped with cloth of Silk, and Silver, and another of Gold, with eight Trumpets Drums and Ensigns, with shot which came from <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi> to fetch them home: and others with Halbards safely to conduct them, they all three were clad in green; the first in green Taffety, with a white Scarf about his Body, and a great Chain of Gold about his neck, with a Cap of Velvet, and a golden Band about the same, bearing an Arrow in his hand, and a green Ribbon hanging thereat; And so had they all: To their great laud and honour were they conducted first into <hi>Grubstreet,</hi> then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the City at <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> down <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> and so into <hi>Cheapside,</hi> continual shot was bestowed to bring them home, to the great delight of the beholders: Thus marching through <hi>Paul's</hi> Churchyard, they went to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and so home, where their Trains was very thankfully received: Against they came home there was prepared great Banquets by their Masters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to the great delight of that Parish where they dwelled, who would not for mony have lost the honor of the same.</p>

                  <p>Then every Baron and the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Governors were brought home to their joy and comfort, making good chear, shooting off their Peeces, sounding of Trumpets, and striking up of their Drums to delight and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I (as perfectly as I may) described the manner of the same, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truth of what I saw. Then on the Monday following, the Duke had provided a sumptuous Feast, to which all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers came, being kept at the Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi> Pallace, who for the good will
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93176:41"/>
he bore to shooting, lent them his house freely, wishing that it might be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to them, as the Show and Sight, for provision of so many Citizens in his house was comfortable to him. And for fear of disorder, there was unto every Archer given a token stamped with a Broad Arrow, who at the gate of the Bishops Pallace, delivered them to those they were appointed to receive them.</p>
                  <p>Which done, every man (for the most part having Ribbons about their necks) went to those Tables, which by good fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight were provided for them, every man taking his place vntill the Service was brought in, the Tables furnished before with Table-clothes, Salt Bread, and tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: The great Hall of the Pallace was filled, and over the heads of the People hung the most sumptuous E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>signs, under which they were before conducted to the field. There might a man behold the great provision of meat, the Cooks in such good order dressing the same in quiet sort as was worthy noting. And when the service of meat was brought in, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets sounded, the Drums struck up, and every man in very good order placed to their contentment, so that the great Hall,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93176:41"/>
the largest Parlor, the Galleries, and other Rooms in the House were filled with People, who with great rejoycing gave thanks to God for his providence and blessings, many wayes bestowed on them. Then was there served into one large Table, which was the highest Table in the great Hall, boyled Capon, rosted Beef, Venison Pasties, Custard, Tart, rosted Capon and Rabbets, with other Dishes necessary for the time, with Wine, Beer, and Ale, and ever was replenished with sufficient thereof to their contentation.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Tables had this service to every' Mess. First boil'd Mutton, rosted Beef, a Pasty of Venison, and a rosted, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and some had Rabbets, besides Beer and Ale which was sufficient, every Mess had a Bottle of Wine served in a Bottel unto the same: There were three hundred Messes of Meat served in, to the great joy and comfort of those that were there, being served in such good order as is laudable. When the Meat was served in, every man familiarly drunk one to another, and then the Duke very reverently drank to them all, whereat the Trumpets founded, the People hollowed, the Drums struck up, and such a noise was made that it was heard

far off. Then the Duke with some of his Knights and Gentlemen, went about the whole House and visited every Table, with Drum and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then sundry times the Trumpets sounded, the Drums struck up, and the Company drank to the Duke, passing away the time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Dinner was ended. Then another Company did wind their Horns, which in good order of measures they did. The People by this time beginning to depart, the Duke caused the Herald to stand up and make a proclamation, that the people might be silent; which done, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in short sentence, a thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for our gracious Queen, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to send her long Life and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over all her enemies; whereat the People cried Amen; lifting up their Caps, heaving up the Tables over their Heads, in sign of joy of her Majesty, whereat the Trumpets sounded, the Company hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and showted. Last of all they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God and so departed; giving the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the broken Meat to the poor and needy, of which company a number gave diligent attendance for the same at

the great Gate. (A charitable deed in the knitting up of so honorable a matter.) Thus they declared their courtesies one to another, to the maintenance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian unity, which I pray God long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, that this her Majesties Realm of <hi>England</hi> may be kept still in Peace and Tranquility, to the maintenance of Gods Glory, the Fame and perpetual renown of of her Majesty; whose life, the God and giver of all life, prolong, that our lives which depend upon Hers, may the better be preserved and continued.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93176:46"/>
and the then Lord Mayor. When the King had past by (who seemed highly pleas'd with the sight of so many Archers) then they march'd to <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> where a very noble Dinner was prepared for them at the expence of the Lord Mayor: Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon the 26th of <hi>May</hi> following, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers marched to <hi>Tuttle-feilds</hi> to Shoot their Whistling-Arrowes.

When they were drawn up in a Line, then came the King with his Guard and Coaches of State, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with His Royal Highness, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and most
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93176:47"/>
of the Nobility attending him; to see them Shoot His Majesty march'd twice or thrice from one end of the body to the other to view them. The Archers were in number near a Thousand; the Spectators near Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand It was a great encouragement, and a mighty joy and satisfaction to the Archers to see the King behold them with such a Serene, Benign, Cheerfull, Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Favourable Countenance: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was pleased to stay an hour or two to look on, whilst they shot several Showers of Whistling-Arrowes to entertain him, with which his Majesty, and the Nobility, seem'd very much satisfi'd: Then the King was pleased to return to <hi>Whitehall:</hi> And then Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> sent in several Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Beer, and other Provision for the Archers; so did Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> and the rest of the Captains; After they had refresh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then they marched home with Drums beating, and Colours flying. Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> being the Colonel, Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> Lieutenant Colonel, and <hi>Michael Arnold</hi> Major.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1676. on St. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude's</hi> day, Sir <hi>Ioseph Sheldon</hi> being Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord Mayor, about 350 Archers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch'd under the Command of Sir <hi>Robert

Peyton</hi> Knight; they Randezvouzd in the upper <hi>Moor-feilds,</hi> and march'd as before mentioned in the time of Sir <hi>Robert Vyner's</hi> Maioralty, and were in the self same manner plac'd to receive the King and Queen, the Nobility and Gentry, who came to Honour the Lord Mayor with their presence at Dinner at the <hi>Guild-Hall:</hi> When his Majesty was past by, then they march'd to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> to Dinner. Amongst the variety of Sights, none seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give his Majesty more content and delight, more pleasure and satisfaction, than to see the Bows and Arrows, these Ancient Habiliments of warr reviv'd.</p>
                  <p>On the 14th day of <hi>July,</hi> 1681. the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers march'd from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> under the Command of Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry Warren:</hi> That was a Day appointed to Shoot for Several Pieces of Plate, worth Thirty pounds, at Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yards distance. After a little time was spent, the King was pleased to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them with his Presence, and Stay'd near Two hours to behold their Pastime, to the great joy, satisfaction, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Archers: And as though this had not been honour enough, so full of Goodness and Clemency was his Majesty, that he permitted as many of them as pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93176:48"/>
to kiss his Hand, in token of his being well satisfi'd with that Heroick Exercise; The Prizes were two Silver Cups, and three dozen of Silver Spoons. The said Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get was placed upon a Butt, erected on the Green, before the Kings Palace there; but it rained so fast that the King was forc'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
