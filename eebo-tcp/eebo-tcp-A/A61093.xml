            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS our Law-books have nothing,
to my knowledge, of the <hi>Terms,</hi>
so were it much better if our
Chronicles had as <hi>little:</hi> For though
it be little they have in that kind, yet
is that little very untrue, affirming
that <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> did first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
them. It is not worth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
who was <hi>authour</hi> of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
but it seemeth that<note n="a" place="margin">Deinde constituit <hi>[Guilielmus Conquaestor]</hi> ut quater quotan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, &amp;c. <hi>Lib. 9. p.</hi> 154. l. 16. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Polydore
Virgil</hi> (an alien in our Commonwealth,
and not well endenized in
our Antiquities) spread it first in
<hi>print.</hi> I purpose not to take it upon
any man's word: but, searching for
the fountain, will, if I can, deduce
them from thence, beginning with
their definition.</p>
            <p>The Terms are certain portions of the
year in which onely the King's Justices
hold plea,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> in the high Temporal Courts,
of Causes belonging to their Jurisdiction,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55288:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the place thereto assigned, according
to the ancient Rites and Customs of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The definition divides it self, and
offers these parts to be consider'd.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>names</hi> they bear.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>original</hi> they come of.</item>

with.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These parts minister matter for a
Book at <hi>large,</hi> but my purpose upon
the occasion imposed being to deal one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the <hi>institution</hi> of the Terms;
I will travel no farther than the <hi>three</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of the Names of the Terms.</head>
            <p>THE word <hi>Terminus</hi> is of the
Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth the
<hi>Bound, End,</hi> or <hi>Limit</hi> of a thing,
here particularly of the <hi>time</hi> for Law-matters.
In the Civil-Law it also
signifieth a day set to the Defendant,
and in that sense doth <hi>Bracton</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sometimes use it. <hi>Mat. Paris</hi>
calleth the Sheriff's <hi>Turn, Terminum
Vicecomitis,</hi> and in the addition to the
M: SS: Laws of King <hi>Inas, Terminus</hi>
is applied to the Hundred-Court; as
also in a Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time of holding the Court.
And we ordinarily use it for any set
portion of time, as of Life, Years,
Lease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The space between the Terms, is
named <hi>Vacation, à Vacando,</hi> as being
Leasure from Law-business, by Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
<hi>Justitium à jure stando,</hi> because
the Law is now at a <hi>stop</hi> or <hi>stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55288:4"/>
The Civilians and Canonists call
Term-time <hi>Dies Juridicos;</hi> Vacation,
<hi>Dies Feriales,</hi> Days of leasure, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,
Festival-days, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sequester'd from troublesome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of humane business, and devoted
<hi>properly</hi> to the service of God, and
his Church. According to this our
<hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Ancestours divided
the year also between <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>King,</hi> calling those days and parts that
were assigned to God, <hi>Dies pacis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi>
the residue allotted to the King,
<hi>Dies,</hi> or <hi>tempus Pacis Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Divisum Imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.</q>
            <p>Other names I find none anciently
among us, nor the word <hi>Terminus</hi> to be
frequent, till the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Gervascius Tilburiensis,</hi> and <hi>Ranul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
de Glanvilla</hi> (if those books be
theirs) do continually use it for <hi>Dies
pacis Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> in like manner,
divided their Year between their <hi>Gods,</hi>
and their <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> naming their
Law-days, or Term-time, <hi>Fastos,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their <hi>Praetor</hi> or Judge might
then <hi>Fari,</hi> that is speak freely; their
Vacation, or days of Intermission (as
appointed to the service of their Gods)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55288:4"/>
they called <hi>Nefastos,</hi> for that the
<hi>Praetor</hi> might <hi>ne fari,</hi> not speak in them
judicially. <hi>Ovid</hi> Fastorum <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ille Nefastus erat, per quem tria verba
silentur,</l>
               <l>Fastus erat per quem lege licebat agi.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>When that the three Judicial words</l>
               <l>The Pretor might not use,</l>
               <l>It was Nefastus: Fastus then,</l>
               <l>When each man freely sues.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The three Judicial words were <hi>Do,
Dico, Abdico;</hi> by the first he gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<hi>Citare partem ream,</hi> to <hi>Cite</hi> the
<hi>Defendant;</hi> by the 2d. he pronounced
<hi>sentence;</hi> and by the 3d. he granted
<hi>execution.</hi> This <hi>obiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Term</hi> hath also other
considerations, sometimes it is used
for the <hi>whole</hi> space, from the <hi>first</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>end</hi> of the Term, including
the day of<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Sect. 5. Cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Return Essoine, Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Retorn. Brev.</hi> Sometimes and
most commonly excluding these from
the first sitting of the Judges in full
Court (which is the first day for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance)
and this is called <hi>full-Term</hi>
by the <hi>Statute of 32. of</hi> Hen. 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.
as though the part precedent were but
<hi>Semi-Term, Puisne-Term,</hi> or <hi>Introitus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55288:5"/>
Termini:</hi> The words of the <hi>Stat.</hi> are
these, <hi>That Trinity-Term shall begin the
Munday next after Trinity-Sunday,
for keeping the Essoines, Returns, Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
and other ceremonies heretofore used,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>And that the full term of the said
Trinity-Term shall yearly for ever begin
the Fryday next after</hi> Corpus Christi-<hi>Day.</hi>
Here the particulars I speak of,
are apparently set forth, and the
Term declared to begin at the <hi>first</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
By which reason it falleth out
that the eight days wherein the Court
of the Exchequer sits, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Michaelmas-Terms, Hilary-Term
and Easter, are to be accounted
as <hi>parts</hi> of the Terms, for that they
fall within the <hi>first</hi> Return: the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
having <hi>one</hi> Return in every of
them, more than the Courts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
have, <hi>viz. Crastino Sancti
Michaelis, Octabis Hilarii,</hi> and <hi>Octabis</hi>
or <hi>Clausum Paschae:</hi> And it seemeth
that Trinity-Term had <hi>Crastino Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis</hi>
in the self-same manner, before
this Statute alter'd it.</p>

            <p>LAW-days or <hi>Dies Juridici,</hi> which

as ancient as <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:</hi>
God <hi>himself</hi> held a kind of Term

was appointed for punishing offences,
redressing of wrongs, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to every of those Nations was their
<hi>Term.</hi> The <hi>Original</hi> therefore of the
Terms or Law-days, and the <hi>time</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to them, are like the Signs of

ended at the Saturday next before

made this Term longer some years

<hi>de</hi> Alderi, <hi>filium Amitae illius suspendi,</hi>
&amp;c. proceeding also judicially against
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55288:18"/>
others. Though <hi>Walsingham</hi> calleth this
Assembly <hi>Consilium</hi> with an <hi>s,</hi> and
<hi>Wigorniensis Concilium</hi> with a <hi>c,</hi> (the
word <hi>Term</hi> perhaps not being in use
in the days of <hi>William Rufus</hi>) yet it
may seem to be no other, than an
Assembly of the <hi>Barons,</hi> in the King's
Court of State, (which was then the
place of Justice) to proceed judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against these offenders. For the
Barons of the Land were at that time
the Judges of all Causes, which we
call <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> and of all other
belonging to the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>King:</hi>
So that the proceedings being <hi>Legal</hi>
and not <hi>Parliamentary,</hi> it appeareth
that it was then <hi>no</hi> Vacation, and that
the Term was begun at <hi>Octabis Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniae;</hi>
whereby it is the liklier also
that it ended at <hi>Septuagessima,</hi> lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
it, as we <hi>now</hi> do, some years
might happen to have no <hi>Hilary</hi>-Term
at all, as shall anon appear. And
this our ancient use of ending the
Term at <hi>Septuagessima</hi> is some induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to think, the Council of <hi>Ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
to be depraved, and that the
word there <hi>Quinquagessima</hi> should be
<hi>Septuagessima,</hi> as the gloss there report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to be in some other place: And
as well <hi>Gratian</hi> mistakes <hi>this,</hi> as he hath
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55288:19"/>
done the Council it <hi>self,</hi> attributing
it to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a City of <hi>Ionia,</hi> instead
of <hi>Ertford</hi> a town in <hi>Germany;</hi> where
<hi>Burchard</hi> before him, and <hi>Binius</hi> since,
hath placed it.</p>
               <p>It comes here to my mind, what
I have heard an old <hi>Chequerman</hi> many
years agoe report, that <hi>this</hi> Term and
<hi>Trinity</hi>-Term were in ancient time
either <hi>no</hi> Terms at all, or but as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Easter</hi>-Terms,
rather than <hi>just</hi> Terms of themselves:
Some courses of the <hi>Chequer</hi> yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to it. And we were both of the
mind, that want of business (which
no doubt in those days was <hi>very</hi> little)
by reason Suits were then for the most
part determined in inferiour Courts,
was the cause of it. But I since ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
another cause, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gessima</hi>
or Church-time one while trode
so near upon the heels of <hi>Octabis Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniae</hi>
(I mean came so soon after it,)
that it left not a whole week for
<hi>Hilary</hi>-Term; and again, another
while, <hi>Trinity</hi>-Sunday fell out so <hi>late</hi>
in the year, that the common neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Hay-seed and Harvest, made
that time very <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>unfrequented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For inasmuch as <hi>Easter</hi>-Term
(which is the <hi>Clavis,</hi> as well to shut
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55288:19"/>
up <hi>Hilary</hi>-Term, as to open <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term,)
may according to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> holden in the
year 922. fall upon <hi>any</hi> day between
the 22. of October exclusively, which
then was the <hi>Aequinoctium,</hi> and the
25 of April inclusively (as the <hi>farthest</hi>
day that the Sunday following the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Full-Moon can happen upon;) <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agessima</hi>
may <hi>sometimes</hi> be upon the 18.
of January, and then they could not in
ancient time have above 4. days Term,
and we at this day <hi>no</hi> Term at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we begin it not till the 23. of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
which may be <hi>six</hi> days after <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gessima,</hi>
and <hi>within</hi> the time of Church-Vacation.
But what <hi>Hilary</hi>-Term hath
now lost from the <hi>beginning</hi> of it, it
hath gained at the latter <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>-Term.
And I shall speak more
of this by and by.</p>

                  <hi>TRinity</hi>-Term therefore in those

that the <hi>Stat. 51. of</hi> Hen. 3. chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beginning of this Term from
<hi>Crastino Trinitatis</hi> to <hi>Octab. Trinitatis,</hi>
and that therefore the <hi>Stat. of</hi> Hen. 8.
did no more in this point than reduce
it to the former original. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>end</hi> of this Term, it seemeth
also that the said <hi>Stat. of</hi> 51. Hen. 3.
assigned the same to be within two
or three days after <hi>Quindena Sancti
Johannis</hi> (which is about the <hi>twelvth</hi>

<hi>return</hi> after.</p>
               <p>Bnt, for ought that hindreth by
the Canons, it is <hi>tanquam Terminus
sine termino;</hi> for, there was no set
<hi>Canon</hi> or Ecclesiastical <hi>Law</hi> (that I can
find) to abbridge the continuance
thereof till <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, unless
the 7. days next before St, <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
were (according to the Canon of
<hi>Ertford</hi>) used as days of intermission,
when they fell after the <hi>Octaves</hi> of
Pentecost as commonly they do,
though in the year 1614. four of them
fell within them. And except the
Ember-days next after <hi>Holy</hi> Rood;
for <hi>Jejunia quatuor Temporum,</hi> as well
by the Laws of <hi>Canutus,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi>
the <hi>Confessour,</hi> as by all other almost
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55288:21"/>
before recited, are either expresly or
implicitly exempted from the days of
Law. But when <hi>Trinity</hi>-Sunday fell
near the Feast of St. <hi>John Baptist, then</hi>
was the first part of this Term so
thrust up between those days of the
<hi>Church,</hi> that it was very short; and
the latter part being always very late
did so hinder Hay-seed and Harvest
following, that either the course of it
must be shortned, or it must still u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp

               </p>
               <p>For as <hi>Religion</hi> closed the Courts

after <hi>Corpus-Christi-day,</hi> and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
19 days; whereas in <hi>elder</hi> times it
began two or three days <hi>sooner.</hi> So
that <hi>Corpus-Christi-day</hi> being a <hi>movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Feast, this Term cannot hold any
<hi>certain</hi> station in the year, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the year 1614, it began on
St. <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s day, and the year
before it <hi>ended</hi> on his <hi>Eve.</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though by all the Canons of the
Church and former Laws, the Feast
of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> was a <hi>solemn</hi> day,
and <hi>exempt</hi> from legal proceedings in
Courts of Justice; yet it is <hi>no</hi> vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
day, when <hi>Corpus-Christi</hi> falleth
(as it did that year) the very day <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
it: Because the Statute hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Term to begin the <hi>Fryday</hi>
next after <hi>Corpus-Christi-day,</hi> which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55288:24"/>
in the said year 1614. was the day <hi>next</hi>
before St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and so the
Term did of necessity begin on Saint
<hi>John Baptist</hi>'s day. This deceived all
the Prognosticators, who counting
St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> for a <hi>grand</hi> day, and
no day in Court, appointed the Term
in their Almanacks to begin the day
<hi>after,</hi> and consequently to hold a day
longer; so deceiving many by that
their errour.</p>
               <p>But, the aforesaid <hi>Statute of 32 H.</hi> 8.
changed the whole frame of this Term:
For it made it begin sooner by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<hi>viz. Crastino Sanctae Trinitatis,</hi>
and thereby brought <hi>Octabis Trinitatis</hi>
which before was the <hi>first</hi> Return, to
be the <hi>second,</hi> and <hi>Quindena Trinitatis</hi>
which before was the <hi>second,</hi> now to
be the <hi>third;</hi> and instead of the three
<hi>other</hi> Returns of <hi>Crastino Octabis,</hi> and
<hi>Quindena Sancti Johannis,</hi> it appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that which before was <hi>no</hi> Return,
but now the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> called
<hi>Tres Trinitatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>altering</hi> and <hi>abbreviation</hi> of this
Term is declared by the Preamble of
the Statute, to have risen out of <hi>two</hi>
causes, one for <hi>health,</hi> in dismissing
the Concourse of people, the other
for <hi>wealth</hi> that the Subject might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55288:25"/>
his <hi>Harvest,</hi> and the gathering
in the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>earth.</hi> But there
seemeth to be a <hi>third</hi> also not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in the Statute, and that is, the
uncertain <hi>station, length</hi> and <hi>Returns</hi>
of the first part of this Term, which,
like an <hi>Excentrick,</hi> was one year <hi>near</hi>
to St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> another year far
<hi>removed</hi> from it; thereby making the
Term not onely <hi>various,</hi> but one year
<hi>longer,</hi> and another <hi>shorter,</hi> according
as <hi>Trinity</hi>-Sunday (being the <hi>Clavis</hi>
to it) fell nearer or farther off from
St. <hi>John Baptist.</hi> For if it fell <hi>betimes</hi>
in the year, then was this Term very
long, and the two <hi>first</hi> Returns of
<hi>Octabis</hi> and <hi>Quindena Trinitatis</hi> might
be past and gone a fortnight and more,
before <hi>Crastino Sancti Johannis</hi> could
come in: And if it fell late, (as some
years it did) then would <hi>Crastino Sancti
Johannis</hi> be come and past, before
<hi>Octabis Trinitatis</hi> were gone out. So
that many times one or two of the
first Returns of this Term (for ought
that I can see) must in those days <hi>needs</hi>
be lost.</p>

by former Statutes it doth appear,
that <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term did begin in

appoints, that the <hi>first</hi> Return in this

off no less than <hi>two</hi> Returns from

There we find, that the old <hi>beginning

found to be very inconvenient to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
subjects both Nobles and others.
1. For the keeping of Quarter-Sessions
next after the feast of St.</hi> Michael <hi>the

               <head type="sub">Why the high Courts sit not in the
Afternoons.</head>
               <p>IT is <hi>now</hi> to be considered why the
high Courts of Justice sit not in
the <hi>Afternoons.</hi> For it is said in
<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 18. 14.</note> Scripture, that <hi>Moses</hi> judged the
<hi>Israelites</hi> from <hi>Morning</hi> to <hi>Evening.</hi>
And the <hi>Romans</hi> used the <hi>Afternoon</hi> as
well as the <hi>Forenoon,</hi> yea many times
the Afternoon and <hi>not</hi> the Forenoon,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55288:27"/>
as upon the days called <hi>Endotercisi,</hi>
or <hi>Intercisi,</hi> whereof the Forenoon
was <hi>Nefastus</hi> or Vacation, and the
Afternoon <hi>Fastus</hi> or Law-day, as we
shewed in the beginning. And the
<hi>Civilians</hi> following that Law do so
continue them amongst us in their
Terms at <hi>this</hi> day. But our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
and other the Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being more prone to <hi>distemper</hi> and
excess of <hi>diet</hi> (as the Canon Law no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of them) used the Forenoon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
lest <hi>repletion</hi> should bring upon
them <hi>drowsiness</hi> and <hi>oppression of spirits;</hi>
according to that of St. <hi>Jerome, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis
Venter non gignit mentem tenuem.</hi>
To confess the truth, our <hi>Saxons</hi> (as
appeareth by<note n="a" place="margin">Hist. lib. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Huntington</hi>) were
unmeasurably given to drunkenness.
And it is said in<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 10. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Ecclesiastes, Vae
Terrae cujus Principes manè comedunt.</hi>
Therefore to avoid the inconvenience
depending hereon the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>
ordained, that <hi>Judices non nisi jejuni
judicia decernant.</hi> And in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Salegunstad</hi> it was afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<hi>A. D. 1023, ut lectio Nicaeni

Yet I find that Causes might be
heard and judged in the <hi>afternoon;</hi> for
in <hi>Capitulars lib.</hi> 2—33, and again
<hi>lib. 4. Cau.</hi> 16. it is said, <hi>Causae vidua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
pupillorum &amp; pauperum audiantur
&amp; definiantur ante Meridiem, Regis verò
&amp; Potentiorum post Meridiem.</hi> This
though it may seem contradictory to
the Constitutions aforesaid, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to be <hi>thus</hi> reconcilable:
That the Judges (sitting then but
seldom) <hi>continued</hi> their Courts both
Forenoon and Afternoon, from Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
till Evening without dinner or
intermission, as at this day they <hi>may,</hi>
and often <hi>do,</hi> upon <hi>great</hi> Causes:
though being risen and dining, they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55288:28"/>
might not meet again; yet might
they not sit at <hi>night,</hi> or use <hi>candle light,
Quòd de nocte non est honestum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
exercere.</hi> And from these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rites of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi>
is our Law derived, which prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
our Jurours, being <hi>Judices de

light,</hi> till they be <hi>agreed</hi> of their
verdict,</p>
               <p>It may here be demanded how it
cometh to pass, that our Judges after
<hi>dinner</hi> do take <hi>Assizes</hi> and <hi>Nisi prius</hi> in
the Guild-hall of <hi>London,</hi> and in their
Circuits? I have yet no <hi>other</hi> answer
but that ancient Institutions are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued
often by some custome gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in upon them, and changed often
by some later Constitution, of which
kind the instances aforesaid seem to
be. For <hi>Assizes</hi> were ordained <hi>many</hi>
ages after by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, as
appeareth by the Charter of <hi>Beverly
Glanvill</hi> and <hi>Radulphus Niger,</hi> and <hi>Nisi

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in the

not unto <hi>Saints,</hi> but unto <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

retain as Holy-days: Yet do not the

them, saving on the Feast of the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
the <hi>Ascension,</hi> St. <hi>John Baptist,
All-saints,</hi> and the day after, (though
not a Feast) called <hi>All-souls.</hi> When the
others lost their privilege and came to
be Term-days I cannot find; it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
that <hi>Custome</hi> hath repealed them
by confession of the Canonists. Yet
it seemeth to me, there is no provision
made for it in the Constitutions of
our Church under <hi>Isleep</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the
third. For though many ancient Laws
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55288:29"/>

had ordained, <hi>judicialem strepitum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebus

though it be in the phrase God <hi>himself</hi>

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 23. 21, 25.</note>

                  <hi>Non facies omne opus in eo,</hi> without

but <hi>honoratum &amp; planè Regium,</hi> and so
not within the prohibition of <hi>this</hi> our
Canon, which being the <hi>latter</hi> seemeth
to qualifie the <hi>former.</hi> Yea the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists
and Casuists themselves not
onely <hi>expound opus servile</hi> of <hi>corporeal</hi>
and <hi>mechanical</hi> labour, but admit 26
<hi>several</hi> cases where (even in that <hi>very</hi>

Canons, and by <hi>much</hi> more reason then,
with this in question. It may be said
that this Canon consequently giveth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55288:30"/>
liberty to hold plea and Courts, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Festivals in the Vacations.
I confess that <hi>so</hi> it seemeth; but this
Canon hath no power to alter the
<hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>course</hi> of the Terms, which
<hi>before</hi> were setled by the Statutes of

not. Why? but there ariseth
another question how it comes to pass
that the Courts sit in <hi>Easter</hi>-Term up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Rogation days,</hi> it being forbidden
by the Council of <hi>Medard,</hi> and by the
intention of divers <hi>other</hi> Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
It seemeth that it <hi>never</hi> was so

<hi>many</hi> ages, especially since <hi>Gregory</hi> the

wherein he prohibiteth <hi>Forensem stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitum,</hi>

We must now shew (if we can) why
the Courts,<note place="margin">Why on some Festivals, and not on others.</note> sitting upon so many
Ferial and Holy-days, do forbear to
sit upon <hi>some</hi> others, which before I
mention'd; the <hi>Purification, Ascension,</hi>
St. <hi>John Baptist, All-Saints,</hi> &amp;c. For,
in the Synod under <hi>Isleep</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>no</hi> prerogative is given to
<hi>them</hi> above the <hi>rest,</hi> that fall in the
<hi>Terms;</hi> as namely, St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St.
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they do fall in
<hi>Easter</hi> Term, St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> (before the late abbreviation
by 16. <hi>Car.</hi> 1.) <hi>did</hi> fall, and St. <hi>Simon</hi>
and <hi>Jude,</hi> doth <hi>always</hi> fall in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term.
It may be said, that, although
the Synod did prohibit onely <hi>Opera
Servilia</hi> to be done on Festival-days,
as the offence most in use at <hi>that</hi> time;
yet did it not give licence to doe <hi>any</hi>
Act that was <hi>formerly</hi> prohibited by
any <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Laudable Custome.</hi> And
therefore if by <hi>colour</hi> thereof, or any
former use (which is like enough)
the Courts <hi>did</hi> sit on lesser Festivals,
yet they <hi>never</hi> did it on the <hi>greater,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which (<hi>majoris cautelae gratiâ</hi>)
those <hi>Opera Servilia</hi> are <hi>there</hi> also
prohibited to be done on <hi>Easter-day,

               <p>Let us then see <hi>which</hi> are the greater
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55288:31"/>
Feasts, and by <hi>what</hi> merit they obtain
their <hi>privilege,</hi> that the Courts of Justice
sit not on them. As for <hi>Sunday,</hi> we
shall not need to speak of it, being
canonized by <hi>God</hi> himself. As for
<hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> we shall not
need to speak of them neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they fall not in the Terms:
Yet I find a <hi>Parliament</hi> held, at least
<hi>began</hi> on <hi>Whitsunday.</hi> But touching
Feasts in general, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that the <hi>Canonists,</hi> and such as
write<note n="a" place="margin">Vide <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raudi</hi> lib. 7. c. 1. n 31.</note> 
                  <hi>De Divinis Officiis,</hi> divide
them into two sorts, <hi>viz. Festa in

And they call them <hi>duplicia,</hi> or
double Feasts, for that <hi>all,</hi> or some
<hi>parts</hi> of the service, on those days
were begun <hi>Voce Duplici,</hi> that is, by
<hi>two</hi> singing-men; whereas on other
days all was done by <hi>one.</hi> Our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral</hi>
Churches do <hi>yet</hi> observe it:
And I mean not to stay upon it, for
you may see in the<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Durand.</hi> lib 7. Ca. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Rationale</hi> which
Feasts were of every of these kinds.
The <hi>ordinary</hi> Apostles were of the
last, and therefore our Courts made
<hi>bold</hi> with them: But the <hi>Purification,
Ascension,</hi> St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> with some
others that fall not in the Term, were
of the <hi>first,</hi> and because of <hi>this</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55288:31"/>
some <hi>other</hi> prerogatives were also
called, <hi>Festa Majora, Festa Principalia,
&amp; Dies novem Lectionum,</hi> ordinarily,
<hi>double Feasts, and Grand days.</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of them in an<note n="b" place="margin">

to the Bishops, to accurse all
and every of the perturbers of the
Church, <hi>&amp;C.</hi> every Sunday and Double
Feast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we must <hi>needs</hi> shew
why they were called <hi>Dies novem Lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum,</hi>
for <hi>so</hi> our old <hi>Rituale de Sarum,</hi>
styleth them, and therein lyeth their
greatest privilege. After the <hi>Arian</hi>
Heresie against the B, Trinity was by
the Fathers of that time most <hi>powerfully</hi>
confuted and suppressed, the Church
in memory of that most <hi>blessed</hi> victory,
and the <hi>better</hi> establishing of the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>
faith in that point, did ordain,
that upon divers Festival-days in the
year, a <hi>particular</hi> Lesson touching the
<hi>nature</hi> of the Trinity, besides the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
8. should be read in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
with rejoycing and thanksgiving
to God for suppressing that Heresie:
And for the <hi>greater</hi> solemnity, some
<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Bishop,</hi> or the <hi>chiefest</hi> Clergy-man
present did perform that duty. Thus
came these days to their styles afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,

                  <hi>Musick, Church-Service, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,

                     <hi>Grand days</hi> in England.</note> and our
own Grand-days, I see some <hi>difference</hi>
in accounting of them: <hi>Durandus</hi> in
his <hi>first</hi> Chapter, and <hi>seventh</hi> book
reckoneth the <hi>Purification, Ascension</hi>
and St <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to be <hi>Grand-days,</hi>
not mentioning <hi>All-Saints;</hi> but both
he in his <hi>34th.</hi> Chapter, and <hi>Belethus</hi>
in his—do call it <hi>Festum Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
&amp; Generale,</hi> being not onely
the Feast of <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
but of the <hi>Trinity, Angels</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55288:32"/>
as <hi>Durandus</hi> termeth it. And
that <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>duty Quod in singulis
valet, potentiùs valebit in conjunctis.</hi>
As for the Feast of <hi>All-Souls,</hi> neither
<hi>Durandus,</hi> nor <hi>Belethus,</hi> nor any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of those times (for they lived
above 400. years since) do record it
for a Festival. But my Country-man
<hi>Walsingham</hi> the Monk of St. <hi>Albans</hi>
sayth, that <hi>Simon</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> in the year 1328. at a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Council holden at <hi>London,</hi> did
ordain,<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Quòd die Parasceue &amp; in

he mistook it; for neither is it <hi>so</hi>
mention'd in <hi>Lindewood,</hi> reciting that
Canon, nor in the <hi>ancient</hi> Copy of
the Council it self, where the <hi>two</hi>
Feasts canonized by him are the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasceue</hi>
and the <hi>Conception of the Blessed
Virgin.</hi> Yet doubtless, whensoever
it was instituted it was a <hi>Great Feast</hi>
with <hi>us,</hi> though no where else. For
the old <hi>Primer Eboracensis Ecclesiae,</hi>
doth <hi>not</hi> onely set it down in the
Kalendar for a <hi>double</hi> Feast, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
for it the <hi>whole</hi> Service, with
the <hi>nine</hi> Lessons; for it is as a Feast
of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And though neither
the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. nor our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55288:33"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> at this day doth receive it;
yet being formerly a <hi>Vacation</hi>-day (as
it seemeth) our Judges <hi>still</hi> forbear
to sit upon it, and have not hitherto
made it a day in Court, though depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of Festival <hi>rites,</hi> and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graced with <hi>Robes,</hi> nor Feasting.</p>
               <p>The Feast also of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
on the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> was a <hi>Double</hi>
Feast,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Feast of St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul.</note> yet it is now become single, and
our Judges sit upon it. I confess I
have not found the reason, unless that
by <hi>Canonizing</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and so leaving
St. <hi>Peter</hi> single, we allow him <hi>no</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
above the <hi>other</hi> Apostles,
lest it should give colour for his
<hi>Primacy;</hi> for to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as one born
<hi>out</hi> of time, we allow <hi>no</hi> Festival, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. or
in the <hi>Almanacks</hi> and <hi>Kalendars</hi> of
our <hi>Church.</hi> And why St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath
it not is the more observable, for
that <hi>he</hi> not onely is deprived of the
ancient dignity of his <hi>Apostleship, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
to the Canons (as the other
are;) but of the privilege given him
in that place by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the
<hi>2d.</hi> in a <hi>Bull</hi> to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessour,</hi>
as being <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Paroch</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Other</hi> Festivals I enquire not after,
as of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> and the rest that

that I find it repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>

<hi>first</hi> part and <hi>foundation</hi> of our Laws,
commonly called <hi>the Laws of</hi> Edward
<hi>the</hi> Confessour, and Common Law.
Two other parts principally (as from

apparently. Though we and divers

persueth the <hi>Method, Phrase and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s <hi>Institutes</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> and <hi>how</hi> these several parts
were brought into our Common-Law
is neither easily nor definitively to be
expressed. Those no-doubt of the
<hi>Canon-Law</hi> by the prevalency of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> in their several Ages, those of
the <hi>Feodal</hi> by <hi>military</hi> Princes, at, and
shortly after the Conquest. And those
of <hi>Civil-Law</hi> by such of our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<hi>Judges</hi> and Sages of ancient time,
as for Justice and knowledge sake
sought instruction thence, when they
found no rule at home to guide their
Judgments by. For I suppose they
in those days judged many things,
<hi>ex aequo &amp; bono,</hi> and that their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
after as <hi>Responsa Prudentium</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Codex Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosianus</hi>
became <hi>Presidents</hi> of Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
posterity.</p>
               <p>As for the parts given unto Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
out of the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of
our Kings <hi>since</hi> the Conquest, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Magna Charta;</hi> I refer them (as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55288:42"/>
they properly belong) to our Statute
Law, though our <hi>Lawyers</hi> do reckon
them ordinarily for Common-Law.</p>
               <p>But among these various heads of
our Law, I deduce none from the
<hi>Scots,</hi> yet I confess that if those Laws
of theirs, which they ascribe to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm,</hi>
the Second, who lived about 60
years before the Conquest, be of that
antiquity, (which I cannot but que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
and that our Book called <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
be wholly in effect taken out of the
Book of <hi>their</hi> Law <hi>verbatim,</hi> for the
greatest part, called <hi>Regiam Majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
(for they pretend that to be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than our <hi>Glanvill;</hi> I <hi>must</hi> (I say)
ingenuously confess, that the greatest
part or portion of our Law is come
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which <hi>none</hi> I think ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
either in story or antiquities <hi>will</hi> or
<hi>can</hi> admit.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the point;
If my opinion be <hi>any</hi> thing, I think
the foundation of our Laws to be laid
by our <hi>German</hi> Anestours, but built
upon and polished by materials taken
from the Canon Law and Civil Law.
And under the <hi>capacious</hi> name of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
I not onely intend our <hi>Saxons,</hi>
but the ancient <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Saliques;</hi>
not excluding from that fraternity
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55288:43"/>
the <hi>Norwegians, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi>
And let it not more mislike us to take
our Laws from the noble <hi>Germans,</hi> a
<hi>principal</hi> People of <hi>Europe,</hi> than it did
the <hi>conquering Romans</hi> to take theirs
from <hi>Greece,</hi> or the <hi>learned Grecians</hi>
theirs from the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> It is not
credible that the <hi>Britains</hi> should be
the authours of them; or that their
Laws after so many transmutations of
people and government, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the expulsion (in a manner)
of their Nation, or at least of their
Nobility, Gentry and Freemen, the
abolishing of their Language, and the
cessation of all commerce with them,
should remain or be taken up by the
conquering enemy, who scarcely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<hi>one</hi> Town in a County to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as they named it, or one <hi>English</hi>
word almost, (that I yet have learned)
to creep into their Language. Admit
that much of their <hi>servile</hi> and <hi>base</hi>
people remained pleased perhaps as
well with their <hi>new</hi> Lords as with their
<hi>old;</hi> can we think that the <hi>Saxons</hi>
should take either Laws or Manners,
or form of Government from <hi>them?</hi>

affairs thereof, and some of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

his eldest Son</hi> Antonius <hi>for his wars
against the Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> conquer'd this
Land, they neither removed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
nor brought any Foreigners
upon them, other than (to govern
and keep them in obedience) some
Legions of Souldiers, and small Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Yet that they made an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their <hi>Laws,</hi> we may see in
the <hi>Scripture</hi> by the example of <hi>Judaea.</hi>
For though <hi>Pompey</hi> obtained the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
there, rather by the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> than by right of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55288:44"/>
                  <hi>Conquest,</hi> (and therefore suffer'd them
to enjoy their rites of Religion, with
the Liberties of most of their Cities;)
yet it being reduced into a <hi>Province</hi>
(as this of ours was) their <hi>Laws</hi> were
so changed, as that, by their own
confession, <hi>John 18. 31. it was not
lawfull for them to put any man to death.</hi>
Therefore our Saviour and the two
Thieves were judged, and suffer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Cross</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner,
not according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
(for <hi>their</hi> Law never inflicted the <hi>Cross</hi>
upon <hi>any</hi> offender) and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> wherewith they
charged Christ was <hi>stoning;</hi> and the
punishment of <hi>Theft</hi> a <hi>Quadruple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
or bondage in default there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
As for the stoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi>
it was not <hi>judicial</hi> but <hi>tumultuous,</hi>
an act of fury, and against Law: In
which course also they <hi>thought</hi> to have
murthered St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had not <hi>Lysias</hi>
prevented them, by sending him to
his legal trial before <hi>Caesar</hi>'s judgment
Seat.</p>
               <p>By this we may conceive how the
<hi>Romans</hi> dealt with the <hi>Britains</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Laws;</hi> and the story of Saint
<hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Amphybalus</hi> somewhat shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it: But what Laws soever the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55288:44"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> made in <hi>Britain,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi>
doubtless swept them all away, with
the <hi>Britains.</hi> There is certain proof
of it; for <hi>Antonius</hi> made a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
that <hi>all</hi> Nations under the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire should be called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and this was done when the
Northern People brake into the lower
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and made their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
there.</p>
               <p>But more plainly <hi>Seneca</hi> speaking
of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour's having
conquer'd this <hi>Island,</hi> as above;
<q>
                     <l>Jussit &amp; ipsum</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>old</hi> Inhabitants, whom they
expelled not but lived mingled with,
were <hi>still</hi> called <hi>Romans;</hi> as we see in
the ancient Laws of the <hi>Saliques,</hi> and
<hi>Burgundians,</hi> in <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> and others,
and their Laws distinguished by the
Titles of <hi>Lex Barbara,</hi> and <hi>Lex Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana.</hi>
But here in <hi>Britain</hi> after the
<hi>Saxons</hi> had conquer'd, we never hear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55288:45"/>
nor find any mention of <hi>Lex Romana,</hi>
or of any <hi>Roman:</hi> Which sheweth,
that both <hi>that,</hi> and the Laws of the

together, or that of the <hi>Romans</hi>
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that of the

               </p>
               <p>What the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> were,
it remains at this day to be seen by
a model of them in an ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of<note n="*" place="margin">These Laws were made by <hi>Hoel Dha</hi> King of <hi>Wales,</hi> about the year 940. and since the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Tract have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the world by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour himself, in the first Tome of his <hi>Concilia Britannica,</hi> pag. 408.</note>
