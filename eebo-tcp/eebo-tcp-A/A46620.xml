         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>MY Lords, For as much as the Moſt High God hath guided me with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, and that I have had no by-ends, but I have been ſincere for the good of Kings and Kingdom; therefore I deſire Your Lordſhips nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſpiſe me nor reject me. Let me be like <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs, to turn away a Curſe, for although <hi>Balaam</hi> was a Wiſe Man and a Prophet, yet he would have Curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might have been deſtroyed, to promote himſelf, and was ignorant of the Angel that ſtood to deſtroy him, had not the Aſs ſeen and turned aſide; ſo God made the Aſs an Inſtrument, to ſave his Maſter and prevent a Curſe: Let me I pray you be like this Aſs, for to turn away Wrath and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: for he has inveſted Your Lordſhips with Power, to take care of the Grandure of his Kingdom. And King <hi>David</hi> was wiſe when he came into Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bemoan the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and the reaſon why? becauſe he Clothed them with Scarlet and Gold, and other delicate things; ſo I ſee it is for the Kings Honour, as well as his Profit, for the Ladies to go in Rich Garments, for God made all the Treaſure of the Earth to adorn the Saints, and to incourage them to ſerve him, and while they do ſo, they are Bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>I was not willing <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods ſhould be Prohibited, becauſe it will make no Advantage to the Weaver, by reaſon it will twiſt about, ſo that it will be but our own-loſs, and other Peoples gain; and it is pity to lay any Tax, upon <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, for Trading is bad enough already, by reaſon Men ſaves their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſerve the Goverment, ſo they have the leſs for Trade.</p>
                  <p>I humbly beſeech Your Lordſhips ſeriouſly to conſider, the great Advantage there is by ſupporting of Juſtice, for ſhe ſupports the Kingdom, and if you let her fall, you will all fall; for no Man ſhall know what is his, for it is Juſtice that keeps you in Peace and ſafety: Therefore Our Bleſſed Saviour Exhorts, <hi>To do unto all Men, as you would have them do unto you, this is the Foundation of the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all Men is apt to ſay, that the Old Company hath been hardly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but I am apt to think it was through a miſtake; but now it is in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Power, to do them Right and Juſtice, and the God of Juſtice aſſiſt you, that you may be able to do that which is Juſt and Right in his ſight: For Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is hateful; therefore God hath forbid, that any Man ſhould covet what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man hath; and God is angry with them that breaks his Laws, and many a time a Kingdom is puniſhed for it, as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not withſtand their Adverſaries, neither would God fight their Battle, till the Offender was found out, that ſtole the Curſed things, the Silver, the Gold, and the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Garment: ſo <hi>Achan</hi> was ingenuous, for he confeſſed he had ſinned and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Puniſhment, and ſo the anger of the Lord ceaſed. I wiſh that the New Company may be ſo ingenious for the good of their own Souls, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Breach of Gods Laws, and eſpecially Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> becauſe he was the Head and Ringleader; I ſhould be glad if he would repent, and I do not doubt but that God will Pardon him, and all the reſt for I do not love Men ſhould bring Puniſhments upon their own Heads, but if they preſiſt in having their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and will not ſubmit to have their Money returned them, God will find out a way to Puniſh them as he has diſappointed their Expectations, in having five or ſix Cheſts filled with Billets for Silks; which I think ſhould be a means to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their Eyes to be weary of their Bargain, for they do not know what Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes they may have, for the Seas are dangerous, therefore there is a neceſſity to undoe what your Lordſhips have done, and in ſo doing you may do them good: For what harm can it be for them to have their Money, for to Trade in other things, that they may have a greater Bleſſing? And to have Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt enough, for they cannot complain they have injury done them: And to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Old <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, will be an act of Goodneſs, and Juſtice; and I do not doubt but that your Lordſhips will receive Honour by ſo doing; and there is ſome of the New ones that are wiſe and moderate, may do well to be United, and ſo the Old Company may be rightly Eſtabliſhed, which will be an Honour to the Kingdom; ſo it may be the occaſion of a happy Unity, and prevent Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt us, and the Generations that are to come, may praiſe you, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſuch an Example of Juſtice: And God may inable the Old ones to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the New ones, that are not joyned, ſo all Men may be pleaſed.</p>
