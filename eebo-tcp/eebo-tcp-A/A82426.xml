            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And it is hereby Enacted, That if any perſon or perſons ſhal endeavor to attempt by force of arms or otherwiſe, or be ayding, aſsiſting, comforting or abetting, unto any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall by any ways or means whatſoever, endeavor or attempt the reviving or ſetting up again of any pretended Right of the ſaid <hi>Charls,</hi> eldeſt Son to the ſaid late King, <hi>James</hi> called Duke of <hi>York,</hi> or of any other the Iſſue &amp; Poſterity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid late King, or of any perſon or perſons claiming under him or them, to the ſaid Regal Office, Stile, Dignity or Authority, or to be Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> or the promoting of any one perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to the Name, Stile, Dignity, Power, Prerogative or Authority, of King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions aforeſaid, or any of them; That then every ſuch offence ſhall be deemed and adjudged High Treaſon, and the offenders therein, their councellors, procurers, ayders &amp; abettors, being convicted of the ſaid Offence, or any of them, ſhall be deemed and adjudged Traytors againſt the Parliament and people of <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall ſuffer, loſe and forfeit, and have ſuch like and the ſame pains, forfeitures, judgements and execution, as is uſed in caſe of High Treaſon: And whereas by the abolition of the kingly Office provided for in this Act, a moſt happy way is made for this Nation (if God ſee it good) to return to its juſt &amp; ancient right, of being governed by its own Repreſentatives or National meetings in Councel, from time to time choſen &amp; entruſted for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the people, It is therefore Reſolved and Declared by the Commons aſſembled in Parliament, That they will put a period to the ſitting of this preſent Parliament, and diſſolve the ſame ſo ſoon as may poſſibly ſtand with the ſafety of the people that hath betruſted them, and with what is abſolutely neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and upholding the Government now ſetled in the way of a Commonwealth; and that they will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provide for the certain chuſing, meeting and ſitting of the next and future Repreſentatives, with ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances of freedom in choyce &amp; equality in diſtribution of Members to be elected thereunto, as ſhall moſt conduce to the laſting freedom and good of this Commonwealth: And it is hereby further Enacted and Declared, notwithſtanding any thing contained in this Act, no perſon or perſons of what condition and quality ſoever, within the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Iſlands of <hi>Guernſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> ſhall be diſcharged from the obedience and ſubjection which he and they owe to the Government of this Nation, as it is now Declared, but all and every of them ſhall in all things render and perform the ſame, as of right is due unto the ſupreme authority hereby declared to reſide in this and the ſucceſsive Repreſentatives of the people of this Nation, and in them onely.</p>
