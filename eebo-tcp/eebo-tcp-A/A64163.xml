         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
DEVIL
TVRN'D
ROVND HEAD,
OR,
PLUTO become a BROWNIST.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>DEMON</hi> having suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
viewed the Epede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
Spectacles of the
World, and withall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
men, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him in knavery, resolved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to equiparate them in emulation.
<pb facs="tcp:64292:3"/>
Yet notwithstanding there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sects, that <hi>Pluto</hi> himself knew not
which to elect to himself, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
unto. First, he began with the
<hi>Puritans,</hi> but they were all in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for beyond Sea, into new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
especially into <hi>New-England</hi>;
that he thought most of them were
safe enough under his tuition: then he
proceeded on with the <hi>Brownists,</hi> but
some were so employed in Barnes and
Stables, others (the Spirit moving them)
were so occupied among the holy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
that he likewise reputed them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in his own custody. Then thirdly,
he calumniously appropinquated to the
<hi>Round-heads,</hi> but they also were bufied
about Cheap-side Crosse, so that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
ennumerated all into his own
Catalogue: Till at length they became
so obstinate, that all the interest, which
before he presumed to challenge in
them, was totally oblitterated.</p>
            <p>Then he palpably began to sycophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
and in a parasiticall pretence sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb facs="tcp:64292:3"/>
to introduce them to his own
Satanicall opinions. Thus he began to
assimulate himself unto a <hi>Round-head,</hi>
and (like them) although he could not
swear, yet he could lie most damnably.
He did initiate with his <hi>Yea's</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily's</hi>
so conformably, as if he were a
perfect <hi>Round-head.</hi> Then he proceeded to
prune his horns, but he thought that
their horns were long enough and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
therefore in that apparent simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude:
secondly, he began to prune his
hair, and cut it so close to his skull, that
it seemed like the Characters of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdammian
print: thirdly, he began
to frequent the Woods, for he was sure
that he should finde many of them in
some hollow trees: fourthly, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conventicles for there he had some
confidence to meet the holy Brethren,
and Sisters together. Fifthly, he denied
the Book of Common-Prayer, because
he would be correspondent unto the
<hi>Roundheads</hi> in every particular degree.
But to have a more reciprocall affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="tcp:64292:4"/>
with them, he would exclude the
Bishops, and all those who were of the
Sacerdotall Function; as also, those who
were comonly called <hi>Cavaliers:</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
desired to be in the community of
the holy Sisters, to the fructification of
one another, and to their better edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Moreover, he conformed himself to
hate all good manners, all orders, rule,
Orthodoxe Divinitie, rule and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Common-wealth and
Church, for in their opinion they were
all superstition and Poperie; he denied
likewise, all good works, Academian
Learning, Charitie, and the publike Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for he
with them, conceived them all to be
Idolatry, prophanesse, and meer Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
He also confined himself to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the He and she Lecturers,
whose sanctifi'd Divinity in plain sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
is inspired from the holy spirit.
He moreover cropt his hair close to his
ears, that he might more easily hear the
blasphemy, which proceeded from
<pb facs="tcp:64292:4"/>
them, and he might increase a more
eager appetite of concupiscence at the
aspect of a younger Sister: And lastly,
that he might be in a perfect opposition
to the <hi>Cavalier.</hi> He loved the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the nose, because it was prone
to smell out the savour of some rich
Saints Feast: and that he might more
sincerely pronounce the holy Word. He
refused all good works; because he
knew them to be so invisible, that they
could neither be seen in this world, nor
known in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Thus the Divell in every respect did
assimulate himself to the absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of a <hi>Round-head,</hi> and became so
conformable in every Degree unto
them, that for his little Faith he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Really so to be. He seemed onely
to differ in this, for he broke his horns
and the <hi>Round-heads</hi> grew as long as
their ears. Thus we may perspicuously
conceive, the diffusive distraction in our
Church, and although Schisme abounds
in such a redundant superfluity; Yet
<pb facs="tcp:64292:5"/>
we hope the <hi>Parliament</hi> will judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider the same, and let the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Time suffer exemplary and
condign punishment, according to their demerits.</p>
