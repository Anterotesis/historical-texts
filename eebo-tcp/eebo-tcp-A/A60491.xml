            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat for neer two and thirty years ſince, untill within ſix years
laſt paſt, the Sea-works of <hi>Margate</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> were
maintained by Scots on the Houſes and Lands there, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with part of the benefits of the Peer (the ſaid peer being
a great and continuall cauſe of the devaſtation of the ſaid
works) which Scots were impoſed by the Commiſſioners of
Sewers, who then viewed and took care of the ſaid works; during all which
time, by the bleſſing of God, the ſaid Town was preſerved, and little or no
hurt done by the violence of the Sea.</p>
            <p>That about ſix years ſince, divers perſons whoſe eſtates lies more backward
from the Sea, and in leſſe danger; aiming more at their private ends, than
the publicke good, queſtioned the power of the Commiſſioners, alledging
the ſaid Seaworks were not in compaſſe of the Statute, on which their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was granted: whereupon the Commiſſioners wholly rejected the ſaid
workes: and ſince that time the Sea hath done above four thouſand pounds
worth of hurt there; and threatens the deſtruction of the Town. That at the
time of the rejecting of their charg of the works, your petitioner was Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
of the ſame works, &amp; had ſome eſtate there in houſing, did for ſafeguard
thereof, and the Town go on in repair of the ſaid works; towards which he
was forced to borrow two hundred pound upon his own band (for which he
ſtill paies uſe for) his Scot granted him by the Commiſſioners being deni'd to
be paid him; But after great charges upon the ſaid works, by the late violence
of the Sea, a great part of the Jetty-works were taken away for want of due
reparations, whereupon your petitioner, finding the burden in ſupportable for
himſelfe alone to undergo, &amp; conſidering what the miſerable event would be
if neglected, did gain a Certificate from the Maior and Jurats of <hi>Dover,</hi> under
the Town Seal (in whoſe juriſdiction <hi>Margate</hi> is) of the great danger the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48718:2"/>
ſaid Town was in, with a Petition ſubſcribed by many of the Inhabitants of
<hi>Margate,</hi> wherein was deſired Timber for the preſent making up of the ſaid
works, and a Scot as formerly continued; which Petition and Certificate was
preſented to the right honourable Committee of Admiralty &amp; Cinque Ports;
and thereupon an order was made &amp; directed to ſome Knights and Gentlmen
neer <hi>Margate</hi> to view the ſaid works, and to report the danger, and charge of
repair to that Committee, as by the Order annexed appears: who with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
workmen meaſured and caſt up the charge, and made report of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
as by the Report alſo appears: upon which report the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of the Admiralty (after along and chargeable attendance) made a further
Order: wherein they declared what they conceived fitting to be done therein.
And in regard the ſame works lay within the juriſdiction of the Sinque-Ports,
they thought fit to recommend the buſineſſe to both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
either to be by them confirmed, or otherwiſe ordered, as to their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
ſhould ſeem meet; as by that Order alſo appears. But by reaſon of the
Kingdomes more weighty buſineſſe, your Petitioner as yet hath had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order or redreſſe heerin, although the Sea hath done above five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
punds worth of hurt within four years paſt, though in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
and for theſe ſix years paſt, your Petitioner hath defended a great part
of the Town at his own charge, and expended the ſumme of four hundred
eighty pounds eighteen ſhillings and eight pence, as by a particular accompt
under the workmens hands appears; beſides his charges in ſoliciting of the
buſineſſe, amounting to above three hundred pounds, and in the neglect, loſſe
and hinderance of his trade, to at leaſt ſix hundred and fify pounds, without
any peny recompence; which will be to his ſudden ruine and deſtruction, if
not relieved by your Honours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe your honours to conſider of the premiſſes, and that a place of
ſuch conſequence where Embaſſadors and perſons of great quality take ſhiping,
and are landed, may not be quite overwhelmed, and the eſtate of your Petitioner,
and many others quite deſtroyed, and their wives, children and families ruined)
to be pleaſed ſpeedily to Order, that ſufficient Timber may be allowed, ſo as the
preſent breaches may be timely repaired, and for time to come upheld, by Scots on
the houſes and lands there, and by a poundage upon commodities exported and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from and to the ſaid Iſland; That the Peer Wardens may be yearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to the Maior and Jurats of <hi>Dover,</hi> for the money by them received
and expended about the ſame, a moiety of the overplus to be allowed yearly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſaid Works; and that your Petitioner may be ſpeedily ſatisfied his ſaid
disburſments about the ſaid Works.
And Your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</hi>

much in his eſtate (ſundry waies) by his long attending on his buſineſſe of

            <p>ON conſideration of a Petition preſented to this Committee, by <hi>John
Smith Expenditor</hi> for <hi>Margate</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> in
behalf of himſelf, and the Inhabitants, and owners of the houſes and lands
lying againſt the Sea at <hi>Margate</hi> aforefaid; the ſame ſetting forth the great
danger the ſaid Town is in of being carried to Sea, and the great loſſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
befallen the eſtates of many the Inhabitants; by the carrying of many of
their houſes already to Sea, through the decay of certain Jetty works hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made for defence thereof; and praying that Timber may be appointed
for repair of the ſame; as alſo that money may be raiſed for the perfecting
thereof, out of the arrears of a Scot of two ſhillings per pound, heretofore
charged upon the houſes and lands there; and of another Scot of thirty ſix
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48718:4"/>
pound <hi>per Annu.</hi> laid upon the Peer of <hi>Margate,</hi> by the Commiſſioners of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the Eaſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> about twenty five years ago, the paying thereof having
been for ſome years diſcontinued: and that for the future maintaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the ſaid Scots may be continued; or that in liew of a moiety of two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>per</hi> pound, reaſonable poundage may be ſet down upon certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
going in and out of the ſaid Iſland, a liſt of which commodities, and
of rates propoſed to be ſet upon them reſpectively was now preſented, and
upon reading a Certificate from ſome Gentlemen of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> to
whom the State thereof was referred by the Committee, to be viewed and
certified; they thereby ſetting forth, That the ſaid Jetty works, being by
them ſurveied, and workmen conſulted with; They found that fifty five
Rods of Timber-work is in decay, which requiring double work will take
up ſix hundred and five Tun of Oaken Timber, that the workmanſhip will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to as much or more charge, than the Timber; and there will need a
continuall charge to keep it for the future: And for that this Committee is
informed by ſome Members of both Houſes, that they have viewed the ſame,
and finde the defect and danger of the ſaid Town to be very great; and for as
much as the ſame is within the juriſdiction of the Cinque-Ports, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
doth thereby conceive it their duty to repreſent it to both Houſes of
Parliament, and doth recommend it to them, that the preſent defects may
be repaired, and ſufficient Timber for that end allowed; and that the Town
may in time to come be ſecured, by a Scot upon the ſaid Houſes and lands,
or by a poundage upon commodities exported and imported, from and to
the ſaid Iſland, or otherwiſe, as they in their wiſdomes ſhall think fit; as alſo
that conſideration may be had of the Petitioner <hi>John Smith,</hi> his disburſments
for the upholding of the ſaid works (which by his Petition is alledged to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto four hundred and twenty pounds) in ſuch a way as they ſhall
think meet; he having offer'd (as by the ſaid Certificate is mention'd, upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of a moiety of the ſaid Scot, &amp; of a poundage on the ſaid commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to perform the ſaid work (being firſt furniſhed with timber as aforeſaid)
and to engage an eſtate of a thouſand pound value to keep the ſame for ever.</p>
            <p>And it is laſtly Ordered, That a Copy of the ſaid Certificate and of the
Schedule of rates upon the ſaid commodities be annexed to this Report.</p>

1. That there was 55. rods of worke meaſured and found in decay, each

all double worke, it will take up in the whole 605. Tunns of Oaken Timber.</p>
