            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following <hi>Prayers</hi> for a <hi>Family</hi> being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to accompany the <hi>Scripture-Catechism,</hi> which I published soon after the <hi>Author</hi>'s Decease; It was thereupon desired by some Friends that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend these additional Prayers to you: And I could not but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Request, though the <hi>Author</hi>'s Name is sufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak their Acceptance.</p>
            <p>I gave a brief Character of that Excellent Person, in a <hi>Preface</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:33323:3"/>
the <hi>Catechism</hi>: And the little that is there said (which I need not tell those that knew him, he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserved, and a great deal more) is abundantly enough to invite all good People to the perusing of any of his Writings.</p>
            <p>And as to these <hi>Prayers,</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads them, must needs judge them well fitted for the Vse of Families: The more so, for their being for Substance penned in the Words and Sentences of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely-inspir'd Writers, which are the aptest of any to excite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and in this Respect they have the Advantage of all the Prayers that I have seen.</p>
            <p>This and other Instances of their <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Usefulness,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33323:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I might here insist upon; but I think it wholly needless, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing easily to be discerned by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reader.</p>
            <p>I will add a few Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>daily worshipping</hi> of God in our <hi>Families,</hi> which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear, having this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>This is a Duty very shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected in this loose Age. And no wonder it is so, by such as are irreligious, and can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live in gross Ignorance and the disacknowledgment of him <hi>in whom they live, move and have their Being.</hi> But that so many of those who are well instructed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon, and keep themselves from the more scandalous Pollutions of the
<pb facs="tcp:33323:4"/>
World, and make Conscience of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Publick Worship of God, and of Secret Prayer, should be able to satisfy themselves constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Neglect <hi>Family-Worship,</hi> is very unaccountable: Especially since not only pious People in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have so commended it by their Practice; but also, that nothing seems more clearly discoverable by <hi>Natural Light</hi> than that it is the paying of a most <hi>Reasonable</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and nothing doth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the begetting, keeping up, and encreasing a sense of Religion in Families, than <hi>this</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>In a Word, since the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence watcheth over <hi>Families</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> what serious Christian can doubt whether the Governours
<pb facs="tcp:33323:4"/>
of them are strictly obliged to call them every Day together; thankfully to acknowledge the daily care God takes of them, and the great Obligations he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heaps upon them; to make a penitent Confession of their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Offences against him, and to deprecate the Punishment deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them; and to put up hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petitions to the Throne of Grace, for the Continuance of those Spiritual and Temporal Blessings they enjoy, and a Supply of those they want?</p>
            <p>And that we may be more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally awakened to a Sense of this <hi>great Duty,</hi> as also that the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> and all other good Helps for the better Performance thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:33323:5"/>
which pious Persons have given those who stand in need of them, may have the <hi>Divine Blessing</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them, is the Hearty Prayer of,</p>
