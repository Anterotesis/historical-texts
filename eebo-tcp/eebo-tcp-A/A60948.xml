            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the interposal of my
Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the Publication of
this mean Discourse, may
seem so far to determine, as even to
take away, my Choice; yet I must own it
to the World, that it is solely and entirely
my own Inclination, seconded by my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to your Lordship, that makes
this, that was so lately an humble Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon your Lordships <hi>Consecration,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101750:3"/>
now ambitious to <hi>Consecrate</hi> it self with
your Lordships Name. It was my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to have lived in the same Colledge
with your Lordship, and now to belong to
the same Cathedral; where at present you
credit the Church as much by your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as you did the School former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by your Wit. Your Lordship even then
grew up into a constant Superiority above
others; and all your After-greatness,
seems but a Paraphrase upon those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
beginnings: for what soever you
<hi>are,</hi> or <hi>shall be,</hi> has been but an easie
Prognostick from what you <hi>were.</hi> It
is your Lordships Vnhappiness to be cast
upon an Age in which the Church is in its
Wane, and if you do not those glorious
things that our English Prelates did two
or three hundred Years since; it is not
because your Lordship is at all less than
they, but because the Times are worse.
Witness those magnificent Buildings in
<pb facs="tcp:101750:3"/>
               <hi>Christ Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> begun and
carried on by your Lordship; when by your
Place you governed, and by your Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
encreased the Treasure of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and, which must eternally set your
Fame above the reach of Envy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
these great Structures you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
at a time when you returned
Poor and bare, to a Colledge as bare, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long Persecution, and before you
had laid so much as one Stone in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
of your own Fortunes: By which
incomparably high and generous underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
you have shewn the World how fit a
Person you were to build upon <hi>Wolseys</hi>
foundation: A Prelate, whose Noble
design you Imitate, and whose mind you
Equal. Briefly, That <hi>Christ-Church</hi>
stands so high above-ground, and that
the Church of <hi>Westminster</hi> lies not flat
upon it, is your Lordships Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore your Lordship is not
<pb facs="tcp:101750:4"/>
behind hand with the Church, paying it as
much Credit and Support; as you receive
from it; for you owe your Promotion to
your Merit, and, I am sure, your Merit
to your Self. All men Court you, not so
much because a great Person, as a Publick
good. For, as a Friend, there is none so
hearty, so Nobly warm and active to
make good all the Offices of that endearing
Relation: As a Patron, none <hi>more able</hi>
to oblige and reward your Dependants;
and, which is the Crowning Ornament of
Power, none <hi>more willing.</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as a Diocesan, you are like even to
out-do your self in all other Capacities;
and, in a word, to exemplifie and realize
every Word of the following Discourse;
which is here most humbly and gratefully
presented to your Lordship, by</p>

Preached at

Upon the Consecration of the Right

D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> JOHN DOLBEN
Lord Bishop of

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 Titus, last Verse.</bibl>
               <q>These things Speak and Exhort, and Rebuke with
all Authority; let no man Despise thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may possibly be expected,
that the very taking of my
Text out of this Epistle to
<hi>Titus</hi> may engage me in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
about the Nature, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and Divine Right of Episcopacy; and
if it should, it were no more, then what some
of the greatest, and the learned'st persons in
the world (when men served Truth instead
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101750:5"/>
of Design) had done before: For, I must
profess that I cannot look upon <hi>Titus</hi> as so far
<hi>Vnbishopt</hi> yet, but that he still exhibits to us all
the Essentials of that Jurisdiction that to this
day is claimed for Episcopal. We are told in
the fifth Verse of the first Chapter, <hi>That he
was left in</hi> Crete <hi>to set things in order, and to
ordain Elders in every City;</hi> which Text one
would think were sufficiently clear and full,
and too big with Evidence to be perverted;
but when we have seen Rebellion commented
out of the thirteenth of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and since
there are few things but admit of Gloss and
probability, and consequently may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
as well as disputed on both sides; it
is no such wonder, that some would bear the
world in hand, that the Apostles design and
meaning is for Presbytery, though his words
are all the time for Episcopacy; No wonder, I
say, to us at least, who have conversed with
too many strange unparallel'd Actions, Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and Events, now to wonder at any thing;
Wonder is from Surprize; and Surprize ceases
upon Experience.</p>
            <p>I am not so much a Friend to the stale
Starched Formality of Preambles, as to detain
so great an Audience with any praevious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
extrinsick to the Subject matter and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101750:5"/>
design of the Text; and therefore I shall fall
directly upon the Words, which run in the
form of an Exhortation, though in appearance
a very strange one; for the matter of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
should be something naturally in the
Power of him to whom the Exhortation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
For no man exhorts another to be
strong, beautiful, witty, or the like; these are
the felicities of some Conditions, the objects of
more Wishes, but the effects of no mans
Choice. Nor seems there any greater reason
for the Apostles exhorting <hi>Titus, That no man
should despise him;</hi> for how could another
mans Action be his Duty? Was it in his
power that men should not be wicked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious?
and if such persons would despise
him, could any thing pass an obligation upon
him not to be despised? No, this cannot be
the meaning; and therefore it is clear, that the
Exhortation lies not against the Action it self,
which is onely in the Despisers power; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the just occasion of it, which is in the
will and power of him that is Despised; it was
not in <hi>Titus</hi>'s power that men should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
him, but it was in his power to bereave
them of all just cause of doing so; it was not in
his power not to be Derided, but 'twas in his
power not to be Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101750:6"/>In all this Epistle it is evident that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
looks upon <hi>Titus</hi> as advanced to the dignity of
a prime Ruler of the Church, and entrusted
with a large Diocess, containing many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cities under the immediate Government of
their respective Elders; and those deriving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from his Ordination, as was specified
in the fifth Verse of the first Chapter. And now
looking upon <hi>Titus</hi> under this Qualification, he
addresses a long Advice and Instruction to
him, for the discharge of so important a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
all along the first and second Chapter:
but summs up all in this last Verse, which is the
subject of the ensuing Discourse, and contains in
it these two things.</p>
            <p>1. An account of the Duties of his Place or
Office.</p>
            <p>2. Of the means to facilitate and make ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
their Execution.</p>
            <p>The Duties of his place were two. 1. To
<hi>Teach.</hi> 2. To <hi>Rule.</hi> Both comprized in these
words; <hi>These things speak and exhort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
with all Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, the means, the onely means to
make him Successful, Bright and Victorious in
the performance of these great works, was to
be above Contempt, to shine like the Baptist,
with a clear, and a triumphant Light. In a word
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101750:6"/>
it is every Bishops duty to <hi>Teach,</hi> and to <hi>Govern;</hi>
and his way to do it, is <hi>not to be despised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will discourse of each respectively in
their Order.</p>
            <p>1. And first, for the first branch of the great
work incumbent upon a Church Ruler, which
is <hi>to Teach.</hi> A work that none is too great or
too high for: it is a work of Charity, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is the work of Heaven, which is always lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self out upon the Needy, and the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
nay, and it is a work of the highest and
the noblest Charity; for he that teacheth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
gives an Almes to his soul, he cloathes the
nakedness of his Understanding, and relieves
the wants of his impoverished Reason: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that governs well, leads the Blind; but he
that teaches him, gives him Eyes; and it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thing to have been the Recoverer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer
of a decayed Intellect, and a Sub-worker
to Grace, in freeing it from some of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of Original sin. It is a Benefaction
that gives a man a kind of Prerogative: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the common Dialect of the world, every
<hi>Teacher</hi> is called a <hi>Master:</hi> it is the property of
Instruction to descend, and upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it supposes him, that instructs, the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
or at least makes him so.</p>
            <p>To say a man is advanced too high to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101750:7"/>
to teach the Ignorant, is as much as to say,
that the Sun is in too high a place to shine upon
what is below him. The <hi>Sun</hi> is said <hi>to rule the
day,</hi> and the <hi>Moon to rule the night:</hi> but do they
not <hi>Rule</hi> them onely by enlighting them?
Doctrine is that, that must prepare men for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline;
and men never go on so cheerfully,
as when they see where they goe.</p>
            <p>Nor is the dullness of the Scholar to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
but rather to enflame the charity of the
Teacher: for since it is not in men as in vessels,
that the smallest capacity is the soonest filled;
where the labour is doubled, the value of the
work is enhaunced; for it is a sowing where a
man never expects to reap any thing but the
Comfort and Conscience of having done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously.
And yet we know moreover, that God
sometimes converts even the dull and the slow,
turning <hi>very Stones</hi> into <hi>Sons of Abraham;</hi>
where, besides that the difficulty of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
advances the Trophee of the Conquerer;
it often falls out, that the backward Learner
makes amends another way, recompencing <hi>Sure</hi>
for <hi>Suddain,</hi> and expiating his want of Docility
with a deeper and a more rooted Sincerity.
Which alone were argument sufficient to inforce
the Apostles injunction of being <hi>instant in season
and out of season;</hi> even upon the highest and

most exalted Ruler in the Church. He that sits
in Moses chair, sits there to Instruct as well as to
Rule: and a Generals office engages him to Lead
as well as to Command his Army. In the first of
<hi>Ecclesiastes, Solomon</hi> represents himself both as
<hi>Preacher</hi> and <hi>King of Israel:</hi> and every soul that
a Bishop gains, is a new accession to the extent
of his Power; he preaches his Jurisdiction wider,
and enlarges his spiritual Diocess, as he enlarges
mens apprehensions.</p>
            <p>The Preaching part indeed of a <hi>Romish</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
is easie enough, whose Grand business is
onely to teach men to be Ignorant, to instruct
them how to know Nothing, or, which is all one,
to know upon Trust, to believe implicitly, and
in a word, to see with other mens eyes, till they
come to be lost in their own souls. But our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is a Religion that dares to be understood;
that offers it self to the search of the Inquisitive,
to the inspection of the severest and the most
awakened Reason: for being secure of her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Truth and Purity, she knows that for
her to be seen and look into, is to be embraced
and admired: as there needs no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for men to love the light then to see it:
It needs no Legends, no Service in an unknown
tongue, no inquisition against Scripture, no
purging out of the heart and sence of Authors,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101750:8"/>
no altering or bribing the voice of Antiquity to
speak for it; it needs none of all these laborious
Artifices of ignorance; none of all these cloaks
and coverings. The <hi>Romish</hi> faith indeed must be
covered, or it cannot be kept warm; and their
Clergy deal with their Religion as with a great
Crime; if it is Discovered they are undone. But
there is no Bishop of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but
accounts it his Interest, as well as his Duty to
comply with this Precept of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Titus, These things teach and exhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Teaching may be effected two ways;
<list>
                  <item>1. Immediately by himself.</item>
                  <item>2. Mediately by others.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And first <hi>immediately</hi> by himself. Where
God gives a Talent, the Episcopal Robe can be
no Napkin to hide it in. Change of Condition
changes not the abilities of Nature, but makes
them more illustrious in their exercise; and the
Episcopal dignity added to a good Preaching
faculty, is like the erecting of a stately Fountain
upon a Spring, which still, for all that, remains as
much a Spring as it was before, and flows as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
onely it flows with the circumstance of
greater State and Magnificence, Height of place
is intended onely to stamp the endowments of
a private condition with Lustre and Authority:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101750:8"/>
And thanks be to God, neither the Churches
profess'd enemies, nor her pretended friends have
any cause to asperse her in this respect, as having
over her such Bishops, as are able to silence the
Factious, no less by their Preaching, then by
their Authority.</p>
            <p>But then on the other hand, let me add also,
that this is not so absolutely necessary, as to be of
the vitall Constitution of this Function. He may
<hi>teach</hi> his Diocess who ceases to be able to
<hi>preach</hi> to it: for he may do it by appointing
Teachers, and by a vigilant exacting from them
the care and the instruction of their respective
Flocks. He is the Spiritual father of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
and a Father may see his Children taught,
though he himself does not turn Schoolmaster.
It is not the gift of every Person, nor of every
Age, to harangue the multitude, to Voice it high
and loud, <hi>&amp; Dominari in Concionibus.</hi> And since
Experience fits for government, and Age usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brings experience, perhaps the most Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
years are the least Preaching years. In the</p>
            <p>2. Second place therefore, there is a teaching
<hi>Mediately,</hi> by the Subordinate ministration of
others; in which, since the Action of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
agent is upon all grounds of Reason to
be ascribed to the Principal, He that ordains and
furnishes all his Churches with able Preachers,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101750:9"/>
is an Universal Teacher, he instructs, where he
cannot be Present, he speaks in every mouth of
his Diocess, and every Congregation of it every
Sunday feels his Influence, though it hears not
his Voice. That Master deprives not his Family
of their food, who orders a faithful Steward to
dispence it. Teaching is not a Flow of Words,
nor the Draining of an Hour-glass, but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
procuring, that a man comes to know
something that he knew not before, or to know
it better. And therefore Eloquence and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of speech is to a Church Governour, as
<hi>Tully</hi> said it was to a Philosopher, <hi>Si afferatur
non repudianda, si absit non magnoperè desideranda:</hi>
and to find fault with such an one for not being
a Popular Speaker, is to blame a Painter for not
being a good Musician.</p>
            <p>To Teach indeed, must be confest his Duty;
but then there is a Teaching by Example, by
Authority, by restraining Seducers, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the Hindrances of knowledge. And a
Bishop does his Church, his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
more Service by ruling other mens Tongues,
then he can by imploying his own. And thus
much for the first Branch of the great Work
belonging to a Pastor of the Church, which was
to <hi>Teach</hi> and to <hi>Exhort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second is to <hi>Rule,</hi> Expressed in these
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101750:9"/>
words; <hi>Rebuke with all Authority.</hi> By which I
doubt not, but the Apostle principally intends
Church-censures, and so the Words are a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy
of the Part for the whole, giving an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in Ecclesiastical Censures, instead of all
other Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. A Jurisdiction,
which in the Essentials of it is as old as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
and even in those Circumstantial additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of secular Encouragement, with which the
Piety and Wisdom of Christian Princes alwayes
thought necessary to support it, against the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
of the injurious World, much
Older, and more Venerable, then any Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that has divested the Church of it.</p>
            <p>But to speak directly to the Thing before us;
We see here the great Apostle employing the
utmost of his Authority in commanding <hi>Titus</hi>
to use his: and what he said to Him, he says to
every Christian Bishop after him, <hi>Rebuke with
all Authority.</hi> This Authority, is a Spiritual
Sword put into the hands of every Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and God put not this Sword into his hands,
with an intent that he should keep it there for
no other purpose, but onely for Fashion-sake,
as men use to wear one by their sides. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is an Art above the Attainment of an
ordinary Genius, and requires a wider, a larger;
and a more Comprehending Soul than God has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101750:10"/>
put into every Body. The Spirit that animates
and acts the Universe, is a Spirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that Ruler that is possessed of it, is
the Substitute and Vicegerent of Providence,
whether in Church or State. Every Bishop is
Gods Curate. Now the Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Contains in it these three parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. An Exaction of Duty from the Persons
placed under it.</item>
               <item>2. A Protection of them in the performance
of their Duty.</item>
               <item>3. Coercion and Animadversion upon such
as neglect it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All which are in their
Proportion, ingredients of that Government that
we call <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. And first it implies Exaction of Duty
from the Persons placed under it: for it is both
to be confessed and lamented, that men are
not so ready to Offer it, where it is not exacted:
Otherwise, what means the Service of the
Church so imperfectly, and by halves read over,
and that by many who profess a Conformity to
the Rules of the Church? What makes them
mince and mangle that in their Practise, which
they could swallow whole in their Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Why are the Publick Prayers curtail'd and
left out, Prayers composed with Sobriety, and
injoyned with Authority, onely to make the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101750:10"/>
more Room for a long, crude, impertinent, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
Harangue before the Sermon?</p>
            <p>Such persons seem to Conform (a Word
whose signification they never make good) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they may despise the Churches Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under the Churches Wing, and Contemn
Authority within the Protection of the Laws.
Duty is but another <hi>English</hi> Word for Debt,
and God knows, that it is well if men pay their
Debts when they are call'd upon. But if Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
do not remind men of, and call them
to Obedience, they will find that it will never
come as a <hi>Free-will-offering,</hi> no, not from <hi>many
who even serve</hi> at the <hi>Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Government imports a Protection, and
Encouragement of the Persons under it, in the
Discharge of their Duty. It is not for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to frown upon, and brow-beat those
who are hearty and exact in the management
of their Ministry; and with a Grave insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Nodd, to call a well Regulated, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Zeal, <hi>Want of Prudence</hi> and <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Such Discouraging of men in the ways of
an Active Conformity to the Churches Rules, is
that, that will crack the Sinews of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for it weakens the Hands, and Damps
the Spirits of the Obedient. And if onely
Scorn and Rebuke shall attend men for assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101750:11"/>
the Churches Dignity, and <hi>taxing the
murder of Kings,</hi> and the like: Many will
choose rather to neglect their Duty safely and
creditably, then to get a Broken Pate in the
Churches Service, onely to be rewarded with
that, that shall <hi>Break</hi> their Hearts too.</p>
            <p>3. The third thing implyed in Government,
is Coercion and Animadversion upon such as
neglect their Duty. Without which Coercive
Power, all government is but Toothless and
Precarious, and does not so much command, as
beg obedience. Nothing, I confess is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Christian, of what Degree soever, then
Meekness, Candor and Condescension; but they
are Vertues that have their proper Sphere and
Season to act and shew themselves in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not to interfere with others, Different
indeed in their Nature, but altogether as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in their Use. And when an insolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiser
of Discipline, nurtur'd into Impudence
and Contempt of all Order, by a long Risk
of Licence and Rebellion, shall appear before a
Church governour, Severity and Resolution are
that Governours Vertues, and Justice it self
is his Mercy; for by making such an one an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
(as much as in him lies) he will either
Cure <hi>him,</hi> or at least Preserve <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were indeed the Consciences of men, as they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101750:11"/>
should be, the Censures of the Church, might
be a sufficient Coercion upon them; but being,
as most of them now a days are, Hell and
Damnation-proof, her bare Anathema's fall
but like so many <hi>Bruta fulmina</hi> upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and Schismatical: who are like to think
themselves shrewdly hurt, by being cut off from
that Body, which they choose not to be of; and
so being punished into a Quiet enjoyment of
their beloved Separation. Some will by no
means allow the Church any further power then
onely to <hi>Exhort</hi> and to <hi>Advise,</hi> and this but
with a Proviso too, that it extends not to such
as think themselves too Wise, and too Great to
be Advised: according to the Hypothesis of
which persons, the Authority of the Church,
and the obliging force of all Church Sanctions,
can bespeak men onely thus; <hi>These and these
things it is your Duty to do, and if you will not
do them, you may as well let them alone.</hi> A strict
and efficacious Constitution indeed, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests
the Church with no power at all, but
where men will be so Civil as to obey it, and so
at the same Time pay it a Duty, and do it a
Courtesie too.</p>
            <p>But when in the Judgement of some men,
the Spiritual Function as Such, must render a
Churchman, though otherwise never so Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101750:12"/>
and qualified; yet meerly because he is a
Church-man, unfit to be intrusted by his Prince
with a share of that Power and Jurisdiction,
which in many Circumstances his Prince has
judged but too necessary, to secure the Affairs
and Dignity of the Church; and which, every
thriving Grasier can think himself but ill dealt
with, if within his own Countrey he is not
mounted to: It is a sign, that such discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Persons intend not that Religion shall advise
them upon any other Terms, then that they may
Ride and Govern their Religion.</p>
            <p>But surely all our Kings, and our Parliaments,
understood well enough what they did, when
they thought fit to prop and fortifie the Spiritual
Order with some Power that was Temporal;
and such is the present state of the World, in
the judgment of any observing Eye; that, if the
Bishop has no other defensives but Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
no other power but that of the Keys,
he may, for any notable effect that he is like to
do upon the factious and contumacious, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
up his Pastoral Staff, shut up the Church,
and put those Keys under the Door.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavored to show the
Three things included in the general Nature of
Government; but, to prescribe the manner of
it in Particular, is neither in my Power nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101750:12"/>
onely, I suppose, the Common
Theory and Speculation of things, is free and
open to any one whom God has sent into the
world with an ability to contemplate, and by
continuing him in the World, gives him also
opportunity. In all that has been said, I do not
in the least pretend to Advise, or Chalk out
Rules to my Superiors; for some men cannot
be Fools with so good acceptance as others. But
whosoever is call'd to speak upon a certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
may, I conceive, without offence take
any Text sutable to that occasion; and having
taken it, may, or at least ought to speak sutably
to that Text.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the second thing proposed
from the Words, which is the Means assigned
for the Discharge of the Duties mentioned, and
exhibited under this one short Prescription, <hi>Let
no man despise thee:</hi> In the handling of which I
shall shew,</p>
            <p>1. The ill effects and destructive Influence
that Contempt has upon Government.</p>
            <p>2. The groundless Causes upon which
Church-Rulers are frequently despised.</p>
            <p>3. And lastly, the just Causes that would
render them, or indeed any other Rulers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be despised. All which being clearly
made out, and impartially laid before our eyes,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101750:13"/>
it will be easie and obvious for every one, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
the Evil so markt out, to answer and
come up to the Apostles Exhortation.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And first we will discourse of Contempt, and
the maligne hostile Influence it has upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
As for the thing it self, every mans
Experience will inform him, that there is no
Action in the Behaviour of one man towards
another, of which humane Nature is more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
than of Contempt; It being a thing
made up of these two Ingredients, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of a Man upon a belief of his utter Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
and Inability, and a Spightful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to engage the rest of the World in the
same Belief, and slight Esteem of him. So
that the immediate Design of Contempt, is
the shame of the Person contemned; and
Shame is a Banishment of him from the good
Opinion of the World, which every man
most earnestly Desires, both upon a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Nature and of Interest. For it is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to all men to affect a good Name; &amp; he that
despises a man, Libels him in his Thoughts,
Reviles and Traduces him in his Judgement.
And there is also Interest in the Case: For a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be well thought of, directly Resolves it
self into that owned and mighty Principle
of self-Preservation: For as much as Thoughts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101750:13"/>
are the first wheels and motives of Action;
and there is no long passage from one to
the other. He that Thinks a man to the ground,
will quickly endeavour to Lay him there:
for while he Despises him, he Arraigns and
Condemns him in his Heart; and all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Bitterness and Cruelties of his Practices,
are but the Executioners of the Sentence
passed before upon him by his Judgement.
Contempt, like the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> has first
an ill Aspect, and then a destroying Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>By all which I suppose, it is sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
how Noxious it must needs be to every
Governour: for, can a man respect the Person
whom he Despises? and can there be Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
where there is not so much as Respect?
will the Knee bend, while the Heart Insults?
and the Actions Submit, while the Aprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Rebel? And therefore the most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Disturbers and Underminers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
have always laid their first Train
in Contempt, endeavouring to blow it up in
the Judgement and Esteem of the Subject.
And was not this method observed in the
late most flourishing and succesful Rebellion?
for how studiously did they lay about them,
both from the Pulpit and the Press, to cast a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101750:14"/>
slurr upon the Kings Person, and to bring his
governing Abilities under a Disrepute? and
then, after they had sufficiently Blasted him in
his <hi>Personal</hi> Capacity, they found it easie
Work to dash and overthrow him in his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reputation is Power: and consequently to
Despise is to Weaken. For where there is
Contempt, there can be no Awe; and where
there is no Awe, there will be no Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if there is no Subjection, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
without the help of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormer Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Politick Capacity, to imagine how
a Prince can be a Governour. He that makes
his Prince despised and undervalued, blows a
Trumpet against him in mens Breasts, beats
him out of his Subjects hearts, and fights him
out of their Affections; and after this, he
may easily strip him of his other Garrisons,
having already dispossest him of his strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
by dismantling him of his Honour, and
seising his Reputation.</p>
            <p>Nor is, what has been said of Princes, less
true of all other Governours, form Highest to
Lowest, from him that Heads an Army, to
him that is but Master of a Family, or of
one single Servant; the formal Reason of a
thing equally extending it self to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101750:14"/>
of the same kind. It is a Proposition
of Eternal Verity, that None can Govern
while he is Despised. We may as well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there may be a King without Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
a Supreme without Soveraignty. It is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
and a Direct contradiction in Practise:
for, where Contempt takes place, the very
Causes and Capacities of Government cease.</p>
            <p>Men are so farr form being Governed by a
despised Person, that they will not so much
as be taught by Him. Truth it self shall lose
its Credit, if Delivered by a Person that has
none. As on the Contrary, be but a Person
in Vogue and Credit with the Multitude, he
shall be able to commend and set off whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he says, to authorize any Nonsence, and
to make Popular rambling incoherent Stuff,
seasoned with Twang and Tautology, pass
for high Rhetorick and <hi>moving Preaching;</hi>
such indeed, as a Zealous Tradesman would
even <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>Dye under.</hi> And now I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it is no ill Topick of Argumentation, to
shew the Prevalence of Contempt, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Influences of Respect; which, thus (as
it were) Dubbs, every little, pettit Admired
person, Lord and Commander of all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers.
And certain it is, that the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as well as the Civil Governour, has cause to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101750:15"/>
pursue the same Methods of Securing and
Confirming himself; the grounds and means
of Government being founded upon the same
bottom of Nature in both, though the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and Relative Considerations of the
Persons may differ. And I have nothing to
say more upon this Head, but that, if Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are called upon to Discharge the parts
of Governours, they may with the highest
Reason expect those Supports and Helps that
are indispensably Requisite thereunto: and that
those men are but Trapann'd, who are called
to Govern, being invested with Authority, but
bereaved of Power; which according to a true
and plain Estimate of things, is nothing else
but to mock and betray them into a Splendid
and Magisterial way of being Ridiculous.
And thus much for the ill Effects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Influence that Contempt has upon
Government: I pass now to the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Thing, which is to shew the Groundless
Causes, upon which Church-Rulers are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Despised.</p>
            <p>Concerning which, I shall premise this;
That nothing can be a reasonable Ground of
Despising a man, but some Fault or other
chargeable upon him; and nothing can be a
Fault that is not Naturally in a mans power
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101750:15"/>
to prevent; Otherwise, it is a mans Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Mischance or Calamity, but not his
Fault. Nothing can justly be Despised, that
cannot justly be Blamed; and it is a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule in Reason and moral Philosophy,
That where there is no Choice, there can be
no Blame.</p>
            <p>This premised, we may take notice of
two usual grounds of the Contempt men cast
upon the Clergy, and yet for which no man
ought to think himself at all the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be Contemned.</p>
            <p>1. The first is their very Profession it self;
Concerning which, it is a sad, but an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Truth, that the Names derived from
it, in the refined Language of the present Age,
are made but the Appellatives of Scorn. This
is not charged Universally upon all, but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will Affirm, or rather proclaim it of
much the greater part of the World; and
men must perswade us that we have lost our
Hearing, and our common Sence, before we
can believe the Contrary. But surely the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and Foundation of this Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Persons set apart for the Service of God,
that this very Relation should entitle them to
such a peculiar Scorn, can be nothing else but
Atheisme; the growing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rampant Sin of the
Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:101750:16"/>For call a man Oppressor, griping, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
or over-reaching person, and the Word
indeed being ill befriended by Custom, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
sounds not well; but generally, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Hearer, it signifies no more,
then, that such an one is a Wise, and a Thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or in the common Phrase, a <hi>Notable
man;</hi> which will certainly procure him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
And say of another, that he is an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
a Loose or a Vicious man; and it leaves
in men no other Opinion of him, then that
he is a Merry, a Pleasant, and a Gentile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and that, he that taxes him, is but a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
an <hi>Vnexperienced,</hi> and a <hi>Morose fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi>
one that does not <hi>know men,</hi> nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what it is to <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
But call a man <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Parson,</hi> and you set
him, in some mens Esteem, ten degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his own Servant.</p>
            <p>But let us not be Discouraged, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,
either with our Selves, or our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
upon this account. Let the Vertuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so's
Mock, Insult, and Despise on: yet after
all, they shall never be able to Droll away
the Nature of things; to trample a Pearl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Pebble, nor to make Sacred things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
any more, then themselves, by such
speeches Honourable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101750:16"/>2. Another groundless Cause of some mens
despising the Governours of our Church, is their
loss of that former Grandeur, and Priviledge
that they enjoyed. But it is no real Disgrace
to the Church meerly to lose her Priviledges,
but to forfeit them by her Fault, or Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
of which she is not Conscious. Whatsoever
she injoyed in this kind, she readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
to have streamed from the Royal
Munificence, and the favours of the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
shining upon the Spiritual; which Favours
the same Power may retract and gather back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it self when it pleases. And we Envy not the
Greatness and Lustre of the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Scarlet Gowns, nor their Scarlet Sins.
If our Church cannot be Great, which is better,
she can be Humble, and content to be Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into as low a Condition, as men for their
own private Advantage would have her; who
wisely tell her, that it is best and safest for her
to be without any Power, or Temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
like the good Physician, who out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
to his Patient, lest he should hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by Drinking, was so kind as to rob him of
his silver Cup. The Church of <hi>England</hi> Glories
in nothing more, then that she is the truest Friend
to Kings, and to Kingly Government of any
other Church in the World, that they were the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101750:17"/>
same Hands and Principles that took the Crown
from the Kings Head, and the Mitre from the
Bishops. It is indeed the Happiness of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
and Callings, that they can equally
square themselves to, and thrive under all Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Government; but the Clergy of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
neither know nor affect that Happiness;
and are willing to be Despised for not doing so.
And so farr is our Church from encroaching
upon the Civil Power; as some who are Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends
to both, would maliciously Insinuate,
that were it stript of the very Remainder of
its Priviledges, and made as like the Primitive
Church for its Bareness, as it is already for its
Purity; it could <hi>Cheerfully,</hi> and, what is more,
<hi>Loyally,</hi> want all such Priviledges; and in the
want of them pray heartily, that the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may flourish as much, and stand as secure
from the Assaults of Fanatick, Antimonarchicall
Principles, grown to such a dreadful height, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Churches late Confusions, as it stood
while the Church enjoyed those Priviledges.
And thus much for the two <hi>groundless Causes</hi>
upon which Church Rulers are frequently De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.
I descend now to the</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and Last thing, which is to show those
<hi>just Causes,</hi> that would render them, or indeed
any other Rulers worthy to be Despised. Many
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101750:17"/>
might be Assigned, but I shall pitch only upon
Four; in Discoursing of which, rather the Time,
then the Subject will force me to be very Brief.</p>
            <p>1. And the first is <hi>Ignorance.</hi> We know how
great an Absurdity our Saviour accounted it, for
the Blind to lead the Blind, and to put him that
cannot so much as See, to discharge the Office of
a Watch. Nothing more exposes to Contempt
then <hi>Ignorance.</hi> When <hi>Sampsons</hi> eyes were out,
of a publick Magistrate, he was made a publick
Sport. And when <hi>Eli</hi> was blind, we know how
well he Governed his Sons, and how well they
Governed the Church under him. But now the
Blindness of the Understanding is Greater and
more Scandalous; especially, in such a seeing
Age as Ours; in which the very Knowledge of
former times, passes but for Ignorance in a better
Dresse: an Age that flies at all Learning, and
enquires into every thing, but especially, into
Faults and Defects. Ignorance indeed, so farr
as it may be Resolved into Natural inability, is,
as to men, at least, Inculpable, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not the Object of Scorn, but Pity: but in
a Governour, it cannot be without the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the highest Impudence; For who bid
such an one Aspire to <hi>Teach,</hi> and to <hi>Govern?</hi>
A blind man sitting in the Chimney-corner is
pardonable enough, but sitting at the Helme he
is Intolerable. If men will be Ignorant and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101750:18"/>
let them be so in Private and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and not set their Defects in an high
Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make them Visible and Conspicuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If Owls will not be hooted at, let them keep
close within the Tree, and not Perch upon the
upper Bowes.</p>
            <p>2. A Second thing that makes a Governor
justly despised, is Viciousnes and ill Morals.
Vertue is that, that must Tipp the Preachers
Tongue, and the Rulers Scepter with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And therefore with what a Controlling,
Overpowering force did our Savior Tax the Sins
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he ushered in his Rebukes
of them, with that high assertion of himself,
<hi>Who is there amongst you that convinces me of
Sin?</hi> Otherwise, we may easily guess with what
impatience the world would have heard an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
<hi>Herod</hi> discoursing of Chastity, a <hi>Judas</hi>
condemning Covetousness, or a Pharisee
Preaching against Hypocrisy; Every word must
have recoyled upon the Speaker. Guilt is that,
that quells the Courage of the Bold, tyes the
Tongue of the Eloquent, and makes Greatness
it self sneak and lurk, and behave it self poorly.
For, let a Vitious Person be in never so high
Command, yet still he will be lookt upon but
as one great Vice, empowred to Correct and
Chastise others. A Corrupt Governor is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101750:18"/>
else but a reigning Sin. And a Sin in
Office may Command any thing but Respect.
No Man can be Credited by his Place or Power;
who by his Vertue does not <hi>first Credit that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A Third thing that makes a Governor
justly despised, is fearfulness of, and Mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances
with, Bold Popular Offenders. Some
indeed account it the very Spirit of Policy and
Prudence, where Men refuse to come up to a
Law, to make the Law come down to them.
And for their so doing, have this infallible
Recompence, that they are not at all <hi>the more
Loved,</hi> but much <hi>the less Feared;</hi> and, which is
a sure Consequent of it, accordingly <hi>Respected.</hi>
But believe it, it is a Resolute tenacious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to well Chosen Principles, than adds
Glory to Greatness, and makes the face of a
Governor shine in the Eyes of those that see and
examine his Actions. Disobedience, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with, is infinitely encroaching, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gain'd one degree of Liberty upon Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
will demand another upon Claim. Every
Vice Interprets a Connivence an Approbation.</p>
            <p>Which being so, is it not an Enormous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency,
as well as a gross impiety, that any
one who owns the Name of a Divine, hearing
a great Sinner brave it against Heaven, talk A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically,
and scoff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Profanely at that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101750:19"/>
by which he owns an Expectation to be
saved, if he cares to be saved at all, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Vindicating the Truth to the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Teeth, think it Discretion and Moderation
(forsooth) with a Complying Silence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Smile to boot, tacitly to approve, and
strike in with the Scoffer, and so go Sharer both
in the Mirth and Guilt of his prophane Jests?</p>
            <p>But let such an one be assured, that even that
Blasphemer himself, would inwardly Reverence
him, if Rebuked by him; as on the Contrary,
he in his Heart really Despises him for his Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
base Silence. If any one should reply here,
that the Times and Manners of men will not
bear such a Practise, I confess, that it is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the mouth of a Profest Time-server,
very Rational: But, as for that man that is not so,
Let him satisfie himself of the Reason, Justice
and Duty of an Action, and leave the Event of
it to God, who will never fail those, who do not
think themselves too wise to Trust Him. For let
the worst come to the worst, a man in so doing
would be ruined more Honourably, then
otherwise preferred.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly. A fourth thing that makes a
Governour justly Despised, is a proness to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
others. There is a kind of Respect due to
the Meanest Person, even from the Greatest;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101750:19"/>
for it is the meer favour of Providence, that he
who is Actually the Greatest, was not the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
A man cannot cast his Respects so low, but
they will Rebound and Return upon him.
What Heaven bestows upon the Earth in kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Influences, and benigne Aspects, is payed it back
again in Sacrifice, Incense and Adoration. And
surely, a great Person gets more by Obliging his
Inferior, then by Disdaining him; as a man has a
greater advantage by Sowing and Dressing his
Ground, then he can have by <hi>trampling</hi> upon it.
It is not to Insult and Domineer, to look Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully,
and Revile Imperiously, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
an Esteem from any one: it will indeed
make men keep their Distance sufficiently; but
it will be Distance without Reverence.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewn four several Causes,
that may justly render any Ruler Despised;
and by the same Work, I hope, have made it
Evident, how little Cause men have to Despise
the Rulers of our Church.</p>
            <p>God is the Fountain of Honour, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
by which he Conveys it to the Sons of men
are Vertuous and Generous Practices. But as
for Us, who have more Immediately and Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Devoted, both our Persons and Concerns to
his Service; it were infinitely vain to expect it
upon any other Termes. Some indeed may
<pb facs="tcp:101750:20"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
from full Revenues, stately Palaces, Court In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and great Dependances. But that which
makes the Clergy glorious, to be Knowing in
their Profession, Unspotted in their Lives,
Active and Laborious in their Charges, Bold and
Resolute in opposing Seducers, and daring to
look Vice in the face, though never so Potent
and Illustrious. And lastly, to be Gentle, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and Compassionate to all.</p>
            <p>These are our Robes, and our Maces, our
Escutenions and highest Titles of Honour, for
by all these things God is honoured, who has
Declared this the Eternal Rule and Standard of
all Honour deriveable upon men, <hi>That those
who Honour Him, shall be Honoured by Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which God, fearful in Praises, and working
Wonders, be rendred and ascribed as is most
due, all Praise, Might, Majesty and Dominion,
both now and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
