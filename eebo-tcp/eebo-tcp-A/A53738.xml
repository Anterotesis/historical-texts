            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great and many Obligations, which I have received from your self and good Lady, made it easie to determine to whom I ought in Duty to direct this Discourse, as a publick Testimony of my Gratitude and Thankfulness. And truly, I have had a very great Longing, for some time, to meet with an Opportunity of paying my Respects to you in some eminent, visible way, to the end the World might see and know, what a grateful Sense I have of those Favours which I am never able to requite.</p>
            <p>But there was another Consideration which did mightily prevail with me to ascribe this Sermon to your Patronage; and that is, the Agreeableness of this Subject of Loyalty with your Practice and Inclinations, who gave suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and the most convincing Proofs of it in a time of Tryal, when Loyalty was going down the Wind, and when some People who had no just or
<pb facs="tcp:35290:3"/>
material Objection against Sir <hi>Jonathan Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> upon account of his fitness to serve the Publick, yet reflected upon his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as his Crime, and that which, in their Opinion, did spoil all other Qualifications. But <hi>Sir,</hi> This has much redounded to your Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among all good Men, that you did so slight the Censures of some malevolent People, who had ill Will against you, for no other Reason, but because you had such good will to His Majesty and his Government, as to shew your self such a brave Example of sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and unshaken Loyalty, in unstable Times; and one that out of pure Choice would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to come in in the very heat of the Day, and steer the Affairs of a great City, when the Government was in great Distress, and pester'd with powerful and implacable Enemies on all sides. Nay, such is your Love of Majesty and Zeal for Loyalty, that you are promoting it in all Companies wherever you come; and, as I have particularly observed, you take singular Care to train up your Children the same way, and encourage nothing more, both in Children and Servants, than Loyalty to the Government. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

            <p>But I fear I may be thought a Bold and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Man, for venturing such a plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Discourse into the World, when there are Numbers of excellent Discourses upon this very Subject, which are no less elegant than profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But as to this, I dare undertake to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my Self and Sermon too, forasmuch as the Subject I now treat on is so great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in it self, that it needs no Flourishes or Advantages of Oratory, to recommend and set it off: And I humbly conceive, that the plainer it is, the fitter it will be for the plainer sort of People, which are most numerous; and if others shall blame me, for not whetting my Style, and using that Tartness of Expression, which is now the modish way of treating all Dissenters, and Persons that appear disaffected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I answer, That Severity, in any sort, is much against my Nature, and that I have studiously declined all Satyr and Invectives, for this very Reason, Because I have known many hardned by that means, but never any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>

And now <hi>Sir,</hi> not to detain you any longer, I here present you with a plain Discourse of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and the true and only way to preserve all People in Obedience to Authority; which as I am confident it will gain your Favour and Protection, for the sake of its Subject, so I hope it may do some general Good in the World in that way it is designed; which is the earnest Wish, and principal Aim of,</p>

                  <bibl>TITUS 3. vers. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>Put them in mind to be subject to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, to be ready to every good Work.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Text is in the nature of a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monitor, and perpetual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer to us of the Subjection and Obedience which we owe to our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours: And I suppose, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle takes occasion to preach up this Doctrine of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the more, because it was commonly suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the first Days and Rise of Christianity, that it was a Religion which brought perfect Freedom and Liberty along with it, and which tended to level all Orders and Distinctions of Men, as, high and low, bond and free, Master and Servant, and so make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body alike Gentlemen; that is, it was taught, and maintain'd, by a vile sort of Men, call'd <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> That Christianity was a brave, frank, and generous Religion, whose main Design was, to dissolve all Ties and Obligations of Obedience, and set all People free from a state of Subjection. And therefore, we may observe, how that the Apostle, out of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Care to prevent this growing Error and Mistake, which People were so prone to fall into, by reason of a natural Love and Desire of Liberty, takes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35290:5"/>
the Pains, in several of his Epistles, to discourse this Matter plainly and fully, and more especially in part of the fifth and sixth Chapters of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> He there runs through all those Bonds and Relations wherein we stand ingaged to one another, either as Husband and Wife, Master and Servant, or Father and Children; and shews, how that the Gospel Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Priviledges, do not consist in bursting these Bonds asunder, or in untying the Knot of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience, whereby we are knit together in mutual Relations and Dependencies. Nor do the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contain'd in the Gospel teach any thing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to such Licentiousness and Disorders, nor in the least prompt or encourage Men to lessen or draw off their Obedience to their Superiours, of what Quality or Degree soever they be: but on the contrary, 'tis manifest that there are no Doctrines so auspicious and friendly to Government, that do so much preserve the Rule and Order of it, or fasten the Bonds and Ligaments of Humane Societies in a due Subordination of one part to another, as the Doctrines of Christianity, which would have a very happy Influence upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Peace and Order of the World, in case they were as truly practised as they are plainly taught and delivered in the Gospel. But though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does so well provide for the Safety, and Peace, and Security of the Government: yet, of late Years, Loyalty and Obedience have been things very much out of Fashion and Request, and Doctrines which some could not hear, or bear with any Patience. The Truth is, we have had the Unhappiness to live in an Age, wherein Loyalty has been persecuted and punish'd, as the worst of Crimes, and even now it is a hard thing to perswade some, that it is either a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35290:5"/>
or a Duty; so that it is little esteemed of by them, and less practised: and therefore the Apostle, as if he did foresee how apt Men would be to flag and faulter in this great Point of Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, commands that the Doctrine of Obedience be preach'd up, and Men often be reminded of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this Particular, saying, <hi>Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In discoursing of which Words, I shall first set my self to prove, That Loyalty, and Obedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is a necessary and indispensable Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prescribe some Rules and Directions how to preserve and establish us in this Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>First then, I shall set my self to prove, that Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Obedience to Authority, is a necessary and indispensable Duty of Religion.</p>
            <p>There is no Duty, in all the Sacred Volume, which is more plain and legible than this of Loyalty and Obedience to Magistrates: and yet some of late years have been so stupid, or rather, willfully blind, as to over-look it; and, which is very strange, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Power and Skill to discover and spell out the Doctrine of Resistance from the Thirteenth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is a famous Sermon and Discourse of Obedience; which is a plain and evident Proof how unconscionably some People will sophisticate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the plainest Scripture, when it is to serve a turn, and in order to carry on a desperate Design. But however, Men may industriously oppose the Truth, and hoodwink their Understandings when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to delude themselves and others, yet it is as true
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35290:6"/>
as Gospel, that Resistance of the Higher Powers is a damnable Sin; for, <hi>They that resist,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, shall receive to themselves Damnation.</hi> But I defie the most four Patrons, and stiff Assertors of this evil Doctrine of Resistance, to produce one Place or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture, which sounds or looks that way; whereas, I can confidently and truly affirm, that there are several great Expressions concerning Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our Superiours, and a huge Vein of Loyalty that runs all along throughout the Holy Scriptures; some Instances whereof are these, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, nor do my Prophets no harm. Fear God, Honour the King. Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers</hi>; with many other Phrases of the like Importance. And 'tis very observable, that there is no Duty which is pressed with more Vehemency, or the Threatnings of a severer Penalty, or more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insisted on than this of Obedience and Subjection; as if it were the <hi>unum necessarium</hi> of Religion. And we may farther take notice, That our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gives us the greatest Example of it, in paying Tribute when he might have lawfully refused: and to remove and prevent all Exceptions to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrine of Obedience, acquaints the <hi>Jews,</hi> that albeit they might look upon themselves as a free and peculiar People, and stand highly upon their singular Grants and Priviledges, so as to think scorn to truckle or bend in a way of Subjection to any Power on Earth, yet seeing it was their Fate to fall under the Power and Dominion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were now uppermost, and become their Masters by absolute Conquest and Victory, they were as things now stood with 'em to pay all dutiful Homage and Submission to 'em, as being the Higher Powers. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35290:6"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> is very brisk and positive in this matter, and commands Obedience, and to be subject for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, even in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> who was a Monster of Wickedness and Tyranny. So that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see with what pretence of Reason or Conscience Men can dispute Obedience to Authority, in all just and lawful Commands. And I do much wonder how a whole Generation of Men can have the Face to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to extraordinary Religion and Sanctity, and yet at the same time live in such a known Sin and Wickedness, as is that of Disobedience to Superiours; and I much more wonder, how they can call upon Kings and Princes to rule altogether according to Law, when they themselves are such lawless People, and live in such a manifest Violation; and Defiance of all those Laws of the Land, which are made in Favour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Obedience. But I would that all Men would know, and consider, That a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Subjection to Authority is one of the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Laws of the Christian Religion: and therefore; for Men to make nothing to break such a plain Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law, and disregard such an essential Duty of Religion, is a great sign, that they make very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Conscience of their ways, and a shrewd Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they have little or no Religion. And this is the Proposition which I promised in the first place to make out and maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> That Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is a necessary and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Duty of Religion.</p>
            <p>I shall now, in the second place, prescribe some Rules and Directions, how to preserve and establish us in Loyalty and Obedience. Which was the thing I principally intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35290:7"/>
As first, By renouncing ill Principles and Doctrines dangerous to Government.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By suppressing our Passions and first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By entertaining good Thoughts and Opinions of our Superiours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By avoiding evil and factious Company.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By ceasing to envy and mutter at our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, By praying for those in Authority, and the Prosperity of the Government.</p>
            <p>And lastly, endeavour to satisfie those Scruples and Jealousies which make some People so restless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet under the present Government. And all this, I promise to perform with that Softness and Candor, as to give no just Provocation or Offence to the most passionate Dissenter, if any such should be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>First then, one way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ill Principles and Doctrines dangerous to Government.</p>
            <p>'Tis natural for Men to act according to their Principles, and follow the tendency of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they have been taught, there being, in a manner, the same Relation between Mens Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices, as between the Cause and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now, ill Principles will, in time, turn into matter of Conscience: but, when Men are once strongly perswaded that they ought to do a thing, though it be never so unlawful in it self, yet they will act it with as much Courage and Resolution, as they would in the most righteous Cause in the World; for, one of an erroneous and misguided Conscience, will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35290:7"/>
be as fierce and active in his way as he that has the most tender and pure Conscience. So that none are so mischievous and fatal Enemies to the Government as those that think themselves bound, in Duty and Conscience, to subvert and overthrow it. And for the Truth and Confirmation of this, I will appeal to our late Experience, and the great Bustles and Stirs which some People make at present. 'Tis certain, that the Government is always in danger from Men of ill Principles, because they lye under a perpetual Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to rebell. Now of those many Principles and Doctrines which have for some Years so mightily prevail'd, and pester'd the World, I shall only recount two, which I think to be of as pernicious a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and to have had as great an Influence in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the Government, as any others that can be named.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Principles and Doctrines are these two;</l>
               <l>That Dominion is founded in Grace; and</l>
               <l>That it is lawful to fight for Religion.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The one takes away all consideration of Right and Justice, and the other authorises and sanctifies Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>And tho some among us take a peculiar Pride, and would be thought the more religious for clamouring against the Papists, as altogether unsufferable, upon account of their dangerous Principles and Practices; yet I would fain know, what Difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Opinions of the Lawfulness of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Kings for Heresie, and fighting for Religion: The one is a pure Jesuitical Principle, and the other a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick. And truly, both accord and jump together in the same Sentiments and Opinions in Opposition to Government, save only, that the latter has the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35290:8"/>
Cunningness to lick the Jesuits Principles into another Form, and put them into a different Dress. But this has been the Trick of all those who have had any Spleen or Design against the Government, to disguise their Malice and wicked Intentions with the plausible and specious Titles and Pretences of Religion and Reformation: and when they have had a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, that they might put a good Face and a fair Gloss upon the matter, they begin to find Fault with their Prince for some personal Failings or Enormities of Life, or not being so close a Friend to Religion, nor so godly, as they would have him to be, or else quarrel at the Administration of Publick Affairs, as wanting Conduct and Policy, and not being agreeable to Honour and Justice. And this we have seen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd all along, by that Party of Men who are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Plague and Burthen to the Government, how that they are always picking Flaws in their Prince's Religion or Government upon the account of some Defects in his Morals, or some Error and Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of State; and so represent him as a Person not fit, or religious enough, to govern: for this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That Dominion is founded in Grace, lies at the bottom, and is the Foundation, of all our Dissenters Rage and implacable Aversion to the King and his Government. For, they looking upon themselves as the Godly Party, and that none love or practice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion like themselves, do thereupon think that none but the Godly have a Right to govern: and though a Prince were as Holy as an Angel, yet, unless he be righteous in their Eyes, and according to their Standard of Holiness, he would be rejected as unfit to rule over 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35290:8"/>
And hence it was, that in the late Times of Usurpation this sort of Men made no Scruple to plunder and spoil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Estates, and seat themselves in their Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giving out to the World, That the Wicked did forfeit all Right to their Estates, and that none could hold an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state by any Tenure but that of Holiness; and so made a shift, under the Pretences of a singular Piety, and a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent engrossing Holiness to themselves, to convert the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Lands, as they called all Rich and Loyal Persons, into the Inheritance of the Saints, as they call themselves.</p>
            <p>And the Truth is, wherever this Principle prevails it will mightily provoke and stir up People against their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, in case of the least Failure in point of Morality, or that which they account Religion, and the only Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Government. And who can ever be quiet or safe in their Possessions when a Company of enthusiastick and hot-headed People, as most of this Perswasion are, shall take an occasion to quarrel with others for their Impieties, and grow very angry with 'em for their Sins, to the end they might have some colour and grounds to justifie their Plunder and Sequestration? And it is certain, that those who are so mightily for putting the Government altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Hands of the Righteous, will be very apt to strike in for their own Preferment; for, generally such kind of People are mightily conceited of their own worth, and are always Righteous in their own Eyes. But, as this Doctrine has done a world of mischief in causing People narrowly to inspect and animadvert upon all the Failings and Miscarriages of their Superiours, (so seeking Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against 'em) even to the despising them for some Weaknesses and Imperfections, which are, perhaps, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable in their Circumstances, and no more than some sad Instances of humane Frailty: so likewise that other Doctrine of the Lawfulness of fighting for Religion, has equalled the former in its mischievous Effects. And tho some who have dip'd their Hands in Royal and Innocent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35290:9"/>
Blood, and have been exercis'd in the Slaughter of the Righteous, have called it fighting the Lord's Battels, and assumed to themselves the Name of strict Professors and Reformers of Religion; yet 'tis certain, that such as are so ready to fight for Religion, and promote it by the Sword, have no Religion at all. For, Religion is a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, quiet thing, and Fighting and Quarrels are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, as are the most dissonant things in Nature; as are the Lamb and the Wolf, the soft Airs of Musick, and that raging, merciless Element the Ocean.</p>
            <p>And I am verily perswaded, that these Principles and Doctrines which I have now mentioned, and the like to them, which I have no time to recite or display in their proper Colours, have been the Occasion of vast Troubles and Distractions in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And doubtless, this very Doctrine of Resistance and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Princes, in case we do not like their Religion, which was so maliciously intended, and so boldly maintained by a late Mercenary Pen, in a Book entituled, <hi>The Life of</hi> Julian <hi>the Apostate,</hi> has tended very much to dissettle some in their Loyalty, and confirmed others in their Rebellious Principles. And perhaps the Arguments which were there used to confirm and propagate that wicked Position, might very much heat and spur on that unhappy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the late Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> to those Consults and Debates which cost him his precious Life, and brought him to such an inglorious end. And besides all this, the great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is, That these turbulent and ill Principles, may, like Errors, not dye with their Authors, but convey them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Posterity: and we have too plain a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Age, that Rebellion, as well as some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diseases, runs in a Blood, and propagates it self from one Generation to another. The Way then to be rooted and grounded in Loyalty, is, to have our Minds seasoned with sound, wholesome, and Loyal Principles; for, such as are our Principles,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35290:9"/>
such also will be our Practices: and no Man that has imbibed ill Principles, or gives ear to treasonable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, will ever make a good Christian or a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And this is one way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ill Principles and Doctrines dangerous to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty and Obedience, is, by suppressing our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and first Inclinations to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>When we once deliver up our selves to the Sway and Predominancy of our unruly Passions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is no other likelyhood but that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should suffer, and be molested by us: for, most certainly, the great Blustrings and Storms, both in Church and State, arise from our swelling and unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Passions of Ambition, Malice, Revenge, and the like.</p>
            <p>'Tis these which imbitter and fire our Spirits against one another, and by Continuance boil up into Rage and Fury, and so help to put the whole Nation into a Flame. 'Tis these which, like Gun-powder, tear up the Foundations of Peace and Government; and if they be not timely check'd and curb'd some way or other, will hurl all into Confusion, and unhinge the World. In a word, 'Tis these which first raise a Tumult within our own Breast, and then fly and break out into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mischiefs and Disorders; and can there be any Peace and Quietness as long as these reign and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer? But then as to our bad Inclinations, they must be check'd and over-ruled equally with our Passions; and we must be sure to crush both in their first Risings and Motions against the Government: 'Tis true, that bad Inclinations do not presently deprave the Mind, but corrupt and taint it by degrees. They lye hovering over the Soul, and play Fast and Loose about it, till
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35290:10"/>
by length of time they come to be fix'd and radicated, and grow into Temper and Constitution. Rebellion, like all other Wickedness, has it's Rise and Beginnings, its several Steps and Stages, and gradual Progressions, to open Violence and Hostility: for, as <hi>nemo repente fit turpissimus,</hi> no Man grows desperately wicked on the sudden, so no Man turns a Rebel without some pausing and Consideration, without some previous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and disaffections to the Government. The Seeds of Sedition must have some time to settle in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will spring up into actual Mischief and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but, except they are nip'd in the very Bud, they will insensibly vitiate the Heart and Affections, and breed in us a desperate and plaguy Itch of Rebellion. And I do really believe, that some Persons who have appear'd in actual Rebellion against their Prince, did at first as little dream they should be guilty of any such thing, as <hi>Hazael,</hi> when it was first suggested to him that he should make such Havock and a bloody Slaughter in <hi>Israel</hi>; saying, with great Abhorrence and Detestation, <hi>What, is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this great thing!</hi> But yet, by giving way to bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and the evil Instigation of others, have been toled on actually to engage in a most horrid and bloody Rebellion. The Truth is, Men can scarce apprehend what will be the Issue and final Result of their Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and bad Inclinations, when they first consent to 'em: they don't know whither they will lead 'em, or into what furious and unlawful Actions they may hurry and transport 'em, or to what a sad and miserable end they may bring 'em in process of Time; for all Passions and bad Inclinations do improve and gather Strength by Indulgence; if they continue for any while, they soak into Mens Natures, and strangely pervert the very Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Dispositions of their Minds: so that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35290:10"/>
yielding and giving way to these boysterous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Spite, Malice, and Revenge, Men at length come to be fierce, turbulent, and unruly, that there is no keeping 'em within Compass, or reducing them to a quiet, peaceable, and good Behaviour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is sound and wholsome Advice to resist the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Evil, whether of Body or Mind; for just as an ill Wound which may soon be cured by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Care and Application of proper and fitting Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but if long neglected will ranckle and fester in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an incurable Gangreen; so our turbulent Passions and evil Inclinations may easily be supprest, by striving against 'em at first: but if they are let alone to go on and prosper, they will then prove fatal to Government, and swell into the most outrageous Treason and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And this is another way to preserve and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By suppressing our Passions and first Inclinations to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is, by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining good Thoughts and Opinions of our Superiours.</p>
            <p>And this is a very proper Method and Means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Obedience to Government; forasmuch as there can be no Certainty or Security of Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Mens Hearts are right and sincere towards their Governours.</p>
            <p>It is always seen, that where Men have ill Thoughts or Opinions of any Person, they can never heartily love or be truly reconciled to him, nor yet think well of any of his Actions: they may indeed make a fair shew, and carry it smoothly to outward Appearance, but there can never be any real or sincere Friendship. And it is the very same in case of Obedience to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; for, where Subjects have no honourable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35290:11"/>
Thoughts or venerable Opinion of their Prince, they can then never obey him out of any Principle of Love, but purely as Slaves, out of Constraint and fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Now where Obedience is the Result of such a slavish Fear, it will never last longer than till Men are afraid to rebell, and they will fear no longer when they once get an Opportunity and Power to rebell: so that that Obedience which is altogether grounded and establish'd upon Fear, is of a most uncertain Date and Tenure; and the Government which so depends can never be safe or happy for the Prince. And therefore, if we desire to approve our selves good and obedient Subjects, we must ground our Obedience in hearty Love and Affections to our Prince; and this we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, unless we resolve to chide away and banish far from us all unkind and uncharitable Thoughts and Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of our Prince, either as touching his Religion or his Government: for if a Prince be never so wise and religious, yet if we are resolved not to think him so, this ill Nature and morose Temper of ours will make us extreamly censorious, and to put an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction upon all his Actions and Proceedings. Tho a Prince should deserve never so well of his Subjects by his prudent and kind Government, as certainly our King is the most meritorious Prince in the World in both Respects; who if he had no other divine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but his vast Wisdom and Clemency, is the fittest Person on Earth to be God's Vicegerent. I say, should a Prince be never so wise and gracious, yet if Subjects will be peevish and cross-grain'd, and have an utter Aversion and Antipathy to his Government, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should obey him from the Heart, when let him do the best he can he shall never please 'em. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> takes the best way to secure our Love and Obedience to our Superiours, when he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35290:11"/>
forbids us to curse the King even in our Thoughts. He knew very well, that there is no preserving Majesty from Contempt unless we retain a secret Reverence for him in our Hearts; for evil Thoughts are next door to evil Practices, and a fair Introduction to Rebellion. He was sensible, That nothing could so facilitate and secure Obedience to Governours, as a real Love and Liking to 'em, and an honouring 'em from the very bottom of our Souls. We know that Love always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Liking; and where there is not a real Liking there can never be a true and hearty Love; and it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a People to obey their Prince as they ought to do when they have no good Opinion or Conceit of him: and therefore we should labour to possess our Minds and Hearts with good Thoughts and candid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of our Rulers and Governours, which will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us to put the best and fairest Construction upon all their Actions: and then will our Obedience come so freely and sweetly from us, that we shall find Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in obeying, as well as our King in governing. And this is another way to preserve and establish us in Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Obedience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By entertaining good Thoughts and Opinions of our Superiours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is, By avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil and Factious Company.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you what Prejudice or Advantages we are capable of receiving from Company, the good or evil Conversation of others, what Power or Influence it has to improve Men in Virtue or Vice: but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bad Company alters Men soonest, and most, and is most infectious, which may be ascribed to our stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger natural Propensions to Evil, and our greater Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibleness of it, than what is really good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But so it is ever known to be, that Men, by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35290:12"/>
keeping Company, contract a likeness of Temper and Disposition with those with whom they usually and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converse, and make Friendship; with the froward Men will grow froward, with the Meek they will grow meek; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> advises, <hi>not to keep Company with an angry Man</hi>: which He might do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double account, either as that might prove fatal and dangerous to his Person, or else infect his Mind with the same Passion. And I am apt to believe, that some honest and well-meaning Men, who at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested all Practises against the Government, have been corrupted, and drawn into Plots and treasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs purely by keeping Company with such as were factious, and disaffected to the Government. 'Tis a hard matter for him that is a Companion of base Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to preserve his Integrity or escape Defilement; and one may shrewdly guess at the Temper and Principles of a Man by the Company he keeps. 'Tis certain, that whilst Men indulge themselves the Liberty of tatling about the Government, and against it, in Seditious Clubs and Conventicles, they will, by continual Discourses of this nature, envenome their Spirits, and come to steep their Language in the Gall of Bitterness: for as it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the frequent talking of some Vices infects the Fancy and vitiates the Mind, and so procreates a Love and a Longing to them; so it is often seen, that by treasonable Talk Men slide and fall into actual Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for from evil Discourses to evil Actions, is a natural Progression. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> gives very proper Advice for the preventing all Treasonable Practices, when he says, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. <hi>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them which are given to change</hi>: that is, Do not associate and hold Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with Men of roving Heads and unsettled Minds,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35290:12"/>
who are governed by no steddy good Principle, but are restless and uneasie under all Governments. No Body knows, no not themselves, what will please 'em: they are dissatisfied with any Government long, and affect Novelty and Change in Government, as well as in other things: with such Persons hold no Commerce at all, have no Dealings with 'em, nor interest your self in their Designs and Projects: when you chance to meet with Persons so very whimsical, and of such fickle and unstable Minds, be sure you contract no Friendship with 'em, but decline their Society, as what will prove dangerous to your self, as well as the Government. See then that you carefully and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously avoid the Company of such People as are always contriving, and hankering after new Forms and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of Government, and meddle not with them which are given to change. And this is another way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By avoiding factious and pestilent Company.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is, By ceasing to envy and mutter at our Superiours.</p>
            <p>Could we who are placed in a remote and lower Sphear, be sensible of the Cares and Incumbrances of a Crown, we should, I perswade my self, be so far from envying the Glory of Princes, that we should heartily pitty and lament their Condition. Did we but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their many thoughtful and busie Hours, how watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they are for our Good, when perhaps we are sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and snoring in our Beds; how they are bandying of things and racking their Brains in deep Consults and Debates for the publick Welfare, at such times as our Thoughts and Minds are at perfect Ease and Rest; how they have their Hands and Heads full too, when we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35290:13"/>
have little or nothing at all to busie and disturb us, and how difficult and laborious a Province it is to rule and govern. Did we thus consider the great Cares and Difficulties of Government, certainly it would migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily abate and take off our Spleen and Envy against our Superiours; it would make us more tender of add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any greater Load of Troubles to that mighty weight of Business which they already sustain. Kings and Princes have Cares enough (God help 'em) in the very best Juncture of Affairs, when their Government is most easie and safe, when all things go on in a due and orderly Course; yet they find work enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Peace and Quietness in their Kingdoms, and need not be put to the Trouble of quelling Riots, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Rage and Fury of a factious Multitude: they find enough to do to defend us from our Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to watch their Motions, and dive into their Policies; so that it is, in my Mind, great Cruelty and Baseness to force them upon the same Guard and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness at home, by our intestine Broils and Dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and making continual Stirs and Commotions in the State.</p>
            <p>In the Name of God, what is it that we the People of this Nation would have, or can reasonably expect or desire to enjoy, more than now we do? What is it that we so much grumble and are discontented at? Are we troubled that our Rulers are studying and project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually for our Good and the Safety of the Publick? Are we troubled that we have such excellent Laws to protect and defend us, and that Justice is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred with so much Temper and Moderation? Are we troubled that our Superiours will take upon 'em the Pains and Trouble to govern us who cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our selves? Or, Are we troubled that our Religion prospers, and grows every day more and more victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35290:13"/>
over those who have been given up to strong Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Delusions. Do any of these things trouble us? If they do not, then 'tis plain that we are arrant Knaves, and resolve to quarrel and find fault out of pure Crossness, and design to vex the Government. But if they do trouble us, then we deserve to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled another way for being such Fools as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand our own Interest and Advantage; then nothing can prevent our troubling our selves, or proving trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to Authority, but only the whetting the Sword of Justice, and making us feel the Power of the publick Rods and Axes: and then we shall have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trouble us indeed. But if we can find no just Matter or Occasion of Offence upon any of the former Accounts, why then do we not humbly acquiesce in the Determinations of our Superiours, and yield up a ready and quiet Obedience to all the lawful Commands and Injunctions of Authority?</p>
            <p>If some People, who live under other Governments where the Prince's Will is an absolute Law, and who many times requires Obedience as well without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as without Law; I say, if these People should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the great Liberty and Immunities of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Realm, and how sweetly and bravely we live, even more like Princes than Subjects, and how that every one may live as he lists, and serve God as much as he pleases, if he do either as he ought and should, they would stand amazed at our Happiness, and wonder what ails the People of <hi>England</hi> that they are no quieter, nor better satisfied, under such a gentle and fine tempered Government. For my own part, I must needs say, that I am often, in my private Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and Retirements from the World, lifting up my Heart and Hands to Heaven, humbly adoring the great Mercy and Goodness of Almighty God, in giving me
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35290:14"/>
my Lot and Station under such an equal and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Government, where all People may be as happy as they can wish or desire, and are debarr'd the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nothing but making themselves and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy by their foolish Divisions. And truly, if we grumble and mutter now, we grumble and mutter for we know not what: and I wish, with all my Heart, that we live not to see those Times wherein we may have Reason to complain, and smart soundly for our present Petulancy and Wantonness.</p>
            <p>Alas, poor foolish People that we are! We do not, we will not, understand our own Happiness! And what an easie thing it is to obey, in comparison of what it is to govern: I see we are not to be perswaded or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the great Priviledges and Comforts of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life, and how that Subjects enjoy more Ease and Quietness in one Day, than perhaps their Rulers and Governours do all the Days of their Lives: but, as far as we can ghess by the Troubles and Cares belonging to the Rule and Government of a private Family, 'tis no such sweet and pleasant thing to govern, as some People may imagine. A Crown, indeed, is a glorious Thing to behold, and People do naturally stare and gaze upon its outward Pomp and Splendour; but they have not the Sagacity to discern with what Cares and Thorns this glittering thing is stuff'd and lined within.</p>
            <p>I know not what others may think, but it was ever my Opinion, since I could make any true Judgment of things, that we are infinitely beholding to our Rulers for the Pains and Care they are pleased to undergo in managing the Publick Concerns of a whole Nation, which redounds so much to every individual Mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Advantage: and, I think we can never tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly recompence or pay a sufficient Tribute of Thankfulness and Obedience to our Governours for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35290:14"/>
their accepting the Charge and Trouble of so vast a Conduct. And therefore, is it not very ill done of some, and an unpardonable Crime in those that make it their Business out of the Malignity of their Spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Government, to sow the Seeds of Discord and Faction, to cherish private Animosities and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents among People of different Perswasions, to the end they might grieve Majesty and make more Work for their Superiours; and, which is more, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, with all their might and main, to misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and bespatter the King and his Government by infamous Libels, and false, scandalous Stories, thinking, by this means, to make Majesty more uneasie in his Throne, and to render both Him and his Government universally odious? Whereas it is the Duty, and will be the Practice, of every good Subject, to endeavour by a ready and quiet Obedience, and a peaceable Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to alleviate and sweeten those Cares and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which are so essential to Government. And this is another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By ceasing to envy and mutter at our Superiours.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, and lastly, Another way to preserve and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish us in Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, is, by Praying for those in Authority, and the Prosperity of the Government.</p>
            <p>Government is one of the greatest Blessings that can be to the World; a prime Instrument of humane Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, without which, Men would live and act like <hi>Salvages,</hi> and worry one another like so many Beasts of Prey: without Government the World would be a miserable and a dangerous place to live in, and all things would run into the greatest Disorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. 'Tis from the Benefit and Protection of the Laws that all Societies keep and maintain their Rights
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35290:15"/>
and Priviledges, that Men have the Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to get Estates, and to enjoy 'em quietly and peaceably when they have done. 'Tis by the Force and Power of Laws that we have our Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties guarded from continual Violence and Invasion; and lastly, 'Tis Government that secures us in the exercise of our Religion, and befriends us with so much Time, and Leisure, and Opportunities for Devotion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, considering all these happy Effects of Government, we ought to pray, in point of Interest, for the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kings, and the good Success of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that under them we may live peaceable and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty. And though the Primitive Christians had the Misfortune to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd against, by some of their malicious and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Adversaries, as Persons dangerous to the Government, and that their very Religion and Principles naturally led and prompted 'em to Treason and Rebellion against the State; yet this is known to be a false and malicious Lye, and that none were greater Friends to the Government than they, tho the Government was an utter Enemy to them: which is confirm'd by their quiet and peaceable Behaviour under the Government, and their assiduous and fervent Prayers for the Prosperity of the Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they lived. Which stand upon Record in the Writings of several of the Fathers, and have of late been transcribed and produc'd by several Learned Men, in Testimony of their Loyalty, and to shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Disloyalty of some Christians in these days if they had any Shame in 'em.</p>
            <p>We must all needs know and confess, That Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ordained and instituted for the Good of the World; and the better that succeeds and prospers, the better it will be for us. And if some cannot be brought to pray for its Prosperity, 'tis a Sign, that they do not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35290:15"/>
regard their own private Interest and Welfare which are involved in the Publick, or else that they have no kindness for their Superiours or their Fellow-Subjects, in wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill to the Government, that so those that sit at the Helm may appear odious to the People: or else, rather than not to be gratified in their private Piques and Animosities against the Government, care not if the whole Kingdom be ruined.</p>
            <p>But, if some Men that are Lovers of Anarchy and Confusion, will not be perswaded that Government is useful and profitable, I could almost wish that such People (if others that are wiser and better could be safe) might for some while have their own choice, and try the Experiment of such Dissolution and Disorders; or others that declare for Government, but are mightily set against that kind of Government which is Monarchical and which it is our Happiness to enjoy, shall hereupon oppose it, or not pray for the Prosperity and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the present Government, that they also might have their own Wishes and Hearts desire in suffering the Tyranny and Distraction of a Commonwealth, if that were possible, without a real Change of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and blessed Government which we are now under. But it is a vain and fruitless Attempt for a man of my small Moment in the World, to dispute with such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons about the Duty and Obligation of praying for our Governours and Government, when 'tis evident, that they despise an Apostolical Rule whereby we are commanded to pray for Kings and all in Authority over us. And truly, when it is so that People shall think much to pray for their Rulers, they will as certainly think much to obey 'em; or, where they shall only pray for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and to avoid the Suspicion of Disloyalty, they had even as good not pray at all, for God accepts not of the Prayers of such insincere and hollow-hearted Hypocrites, neither will the Government thrive one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35290:16"/>
Jot the better for 'em. Yet I doubt not but God has hitherto preserved our Gracious Sovereign and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the sundry Attempts and nefarious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Sons of Violence, as the Fruit and Blessing of the numerous fervent Prayers of pious and good Men, which have been incessantly offered up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Conservation of both. And this is another way to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> By praying for those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Prosperity of the Government.</p>
            <p>Having now prescribed several Rules and Directions how to preserve and establish us in Loyalty, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority, I shall now, in the last place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to satisfie those Scruples and Jealousies which make some People so restless and unquiet under the present Government.</p>
            <p>Now, these Fears and Jealousies must be grounded either upon a Suspition of their Prince's Firmness and Constancy to the Protestant Religion, or else upon a Suspicion of a Change of Government; upon both which Accounts, I shall shew Mens Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to be altogether groundless and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>First, If these Fears are grounded upon a Suspicion of their Prince's Firmness and Constancy to the Protestant Religion, (I speak out what others by their Whispers and Muttrings have given us too much Reason to believe they suspect and think) they are then altogether groundless and unreasonable. For it is highly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a Prince should waver in his Religion, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to part with it in his Prosperity, when he could not be overcome to change it in the time of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and when some who went under the Name of strict Professors and Protestants had done enough, by their cruel and unchristian Practices towards him, to put him out of Conceit with it. But 'tis well known,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35290:16"/>
that during the Time of his Majesty's Exile and Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he was under great Temptations to change his Principles, both from the Spite and Malice of his Subjects at home, and the Kindness and Friendship which was proffer'd him abroad, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these great Provocations on the one Hand, and as great Allurements on the other, still he had the Courage and Bravery to preserve his Faith and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inviolable. And when his Religion was brought to the Test and Tryal, 'tis manifest, That the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Religion were so strong and well-grounded in him, that no power of Art, or force of Disputation, could alter or controul 'em, not the greatest Subtilty and cunning Sophistry of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> could win upon him, or so far insinuate any contrary Perswasion into his Mind, as in the least to stagger him in his Faith: but he continued firm and stedfast to his first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and came off a brave, stout Confessor, and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Faith and Religion for which his Father died a Glorious Martyr. So that Mens Fears of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery coming in, upon a Suspicion of their Prince's Firmness and Constancy to the Protestant Religion, is (to say no worse) very unkind and uncharitable, and a Diminution to that Glory he did himself and the Protestant Religion, when he stood out and maintained his Ground under so great a Tryal of Afflictions and Temptations too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mens Fears of Popery coming in, upon a Suspicion of a Change of Government, are highly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>The Protestant Religion is now of long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among us, and is so united and incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Government of the State, that Church and State must live and fall together. And such was the Care and Policy of those who attempted the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35290:17"/>
that they so ordered the matter, as to make it Mens temporal Interest to preserve and stand up for the Protestant Religion, by alienating the Church-Lands and Revenues into the Hands of the Laity; so that now most of the best and greatest Estates in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> consist and lie chiefly in those Lands which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonged wholly and entirely to the Church. So that it is against one of the most common and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Maxims, which is, That Men will be of that Religion which is most for their present Interest, to think that ever the People of this Nation will desire or consent to a Change of Government, when by that means they will hazard their Estates, and be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of losing all. If, indeed, the coming in of Popery would be for Mens Advantage, and add to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, for ought I know, vast Numbers would be tempted to embrace it. But, when it will so indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their Fortunes, if not beggar 'em quite, I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe, or imagine, That the People of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have either Lands or Brains, will change or turn to Popery, whatever they may turn to else. Besides, the Protestant Religion, as I hinted before, is now of a considerable Standing among us, and has had time to settle, which it had not when People flew off from it in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days. Then the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was in a great measure imperfect, and but in its Infancy, and it was impossible it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd and ratified when People had only some small Taste and Relish of it, as now it is, by so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Laws in the Successions of several Princes; and therefore it was no wonder that People were so soon perswaded to turn off a new Religion, and revert to the old one, But now that we are grown better acquainted with the Protestant Religion, and are so well convinc'd of its great Excellency and Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35290:17"/>
in comparison of the <hi>Romish,</hi> it will be a hard thing to introduce Popery at this time of Day; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, such is the Genius of this Nation, That when they take to a thing, especially to Religion, they will not leave or part with it, if they can possibly help it. and so it is that the Protestant Religion has had the good Fortune to be most agreeable to their Minds and Perswasions, of any Religion in the World: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, considering it is their great <hi>Diana,</hi> none that knows the <hi>English</hi> Zeal and Resolution, in matters of Religion, will be so hardy or foolish as to attempt to change or ravish it from 'em. And besides this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be a Change of Government, which must be effected by a Change of Religion, there must be such a repealing of Laws, and Alteration of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and such vast Changes, as are not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Revolutions of an Age: so that although some Men may fear the coming in of Popery, yet if it be considered what a great and strange Alteration there must be, both in the Constitutions of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the very Temper of the People, in all humane Probability, it can never prevail in our days. And, tho some People are possess'd with such mighty Fears of Popery, and its prevailing among us, yet, if I may speak my Mind freely, and without Offence, I see more Reason to fear, that, according to the Atheism and Wickedness of the Times, we shall come shortly to be of no Religion at all.</p>
            <p>Fear is one of the most boundless and ranging Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to Humane Nature, and which prevails more or less according to the Variety and Difference of Mens Tempers and Constitutions; but, where it meets with a Person whose Faculty of Imagination is quicker and more operative than ordinary, there it swells and multiplies, even to the transforming every
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35290:18"/>
weak and idle Fancy into a prodigious Monster and Bugbear. And therefore 'tis observed, That those who appear so mightily afraid of the Introduction of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among us, are a sort of People that are naturally suspicious and jealous of every thing, in whom Fear is the most prevailing and governing Passion: and therefore, as to the Business of Popery, if People will indulge their Fears and Jealousies, 'tis certain they may as much fear a thing that will never come as that which may come: so that there is no such way to cure some Peoples desperate. Fears of Popery, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise them to consult their Reason touching the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Events, more than their Passions, which are often very vain and extravagant.</p>
            <p>And now, though I am convinc'd I have done my Duty both to God and Man, in preaching upon this necessary and material Subject of Loyalty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet I fancy that some People may object against this Discourse, for no other Reason, but because it is a Sermon of that Nature and Strain; and perhaps, judge it unreasonable and improper for such an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, where none but Loyal and conformable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are suppos'd to be. This, indeed, is such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and silly Cavil, that I could hardly believe any such thing, but that I know it to be true, for People to cry out, that a Sermon is unseasonable and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, only because they have no mind to hear of a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they have no Mind to practise. And 'tis certain, that those that so flounce and carp at a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Loyalty, and Obedience to Authority, must have a sore place somewhere, some little Ailing and Infirmity of Mind and Conscience, as to the Point of Loyalty, which they cannot endure should be touch'd or rubb'd up. But I am strongly of Opinion, that no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35290:18"/>
Man will ever grumble to hear handsomly of a thing he loves: and therefore I conclude, that whoever is offended at a Sermon of Loyalty and Obedience, can have no real Love or Liking to the thing it self.</p>
            <p>But in Answer to this slight and poor Cavil, I say this, That I think a Sermon of Loyalty to be always seasonable, and that Ministers are as much bound to preach it up as any other necessary Duty of Religion, whether People will hear, or whether they will forbear. And the same Objection lies against all Sermons as well as this of Loyalty: for if we preach nothing but what is new, and not tell People of their Duty because they pretend to know it already, then all preaching will soon be at an end. But we think it, as the Apostle did, meet and necessary, to put People in Mind of Loyalty and Obedience, for the same reason that we put 'em in mind of all other Duties; <hi>viz.</hi> not because they don't know 'em, but because they will not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise what they know. And moreover, I think that a Sermon of Loyalty is more especially in season at this time, considering how the World now goes, and how much the Government is threatned by a sort of Factious and ungovernable Men. And I think none of us can be too perfect in this Lesson of Obedience; and perhaps some People may not be so perfect as they take themselves to be; and 'tis a Sign that they need to be taught Loyalty, when they cannot endure to hear of it, and appear so very uneasie and nettled at a Discourse that tends that way. But let not such Persons flatter themselves with an Opinion of their great Loyalty, when they resent it so very ill to be told of it; for, this Impatience and Dislike must needs proceed from Lukewarmness, and a very cold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Love of Obedience to Authority. Indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some Mens bitter way of arguing, no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35290:19"/>
can be very pleasing; and perhaps it may occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some People to fly quite off from their Duty which they had but little mind to before. And therefore, I have all along been careful not to offend any through hot and fiery Language, or provoke 'em by hard Names and odious Appellatives, which I think mighty unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming this Sacred Place, where a Decency ought to be observed in our Words as well as Actions. Herein, then, do I comfort my self, that I have handled this Doctrine of Obedience with those gentle, but solid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that I presume the most violent <hi>Fanatick</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly quarrel at 'em, and I defie the wisest and most conceited <hi>Fanatick</hi> of 'em all, either to answer or confute 'em.</p>
