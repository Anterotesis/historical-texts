         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is our deſires to let you know, and by this <hi>Inſtrument</hi> to declare, That although for thoſe many years your <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> hath been <hi>interrupted</hi> by the late Protector, and your <hi>viſible being</hi> withheld from this Nation; yet ſo long as a <hi>Quorum</hi> doth ſurvive, notwithſtanding that, or any other interruption, your <hi>Authority</hi> abideth, and you remain the onely <hi>Legal Parliament of England,</hi> until your <hi>Legal Diſſolution;</hi> and no other Authority or Power ought to be owned or exerciſed amongſt us: and for our parts, we will neither ſubmit to, nor own any other for the <hi>preſent Authority,</hi> but Yours; and in Yours we will <hi>acquieſce,</hi> (as in the <hi>rightful Supreme Authority of England)</hi> and in no other whatſoever. And as it is our Duty to Own and Obey your Authority; ſo, it is your Duties (Providence having opened the way for you) to Return to your Truſt. It is Treaſon in us to forſake and decline your Authority, and Breach of Truſt in you not to take upon you the exerciſe thereof.</p>
            <p>You are the rightful and natural <hi>Head of our Countrey,</hi> from whence all ſubordinate Powers and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Civil are derivative, without which a Legal <hi>new Parliament</hi> cannot be <hi>called:</hi> Law and Common Right denies that to the <hi>Sword;</hi> it is inherent only in you.</p>
            <p>The Army as <hi>de jure</hi> they may not diſturbe or interrupt the <hi>Freedom</hi> of Parliaments, ſo <hi>de jure</hi> they cannot <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Parliament,</hi> nor impoſe a Government upon us: for the People of <hi>England</hi> are a free People, the true Original of their own Authority.</p>
            <p>And as the Army can neither give nor take away the right of the People, ſo neither will they any waies hinder or interrupt <hi>your Seſſion,</hi> or invade their <hi>Countries Right:</hi> for have they not like <hi>true Engliſh men</hi> appeared as one man for the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and made ſo honeſt and honourable a <hi>procedure</hi> therein, as hath united all the hearts of the honeſt and well-minded of the Nation to them? for which moſt juſt and conſciencious <hi>undertaking,</hi> we do <hi>declare</hi> our ſelves in union with them, and their friends to be our friends, their enemies our enemies; and that we will ſtand or fall with them in this their glorious enterprize. Therefore fear not their interpoſition; their intereſt and ours is all one, and we will joyntly ſtand by you and own you, as (indeed you are) <hi>the Supreme Authority of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of England</hi> (as it was eſtabliſhed at your laſt Seſſion) <hi>without King or Houſe of Lords:</hi> The ſeveral ſeeming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in this <hi>deplorable interval</hi> of your Authority, and the ſeveral Models of obtruded Government ſince, being no other, then as <hi>one continued</hi> Act of uſurpation and innovation upon the Rights of the People, and their Power of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And now the Grand Enemie and Interrupter of your Seſſion being in the Duſt, He that <hi>letted</hi> being <hi>taken away,</hi> your Authority ariſeth and reviveth; and the Army, People and Nation, of courſe retire to the <hi>Good Old Cauſe;</hi> and all that have continued or are faithful to Authority of Parliaments, <hi>invite</hi> you and <hi>call</hi> for you, and challenge the <hi>Freedom</hi> of your <hi>Seſſion</hi> as of <hi>Engliſh Right:</hi> and as you had and truly derived your firſt Seſſion from the People, ſo we preſent you with this <hi>ſignal</hi> of our <hi>unanimous Agreement</hi> for your <hi>Re-aſſembling</hi> and <hi>Seſſion</hi> at <hi>Westminster:</hi> but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to humble your ſelves, and repent truly of your great failings in your laſt Seſſion, which were very many and grievous; but we truſt your eyes are opened, and you ſee your miſcarriages, &amp; that you will be faithful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Truſtees for the People. Indeed ſo hath the Divine Providence of God ordered the ſtate of Affairs, that your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is and muſt be, to be honeſt to the People, or you will periſh by their hand. VVe do own and acknowledge, you are the <hi>fitteſt perſons</hi> in this Nation to do the <hi>work of the People,</hi> and <hi>ſettle</hi> us in <hi>true freedom and peace;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hearts of the <hi>good people</hi> are towards you, and invite you: do but you <hi>appear,</hi> and all the Court-Policies and Practices will end in that <hi>moment,</hi> your enemies will be quite defunct and defeated; Plots and Deſigns, Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Invaſions will be prevented, our Diviſions and Diſtractions will be compoſed; and we ſhall return <hi>to ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>ſafety;</hi> otherwiſe both Army and Navy, Nation and People, will be all confounded, ruined and loſt.</p>
            <p>But in Caſe of your <hi>Aſſembly again,</hi> we deſire, That at your firſt <hi>ſitting down,</hi> you may <hi>aſcertain</hi> a <hi>time</hi> for your <hi>ending,</hi> and for the <hi>Succeſsion</hi> and <hi>Beginning</hi> of a <hi>new Repreſentative;</hi> and ſo ſettle the Foundations of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our Parliaments may be Succeſſive, and of Courſe, with their certain times of their Beginning and Ending; and with ſuch Boundaries, Limitations and Powers, as all Arbitrarineſs in Government may be prevented, and the Rights and Freedoms of the People ſecured. And we ſhall (together with your and our faithful Army) ſtand or fall with you, in the neceſſary and juſt Defence of your Perſons and Authority.</p>
