         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer to the Sope-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Complaint, &amp;c,</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His morning I being abroad about my affaires,
I met with a scandalous Pamphlet, entituled
as before; and finding therein severall things
reflecting upon the Honor of the Parliament,
&amp; the Committee for regulating the Excise, as
also some aspersions and untruths, cast upon
particular men; I shewed it to some eminent persons, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
in place, and able in judgment, than any subscriber,
who quickly perceived by the Language, who was the Author,
and desired me to give an answer to what was materiall.</p>
            <p>And now to his first objection against me, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,</p>
            <p>It is an easie matter to raise money by way of Excise, but
the difficulty is to doe it justly.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, if it be just in the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
which is the Supreme Authority of this Common-wealth, to
impose a legall tax by way of Subsidy, Fifteens, Custome and
Excise, or otherwise, (which is undeniable, except you will
argue against principles) whether those men the Parliament
shall imploy duely and without partiality, to collect and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Imposition so put, without breach, or altering any
of their Ordinances or Acts in that kind provided; whether in
justice, these men are guilty of the oppression and ruine of
those people, upon whom it is imposed, for their due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that act, I leave to the impartiall Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>But here is <hi>Anguis in Herba,</hi> he first would lop the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and then <hi>pedi tente</hi> root and branch, first take away the
Collectors, then the Assessors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35825:3"/>He saith next, which they never look after or speake of, it
being their maxiome or principle, so they get mony they care
not how.</p>
            <p>It is my maxiome and principle, which I have ever obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not to question the power of Parliament, that belongs
not to me, but allwaies to submit to that power which so well
protects me from such turbulent spirits.</p>
            <p>Next he saith, it's true the King made the Sope-makers pay
above 30000 li. a year.</p>
            <p>I say it's false, the King made them not, for they bought
the Patent of the former Patentees, the white Sopemakers, and
for it gave 40000 l. that they might become immediate Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
to the King.</p>
            <p>Next he saith, And there is no doubt, but the same princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he went upon, such men as the proposers are.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, tis true he went upon the same principle
of such men as you the Objectors are, which were <hi>propriis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonis,</hi>
reall actors in that businesse.</p>
            <p>And next with him I joyne, that I hope our eyes shall never
see that destruction and ruine of the Parliament, as we have
upon the King, &amp;c. And further I hope God will defend them
from the calumnious pens, and tongues of such men, as not
many moneths agoe would have rendered them odious to the
people, and at that time have subjugated them (if possible
those designs had come to passe) to the insolent power of a
confused multitude, but God blasted their wicked and shirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ways, for all which their wicked practices, we need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prospective glasse, then their own Books, which had they
been owned, the Author had ere this received his most just
demerit.</p>
            <p>And for our Proposals, stile them what you will, your
tongue nor pen is no slander, but this I may say for them, that
they received a fairer Character then your large paper, and
more reality and truth appeared in them as by the honorable
Committee did appear, when severall heads of your long
speech (to be modest with you) did not appear truth.</p>
            <p>Example, you did declare, that the Excise of the materialls
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35825:3"/>
had for the time past, did for the present, and would for the
future, advance more to the benefit of the Common-wealth,
then the manufactory, this being the main pillar upon which
you had builded your long work, or Basis, hapned to be rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and by the Committee proved to your face contrary, for
the fore-past time, &amp; such like solid reasons given, that it was
likely to be less for the future, as (put you altogether) you can
never give a true answer to the contrary, and this was but by
inconsiderable summe, a matter of 9000l. these acts speak you
what you are, I passe on to enquire, how the due execution
of a legall power of 7. years establishment, should all of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
put the people to shake off their Governors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and truly this I cannot finde, except it be by such as have
your spirit, which are never contented with any thing, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
your many changings from one party to another, in both
Parliament and Army.</p>
            <p>And how any of our Proposals, look with a species to set
the Prince upon his Fathers Throne, I know not.</p>
            <p>But here you appear like your selfe, a Firebrand in the
Commonwealth, If you be the man (to conclude in your
phrase) whose name I have seen subscribed to many a scurril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
pamphlet; and so much for your first Proposition.</p>
            <p>And as for your second, wherein you desire to know, how
the worke must be done, if it be not in the road the King
troad in? Alas good Man, you must be better practised in
in your trade, your partners may do well to instruct you,
you are an ingenious Pupill, and would learne quickly; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
the way is honest, or else you had knowne it; some
of your partners knew the Kings pathes to a haire, and have
walked therein yeare after yeare; and if a man would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a president to do evill, and answer your own words, to
destroy Houses and Goods, and to ruine the Poore, he
must tread in those steps your Brethren have done, which
how dangerous and clamorous that hath been, I leave to be
determined by those that in a short time will take it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
which are much wiser, and are in greater power
then You or I.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35825:4"/>Then next you admit that a Toleration be given to all in
City and Countrey to make Soap; it is impossible for those
that have fixed houses to pay Excise exactly and not break, as
the Proposers have done, say you.</p>
            <p>To which I answer; leave shall be given to all in City and
Countrey to make Soap, no restraint from any, no not from
so very a—as your worship, but make till you break, which
would not have been very long, if those you most calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
have abused, had not proved your best friends; and
therefore hereafter pray for my Lord Generall CROM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WELL.</p>
            <p>And for the fixed houses in <hi>London,</hi> I know no reason why
their owners should not joyn with me which really endeavour
the restauration of the Trade to <hi>London,</hi> by a due and exact
execution of the Acts of Parliament, without either addition
of Excise, or further penalty then is already prescribed; so
that every one may pay exactly and not break no more then
I: which I do abhorre from your calumnious pen, and dares
to tell it to you, that you unjustly slander me, as hereafter
may to your cost appear; but you have abused far better men
then my self, God forgive you for both, and for the future
I resolve to follow the example of that honourable person
forenamed, to reward you good for your evil, if it ever be
in my power.</p>
            <p>But now to your hundred of pans so lately set up, though
I beleeve not one half, yet some more may be then I imagine,
because divers of your most eminent Subscribers have of late
set up just such as you speak of, and I do verily beleeve to the
same purpose, that they might pay the lesse Excise; but for
any power to break open dores, or oppresse the poor, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it to all the world, I had rather suffer then do injury to
another, neither was it ever my practice, or ever shall be to
run any desperate course, or cause others so to doe in these
troublesome times, (to answer your words verbatim) which
may prove of dangerous consequence to the State, for so I
might come like you to render my self capable of a hanging.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; next you are informed that the Proposers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35825:4"/>
are Soap-makers, (I grant it) and yet upon this bare report
your slanderous pen dares render them broke, and presently
following, you say not worth two groats; I do beleeve you,
and your Partners could wish it so, but God forgive you, I
shall not much trouble my pen to vindicate my self in a thing
so well known to the contrary, yet let me tell you if such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
affirmations upon so false informations, and such
rash censures be the Levellers Tenents, into their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
let not my soul come; and yet as if you would fill full
the measure of your abominations, dares without knowledge
of the parties passe your censure of Gods judgements upon
them; but if all were true you had spoke of us, I would say
with the Prophet <hi>Micah, Rejoyce not against me, O my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for though I fall, I shall rise again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next you affirm your confidence is, we will not stand to
it, nor can give security for our performance of it.</p>
            <p>To both which I say thus; in that we would not stand to it,
your eyes and ears were sorrowfull witnesses that your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has deceived you, and that to your face before a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and honourable Committee; and for our security, I can
if there were any necessity for it, bring more honest, lesse
turbulent, more able, lesse insolent men then your self, to be
responsible security for the true performance of what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and so much for your second.</p>
            <p>Now for the third, which you say to your understanding
runs thus; indeed I imagine your wits are but weak, and
sometimes may run a wooll-gathering, but I hope we shall
not walk in any crooked &amp; rigorous ways, for that would not
agree with my Motto, which is <hi>to walk in the light purely and
surely;</hi> and so thereby shall be able to give a better answer
to the State, then all your following lines but the last, sets
forth; not one of which is worth the answering: but in a
word, we will double the Excise with lesse charge then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
yea, or the breach or altering any Ordinance or Act
of Parliament in that kind provided, no nor offer injury in
the least to any man, if the State shall think us worthy the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and I am confident nothing troubles neither you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35825:5"/>
or your Partners more, then the fear of the employment of
able men in that businesse; for set a Thief to catch a Thief, is
sometimes State-policy. Sir, and for the information you
give of the Bobber at <hi>Bow,</hi> I am not sensible that of late you
have don the State any greater service: but catch him napping,
and take half for your pains; then I undeniably conclude
with you, as you of us, that neither you nor we, will or can
work for nothing.</p>
            <p>And one thing let me tell you by the way, I believe you have
not got much by bobbing.</p>
            <p>Well, but here I must resolve a riddle, as it seems to mee,
you tell them of our great houses, and a great Trade, and that
we may prove the great ones we talk of to devour the little
one; what a great Trade, and great house, and yet not worth
two groats? heres a mystery to me, and broke too; well I passe
it by for present, but if I knew but at this day what you were
worth, which for any thing I know may not be much (and
there is some hazard too, as it may happen in the keeping of it)
I could give a neer guess (if you continue your bobbing trade)
how long it would be ere you broke, for I know some that
joyn with you in subscribing, that outwit you there, and being
alwaies ready to helpe on another at a dead lift, will rather
then faile, give you a heave too. I advise you beware and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, when any one of them buyes a good bargain, and

error.</p>
            <p>Well, next you tell the Parliament of their great streights,
and the cause of the Excise, they know all this as well as you,
and I beleeve would not have continued it thus long, had not
urgent necessities of the Commonwealth required it, and all
this evill is caused by turbulent Spirits (God keep you quiet)
and therefore seeing the case so stands, make a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and pay this the Parliaments legall Imposition duely
and truly, and as your Petition hath it freely and willingly,
all which your carriage in this businesse declares you doe? but
how, I leave the World to judge. Indeed your words and
deeds seldome agree; submit then to the present power, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35825:5"/>
threaten not the Parliament, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Committee, as may be easily
gathered in your 7. last lines, where you pretend to seek ease
and redresse, but meet with honest proposals, which if they
countenance, what you will doe God knowes, but a world of
clamors followes, I doe therefore in love to your person ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you to submit to a legall power, and forbear to lay plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
and ground-works to ill-minded people, which may doe
more hurt than ever you did good, and so much for your 3d.
and 4th. Proposition or interjection be it what you please.</p>
            <p>Now followes wonders, for in your last line, I find most
Honorable and Worthy Senators: here's a Title indeed, good
God keep you in this mind, I fear 'tis too good to hold; it is
not long since you rendered them in other words, but keepe
you there, and you hear no more of me, I will ee'n leave you
while you are in good mind to your reasons, and proposalls so
reall and certainly gaining to the Nation, (this is new with you
too) which I beleeve hath not appeared so to the Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Committee for regulating the Excise by their answer to
your papers and my words (which follow now in writing) for
I finde not their answer in all your book, therefore I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
it modestly in mine, to whom, by their wisdome and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide
judgment it more properly belongs, and for ever bid you
adieu having spent 3. whole hours upon your paper this 24th.

            <p>1 THat till the totall, of so much be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as was the last yeare, we the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
will expect no sallarie.</p>
            <p>2. That to make that double which
we will engage to doe, we shall only
expect 2. s. <hi>per</hi> pound, and that not out of that bare
summe, but out of the overplus which shall be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
above the double.</p>
            <p>3. That whatsoever we bring in to the State or
Commissioners above the double of the last years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
we for our extraordinary pains and industry in
it, may have a fourth part.</p>
            <p>4. That there be a reasonable allowance for under

            <p>
               <hi>Whereby these ensuing Benefits will inevitably
follow, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To the State a far larger advance of the Excise than
formerly.</p>
            <p>2. To the Trade, the great ones shall not be, so
much as formerly, enabled to destroy the inferior
sort.</p>
            <p>3. That upon no man whatsoever there shall be any
oppression or injury to him, but a Commutative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
shall flow equally to all, according to the true
intent and meaning of all former Ordinances and Acts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35825:6"/>
of Parliament in that kind provided.</p>
            <p>4. That nothing shall be altered in the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
by Ordinance and Acts of Parliament,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These Inconveniences will certainly fall upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the Excise from Soap to the Materials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Though it may appear to this Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
that whereas there is great quantities of all sorts
of Oyle brought into this Common-wealth, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
whereof may amount to a considerable sum of
money, in Sweet, Whale, Holland, Train, Newland
and Pitchard Oyles, a great part of all which, are used
for other commodities, then Soap, as Lamps, Curriors,
Wool-combers, Stuffe-weavers and Clothiers, upon
all or any of which, if you put a greater Excise, you
ruine the poor, and undoe the Trades.</p>
            <p>2. Tallow is used for severall uses then Soap, as
Curriours, Chandlers, and Shipping, in all which
there will be far greater difficulties in gathering the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
then as it now stands.</p>
            <p>3. And for Pot-Ashes, If you shall put any Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Impost upon them, it will much dis-encourage
the Merchants, prejudice both Custome, and Excise,
increase the poor, decay Sea-men, and Shipping, and
cause great quantities of Ashes to be made here at
home, which in fine, you will finde much prejudiciall
to this Common-wealth; for in making much, they
make bad; and when none was made here, or but few,
it rendred this Kingdome as then, in a better condition
then now, when so great quantities are made.</p>
            <p>For a further and more satisfactorie Answeri, I humbly offer
to this honourable Committee these eight Queries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

            <head>Eight Queries, presented to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Committee for Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Excise, <hi>October</hi> 23. 1650, in
answer the Sope-makers Petition.</head>
            <byline>By John Walker.</byline>
            <p>1 THat it may please your Honors to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
whether in all their long Paper,
containing to sheets close writ, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to our few lines, if they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
any thing for the advance of
the State, and whether there appear not a greater
measure of selfe interest in their proposals, than in
ours?</p>
            <p>2. That your Honors seriously consider; whether
their proposals or ours, tend most to the prejudice of
the Common wealth?</p>
            <p>3. Whether the altering of the Excise, from the
Manufactory of Sope, unto the Materialls; or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
of it <hi>statu quo,</hi> will most advantage the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, in point of Trade, Custome, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise?</p>
            <p>4. Whether they, or we, appear to have put greater
oppression upon the peopl of this Common-wealth,
they in giving to the late King 18s. 8d. <hi>per</hi> Barrel, or we
which endevour only the due execution of a legal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of 4s. 8d. <hi>per</hi> Barrell, to preserve a Common
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35825:7"/>
wealth, according to the true intent and meaning of
severall Ordinances, and Acts of Parliament in that
kinde provided, to the intent no man should be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
no man oppressed, but every maker to pay his
proportion, <hi>rato pro rato?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. How these men intend the advance of the Excise,
which have already bought up the gratest part of the
Ashes in Town, upon the bare supposall of altering it,
whereby they might both defraud the State of their due
and be able to undersell, and consequently ruine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
sort, that must buy for the future?</p>
            <p>6. Whether the East Countrey Merchants did not
(upon a Petition formerly by these men presented for
this purpose) give a plenarie satisfaction to the House
of Commons, that it might not be laid upon Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ashes;
whereby at that time their designe was laid
aside?</p>
            <p>7. Whether that part of their Paper be true or false,
which Declares, <hi>the Pole, Casocks, and Tartars at Peace,
wherby</hi> (say they) <hi>great store of Ashes will be imported;</hi>
when it is well known to some here, that their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
there is great, and the Wars in that very place,
where usually Potashes were made; so that but few or
none will come from thence, and so you will seem to
put the Excise upon a bare shadow, rather than sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>8. Whether it will not apparently alter the whole
Fabrick of your 7 years buil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, when almost all
Trades may as justly petition as these men, for altering
of it from the Manufactory, to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> so
you may, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> alter it from the shoulders of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35825:8"/>
one party to another, if you listen to such men as are
never satisfied when they are well, and not contented
with any thing but what they contrive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though never so distructive to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>The Answer that was returned by the Honourable
Committee, whereof Colonell <hi>George Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi>
hath the Chair, <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. 1650.</p>
            <p>GEntlemen, I am appointed to deliver you the opinion
of the Committee, in this businesse. First, that they do
not take notice of any part of your Paper, wherein you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the proposers, for we find in them matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and advance to the Commonwealth, and must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them as good Commonwealths men. And to you I say
we have perused your Papers and Accounts, and find you
in an error; for here we finde, that the advance upon the
Materialls, falls short of the Manufactory by 9000 l. and
and this when we had a free trade from forraine parts, and
now our Seas may be troublesome, and so not so much of
the materialls come in, whereby it is possible and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be lesse, and if it fell short by so much when Soap
made lesse then for the future it is like to doe, when it is
doubled; we shall present both to the Parliament, and
leave them to determine, more may be said but we shall
report it to the House.</p>
