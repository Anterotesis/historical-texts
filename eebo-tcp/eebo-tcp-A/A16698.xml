            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For fyrst he telleth that miracle whyche Iesus

shewed by fedyng so many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men in the desert: after that he reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an excellente Sermon, whyche Christe made of true fayeth in hym. And verely he sheweth the matter in a mete and decent order. For Iesus Christ would not put forth his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne to the herers, naked and bare, but wel defensed wyth diuers mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that by them, as it were by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wytnesses, the trueth and hys authoritye myghte boeth be opened and also established. We haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed also before that Christe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme vsed his miracles as belles, to call the herers to sermon, and stirre theym vp to take the better hede. Wherefore fyrste of all let vs also heare the sound of hys bell, that is, the historye of hys miracle done in the deserte, that we may take the bet ter hede aswel to the sermon whyche foloweth after, as to al the doctryne
<pb facs="tcp:23129:10"/>
of Christe, whyche must be lerned by fayeth.<hi> After this sayeth the euaungelist: Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus went ouer the sea of Galile whych is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tiberias, and a great multitude folowed <note place="margin">T</note> him, because they dyd se his miracles whyche he dyd vpon them that were sicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be thoughte that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus strayte after hys Sermon, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is all wrytten in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, went secretly away ouer the sea of Tiberias, but as the other Euau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gelistes testify, he went awaye wyth hys Apostles into a desert place, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had sente theym before to preache the Gospell, and had gyuen theim power to cast oute deuils, and to heale sycknesses, and that nowe they were come agayne, and had she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed al that they had done &amp; taught: Iesus then takyng them wyth hym departed aside ouer the sea of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, in Galile, vnto a desert place of the citie, whych is called Bethsauda, and sayed vnto theym: rest a litle, for

there were amonge them that wente and came, and had not so muche ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as once to eate theyr meate.</p>
            <p>Wherfore he wyth hys Apostles, went asyde from the people, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge refreshed they myghte come a gayne to their busynes cherefullye For in thys weaknes of man, which Iesus also hadde taken vpon hym, what is durable that lacketh the course of reste? But yet not by thys neyther coulde they haue quietnes, for whan the people had perceyued that Iesus wyth hys Apostles dyd take hys iorney into the desert, they were so desirous to se him, and heare hym, that some in dede went into the deserte before hym, and some folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed after.

They thynke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by theyr owne meanes, they can lyghtlye get heauenly iustice &amp; health if they may once get earthly felicitie. Let god, sai they, gyue me life and riches, and as for a good mynde I wyll get it my selfe. But this is a very corrupt and euell opinion. For that iustice that standeth in the syght of God, cannot be gotten by mannes strengthe, nor cannot be founde in riches, in ease, or pleasures of thys world, but it is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly founde in Iesus Christe, and is gotten by fayeth, whiche is giuen to Iesus Christe, and hys Gospell, not in dede that thereby thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest gette yearthlye filicitye, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuenes of synnes, and helthe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng.

And sith it is so, let vs heare of hys miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Iesus wente into the mountayne, and there sate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys Dysciples. And the passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the Iewes holiday was nie. So when Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus hadlyft vp his eyes, &amp; had sen, that muche
<pb facs="tcp:23129:13"/>
people came vnto hym, he said e vnto Philips whence shal we by breade that these may eat? And he sayde thys to proue hym. For he hym selfe knewe what he wold do. And Philip an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. Two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred peniworth of bread wil not suffice them that euerye man should haue alitle. One of hys Dysciples sayde vnto hym Andrewe the Brother of Symou Peter: Here is one that hath fyue Barlye loues and two fyshes, but what be these amonge so many? And Iesus sayed. Make these men sit downe. And there was muche grasse in that place: so they sat downe, almoste fyue thousand men in number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The miracle, that Iesus fedde in the deserte wyth fyue loues and two fyshes more then fiue thousand men and the whyche the Euangelist hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand to discribe is great and worthy to be remembred and euen of the men them selues so muche set by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that moued therewyth they woulde haue made Iesus a kynge, whyche was the doar of the miracle. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the descripcion of it is diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be marked, and discussed, that
<pb facs="tcp:23129:13"/>
the trueth of it may be vnto vs most certayne. And fyrst as touchyng the wryter hym selfe Iohn the Apostle and Euangeliste, there is no douqte but he is most worthy to be beleued. And to beare witnes with him come thre other Euangelistes, Mathewe, Marcke and Luke, whych eche one haue described thys miracle of the. v loues and. ii. fyshes. In the mouthe of two or thre standeth al wytnes.</p>
            <p>And they haue described thys mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not forgynge it among them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and layinge theyr heades toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in diuers places and tymes and specially then, when as yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were alyue, which if they had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these thynges, coulde haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them liers. Further Iohn wyth greate diligence doeth reherse all the circumstaunce of thys miracle. He sheweth the place, that is, the deserte beyond the sea of Tiberias in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:14"/>
He sheweth also the tyme of the yere, saying: the feast of Easter was nye, the feaste of the Iewes. Some also haue marked y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tyme of the day, saying: the day began to go downe. There be shewed also witnesses of thys so great a miracle, for ther wer present the Apostles, among whom Christ chieflye disputed the matter with. ii. of them, that is, with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip and Andrewe. There were also almost v. thousand men beside wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children: al the which true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if nede had ben, could haue open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie borne witnes of this miracle.</p>
            <p>Ihon also dothe rehearse what the ground brought forth in that place. Ther was ther saith he, much gras. All these circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist so dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly reherseth, to tel vs plain lie, that in no wise he forged the tale of this miracle, but that he put in writynge a thynge that was done moste certeinlie. Beside thys he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
<pb facs="tcp:23129:14"/>
the fashion also, how Christ toke in hand to do this miracle. For Christe by his inuisible power, hathe saued all them that folowed hym to the deserte without external meate, that they shulde not peryshe wyth ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, as in time past Moses and Elias were saued, &amp; he also hym selfe in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> desert. lx. dayes &amp;. lx. nygh tes. He might also by his inuisible power haue put bread into eueri one of their laps vnloked for, but se what he doth. In dede he knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther was a great multitude of men, he knewe what thinges hongry men had nede of, &amp; he thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how to fede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> He said this, saith the euangeliste, to proue him, for hym selfe knew what he wold do: &amp; he set not meate before these ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, but dissimu led al thinges, &amp; so behaued him self as though he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no kepe at al of this matter. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the euening drue nie, and Christ semed to thinke
<pb facs="tcp:23129:15"/>
vpon farre other thinges, se then the disciples busilye preassed and cryed vpon hym, to sende awaye the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the villages and stretes that were nexte by, that they myght bye them some meat. Yet not for al this did Christ shewe that he tooke any care to fede these ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry, but went on as though he cared not, saying: geue them sumwhat to eate. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> disciples by this answere getting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to declare their wisdom &amp; shewe their pouertie: What (quod they) shuld we fede so great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? Twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty or. xxx. pieces of golde wer scant inough for vs to bie bread And who shulde paye vs so great a su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money, &amp; although we had it in our chest, what? woldest y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haue vs laye it out for other men &amp; lacke our selues? Here Christ, as thoughe him selfe had doubted and neded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens counsell, spake vnto Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip alone, sayinge: whence shall we
<pb facs="tcp:23129:15"/>
bye bread that these men maye eate, what thinkest y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> is beste to be done? But Philip referred him self to the mynde of his felowes, sayinge: I iudge plainly as my felowes do, for although we bought as much bread as wolde cost. xxx. peces of gold, yet wold it not be inough euery man to haue a litle. How many loaues haue you then quod Christ? And Andrew told him that ther was a yong man amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche had. v. barley loaues &amp;. ii. fyshes. But not by thys meanes neyther semed the matter to be holpen, but what be these among so many? Marke I praye you howe constantly Christ dissimuled the en tente of his mynde, &amp; what compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he vseth afore he fede y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hongrie: what shal we saye then? Did Christ take so long deliberacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his dis ciples, because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either he knewe not what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people lacked, or either wold or could not remedye theyr honger?
<pb facs="tcp:23129:16"/>
Nothing so verily but he wold that the lacke of bread shuld be manifest and knowen, that the greatnes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> miracle whiche he wolde do, mighte wel be knowen. For seinge the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels shuld be teachers of the gospel of Christ, and witnesses of his dedes thorowe all the worlde, it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that they shuld thorowly se and perfitly know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles of Christ. Here is an other thynge also to be marked. For Chryste the sonne of God teacheth vs by this dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; prolongyng to do the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, for what purpose God is wonte sometyme, althoughe he be long cal led vpon, &amp; weried with many prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to defer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe and deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce longe tyme. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did euer se God sayth the Euangelist, the only sonne that is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bosome of his father, he hath shewed hym. And agayne: No man knoweth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> father but the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Wherfore in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sonne of God which
<pb facs="tcp:23129:16"/>
is Iesus Christe, the wyll of God muste bee knowen, and his counsell seene. And we see in thys place the sonne of God to tarye longe in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge the hongrye, and yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniente time, he feedeth them after a meruelouse fashion. And euen so playnely be the maners of oure hea uenlie father: for he is wont to seme almoste deafe at the praiers of good men, and to take no care to saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what purpose dothe he that? <note place="margin">God se meth deafe to the pray er of good men.</note> For that, that he heareth the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of good men and wyll not saue vs? God forbidde. What thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges so euer, sayth he, you shall axe in your prayers, and beleue, ye shall haue them. And againe: I wyll heare them beefore they crye, and heare them whyle they be yet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge. And agayne: Call vpon me in the daye of tribulacion, and I wyll deliuer thee, and thou shalte ho noure me.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:17"/>
God therefore called vpon in fayeth slacketh in gyueynge healpe: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wyl not saue you; but he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth first that by this delay he wold stire vp in the trobled a greter desier to cal vpon hym, that is, to do trewe godly honoure. For the more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, the more ye serue God. And we are made for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to worshippe oure Lorde God. Sertainely he tarieth to geue to the afflicted greater benefites, whereby both the afflicted may get greater fe licitie, and the glorye of the name of God maye be more shewed out. For as a graine that is caste in the grounde is not loste, thoughe it be couered wyth yearth and to dye, but rather is encreased, whyche in the haruest tyme apereth manifestlye: so <note place="margin">Praiers of fayeth.</note> the praiers put in the bosome of god thorowe fayeth, are not in vayne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they seme not to be hard, but in their conuenient tyme they bryng

Could not the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue eate, excepte they fyrste had sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? yes they coulde. But as we said before, the lacke of bread ought to be knowen also to the people, that the miracle myght be the more euident.

So here their lacke was opened, and they were quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to looke that Christ shulde geue them meate. Yea the order of theyr sitting made the miracle more to be

marked. So when these thinges were thus prepared, Iesus beganne to worke the miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For he tooke breade, and after he had geuen thankes he distributed them to his disciples, and the disciples to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were set downe. Lykewyse of the fishe asmuche as he wolde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We maruayle what Christ ment by bidding them sit doune, and now we more marueile what this ceremo nie of thankes geuing meaneth: for he dealt not the bread before he had fyrst lifte vp his eyes to heauen and gaue open thankes in the sight of al <note place="margin">Christe ueth th kes.</note> men. What nede had Christ to these ceremonies? Is not he the worde of god and god him self? He spake and thinges were made, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, and they were created. Whye nowe therfore saye but euen a worde that the loaues myghte be multiplied? Christ myght not only if he had spo ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but one worde, but euen also by a thought only haue multiplied these loaues, but it plesed him to vse these
<pb facs="tcp:23129:20"/>
ceremonies first to shew in the sight of the people that he taughte them none other God, but hym the true God, maker of heauen and earth: &amp; that he did not his miracles by iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyng, but by heauenlie, and power of God. Moreouer he wolde teache vs what gyuinge of thanckes was, and how muche it was hable to do. For wher Iohn sayth, he did than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, the other saye: He blessed: for by the doinge of thanckes, the. v. loues and two fishes were so blessed increasid and multiplied, that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onlye. v. thousande men euen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> women &amp; children were aboundant ly fed, but also there was gathered xii. cophins ful of fragmentes.

Wherefore crafte and deceytes in marchandise is not that waye wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ryches are truely blessed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, but to do that ryghtely, we must learne of the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christ.

Thys is the bread, this is the meate whyche Christe woulde principallye to be sought for in hym.

For this miracle is an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly seale, wherby god dothe testifie that he wyll geue vnto euery man that walketh in the vocacion of God in faythe, sufficiente meate, drinke, and clothynge. For lyke as in a well ordered householde, the good manne of the house requireth this of his familiars bothe children and seruauntes, euerye man shulde do his duetie, and that one in deede shulde se the ground tilled, an other cutte the vine, an other wood, and some sweepe the house, and he hym selfe taketh care to prepare meate, &amp; to geue it to euerye man in due tyme thoughe not wyth hys owne hand,
<pb facs="tcp:23129:27"/>
yet at the least waye, by his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce and commaundemente.</p>
            <p>And so what could be worse, then if the seruaunt wolde set lyght by his masters commaundement, neither wolde tyll his ground, and yet take vpon hym too prouide for meate, whereby he wolde wander vp and downe to take bread? So our lorde God, he is a greate housekeper, and <note place="margin">God is the houseke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ca reth for his housholde.</note> we men are his household: And eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs hath his vocacion, his office, whiche he is ordeined of god to do. Seynge therefore that we be the householde of God, we oughte not to be thoughtful what we shuld drynke, or what clothes we shulde weare, for this care god, as master of the householde, hath taken vpon hym: but we oughte to bee carefull, howe diligentlye, howe obediently, and howe godly we do oure duetye. Let this be our worke, let thys bee oure laboure, to seke after vertue.</p>

For God sayeth he wyl not destroie wyth honger the life of a iuste man. And the Lorde knoweth the dayes of the vndefiled, and their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce shall laste for euer.

            <p>These are so muche the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye to bee considered and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, howe much the common sort of menne is wonte more to offende in getting them their liuinge. For men commonlye are thus mynded as we se that Philip and Andrewe in the declaracion of thys miracle, were. For as they thinke that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a litle money, nor a litle meate do suffise to feede so greate a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, and when they se no meate before their eies, they wot not whither to turne them: So menne when they se in getting their liuing that nothinge is lefte in earthe, they
<pb facs="tcp:23129:28"/>
thynke also that nothynge is lefte in heauen: and where mannes helpe wanteth, they suppose there also the helpe of god to lacke, and therefore they lifte not vp their minde to god, but rather turne to the craftes of the Deuell. They robbe, they steale, they trifle, they studye for deceiptes and craftes onlye, yea howe soeuer it be, to get them sustenaunce. And when they be rebuked, they make ex cuses: I must nedes, sayth one, haue to fynde me and my householde.</p>
            <p>Thou sayest well. Thy householde in deede muste be founde. But to <note place="margin">Thi house holde must bekept, but sinne thou muste not.</note> steale, and to studie for deceytes and craftes, that is not to kepe an house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, but to destroye an household: for the scripture fayth. If thou kepe not the commaundementes of God, and amonge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of god is conteined: thou shalte not steale, God shall sende famine &amp; hon ger vpon the, a cursing vpon al thy

And againe: They coulde not do <note place="margin">Deceiptes do not pro spere.</note> ryght, saith the lorde, treasuring vp iniquitie and rapine in their houses. Therefore thus saith the lorde god: The lande shall be troubled and be besieged, and thy strength shall bee drawen oute of the, and thy houses shall be spoyled. Thou seest that to take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is other mens, &amp; get riches by deceytes, is not to norishe thy selfe &amp; thy houshold, but rather to caste the into pouertie &amp; ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger.

            </p>
            <p>There be two thynges that these men take vpon them to shewe theyr kynde mynde towarde Christ. The one is that they prayse hym in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and speake openly and confesse that he was the prophet which Mo ses wrot shulde come into the world, and the which the Iewes loked for at that tyme. An other that they cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sailed among theym selues to make hym a king: for Messias is as much to saye, as one annoynted, or a kyng.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:30"/>
to the dignity of a king. And in this the peoples doynge some thynges are worthy prayse, and some thynge to be rebuked. It is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended that stiered vp by this miracle, they graunt to the doctrine of Iesus, and perceyue that he is verye Messias him selfe. But it is greately to be rebuked that they thinke the kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Messias should be a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kingdom here in this world, and that Messias shoulde rule after the facion of the kynges of thys world: and nowe they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy that they haue got a king, whych not onely is hable by hys mi racles to gather vnto hym a gret at mie, and ouercome al the world, but also by whom they may be fed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any labour of theirs, &amp; maye get al earthly felicitie. Thys opinion of Messias kingdom is carnal, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be condemned. For the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias whom the prophetes promised

is no earthly kynge. And oure bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes resteth not in this that the bo dy should fare wel, &amp; that we should rest vs carnally and sluggeshly and be fed for naught, but that we shold be well in spirite, and be fed wyth meate euerlastynge: of the whyche thynge Christe hym selfe wyl preach after wardes more at large. And not onely the carnall opinion of the peo ple of the Kyngdome of Messias, but also their lyghtnes, their waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge and inconstaunce, yea and the rashenes also of the people, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be rebuked. For they whome nowe when he fedeth them, desiar to make him a Kynge, &amp; set hym as hye as heauen, hym afterwardes whan he was led prisoner to the crosse, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dysdaynefully they dyspised, or spitefullye mocked, or euen wyth the other they cried to nayle hym on the Crosse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:31"/>
Thys is the nature of the common people that they neuer in a meane ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fauour them that do them good or hate them that they thyncke to be euel doars. Thys is a syknes and fu rie not a iudgement or sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dnes. For althoughe we oughte to be mindful and kynde towardes hym that doth vs good, &amp; hate euill, yet hath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hys boundes, that is that we do not as the Paganes haue done, to make goddes of menne, or as is the maner of the Hypocrites to do, to make of saynctes our redemers &amp; sa uiours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil: for we so must hate euyll that for all that we forget not what we oughte to do, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence not euill wyth euil, but wyth good.

kynge, by and by as Mathew sayth he compelled hys Disciples to take shyp, and to go before hym vnto the other syde of the riuer: but he hym selfe fled, and went agayne aparte in to the mountayne alone. Thou wilt say: what meaneth thys? Why doth Christe flye? Why doth he not take vpon hym a princely maiestie, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is offered hym of the people? Is the office of a kynge so abhominable afore God, that it maye not be lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take it vpon hym and beare it? Uerelye nothynge lesse.

Wherfore he that is lawfully called to offyce of a kyngs maiestye, maye with good conscience be occupied in that kynde of lyfe.</p>
            <p>But what saye you? Would Christ by thys runnynge awaye sygnifie that althoughe the office of a kynge of it selfe be exceptable to God, yet

            <p>For althoughe Christe do bydde vs folowe the example of hys humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, yet is it no humilitye, rashelye to caste awaye hys lawefull voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and to take vpon hym a more abiecte kynde of liuynge wythoute the commaundemente of God, but it is verye humilitye to serue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entelye to Goddes wyl, and hys or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce in euery vocacion be it no ble or vyle. Thus, lowlye was Iob, that is obedyent to the wyll of God aswell in ryches as in pouertye, whan he sayed: GOD hath gyuen, God hath taken awaye: the name of God be blessed. Thus was Dauyd lowlye, that is, obediente to the wyl

But if he saye, thou pleasiste me not, I am tedye: lette hym do that he thyncketh good wyth hym selfe: so Christe hym selfe the verye Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd was lowely. For whan he was called by GOD to beare hys crosse he bare it obediently. Afterwarde be ynge called to recey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e the heauenly maiestie in the kyngdome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he toke that also obedientlye. This is verye humilitie, whereby you cast not awaye your lawfull vo cacion, but that in euery lawful vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion thou obeist thy Lord thy god Wherfore Christ would not by this goynge away teache good men, that either they ought not to take vpon theim the doynge of a kinges office, if they be lawfully called vnto it, or that thei shuld rashly and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the

callynge of God cast it away, if they haue taken it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, what is the matter than, that he fled awaye, and woulde not be made a Kynge? And verelye, if you consider his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, he toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him much greater and nobler thynges, than if he had a uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced him selfe an outwarde kyng of Israell. He preached that he was the lyghte of the worlde, that he was the lyfe and resurreccion. He saied he was the sonne of god, yea and equal to God hym selfe. These thynges in dede be muche greater &amp; more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than if he had taken vpon hym the maiestye of a Kynge amongeste men. Why is it tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he refuseth thys, and taketh vpon hym that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The callynge of GOD is the cause, and his office. For Christ was not sente from heauen into yearthe for thys entente to do the office of a kyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in thys worlde, and to beare rule vpon the yearth, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of a kinge, but he was sent to be a prophet and a preacher of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <note place="margin">Christes callynge.</note> in Israell: and as Paule calleth hym, a minister of circumsicion for the truth of god, to confirme the pro mises of the fathers. For the Lorde sayeth by Moses of Christe: I wyll rayse vp a prophet in the myddes of his brethren, lyke to the, and I wyll put my wordes in hys mouthe, and he shall speake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thynges, whych I shall commaunde hym. I wyll (sayeth he) rayse vp a prophete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say a preacher, not a worldly kynge or chiefe gouernoure. And I wyl (sayth he) put my wordes in his mouth, not a corporal sweard in his hande. And he shal speake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he sayeth not, he shal correcte theym by outward and corporal violence. And in Esaye. The spirite of the Lorde is vpon me, because that he hath annoynted me, and sente me to preache the gospel to the lowely: he
<pb facs="tcp:23129:34"/>
sayeth not: He hath sente me to rule amonge men after the fashion of a Kynge, but to preache the Gospel to theym that be in sorowe and misery. For althoughe the Prophetes do sometyme so describe the kyngdome of Christe, as thoughe it were a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral kyngdom, yet is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> discripcion so defenced wyth circumstaunces ine speciallye whan they saye, that hys kyngdome shal be euerlastyng, that nedes you muste vnderstande that his kyngedome is not corporal but spirituall, neyther yearthlye but heauenly, and that he will gyue, not externall but eternal gooddes, name ly forgyuenes of synnes, eternall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, euerlastynge lyfe, and filicitye. Wherefore that Christe foloweth not the peoples mynde, and taketh not vpon hym the princely maiestie of thys worlde, and yet for all that teacheth that he hym selfe is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> verye sonne of God, yea and god hymselfe

whyche is greater than al the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye of man, boeth thynges he doeth accordynge to hys offyce, and the vo cacion of God.

whither be we brought but into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But Christ although he was far of, and that it was verye darcke, yet sawe he in what ieopardy his Dysciples were: and they had de serued in dede to be lefte in this ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdye and to haue be drowned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that boeth forgettynge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes teachynge and hys miracles, they dyd dispayre. But Christe hath a greater regarde of hys owne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodnes, than of their desert: Wherefore whan that nowe they were gone wyth greate laboure and studye aboute. xxx. furlonges, Iesus came vnto them walkynge vpon the sea, as if he had gone vpon the hard grounde. By whiche miracle he dyd not signifye that he had not a verye and naturall bodye of a man, but he signified that as he was the Lorde of heauen and yearth, so was he also the Lorde of the sea. Well what do the Disciples than? At the fyrst they
<pb facs="tcp:23129:38"/>
knowe not it is Iesus Christe, but they thinke it is a spirite: they thinke it a diuell wythoute a bodye whyche came to take from theym their lyfe. And therefore theyr feare was dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and they horriblye cryed out. Here is no fayeth, no callynge for healpe, but as the hert was blynded, so was it in despaire. For they dyd not vnderstande, as Marke sayeth, of the loues: that is they had not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by the miracle, whyche the same day was shewed wyth fyue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and two fishes, so greate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christe, that they trusted theym selues to be salfe, by hys fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, power, and healpe, aswel in the perils of the sea, as also in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell route of diuylles. But whome Christ by his commaundement had cast into perlis, those same also dyd he saue. He opened hym selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wyth hys voyce, criynge oute agayne: It is I, be not afearde:

For we ought to put oure selfe in no peril rashelye, and not called of GOD. So Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus called Peter and he walked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters: but as there came vp on hym a greate wynde, he was so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, that hys fayeth fel from hym, and beganne to syncke. But whan he had called for the helpe of Christ, in dede he was rebuked because he douted, &amp; was of a weake faieth, but Christe toke hym by the hande and saued hym. And so boeth wente in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the shyppe to the reste, and than the tempeste dyd not onelye ceasse, but the shyp was also in the hauen,

and was come to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> part of the shore from the whych it was farre of, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ came. Thou hast here a great heape of miracles: Iesus was far of from hys Dysciples, the darckenes of the nyghte was verye greate, and yet he sawe in what ieoperdye they were on the sea. This agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the miracle, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iesus saw Nathanael vnder the fig tre, and sawe Lazarus whan he was deade, beynge yet far of frome Iurye, where Lazarus dyed. And afterwardes he walked vpon the waters as vpon the drye grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: which verely was a wonder full miracle. And not onelye dyd he that hym selfe wyth hys owne body, but also he bad Peter to do the same and Peter obeyng hys wordes, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lykewyse vpon the water, and was preserued that he was not drouned: By the whyche miracle the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Christe is manifestly proued.

Finally the ship was sodaynely in that hauen to the whyche they coulde not come before wyth greate labour. These miracles be so great that the Dysciples why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be in the ship dyd worshyp hym and that worthely, as Mathew doth wryghte, and confessed him to be the verye sonne of God.

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> here is done is an image of those thynges whych are alwayes wount to be done betwixt the churche, and Christ the heade thereof. The sea is thys worlde.

In thys worlde you shall haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliccion. And againe: you shall wepe and Lamente, but the worlde shall be gladde and reioyce. And Paule sayeth we must enter in to the kyngedome of God by manye affliccions. Further Christe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye in the mountayne, and yet he sawe hys Dysciples that were in greate ieopardye. For althoughe Christ be ascended into heauen, &amp; is now inuisible to oure corporal eies, yet the churche that is in ieopardye is wel seen to of him, &amp; he is ready to healpe hys church: he taketh care for
<pb facs="tcp:23129:40"/>
it, and loketh vpon all the paynes and trobles of it to help and saue it.</p>
            <p>For he sitteth at the ryght hand of GOD, and is thee almyghtye gouernour of al thinges. Wherfore neyther heyth, nor length, nor depth can lette hym, that he shoulde not healpe hys churche beynge in paine and sorowe. But lyke as he came to hys Dysciples in the myddle of the tempest, and was thoughte to haue bene a spirite of the dyuell, that woulde haue drouned theym in the watters, so he came in dede accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in thysworlde wyth a crosse, and couered wyth diuers afflicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore in verye greate aduersitye men that be of a weake fayeth, thyncke not that Christe the sauioure is there, but a legion of dyuylles, that woulde destroye theym euen oute of hande.

Wherefore when greate troubles aryse, we must giue care to

the voice of Christe and to his gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that thereby we maye take co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, and be saued. But as Christe walked vpon the sea, and yet dyd he it not alone, but he called also Peter to do y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same. And althoughe he, whan the wynde blewe sore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hym, began to doute and syncke doune: yet whan he called vpon the helpe of Christ, he is saued, beynge caught by the hande of Christe: so Christ preached not hys owne gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel alone and confirmed it with mi racles, but he chose vnto hym Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to be hys felowes, and vnto the also he gaue the gift to do mira cles. Then after theym folowe the ministers of the church to shew out the gospell that they haue receyued of the Apostels. What hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then? That that was spoken to the Apostels: Beholde I sende you into the myddes of wolues. That sayinge stretcheth out not onelye to

the ministers, but also to the self of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of preachynge of the Gospell. For in thys worlde so greuous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, are wont to ryse agaynste the ministers of the churche, that it lacketh but a litell, to be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Therfore they that be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to weake, are diuerslye mynded, and almoste fall in dispayre. But it is happy, Christe is redy at hande: and beyng called vpon, putteth out his hande, and preserueth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterye of the churche: whych semeth to other, to be destroyed.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me what y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ende of these studyes is.

But if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worke the meate which abideth still into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, than althoughe thy body be somtyme hungry, yea I say more, die also, yet is thy soule saued.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:49"/>
Wherfore let this be our onely stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye &amp; care, let thys be our thought, to worcke meate that remayneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So thoughte certaine folyshe Hypocrites, whyche after they had shut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues vp in their <note place="margin">The slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnes of Hypocrits is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> celles, than toke meat of other men ydellye. Christe doth not teache vs this. For when he biddeth vs praie: giue vs thys daye our dayly bread, he sheweth plainlye, that we ought to seke also for bodilie meate after the facion in dede that-we shoulde seke. And Paule also: when we were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>you (saith he) we gaue you this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maundement, that if any man wold not worke he shuld not eate nether. And it foloweth: We heare say that some men order them selues among you inordinatelie, doinge no worke but lyue curiousli. To those that be
<pb facs="tcp:23129:49"/>
such we commaund you, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier you thorowe our Lorde Iesus Christ, that worcking quietlye, they wold eate their owne breade. What meaneth this than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ sayeth: worke not the meate that perisheth? He doeth not condemne an honest waye to seke for bodily fode, but he condemneth the lewde and bacward studye of men. Men are wonte to haue a greater regarde of bodilye fode than spirituall, and they more care for the health of the body than of the soule. But these thynges you must nedes do, and not leaue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vndone. That you shoulde be kepte to heauenly and euerlastyng lyfe, it is necessarye if you wyl be sa ued. But that you should be kept in thys mortal lyfe it is not necessary. Fyrst (sayeth he) seke for the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and all these thynges shall be caste vnto you. And man doth lyue not by breade onelye, but

by euery word that commeth out of the mouth of god.

In dede the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arckes serue for greate purposes, so do the prophetes and the law: But onely Messias is the true health. Abraham was a verye holye patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcke, and verie worthy prayse, and yet for Abrahams sake no man ob tayned pardon of hys synnes. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was a verye good lawe maker,

and a valiaunt Duke of the Istae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, but for Moses sake no man is saued whan he dieth. The Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were verie wel learned, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye holye preachers of the worde of God, but for the prophetes sake no man obtained the heauenlye kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Circumcision was a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable sacrament, but no man had eternal saluacion because of circum cision. The Sabbath, the sacrifices and other worckes of the lawe had their vse and profit, but for these no man came to euerlasting saluacion. Onely the sonne of man, Messias only, is the bread of life. For whom to al that beleue in hym, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forgyuenes of synnes, iustice, health, and lyfe euerlastynge: And that ryghte worthilye. For it is he whom God the father hath sealed vp. For fyrste God the father hathe sealed hym from the begynnynge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his owne Image, that he should

Wherfore seynge he is marcked wyth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne power, it is no maruayle that he is hable to saue them that beleue in hym, and to gyue vnto theym e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall lyfe. Further, after he was made the sonne of man, god sealed hym by open wytnesses, that he is the true Messias and sauiour of all them that beleue in hym. For as the seales of common writynges do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifye of the thynges that be done, whyche are rehearsed wythin the letters, so God the father testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many miracles, as it were by heauenly seales, of Iesus the sonne of Marie, that he hadde sente hym and anoynted hym vnto the true

Wherfore perfecte ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is oures, the holines and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes of Christe, is ours: in respect of whyche thynges, oure synnes be not layed to oure chaurge: and our death, whyche in thys worlde is the laste kynde of all miserye, is not the gate of hell, but of raigne euerlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge thorowe Christe. Wherefore seynge Christe is taken and graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into vs by fayeth, it is manyfest that we cannot do a more excellente and a more holye seruyce, than to be leue in Iesus Christe. And so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth also we be sayde to be iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fayth, not that fayth in Christ of it selfe is a worke of so great dig nitye, that for the worthynes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

it doth instify vs before god, but because it taketh Christ: for whom onelye we are counted iuste before god, &amp; chosen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonnes &amp; heires of god. Furthermore fayth is called the moste excellente worshyppynge of god, because it gyueth vnto God the honour of the trueth of hys pro mises, and knoweledgeth God to be verye true. For God althoughe he hath promised many other thinges as well bodilye as spirituallye, yet is thys the chiefest thynge amonge all hys promises, that he well sende Messias into thys worlde. And he hath openlye proued, and declared by greate, and manye testimonies, that thys Iesus of Nazareth is the same Messias that was promised before. Wherefore he that beleueth in hym, doeth gyue glorye to God for hys trueth. And so to gloryfye god, it is to god a thyng that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth hym farre aboue all other. It
<pb facs="tcp:23129:58"/>

For what honour shuld be acceptable to God, if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> shuldest iudge him in thy hart to be vaine &amp; a lyer? A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Finally seyng the fayth in Christe receyueth euen together with Christ the holy goste also, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the renuer of man, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of obedience in man, it is playne that fayth is the fundacion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge of all good vertues and
<pb facs="tcp:23129:58"/>
good doynges. Other that haue not fayeth in Christe, are sometyme garnyshed wyth other vertues: one is iust in ciuile bargaines, another is pacience in aduersitye, this man is chast, he is gentell to speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that man is mercifull to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and some man is true of hys worde and promise. These be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues, and he that hath one it maye happen that he lacketh all the other.</p>
            <p>For you shal fynde that wher as they wyl kepe theyr promise wel, yet are they very cruell to them that be in misery. Ye shall fynd other, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che for all that they kepe a ciuile chastitye, yet are they verye lyars. But he that hath fayeth in Christe he also hath the holye Gooste, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che leadeth hym into all kyndes of vertues, and good doynges.</p>
            <p>For althoughe fayth so far forth iustifieth not a man before God as
<pb facs="tcp:23129:59"/>
is the begynnynge of good workes in a man, and that ther is alwayes left a weaknes in the fleshe as long as we lyue in thys world, although the holy gooste gouerne a man, yet is not that spirite of faieth idle and dull, but worketh stoutely, it morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the desier of the flesh, &amp; bryng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth diuers kyndes of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, charitye, ioye, peace, lenitye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nygnitie, goodnes, truth, mekenes, temperaunce, chastitye, and who is able to reherse all the fruites of the spirite? Wherefore fayeth in Christ for thys cause also is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worshyppyng of God, because it is the begynnynge, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion of all good worckes: and he that wyll do the holiest worcke to God, he muste nedes worcke thys worcke also. For thys is the hyest seruynge of God whych the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes and Prophetes and all good men haue done. By this seruice, thei
<pb facs="tcp:23129:59"/>
haue gotten iustice and health, as manye as were receyued to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure of god. They were not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the desert of circumcision, of theyr sabbothes, of their sacrifices, nether yet of theyr morall vertues, but the were iustified by thys ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that is by fayeth in Christe, and yet that not for the desert of the worcke of fayeth, whyche worcke yet itselfe is wonte euen in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuer to be fainte, but for Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, whych is grafted into man tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe fayeth and applyed vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But thou wylt say, what? If to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christ it be the hiest and the most excellente worshipping of god, than is nothing more easye, than to do thys seruyce to God, inespecially to vs whyche euen from our youth haue bene instructed in the Apostles Crede, wherein all the doctryne of fayeth is shortly contayned.

Thys was in dede an excellente benefite, and very acceptable to the Iewes that were afflicted, but yet was it not a verie deliueraunce: for although they were deliuered from the tirauntes of Egypte, yet were they not deliuered from there spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tyrauntes, that is from synne, the diuyll, death and hel. But Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias bryngeth true deliueraunce.</p>
            <p>For to theym that beleue in him, he forgeueth synnes, and causeth, that they whyche receyue hym thorowe fayth, are counted iust before God. He ouercommeth the deuyll, and so deliuereth the seruauntes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl, that they be chosen into the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes if god.</p>
            <p>He ouer commeth death, and bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to passe, that they whych were in the daunger of death, neuer dye but lyue for euer. He ouercommeth
<pb facs="tcp:23129:68"/>
hell, that they whych were in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell, shoulde go into heauen, and enioye euerlastynge felicitye.</p>
            <p>These in dede are the true benefits whych as they are in no wyse to be compared to those corporall profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, so do they brynge euerlastynge health. It commeth doune (saith he) from heauen. It bryngeth therefore heauenlye and euerlastynge good thynges, not earthly and those that shall vade awaye. And it geueth lyfe, it gyueth not money, whych co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous menne seke for: not corne, whyche vsuras heape together: not wyne, whyche bybbers seke after: not earthely Empyres, wyth whose desiar men of thys worlde be on fier: But it geueth lyfe, that is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for euer.

Wherfore althoughe these corporall, and yearthely good thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue theyr vse, and God (if they happen) is to be thancked for them, yet must you not set your herte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theym, as the Psalme sayeth, but set all youre herte vpon thys stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, to get true, and heauenly good nes in Messias. Thys thynge doth Christe playnely declare, where he sayeth: my father gyueth you the true brèade from heauen. For it is the breade of GOD that commeth downe from heauen, and gyueth lyfe vnto the worlde. But the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes yet dreame of bodilye good thynges.

            <p>Whom soeuer he shall gyue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and whom that he shall raise vp by his spirite thorowe my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to confesse, &amp; acknoweledge me, he receyueth me, and I wyll receiue and kepe hym agayne. And what is the cause that thou doest not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell men by thy kyngly power to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the, and submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the?

as a master but as a seruaunt. And it is the dutye of a seruaunte to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye hym selfe not after hys owne wyll, but after the wyl and becke of his master. I am come downe from heauen, not as a cheyfe Lorde and Emperoure, but as a messanger or one that is sente. And it is his office that is sente, to do and perfourme not hys owne opynyons, but the commaundements of him that hath sente hym.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in thys myne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassye, it is not lawefull for me to do anye thynge besyde the wyll of my father, whose Messengare I am. Tell vs than I praye the, what is the wil of thy father? Thys saythe he, is the wyll of my father that hath sente me, that I lose not annye of those menne whyche he hath gyuen me, but rayse them vp
<pb facs="tcp:23129:79"/>
in the later daye. It is not my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wyll, that I shoulde take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the rule of a kynge, in thys world, and by stronge hande to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due men vnto me, but that I should saue theym whyche he by hys holye spirite hath broughte vnto me, and that I shoulde kepe them that they perish not, but although they shuld seme to dye, yet that they be raysed vp agayne and lyue a ioyfull lyfe for euer. To thys pertayneth also that Christe sayeth in another place of hys owne offyce. The sonne of man is come, not that he shoulde be serued, but to serue hym selfe, and to gyue hys lyfe a redempcion for manie, that is, Christ came not, that horsemen, and soldiars should fight for him, &amp; shuld get for him by their lyfe, and their bloude, victorie, that he after the maner of a kyng should beare rule in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, as an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours armie shedeth theyr bloud, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:79"/>
Emperour may be defended, &amp; may haue the victorye of hys enemyes hym selfe beynge safe, but he came that he hym selfe shoulde gyue hys soule, and his lyfe, and shed out his owne bloud, that they that acknow ledge hym, myghte be redemed, and saued from theyr enemies. And in an other place when the Dysciples exhorted Christe to be reuenged vp on theim that set lyght by him with fire from heauen, he answered: You can not tel of whose spirite you are. The sonne of manne is not come to destroye the soules of men, but to saue theim. Wherefore it is an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of goddes vocacion, that he wyl not subdue men by kyngly and stronge power. But thou wylt say: Christ is ascended nowe into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hath layed awaye the fourme of a seruaunte, and sytteth in the glory of God hys father, why than doeth he nowe suffer blasphemers, why
<pb facs="tcp:23129:80"/>
now that he is in such maiesty, doth he not compel violentlye or by hys almyghty power the inobediente to the obedience of his gospel. Of this thing Peter preacheth thus.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmeth he came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Wyll he take vpon hym to be God?

Howe dare he be so bolde therefore as to say he is god? Here is a double erroure. One that of Messias promised by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, they thincke no hier, than of a man, in dede verye excellente, but yet but a man, when for al that god calleth hym openlye after a syngu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">Messias y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very sonne of God.</note> maner, hys sonne, saying: Thou arte my sonne, thys daye I haue be

gotten the. And Dauyd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracion of the holye gooste doeth knoweledge him hys Lorde, and set teth hym at the ryghte hande of his father. An other erroure is that thei iudge hym after the outwarde sight of hys stocke or kindred, yea y wys as thoughe Dauyd also beynge so greate a Lorde, dyd not confesse the basenes of his kindred, and had not bene wrytten of Messias whyche shoulde be borne of Dauydes sede, that he shoulde ascende as a young graffe, and as a rote out of a drys grownde, neyther that he shoulde haue anye fayrenes or beutye, but shoulde be the worste, and moste dis pysed. Lette vs consider therefore what canse Christ doth rehearse of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iewes errour. Iesus answered and sayed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Murmure not emonge your selues. No man maye come vnto me, excepte the father that sente me, hathe drawen hym: and I wyll

The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Messias lieth not in mans wytte, nor in carnall reason, nor in

mans merites, but it is the worcke of goddes mercye, and of the holye gooste. But you Iewes, you lacke the holy goost, and the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draweth you not. Wherfore it is no maruayle that you knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not me, that is, the true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias. But howe is thys proued that Christe sayeth: No man maye come to me excepte he drawe hym that hath sente me? Althoughe Christe haue suche greate autoritye that all hys sayinges, althoughe they haue no profe ioyned to theim, must be taken, and kepte for heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelacions, yet in thys place he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out for wytnes, the sayinges of the Prophetes, sayinge, in the Prophetes it is wryten: all shall be taughte of God.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:90"/>
dede, that thys saying is contained in the. xlv. Chapter of Esaie. For whan the Prophet dyd discribe the kyngdom of Messias, and rekened vp hys benefites, whyche be geuen to those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be subiectes of hys kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, amonge other he reherseth vp thys also: that al they that pertayne to thys kyngedome are taughte of god, and are lightened by the holye goost.</p>
            <p>I wyll (sayeth he) make all thy children the Dysciples of the Lord: For god hym selfe shal be their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. And the holye goost shal teach theym: that both they shall knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the true Messias, and obtaine the true benefits of Messias. With thys sayinge agreeth thys also that the same prophete wryteth of in an other place: All nacions shall slowe (sayeth he) vnto the mountayne of the lorde, that is to wyt, whan the kyngedome of Christe is opened,
<pb facs="tcp:23129:90"/>
and much people shall go and saye: Come lette vs go vp to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the Lorde, and the howse of the god of Iacob, and he shall teache vs hys wayes. The Lorde hym selfe (sayeth he) shall teach vs, that all maye be taughte of the Lorde. To thys agreeth also Hieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye in hys. xxxi. Chapter: after those dayes (sayeth the Lorde) I wyl gyue my lawe in theyr bowels, and I wyll wryghte theym in theyr herte, and I wyll be theyr GOD, and they shall be my people. And a manne shall no more teache hys neyghboure, nor a manne hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sayinge: knowe the Lorde. For all shall know me from the lest to the hiest.</p>
            <p>Uerely thys is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Esaias had say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also before: Al shal be taughte of god. There be also some thynges or places in the wrytynges of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It is not (saieth Paule) in the wyllar, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, but in God that hathe mercye. And it is sayde to Moyses: I wyll haue mercye of whom so euer I wil haue mercye, and I wyll shewe mer cye to whom so euer I list. There be manye also suche lyke sayinges of Scripture, whych testifye that men can get the knoweledge of Messias and theyr saluacion onely by the fre mercye of God, whyche wyll drawe by hys holye spirite, whome so euer he wyll, and lyst. Here nowe ryseth a great sorte of questions, and as wel the ignoraunte as the connynge, the good as the badde, may dyspute in thys mater. For some say: If ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des al men muste be taught of god, what nede we to heare sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made by men, to what profiteth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde preachynge of the Gospel?

wil tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare no more what any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayeth vnto me, but I wyll loke for reuelacion from heauen, to be lyght ned by the holy goost. Other make obieccion. If no man may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christe excepte he be drawen by God the father, the faulte of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe shall not be in the man: whych if he were drawen, must nedes obey wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God draweth because his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is omnipotent. For why doeth not god drawe all menne, seynge he is hable to do it. Why drewe he Ia cob and not Esau? Why drewe he Paule, and not Caiphas? Other thynke: If mans saluacion depend onlye of the fre mercye of God whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che choseth whom he wyl, what and if thou werte not in the number of them, that are chosen by God, what if God had caste the awaye whan he chose hys at the begynnynge: he those hys before the foundacions of the world were layed. These and
<pb facs="tcp:23129:92"/>
many other thynges are wonte to be reasoned of by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther heate that no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to Christe, nor getteth saluacion excepte he be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen of god, &amp; be drawen, &amp; taught by god.

Furthermore, where Christe sayeth: That no man commeth to hym excepte he be drawen of God the father. And Esaye: that all be taughte of GOD, It putteth not awaye the outwarde ministery of the preachynge of the Gospell, but rather confyrmeth it. For whome the father draweth, those he draweth
<pb facs="tcp:23129:93"/>
by preachynge of the Gospell. And those whome God teacheth, those he teacheth by the outwarde or as we be wonte, by the vocal worde. <note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel is necessarye.</note>

The maiestye and authoritye in dede to teache, and shewe Christe, that is of saluacion to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thorow Christ is onely in the power of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hys holye gooste. But the ministery, and the instrument where by the spirite teacheth, and openeth Christe, is the outwarde and vocall predicacion of the gospel. For that, God vseth thys organe, and is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall in man, by it the matter it
<pb facs="tcp:23129:94"/>
selfe proueth, and manye places of the scripture witnesseth. I haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted you sayeth Christ to his A postles, to go and bryng fruite, and that your fruit should abide. And it is manifest y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Christ hath sent his A postles to preach his gospel. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaketh of this ministery y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it bringeth fruit, which also tarieth. And Paul: The gospel (sayth he) is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power of god to all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue. And againe: faieth is by hearing, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng is by the word of god. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: We thancke god &amp; ceas not that when you receyued the word of vs, whereby you learned God, you receyued not the wordes of men, but as it was in dede the words of god which also worketh in you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue.

saieth. What could be spoken more excellente of thys ministerye? Let vs heare also Peter: beynge borne agayne (sayeth he) not by mortall sede, but by immortal, by the words of the liuyng god, and that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for euer. And sayeth further: And these be the wordes, whyche was broughte vnto you by the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. You se that Peter gyuethe to the instrumente of outwarde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of the Gospell, a newe byrth, wythout the whych no man can get saluacion. Nor all be not borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne that heare the Gospel: and in <note place="margin">The salua cion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes.</note> fauntes whyche for theyr age can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare the Gospell, are borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne thorowe goddes mercye by Baptisme. For they although they be not liable to receyue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde worde, yet be they hable to re ceyue the holye goost, whyche thing the example of Iohn Baptiste doth proue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:95"/>
But we nowe speake of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye waye to receyue saluacion. For in that some, althoughe they heare the Gospel, are not borne agayne, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, althoughe they here not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde voyce of the Gospell, by the singular power of God, are borne a gayne, it taketh nothynge awaye from the dignitye, and profit of the ministerye, whyche is ordeyned by Christ wyth great authoritye. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye sowe sede whyche bryngeth no fruit, and yet the corne is good, and the sede also. I (sayeth Paule) haue planted, Apollo hathe watred, but God gyueth the encrease. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe it folowe: Neyther he that planteth is anye thynge, neyther he that watereth, yet anone after it is sayed. We be healpers together wyth god, that is: the planter, and the waterar is nothynge in dede if you consider y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> autoritie of encrease: but it is muche if you consider the
<pb facs="tcp:23129:95"/>
instrumente, the ministery the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, and waterynge by whyche god is wonte to gyue encrease. And on that other part, the rod of Aaron floryshed wythout plantynge, and wateryng. What shall we say then? Shall we therefore take awaye all plantynge, and waterynge, because God somtyme bryngeth thynges to effecte wythoute theym? Nothynge so at all. But rather is the power of God to be maruayled at in hys mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but we muste vse the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that he sheweth vs to serue oure vocacion, and offer oure selfes to god the father, and the holy gost, to be facioned thorowe Christ. And touchynge the vse of outward prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the Gospell, thus far be it spoken. But nowe let vs searche to whom the faut of ignoraunce, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe is to be layed. For (saye they) If no man come vnto Chryste, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte the father hathe drawen hym
<pb facs="tcp:23129:96"/>
who shall be the maker of incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye but god hym selfe, because he draweth not al men, and yet may do it? Lord, what a blasphemie is this. For god is not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> author of euyl but of good, not of vices but of vertus. For as touchynge God, he in dede draweth &amp; teacheth al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but most <note place="margin">God dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> how</note> part of men drawe backe theim sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and wythstande the doctrine of Christe. Howe often (sayeth he) woulde I haue gathered together thy sonnes, as the byrde her young vnder her wynges, and you would not. And Stephan sayth: you hard necked, &amp; vncircumcised, in hert and eares, you alwaies haue resisted the holy goost, &amp; as your fathers haue done, so do you also. Thou wylt say then: what is the cause that God chaungeth not theyr wyll, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth theym of not wyllynge, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, of styffe necked, redye to be tourned?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:96"/>
For who is hable to resiste his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power? This in dede is to bring god vnder, &amp; make hym sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to mans wisdome. There is no doubte but god coulde aswell haue chaunged the wil of Caiphas as he chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the wil of Paule: but these secretes shall than be opened whan we shall se him in the world to come as he is in dede, and when we shall knowe him, as he knoweth vs. But nowe as touchinge these misteries, we muste crye out wyth Paule: O deapthe of the riches and wisdome &amp; knowledge of god, how vnsercha ble be his iudgementes, &amp; his waies hard to found out. For it is plaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thorowe one mans faute as Paule sayeth euil was engendred vpon al men to their conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore god by no right may be rebuked, &amp; accused of iniustice, althoughe he chaunge no mans wyll, but leaue all menne in perpetual damnacion,
<pb facs="tcp:23129:97"/>
whyche thorowe theyr euyll they haue deserued. But in that he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, and saueth some, it is hys gentilnes, and mercye whych we be bownde to knowledge and prayse, <note place="margin">Christ was opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men euen from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde.</note> and not to rebuke. For so greate is the beneuolence of God toward me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that althoughe he owe theym no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, yet wyll he shewe that very and true health oughte to be taken of all men, and woulde as much as he hath shewed vs in Scriptur by the holy gooste, make al men saued. Dyd he not euen from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the worlde, after man had synned, and deserued perpetual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struccion, shewe out vnto vs hys sonne Christ, to be receyued in faith that men thorowe hym myghte get the saluacion whiche they had lost? Whyche Sermon of Christe was fyrste shewed a brode amonge the Patriarckes, whyche were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fathers of the Iewes but of the
<pb facs="tcp:23129:97"/>
Gentiles also. Afterwardes were the Iewes amonge whome were put the promises of Christ, spreade abrode by diuers occasions among the Gentiles, that by theym the gen tiles myghte learne what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised of Christe from heauen. And the last of al when Christ was come and had fynished his iorney in this worlde, the sounde of the Apostles wente thorowe all the yearth, and theyr wordes wente into the endes of the worlde. Wherefore as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge oure Lorde god, man neuer lacked any thyng wherby he might knowe Christe, and by hym to get saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But in that, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> al men haue not gotten or do not get the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christe, and theyr saluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not goddes faute, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For they as they do not receiue Christe offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so they wyll not receiue him, yea, thei do not once
<pb facs="tcp:23129:98"/>
desire to haue a wil to receyue hym. What should god do then? Would ye haue him thrust out his benefits vnto theim that be not wyllynge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste theyr willes, and resistynge hym asmuch as they can? Caiphas heard the Gospell of Christ, he sawe hym him selfe, &amp; speake wyth Christ face to face. I dout not but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Nero which killed Paule, heard speaking also of Christ. But what was done? They not onelye woulde not learne y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trueth of Christe, but were so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that they had not once a wyl to desire, and if a man had wyshed a better mynd vnto them, they would yea haue abhorred that. Wherfore the faute of the vtter destruccion of wicked men is not to be ascribed vn to the maiestye of God, but to theyr naughtines, whyche whan they be drawen, and taughte of God, put awaye saluacion from theym, not onelye wyth fote, and hande, but

Furthermore the holye gooste hathe opened in the Scripture the doctryne of free eleccion of GOD for thys purpose, that good menne shoulde not be offended eyther with the smalle number or vylenes, but

shoulde truste: and that the euyll menne shoulde not be prowde of theyr multitude, power, wysdome and maiestye whyche they haue in thys worlde, but feare. For if ye compare together the congregaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the good and the badde, in thys worlde, ye shal alwayes fynde the badde hygher in degree, more in number, in more dignitye, honour, and greatenes, and in all other thynges.</p>
            <p>In the begynnynge of the worlde the congregacion of Cayne, semed to be beste, and that onelye shoulde possesse the worlde. And the churche of good Patriarckes, as it was smalle in number, so was it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted verye litell worthe. Abraham when he was called out of hys cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, had no great authoritye amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gentiles, and yet he wyth Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech, and fewe other was the verye true churche of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:103"/>
Other nacions were bygger in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, power and wysdome, and yet were rected of God. In Egypte the Israelites were the churche of god, whyche althoughe they were encrea sed in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, yet were thei oppressed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bondage, &amp; the Egipcians in the meane seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were the church of the wycked bare greate rule, and were in very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great maiestye of thys worlde. What shall I say of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of those times that folowed after? In the same people whyche were called by the name of god, one was the verye churche of god, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fained. Whan Ahab was king of Israell, the churche of god semed to be the kyng, the quene, the courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the priestes, and all Israell, but a fewe other, that is to wit: Elias, Abdias, and some that were hyd in the caues by Abdias, were thought to be abiected from god. But they were the true church, and that other
<pb facs="tcp:23129:103"/>
the fayned. What tyme Christe was borne, the byshoppes, the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, the Pharises were iudged the churche of god, and as many as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the authoritie, and doctrine, but zacharias, Elizabeth, Marye, Iosephe, Simeon, and a fewe other as in comparison of the mulitude and maiestye of the other, they were counted nothynge, so were they not taken nother for the true churche. But the iudgemente of god is one, and the iudgement of men another. And afterwardes, Iohn Baptiste. Christe, the Apostles, and certayne other were the verye church of god when for all that, Annas, Caphas, the byshopes, the priestes, the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pharises, al the other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, of the Iewes helde the hieste place, and dygnitye in the churche, in comparison of whome, they were counted vyle, and abiecte. These thynges verilye are wonte much to

offende good men. They se they are but a fewe, &amp; dyspised, &amp; to haue no shewe of the churche of god: &amp; that their aduersaries are manye, great, mightye, wise, and not onelye beare the title, and name of the church, but also haue the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefe place in it.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:105"/>
But we haue nowe spoken inoughe of thys matter, we wyll tourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to oure purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that haue harde (sayeth he) and learned of my father, commeth vnto me. And it is sayde more, not that any man hath seen the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he that is of God he hath seen the father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall we say then? If none other hathe seen god the father but he, whych is of God, that is, but Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christe the onelye sonne of god whyche is in the bosome of hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what remaynethe, but that none other also hath harde god, and learned any thynge of hym, and can not obtayne saluacion. What shall we thyncke than of Moses, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophetes, of the whyche the scripture wytnesseth that they haue seen God, and learned manye thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the prophetes visions, &amp; Christes.</note> of hym? But greate dyfference is betwixte the seynges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and Christes seynges. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prophetes are sayed to haue seen
<pb facs="tcp:23129:105"/>
God in dede, but they haue not seen hys substaunce, and beynge, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye certayne sygnes of hys presence. But Christe seeth the beynge of God, yea, and is one God in dede wyth hys father. Moreouer, the Prophetes haue heard the voyce of God, not the naturall, but that that was taken for a tyme, by whych the wyll of God shoulde be declared.</p>
            <p>But Christe is the verye naturall voyce of GOD, and hys eternall worde. Finallye, the prophetes and other good men haue gotten salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in dede, but not by theyr owne merite, but by an others benefite, but Christe is saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it selfe from the begynnynge, bycause he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye God. It remayneth therefore that he that desireth to se, and beare god, and to learne of God, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des se, and heare Christe, and learne hys Gospell, and kepe it thorowe sayeth, that he maye haue true sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:106"/>
No man (sayeth he) in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, hath euer seen God. The onely sonne that is in the bosome of the father, he hath declared of hym. And agayne, no man knoweth the father but the son, and he to whome the sonne wyll shewe hym. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: Phylip he that seeth me, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my father also. Wherefore in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> desier to se God, &amp; to heare hys hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye doctryne, and to get saluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we haue no nede to saye (as Mo ses sayed) who of vs shall ascende into heauen to se, and heare God? But Christ must be sene, and heard, we muste beleue in Christe thorowe hys Gospell. For thys is the face of God, that is the expresse Image of the substaunce of God, thys is the voyce, and worde of God.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:107"/>
tyme before, the same nowe doth he repete wyth playne, and open wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And thys is the sum not onely of thys sermon, whyche Christ hath in thys place, but also of the whole Gospel of Christ. Moses called vs to heare the Sermons of Christe, a thousande, and fyue hundred yere before Christe was borne, sayinge: heare him. And Christe was sent of God the father for thys offyce, to shewe his Gospel: and we men were called for thys poynte, and be here in thys world to thys vse, to knowe Christe oure sauioure by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Wherefore, seynge thys say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of Christ that we haue shewed is the summe of all hys whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, it muste be so muche made of, that euerye worde owght to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. And fyrste se wyth howe greate asseueracion Christe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hys worde.</p>
            <p>Uerelye verely (sayeth he) I say
<pb facs="tcp:23129:107"/>
vnto you. Thys is the othe of Christe, whereby he sygnifieth, that nothynge is more fyrme, nothynge more true, nor nothynge more suer. Howe much mischeife doth he than whyche wyll not beleue the sonne of god no not whan he sweareth? And secondlye he maketh no dyfference of persons, sayinge: he that beleueth in me, whether he be Iewe or greke whyther he be circumcised or vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, whither he be man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ryche or poore, master or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte, honest or vnhonest, I saye if he beleue in me, he hath lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge. I fynde it true in dede say eth Peter, that ther is no respecte of persons wyth God. But in euerye nacion he that feareth GOD, and worcketh iustice (but that no man can do well, excepte he beleue in Christ) the same man is accepted of hym. And Paule sayeth: who soeuer of you is Baptised, hathe putte on
<pb facs="tcp:23129:108"/>
Christe. There is neither Iewe nor Greke, there is neither seruaunt nor freman, there is neyther man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For all you are one in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ teacheth in thys place howe to get, and, haue lyfe euerlastynge, he requireth not circumcision, not the sabboth daye, not sacrifices, and such other leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call holy thynges, whyche were in dede in theyr time, the worshypping and seruyce of God, and had a good vse, but they were not the deseruyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of eternall lyfe. Nor Christ say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, he that hathe honoured fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and mother, he that hathe not kylled, he that hathe not stolen, he that hath hadde pitye of the poore hathe lyfe euerlastynge.</p>
            <p>For althoughe these be good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes commaunded of GOD, to the whych preceptes we must nedes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so obey, and these worckes shoulde

deserue lyfe euerlastynge, if a man were iust, and spiritual in dede, and coulde do these worckes perfectlye as the lawe of god doeth perfectlye require them: If thou wylte go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lyfe, kepe my commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, yet bycause man is carnall, sold vnder synne, and doeth not these good worckes perfectlye, it cannot be, that they shoulde deserue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lyfe.

<pb facs="tcp:23129:109"/>
and an expiacion, and whyche was made for vs as Paule sayeth, the wysdome of God, the iustice, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion, and redempcion. Therfore to beleue in Iesus, is to put al thy truste in Iesus: as true Christe, so also a true redemer, and sauioure.</p>
            <p>Thou wylte saye: thys we wyll do easilye: for what is more easye, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among Christen men, than to beleue thys Iesus to be true Christ and redemer of our synnes. Happye are we therefore, that eternall lyfe is so easily gotten. Thus the fleshe somtyme either doth swetely laugh at the doetryne of the Gospell, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the fayeth in Iesu Christ, or vng odlye abuseth it to hys licence, and lewde libertye. But the thynge it selfe doeth teache, that fayeth in Christ is a farre other worcke, than the fleshe imagineth: and many thin ges do testifie howe harde, yea how impossible it is to the fleshe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
<pb facs="tcp:23129:109"/>
in Iesu christ. For consider me wyth howe great authoritye Christ hym selfe the onelye sonne of God hath taughte hys owne Gospel, and wyth what miracles he hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the trueth thereof, and howe fewe were there that beleued him.</p>
            <p>In the people of the Iewes, were so many wyse men, so many wittie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whych verelye, if fayeth in Christe myght haue bene conceyued by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reason, and strengthe of mans wysdome, they woulde wyth greate obedience haue taken Christe.

And it is sayed to Peter: Flesh and bloude hath not shewed vnto the but my father whyche is in heauen. Hytherto commeth, that wyse men in this world, not only not haue bele

And if it were so easye a thynge to beleue in Iesus Christ as the fleshe maketh it, who would soner haue conceiued fayeth than these wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Set also before thine eyes, how great a multitude of men is wont in persecucion to denye the fayth in Christ.

Thys is hys true meanyng: except you beleue in me whyche wyll gyue my Ceshe for the lyfe of the worlde, and wyl shede my bloude to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the synnes thereof, you shall not gette true health: and in verye dede Christe by thys Metaphore, doeth vnderstande playnelye the same thynge, that before he sayed simplye: All men that se the sonne, and beleueth in him, haue lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge.

            <p>Uerylye verylye, I saye vnto you, he that trusteth to me, hathe lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastynge. For it is manyfeste that Chryste thinketh this eatynge and this drinkinge, whiche he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in thys place, to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to lyfe and saluation, sayinge: Except ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drynke hys bloude, ye

haue not lyfe in you. But if we shulde saye as trueth is, none other thynge is symplye necessarye to vs for oure health then fayeth in Christe. Good worckes also after their manner be necessarye. But we nowe speake of that thynge by the whyche we are iustified, and be saued before God. But we be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Christ only, and by faith onelye: by the whyche we receyue Chryst, yea rather we be receaued of hym, and as I might say be our selfes in corporate vnto hym. The iuste man saith the Prophet, liueth by hys faith. And Paule sayth: we thynke that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iustified by faith withoute the worckes of the lawe. And agayne. We knowe that man is not iustyfyed by the worckes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lawe but by faith of Iesus christ. Wherfore it is also manyfest that Chryste by the eatynge of hys flesh and drynckynge of hys bloude, in
<pb facs="tcp:23129:128"/>
this place vnderstandeth none other thyng, than faith which is to be had of his fleshe, &amp; his, bloude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we beleue his fleshe to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death for vs, that we may haue life, &amp; hys bloud to be shed to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our synnes. For so to eate the fleshe of Christ, &amp; to drinke his bloud, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to beleue in Christ, is playnely necessa ry to our helth, &amp; saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him selfe the first man althoughe in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time of his lyfe christ was not yet come, yet eate he his fleshe, &amp; dranke his bloude, because he beleued that Christ shoulde come, whiche by hys fleshe &amp; bloud, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is by his death put ged our synnes. Noe, also Abraham &amp; the other patriarckes &amp; prophets did eate the flesh of Christ &amp; drinke his bloud, because they beleued that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:23129:128"/>
which shuld suffer in fleshe for their sines &amp; put away their iniquities by his bloud. So also al good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che after Christes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming liue here in this world, althoughe thei do not alwaies take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord, yet alwaies they eate the fleshe of christ &amp; drinke his bloud, because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christe hath put away theire synnes by hys bloude, &amp; death.

            </p>
            <p>Thys is the comparacion of meate, and dryncke wyth the fleshe, and bloude of Christe. And the comparacion is made partelye by a
<pb facs="tcp:23129:129"/>
dyssimilitude, and partly by a lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhode. The dyssimilitude is, that althoughe corporal meate, &amp; drinke noryshe the man, and substayne hys lyfe, yet are they not the meate and dryncke whych kepe man for euer, but for a whyle in thys corporall, and fadyng lyfe. But the fleshe and bloude of Christe, if they be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in fayth, that is, if ye beleue the fleshe of Christ to haue bene gyuen to death for oure synnes, and hys bloude to haue bene shed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes, are meate and dryncke in dede: bycause they kepe man in lyfe perpetuall. For he that beleueth in Christ, he semeth in dede to dye as other men, but hys death is no death, but a slepe, because that hys lyfe is hyd wyth Christe, and kept of Christe, vntyll he be raysed agayne in the last daye. And the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is, that as the iuyce of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral meate and drinke is sent into

all the partes of man, and turneth the hauioure of hys bodye into hys nature: as if a manne vse to moyste mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the same nature that my fleshe, and my bloud hathe, the same also getteth he, that eateth me. And the fleshe of Christe is lyfe. I wyl gyue my fleshe (sayeth he) for the life of the worlde. The fleshe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of Christe coulde not peryshe in death, but rose agayne from death. And the bloude of Christe putteth awaye synnes, because it is iust, and innocent bloud. Wherefore he that eateth thys meate, and dryncke, as
<pb facs="tcp:23129:130"/>
he is counted iuste before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so al so is he made alyue, that he dye not in death, but ryse agayne, and haue lyfe euerlastynge.

               <hi>Manye (sayeth the Euangelist) of his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when they hadde hearde these thynges sayde: Thys is an harde sayinge, who is able to heare hym?</hi>

            <p>The thinges that they were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wythall that were rehearsed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by them selfe, nowe are rehersed together. For there be two thynges wherewyth the hearers were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this sermon. The one is, that Iesus had sayed that he was come downe from heauen, wherby he syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that he was the sonne of god and verye god hym selfe.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:137"/>
In other is, that he had sayde: hys <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eshe shoulde be eaten, and hys bloud dronken. Those thinges ther fore at whyche seuerallye the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers hadde murmured before wyth theym selfes, nowe they repete togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and saye. These be hard words he bosteth him self to become doune fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, that he is god but we se &amp; knowe him to be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what shulde then become of vs if we shulde folowe him teachynge so blasphemous thynges? Uerelye we shulde brynge our selues into parel and ieopardye not only of oure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall lyfe, but also of euerlastinge healthe. For there is a lawe: If ther ryse amonge you a prophet, and do shewe before of a signe or wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous token, and it come to passe that he hath spoken: and he say vnto the, let vs go and folow straunge goddes, whyche thou knowest not, and let vs serue them, thou shalt not heare

he anoyntethe wythe the bloude stones that be set in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before theym. By the which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome you maye se that couenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and bondes wer not made suar wythout the bloude of those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> were confederate or ioyned together. In some other countreis, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maner in makynge couenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, not onely to shede bloud, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to dryncke it. For they that came into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> felowship together, be wonte to bynde theyr ryghte handes and their thombs together wyth a knot, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to let out wyth a litle stroke and to licke the bloud, that was ga thered at the later ende of the ryb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes. That bonde was counted a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create, and very sure bonde, because it was consecrated, and halowed wyth eche others bloude. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne hystorye doeth testifye in the sedicion of Cateline, howe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was
<pb facs="tcp:23129:139"/>
vsed: that Cateline the begynner of the sedicion, bare aboute in greate boles the bloud of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body, ming led with wine, &amp; dyd to dryncke of it al that knewe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> conspiracye: that by thys dryncke, the othe made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeste theym shoulde be confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to be more fayethfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them selues. You haue now that the drynckynge of mans bloud was vsed in makyng bondes or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenauntes, and in doynge treason. Wherefore when the Capernaites hearde Iesus preache of the drync<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of hys bloude, I doute not but they thoughte vpon suche a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and thoughte that Iesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of theim such a bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shoulde so bynde theim sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wyth hym, that onely thei shuld healpe him to get a worldely domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thorowe out al the worlde, not onely by venturyng all their goods but theyr liues also. And althoughe
<pb facs="tcp:23129:139"/>
the Iewes were verye desirous, and soughte principallye for thys thynge in theyr Messias, that they shoulde beare rule in thys worlde, yet because they thoughte that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus dyd thys thynge, not that they liuynge in rest and wythout the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe shot, he woulde get worldlye felicitye, they abhorred hys sermon, and toke councell to go awaye. What? Say they, we thought that seyng he prophesied hym selfe to be Messias, he woulde haue made vs happye in thys worlde, wyth out all oure losse or hurte. But nowe by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we perceyue that he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute a conspiracye, to make vs sworne to hym by drynckynge hys bloude, and that he wyll cause vnto vs most extreme ieoperdi, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be hys scholar or folowe hym? For he sayeth: He that eateth my flesh and dryncketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in hym. What other thynge
<pb facs="tcp:23129:140"/>
is thys than if he sayde, that we oughte so to bynde oure selfe wyth hym, that we shoulde sticke vnto hym, and neuer go awaye but fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe hym, whyther soeuer be it thorowe sworde or fyarre he shall leade vs, whither it be to the besige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of the citye of Hierusalem, or the citye of Rome.

You se here a greate prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in dede of the Capernaites but a naughtie and carnal wit.

Wherefore ye nede not to feare sedicion, whereby I wyll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade worldelye kingdomes. Nor it is not to be feared, least my doctrine shoulde brynge anye distruccion to you. Do no more but stande and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde still, you shall fele in dede, that you by my doctryne shall receyue lyfe, and saluacion.

            <p>
               <hi>It is the spirite (sayeth he) that gyueth life: The fleshe profiteth nothynge. The wordes that I speake, are spirite and lyfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>Thys place some vnderstande one wayes some an other, but we wyll folowe the verye playne sentence, and that the thynge it selfe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:144"/>
For if we wyl consider in what estate this controuersie doeth stand, which is risen bewixt Christ and the Iewes, it is manifest that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion is of the doctryne of Christ, wherewyth the Iewes in dede be of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ended, and the which they reproue: but Christe defended it. But Christ also hym selfe whan he sayeth: The wordes whyche I speake vnto you are spirite, playnely sygnifieth, that here he speaketh of hys doctryne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and expoundeth what hys doctryne is. For the Iewes dyd fear, least if they continued to be hearers, and folowers of Christe, they shoulde by hys doctryne be caste into all kynde of troubles, yea into death it selfe. But thys f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ar Christe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth, and he teacheth hys doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne not to brynge deathe, but to brynge lyfe: not to brynge destrucci on, but saluacion.</p>
            <p>For the spirite in thys manner
<pb facs="tcp:23129:145"/>
of speakynge is taken for spiritual, heauenlye and diuyne doctryne.</p>
            <p>Therefore the maner of reasonyng is shorte in dede, but worthy to be marked, sayinge: the spirite, that is, the spiritual and heauenly doctrine, gyueth lyfe. But the fleshe that is carnall and humayne doctryne, as is the doctryne of the Phariseis, or of sedicious persons, profiteth no thynge, bycause it bringeth distruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and death. But my wordes be spirite, that is, be spiritual doctrine, and not carnal: wherfore thei be life and bryng not death or destruccion as you iudge. You haue the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of Christe. Let vs nowe run ouer his partes: spiritual &amp; heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly learnyng (sayth he) gyueth lyfe, and bringeth saluacion. But carnal and humayne doctryne, bryngeth dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struccion, and death. What shal we saye than of the lawe of the Lorde? whyche althoughe it be spirituall,
<pb facs="tcp:23129:145"/>
and heauenlye doctryne, yet bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it death, or, as Paule sayeth, kylleth. What shall we saye also of doctrines of men, of conscience Ma thematicall, of Physicke, and other artes, whiche partelye be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for mannes lyfe, yea and partly after theyr facion, necessarye also.</p>
            <p>Shall we saye that they also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite nothynge, but rather brynge men to destruccion? Of the lawe of god therfore, thus must we thinke, that it mortifieth in dede, and kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth man, but that is not thorowe the faut of the lawe but of the man. For if we should speake of the selfe nature of goddes lawe, verelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a spirituall, and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye doctrine, it hath also the nature of giuing life, and bringing salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Kepe (saieth he) my lawes, and iudgementes, whyche the man that doth, shal lyue in them. They bring therefore of theyr owne nature, life.
<pb facs="tcp:23129:146"/>
And when Moyses had made an ende of the ministerye of makynge a lawe, he sayde: Consider that nowe I haue set in thy syghte, lyfe, and good. Christe also sayeth: If thou wylte enter into lyfe, kepe the commaundementes of God. And Paulle: the lawe is holye, and the precepte is holye, iuste, and good. Stephen also sayeth: Moyses (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) toke the lyuelye wordes, to gyue theym to vs. Wherefore as muche as pertayneth to hys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is spirituall and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye doctrine, so it bryngeth also spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and heauenlye life. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men be carnal, soulde vnder synne, therefore it commeth to passe that the doctryne of the lawe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth rather deathe than lyfe, and rather damnacyon, than saluaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whyche thynge, sith it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the lawe, but vnto manne and vnto hys synne, it doeth yet
<pb facs="tcp:23129:146"/>
remayne suer, and stedfaste, that spirituall learnynge dooeth gyue lyfe.</p>
            <p>And as touchynge mans sciences, whyche be profitable in thys world to kepe the lyfe of man, here we speake not. For thys earthelye, and corporall healthe, is one, and the spirituall, and heauenlye healthe is an other. If we shoulde speake of thys bodelye, and worldelye healthe, there be manye and dyuers doctrynes, whyche profyte verye muche. Physicke profitteth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and recouer the good healthe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body. Mathematical profiteth to knowe the marueylous mocions of the bodyes celestiall, and to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the yearthe. Housbandrye profitteth to the tyllynge of the ground: and who can in fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des rehearse vp the profite of al the sciences of men?</p>
            <p>But if we shoulde speake of true
<pb facs="tcp:23129:147"/>
spiritual, heauenly, and euerlasting health, verelye none other doctrine doth profit, saue spirituall, and hea uenlye. Al carnal doctrynes be they neuer so profitable, are pernicious and deadely, if they be iudged to be a perfit waie, to get heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly health. Amonge carnall teachinge most of all be deadelye the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teachynges of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pharasies, and of sedicious men.</p>
            <p>The Pharisies do teache that men maye satisfye the lawe of God by outwarde worckes, and that they do deserue by their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, iustice and lyfe euerlastynge before God. Thys is in dede a carnal doctryne, whyche leadeth men into perpetual distruccion. The sedicious men do teach that tributes must not be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Emperour of Rome, and that we muste make batell agaynst the Romaynes: that the Iewes, the Romaynes beynge cast out of their countrye, maye bryuge them selues
<pb facs="tcp:23129:147"/>
into libertye, and also subdue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other kingdomes of the world. Thys is verye carnal doctrin whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che leadeth men into the ieoperdye of al their ryches &amp; goodes. Since ther is therfore two maner of teach ynges, one spirituall, that gyueth lyfe, &amp; saueth, an other carnall, that bryngeth death, and dystroyeth: I praye you, in what kynd is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Christ comprehended? My wordes (sayeth he) that I speake vnto you are spirit. My doctrine is not flesh, nor is not carnal, but it is spirit, it is spiritual. It is manifest therfore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is also life. I sayd s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ply he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> beleueth in me, hath lyfe euerla stinge. Thys is spiritual doctryne, heauenly, and diuine. Wherfore he that receiueth it, receiueth also life. I spake Metaphorically but in the same sence: I am the liuynge bread whyche am come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. If any man eate of thys bread
<pb facs="tcp:23129:148"/>
he shall lyue for euer. And agayne: Excepte ye eate the fleshe of the son of man, and drynke his bloude, ye haue not life in you. Thys doctrine also is spiritual &amp; diuine. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth therfore, that it is life, and that it giueth life, that it saueth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that receyue it, that they may get euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But why do we not rehearse, thoughe in fewe wordes, the kindes of the doctrine of Christ, that we maie knowe the true vse of it. For fyrst Christe did sometimes expounde the lawe of GOD as in Mathe, the. v. and the. vi. and as it is writen in other places of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelists. To this braunch or kind do pertayne, the threteninges the re bukinges, and the prophesies of the euyls that are to come. Thys doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne is not in dede the proper doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of Christe, but of Moses: yet is it sayde that it doeth gyue lyfe, be cause that shewynge the greatenes
<pb facs="tcp:23129:148"/>
and greuousnes of synne, it styreth men vp, to seke for iustice, and life in Chryste, oure onelye sauioure. Also it hathe taughte that salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon doeth not depend vpon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes merites, but by goddes elec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No man (sayeth he) can come vnto me except my father that hath sente me, shall drawe hym. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: you haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you.</p>
            <p>Thys learnynge also gyueth lyfe if a manne can vnderstande it well: for it doeth strengthen theyr fayeth whyche beleue in Christe, that they may haue their saluacion certayne and thorowlye knowen. For if oure saluacion should stand vpon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes merites, we coulde neuer be in a suer mynde: because that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of man, as they are vnperfite, so are they vnsure.</p>
            <p>And in the Psalme it is spoken playnelye. In thy syghte shall
<pb facs="tcp:23129:149"/>
not be iustified all liuynge creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. But nowe because it dependeth of the onely and free mercye of God whych in his lonne Christ not only is opened, but also confyrmed, hys saluacion ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vncertayne that beleueth in Christ. The mountains sayeth he, shalbe moued, &amp; the hilles shal tremble, but my mercy shal not go from you, &amp; the couenant of my peace shal not be moued, sayde thy mercifull lorde. Wherefore seynge this doctrine taketh out y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Finally Christ taughte hys Gospell, that he was come into thys worlde to reconcile men wyth God the father, that all that beleue in hym shoulde not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, but haue life euerlastinge.</p>
            <p>This is the doctrine that properly <note place="margin">The gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

One is vexed, &amp; almost dieth, for hys great nede, pouertie, but if he haue taken thys doctrine of the gospel, &amp; know ledgeth that God is merciful vnto him thorow Christ, it cannot be but he must be so made aliue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maye manifestlye perceyue that he is in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Paule speaketh of: as pore men, yet enrichinge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: as hauing nothing, and yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessyng althing. An other is trobled with the knoweledge of synne, and in maner dieth for the greatnes of the iudgement of it.

dare boldly, and cherefully come to the throne of goddes maiestye. An other is striken wyth the feare of death, and hel, and thinketh he shal be damned for euer. But if he wyll harcke to the Gospel of Christ, and beleue in Christe, that he is the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of death, and hel, and the rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of al that trust in hym, not only is he saued in death, but he shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

God forbid. The father which wyll haue all men, saued offreth fayeth vnto all men, and draweth al men as touchynge hym selfe to Christe, but all menne receyue not fayeth, neyther do they obaye vnto the wyl and drawing of the father. I know that no man can resist the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power of God, but the mooste parte of men wythstand the wyll of God which he him selfe openeth by his worde. Howe often (sayeth he) woulde I gather together thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thou wouldest not? And a gayne: you haue alwayes wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the holy gost, as your fathers haue done so do you also.

Wherefore the faute of vnbeliefe must not be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to god, but to the wicked wyl of man: which furiously reiecteth that good thynge, that god mercifullye offereth. For where Christe sayeth, no man can come vnto me excepte it be geuen hym of my father, he sig nifieth not that god is the authour of vngodlines in men, but he sygni fieth that in dede he wyll obaye the wil of his father, neither that he wil take vpon him any outwarde regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, whereby he maye compel me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> violently to receyue hym: and that god the father is no regarder of per sonnes, but that he bryngeth to hys sonne, and gyueth vnto hys sonne

With this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the gospel of Christ, agreeth this also that Christe in an other place saythe: Preache the gospell to all creatures.

For there be two sonnes: One na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, an other by adoption or cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. But Chryste is not the chosen sonne of God, but begotten of god. I haue begotten the, saythe he, this tyme. Wherefore he is the naturall sonne of God. If he be the naturall <note place="margin">Christe is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sonne of God.</note> sonne, it resteth, that seinge of God nothynge is gotten but God, as of man nothinge is gotten but man, Christ is the true and eternal God. This is the maiesty which passeth not only the glory of this worldlye kyngdome, but the glory also of all creatures as well in heauen as in earthe. What shoulde we do then?

Thys is the confession, and the doc trine, vpon the whych the church of Christe is founded, and the whiche properlye is called the Apostolike churche. Let vs therfore holde this confession with suche a su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thinke not that Christ wythout greate aduisemente, bothe dyd speake of thys before, and now speaketh of it againe. For fyrste.

beleue, shuld learn the feare of god, and beware that they slepe not care les, and be preuented by the Deuyl: for not only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest manie, many do fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a fewe, yea and those also cho sen.

            <p>Wherfore good men wyth all di ligence ought to applie them selues to thys studye, that they walke in the fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Christe monysheth good men that whether many, amonge many, or the chiefe amonge fewe, do fall from the gospell, they shulde not be offended: but co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:158"/>
For although the greatest parte of the disciples was gone awaye, yet for those dothe he not reiecte the twelue which taryed styl, but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them so much the more, bicause manye were gone awaye. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe amonge the twelue also, one was a dyuell, not by nature in dede, but by wyckednes, wherby he shuld become a traitor, yet the other eleuen be so muche the more loued of Chryste, howe muche the worsse the twelfth was. Let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be moued with the multytude of euill men, but let vs thyncke if we folowe the gospell of Chryste, that we be very wel taken and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued of God, whyther they be many that beleue or fewe. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more thys example also doeth teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a modestye.

As in example: if there were a merchaunt or two, a tayler, a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or a Myller, that were a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye deceiuer, they are wonte to saye that all other of the same crafte are deceyuers.

For what kind of life is there, or what order &amp; state of men, in the whych naughtie men maye not be found? Finally Christ prophecieth of the fallyng away of the vnbeleuers, &amp; of the treason of Iudas, to warne in tyme the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers, and Iudas hym self hys A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to repent, &amp; auoyd the punish ment for his wickednes.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23129:159"/>
He signifieth therfore in thys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municacion that one of his twelue Apostles shuld be a traytoure, that Iudas which was noted bi y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of the diuel, shuld haue space of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and beware that he did not fulfil by hys myscheife in dede, that which he was called by worde.
