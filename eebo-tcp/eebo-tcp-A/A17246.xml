            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that by all meanes

ſeeme a hard attempt in theſe our dayes,
wherein falſehoode maketh ſo fayre a ſhew,
<pb facs="tcp:10074:3"/>
and hath ſo great appearaunce of that it is
not, and euery man claimeth to the trueth,
be their doctrines neuer ſo diuers, yet ſince
God hath giuen vs meanes to driue awaye
thoſe thicke cloudes of errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
that the ſunne of trueth may ſhine
vnto the worlde, I haue indeuoured in this
ſhort treatiſe, to take away that colourable
ſhewe of trueth from the Church of Rome,
that the vndoubted trueth of the Church of
Chriſt may the better appeare. For we haue
a touchſtone, the word of God that cannot
lye, a rule that cannot deceaue, by which
whatſoeuer we trie and examine, it wil ſoone
bee ſeene whether it bee true or falſe. Truth
alſo is a thing that is auncient, and hath bin
alwayes,<note place="margin">De virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus velan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</note> ſayth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and like the good
corne that was firſt ſowen: but errour is that
bad ſeed which was caſt after into that field
by the enuious man.<note place="margin">Tertul. de preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſus Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticos.</note> Seeing therefore that
is true that was firſt, and what ſo euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
after is falſe: howe eaſie a matter is it
for ſuch as ſearch, to ſee the light, and for
them that inquire after her, to finde the
trueth? For if it bee true that the Scriptures
<pb facs="tcp:10074:3"/>
teach, &amp; that onely, then al that is not agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that truth, muſt needs bee falſe. And if
that onely be nowe true, which in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
times was true: no number of dayes
or yeares ſhall prooue that not to bee falſe
nowe, which then was not true. Therefore
for the benefite of all ſuch as loue the truth,
I haue in this treatiſe ſet downe, the doctrine
which was firſt taught and preached at <hi>Rome</hi>
in the Apoſtles dayes, whereof no man
doubteth, but that it muſt bee the infallible
worde of God, and Chriſtian religion. Then
alſo I haue added thereunto that which is
nowe holden for the Romiſhe religion and
Catholicke fayth there. And becauſe theſe
two doe verie much differ, as hee that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
will ſoone ſee (for indeede they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like:) and wee are aſſured that that
which Gods worde deliuereth, and was firſt,
muſt needes bee currant, that which hath
no warrant in the worde, and commeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
muſt needes be counterfeite. I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to bee ſhort, becauſe I hoped it
woulde be the more willingly read, and the
better remembred. And for that cauſe I
<pb facs="tcp:10074:4"/>
haue not aunſwered the argumentes, which
the Romiſh Catholickes vſe for defence of
their opinions, and the rather becauſe it is
performed in an other treatiſe. But I truſt
in this it will appeare, that hee that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Catholicke Fayth that was then,
when the faith of the Romans was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereof the Papiſtes make greate
bragges, muſt needes deteſt that Romiſh
fayth that is now, and accompt it moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous.
This little worke I haue beene
bold to dedicate vnto your good Ladiſhip,
not onely as a diſcharge of my duetie of

of the faith of the <hi>Romans</hi> that then was, and doth not
promiſe or prophecy, that it ſhould be ſo alwaies. In the
beginning God planted true Religion &amp; the feare of him,
in the hearts of men and women: but in continuance of
time, that plant of the Lords own plaining, was ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen
with the wéeds of wickednes of life, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions

men. In ſo much as of the times of <hi>Enos</hi> it is
written, (as if the world had for a long time forgotten
that there is any God) that then <hi>he began to call vpon
the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 26.</note> Yea that which was at the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from God as a perfect rule of life, and written in
the heart of man: Yet was by the corruption of man ſo
blotted out, and by the darknes of our minds ſo defaced,
that God was forced as it were to write it a new (that it
might the better be remembred) in the tables of ſtone.
Yea and ſuch is the force of our naturall and hereditary
infection, that we cannot long kéep the truth ſincerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vnto vs, without mingling, or mangling of the
ſame.<note place="margin">De praeſcrip. aduerſ. haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos.</note> And therfore <hi>Tertulian</hi> teacheth vs truly, that the

from the Lord, &amp; true, that is firſt, &amp; that which commeth
after,<note place="margin">Contra epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolam Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phani.</note> is falſe and ſtrange. And <hi>Ciprian</hi> alſo confirmeth the

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> as a very good rule
and worthy to be followed. And <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> in
his Commonitory, doth not more earneſtly indeuor any
thing then that without any addition, we kéepe ſincerely
that which is deliuered: yea it is his onely intent &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
his whole drift &amp; deſire, to teach vs to loue that firſt
was taught, and to eſchew al new additions. Therefore
howſoeuer religion at the firſt, was either at <hi>Rome</hi> or
elſe where truly eſtabliſhed, yet that is no good argument
to proue, that it ſhould ſo continue alwaies. Whereof if
we would make any doubt, let vs looke backe vnto the
Church amongſt the <hi>Iews,</hi> where God eſtabliſhed among
them for his ſeruice and worſhip, euery ceremony, ſo that
in euery thing they had plaine direction by Gods lawe,
how to behaue themſelues: yet notwithſtanding their

                     </gap>.</note> And if the goodnes which
the Apoſtle commendeth in them, was not in them ſuch
a continual or eternal inheritance, but that they haue
long ſince loſt the ſame, as themſelues cannot deny: how
wil they be able to proue, that they muſt haue ſincerity
of faith for an euerlaſting ſucceſſion? I wil not here ſtand
to examine what the Apoſtle meaneth by this word faith
in this place, although that perchance might ſerue to lay
their brags. For amongſt many ſignifications of this
word faith, there are two that may eſpecially ſerue for the
vnderſtanding of that place. Sometime faith ſignifieth
religion it ſelfe, or the rule of faith, as it is taken in this
queſtion, what faith or religion do you profeſſe or are you
of? And in this ſence it muſt be taken in this place to
pleaſure the papiſts. And in another ſence faith may here
ſignify their forwardnes, confidence &amp; conſtancy in this
their religion: and ſo it ſemeth that the Apoſtle here doth
vnderſtand it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then this is the ſence of theſe words:
It is ſpoken of in al the world, how readely you receiued,
&amp; conſtantly continued in the faith. And thus doth <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>
ſéeme to expound this place,<note place="margin">Ad Romanos Serm. 2.</note> when he ſaith that the
Apoſtle giueth thanks for their faith &amp; confidence, as if he
would by the latter expounde the former, by confidence
teach what he meaneth by faith.<note place="margin">Tho. Aquin. in Rom. lect. 5.</note> And euen <hi>Tho.</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi>
doth ſo take it: The <hi>Romans</hi> (ſaith he) are commended for
their faith, becauſe they yeelded to it ſo willingly, and
ſtood in it ſo ſtifly. And this place thus expounded, doth
not proue their faith to be Catholicke: for many are
conſtant that oppugne the Catholicke faith. Neither yet
will I oppoſe vnto this ſome other places, where the
Apoſtle may ſéeme perchaunce to giue as great, if not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10074:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greater commendation vnto other Churches; and yet

although they came of <hi>Abraham</hi> as touching the fleſh, yet

whatſoeuer man hath deuiſed is but new) and vnder the
name of holy faith, they commend vnto vs, their groſſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries,
and moſt profaned blaſphemies: My purpoſe
is, (if God with his good grace ſhall aſſiſt me therein in
this ſhort treatiſe, briefly to ſet downe, both the ancient
religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which at that time was taught
and receiued in <hi>Rome,</hi> when this their faith was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in the whole world: and alſo the faith or religion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10074:7"/>
that is now, ſo violently defended of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and is (although vniuſtly) called, the Catholick <hi>Romiſh</hi>
religion: that we comparing the one of them with the
other, may ſée how vnlike they are, and that they cannot
flow both from one fountaine, or both of them be taught
of one ſpirit. And if we will know the auncient religion
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the faith wherevnto the Apoſtle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
ſo good a witneſſe, wee can haue no way more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
then to trie what was taught in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> then. For that onely can be called that <hi>Roman</hi>
faith, that was then taught in that Church, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the faithfull there. All which with reuerence we
receiue, and moſt faithfully beléeue. But the additions
of later times, and that which ſince they haue foyſted
in vnder the name of that auncient <hi>Roman</hi> faith, wee
iuſtly reiect, as water mingled with the pure wine,
whereby the wine is corrupted, or as myre or filth that
hath ſullied the fined gold, whereby the excellencie of
the gold is blemiſhed, or as tares and wéeds ſowen in
the field where firſt good corne was ſowen, whereby the
growing of the good corne is hindered. But what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> doth
teach them to beleeue, whatſoeuer faith he would haue
them to holde, that we acknowledge to bee in déede the
true <hi>Roman</hi> faith, in the which he is deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
and ſtrengthen them by ſome ſpeciall gift,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 11. 12.</note> and to
haue mutuall conference with them, no doubt to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to continue conſtantly therein. Yea what ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer
he teacheth in that Epiſtle, whether it bee to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
them in that they had learned, or to inſtruct them
more perfectly in any poynte whereof they were yet
ignorant, I ſay all that wee imbrace as the auncient
faith of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Moreouer whatſoeuer Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
who they ſay was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that hee
wrote his firſt Epiſtle from <hi>Rome</hi> (for rather then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10074:8"/>
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould not be proued to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> they are
content to cal <hi>Rome Babylon</hi>) whatſoeuer I ſay he wrot
in that Epiſtle, which they ſay that he wrote from <hi>Rome</hi>
we alſo moſt readily receiue as that old and authenticks
<hi>Roman</hi> religion, whereof we will make no doubt at all.
And further, whatſoeuer doctrine can be proued out of
Saint <hi>Markes</hi> Goſpell,<note place="margin">De Rom. pont li. 2. cap. 2.</note> which Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goeth
about by teſtimony of ſundry auncient writers to ſhew,
that it was written at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he heard Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
preach the ſame, that alſo we will acknowledge to bee
the <hi>Roman faith,</hi> which is ſtill to be followed. So that
whatſoeuer eyther Saint <hi>Paule</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being (ſay the papiſts) among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
wrote vnto the diſperſed <hi>Iewes,</hi> or Saint <hi>Marke</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
haue taught, and what ſoeuer is conſonant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
therewith, that is vndoubtedly receaued of
vs. But that which cannot be found agréeable to any of
theſe writings I truſt any indifferent reader wil think,
that we may iuſtly ſuſpect, as neither taught by thoſe
godly teachers, neither yet beléeued of thoſe famous
and faithful ſchollers, and therefore of none acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at that time for the faith of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And if then
it were not the faith of the <hi>Romans:</hi> what néed either the
<hi>Rhemiſtes</hi> in their edition of the teſtament,<note place="margin">In Rom. 1. 8.</note> or all the
reſt of them, ſo confidently to bragge, that the faith
of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ſo commended of the Apoſtle?
Muſt it needes follow that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith that now
is, is true, becauſe that was good and godly? Suſpend
thy iudgement (good Chriſtian Reader) and come not
with a preiudicate opinion. Trie and then truſt, proue
and examine whether we or the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, come
néerer to the auncient <hi>Roman</hi> faith, and bee bolde to
heare and followe them, that beleeue as thoſe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
<hi>Romans</hi> were taught and veleeued. And who
ſo euer they bee that diſſente from that faith, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10074:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſwarue any thing from that religion, or ad any thing to
that doctrine, ſay not to ſuch, ſo much as God ſpéed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
they are in déed heretiks and enemies to Gods truth,
they are the corrupters of his moſt ſacred word, they are
the verie botches and blanes of all Chriſtian Religion.
And that thou maiſt (good Chriſtian reader) more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſée, and more eaſily iudge, both of that old <hi>Roman</hi>
faith, and this new Romiſh Religion, my meaning is ſo
to compare the one of them with the other, that at one
view, thou maiſt ſée them both. Wherein I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
nothing, but ſincere dealing, both in ſetting down,
whatſoeuer Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or Saint <hi>Mark</hi>
haue taught vs, concerning ſuch points as are in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and alſo in poynting vnto the doctrine of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
I will not charge them with any thing vntruly,
I will not falſifie any of their writings, that the truth
may appeare, and God may haue the glorie. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> therfore doth

                  <hi>and brought forth

and the force hindered. Not becauſe I aſcribe ſuch force
either vnto the ſound, that we may heare, or the letters,
that we may read, but vnto the ſence and ſubſtance of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10074:9"/>
the word; vnto the leſſon that may be gathered out of the
ſame. Whereunto we ſée Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writing to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> (as our aduerſaries
affirme) and S. <hi>Marke</hi> alſo there according to the doctrine
of S. <hi>Peter</hi> as they tell vs, penning his goſpell, do giue this
effect that it is of power to ſaue, and the very ſéede of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life. They find not therein any ſuch hardnes, as ſhould
driue men and women from the reading therof. They find
no ſuch dangers, they ſpy no ſuch perils. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it was holden for good doctrine at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 15.</note> when Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> did write (if from thence he wrote) <hi>Alwaies to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with all meeknes and reuerence, to anſwere to euery body,
that ſhall aske a reaſon of that hope which is in you.</hi> And that
this is required of euery man &amp; woman, that ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Lord God in their hearts, euen of ſeruants, and
not of maiſters onely, of wiues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not of huſbands onely:
it is more plaine, then that it can be probably denied. Now
to yéeld a reaſon of thy faith, requireth much greter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
then to make confeſſion of thy faith. So that héere
the Apoſtle ſéemeth to require that of them, that S. <hi>Paule</hi>
doth aſſure himſelfe that he ſhal find in them, namely that
they are ſo filled with all knowledge,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that they can admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
one an other.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 1. 9. 10</note> Yea this knowledg is ſo neceſſary for all
Chriſtians that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> alwaies wiſheth it to be in
ſuch as he writeth vnto,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1. 9. 10.</note> and prayeth that they may haue
it. But ſéeing this hope that is in vs, is grounded vpon the
word (for otherwiſe it is but a foolſh fancy, and no ſound
hope) the knowledge whereby wee muſt be made able
to aunſwer of the ſame, muſt be the knowledge of Gods
worde. Yea whatſoeuer beſides that we doe know it may
perchaunce ſome way ſatiſfie our humour, and ſerue for
ſome turnes, but this one knowledge, is that onelie
that is neceſſary and without which we cannot but erre,
as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> himſelfe reporteth vnto vs that Chriſt
told the <hi>Iewes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marke. 12. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe you not erre, becauſe you know not
the Scriptures?</hi> So that we ſée, that the auncient doctrine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10074:10"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was this: That to knowe Gods
word is the meanes or power whereby God ſaueth vs,
and the ſéede of euerlaſting life. And therfore as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof is comfortable and profitable, ſo to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
thereof, is very dangerous for any Chriſtian man
or woman.</p>
               <p>But the now <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church,<note place="margin">Gods word reproched.</note> doth not onely ſuffer without
any publike ſhewing of their miſlike, the ſacred Scriptures,
and Gods written worde, to be moſt reprochfully diſgraced,
and blaſphemouſly ſcorned at, by comparing it to a leaden
rule, a noſe of wax, Inkye diuinitie, and with ſuch like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and godleſſe ſcornes: but alſo they teach, that that
word of trueth wherewith (Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
vs,<note place="margin">Iac. 1. 18.</note> is doubtfull and may be wreſted any way: it is not
ſufficient to teach vs all trueth,<note place="margin">Doubtful and not ſufficient.</note> without the helpe of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Ignoraunce mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</note>
it is harde to be vnderſtoode, and therefore the people
muſt not reade it. And that it is beſt for the people to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
ſtill: for ignorance is the mother of deuotion. So
that we ſee the auncient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs Gods word as moſt neceſſary for Chriſtians: the now
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemneth the ſame, not as needleſſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Dangerous.</note>
but euen as hurtfull and dangerous. They hated ignorance
as a ſworne enemy to Chriſtianitie: theſe reuerence her, as
a fruitfull and the onely mother of popery. Therefore the

in this nothing like.<note place="margin">Gods word muſt haue power from man.</note> And yet there is not any greater diſgrace,
that they can lay vpon this powerfull worde, then that which

that bringeth it. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> commending the worde
whereby men (by their ſinfull nature mortall) are made
immortall, poynting vnto that word ſheweth what it is,
<hi>And this is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the word, which by the goſpell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 25.</note> And in the end of this his firſt epiſtle he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth.
<hi>This is the true grace of God wherein ye ſtand.</hi> That
is to ſay,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 12.</note> this faith or religion that you haue béene taught,
this doctrine of the goſpell which you haue learned, is the

Guilliandus</hi> and <hi>Iac. Faber</hi> no enemies to popery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

that rule, is the truth: euen that which was then <hi>Depoſitum</hi>
committed or taught, not any thing that ſhould be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that old worde of God, which was then acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> But the

our new M. of <hi>Rome</hi> haue decreed, that al the books of the old

We ſee then that the old religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> taught both by
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> is to reſt in that worde that then was taught
without adding thereto. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion that now is, doth

which God commanded (not knowing that they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
but vntill the time of reformation ſhould come)
ſhould not be abrogated, and therefore would mingle the
Law with the goſpell. Who alſo looked to be iuſtified by the
Law and the works therof,<note place="margin">Rom 10. 5.</note> becauſe it was promiſed: <hi>Hee
that doth theſe things ſhall liue thereby.</hi> There were alſo a
third ſort perchance, namely ſuch as were conuerted from
<hi>Gentiliſme</hi> that being proud of that grace that was broght
vnto them, were not onely more ſecure of their own eſtate,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10074:11"/>
then was for their ſafety, but alſo deſpiſed the <hi>Iewes</hi> as a
people ſo reiected, as if God vnmindfull of his promiſe,
would neuer be reconciled to them again. Againſt al which
the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle teacheth,<note place="margin">Iuſtification by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works of the Law.</note> that al people that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
of whatſoeuer cuntry or nation, are freely iuſtified by
faith in Chriſt. And firſt he proueth that neither <hi>Iew</hi> nor
gentile (vnder which two al are comprehended) can be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed
by doing the works of the Law, becauſe none can
fulfil the Law, neither the gentiles by that light of nature,
the Law written in their heart, neither the <hi>Iewes</hi> by that
knowledge of the Law that they ſo much bragged of. And
this the Apoſtle performeth (as the diligent Reader may
obſerue) from the xvii.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> verſe of the firſt Chapter, vnto the
xxi. of the third chapter. So that he flatly concludeth. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the works of the Law, ſhal no fleſh be iuſtified.</hi> Now
this place being ſo plaine as it is, againſt iuſtification by
works, the doctrine of merits is quite ouerthrown, if ſome
color be not deuiſed to auoid the force of this teſtimony.
The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholiks therfore indeuor as much as they
can to make vs beléeue that thoſe wordes muſt haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſence and vnderſtanding, then we take them to haue:
but what ſence that is they are not yet reſolued.<note place="margin">Bellarmin. de iuſtif. li. 1. c. 19.</note> For
ſome ſay that the Apoſtle by the workes of the Law mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the works of the Ceremonial Law, and in déed many
of the Papiſts do ſo expound it. But Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not of that anſwer, &amp; confeſſeth in plain termes that
not onely the obſeruation of the Law of ceremonies, but
alſo the kéeping of the moral Law is excluded from iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
but yet he would haue vs to imagine, that onely
ſuch workes as are done before we beléeue,<note place="margin">Concil. Trident.</note> are denied to
iuſtifie vs.<note place="margin">Seſſ. 6.</note> As for the workes that we doe after, they doe
iuſtifie and merit as they teach vs.<note place="margin">Againſt merit,</note> And this their abſurd
opinion, procéedeth of their ignorance of the intent and
meaning of the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
For Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place before alledged, doth
affirme, that the Apoſtle there, as alſo in his Epiſtle to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10074:12"/>
                  <hi>Galathians,</hi> goeth about to proue that none can be ſaued
without faith, or without Gods mercy: which is in déed
the trueth, but it is not the whole trueth. For he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as carefull to take away the confidence that any had
or might haue in their owne workes. And becauſe he
writeth to them who had faith already (for, <hi>Their faith
was publiſhed throughout the worlde:</hi>)<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> and teacheth vs
that all our reioycing,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> by this iuſtification by faith in
Chriſt is taken away (but where is merit, there is reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in our ſelues) therfore it is plaine that the Apoſtle
excludeth here from iuſtifying al works. This alſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the ſetting down the true cauſe of iuſtification (<hi>By
faith</hi>) and remouing the wrong cauſe in ſo general termes:<note place="margin">28.</note>
(<hi>Without the works of the Law</hi>) &amp; that alſo the Apoſtle doth
after in the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi> All which may teach vs,
that S. <hi>Paule</hi> héere indeuoreth, to take from all workes,
when ſoeuer we doe them, all hope of being ſaued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
to the end that our pryde in our owne workes being
abated, and our boaſting taken away, <hi>He that reioyceth
may reioyce in the Lord.</hi> For this cauſe alſo the Apoſtle doth
afterwards ſo ſet workes and merit againſt grace, as if the
one of them doth quite ouerthrow the other:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>If by grace,
not now by workes, for then grace is no more grace: but if
it be of workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>then is it now no grace, for then worke is no
worke.</hi> We ſée then, that S. <hi>Paule</hi> teaching that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be iuſtified by workes, to the end that our Ieſus may
be indeed a true, onely, and perfect Sauiour, and fully ſaue
vs from al our ſins, taketh away from all our doings the
hope of meriting and deſeruing the ſame. And to this end
the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 3.</note> in the beginning of his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
doth make mention of <hi>Gods aboundant mercy</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are not onely begotten to a liuely hope, but alſo
<hi>Kept by the power of GOD through faith vnto ſaluation.</hi>
Therefore I ſay hee teacheth vs,<note place="margin">5.</note> that we obtaine this by
Gods greate goodneſſe, becauſe hee woulde not haue
vs any thing to truſt in our merites, but in that, <hi>God of all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10074:12"/>
grace, who will make vs perfect,</hi> (for our workes cannot
do that) that we may aſcribe,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>To him glory and dominion
for euer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> (and not to our ſelues, or our goodnes.) But if
any man replie that this doctrine ſéemeth contrarie to
that which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writeth to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That God
will reward euery man according to his deedes:</hi> Or to that
Saint <hi>Mark</hi> reporteth that our Sauiour Chriſt promiſed,<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 41.</note>
                  <hi>That he, who in his name, gaue a cup of cold water to drink

God in mercie promiſeth reward to ſuch as do his
will, and in mercie he likewiſe performeth the ſame, not
waighing the work, but remembring his mercie. So
that herein wee may rather commend Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in kéeping his promiſe alwaies: then eſtéeme of our
works. For who will think that a cup of cold water gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
may be worthy of eternall life? And the words of
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> are plaine enough, if we wreſt them not out
of their naturall ſence. For we denie not that GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth
men <hi>According to their workes.</hi> And the place
proueth not that GOD rewardeth them <hi>For their works,</hi>
and that ſence onely can eſtabliſh their doctrine of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
but thapoſtle ſaith there onely thus much, that
good workes ſhall haue a good reward of eternall lyfe,
glorie, honor, and peace: Euill workes their due reward
of wrath, indignation, tribulation, and anguiſh. So
that according to the qualitie of their workes, (the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
I ſay, and not the merite) GOD in mercie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his promiſe, ſhall giue honour and immortalitie
to them that ſéeke to ſerue him. This therefore ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>there ſhall no fleſh bee iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                  <note place="margin">Iames 2. 21.</note> For howſoeuer <hi>Abraham was iuſtified

<hi>For thou ſhalt not obtaine (this righteouſnes) by thy

is from aboue of Gods free gift: bringing with thee of thine,
only this one thing, namely that thou beleeue.</hi> Then which
words, what can more plainly impugne the doctrine of our
aduerſaries, or ſhew what was the iudgement of this
auncient father concerning this point? But that conſent
and conſenancy which we find in many of the Fathers,<note place="margin">Faith only.</note> as
in <hi>Origen, Hierom, Ambroſe, Iſichius, Baſil, Athanaſius, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius,

<hi>Faith only,</hi> to ſaue or iuſtifie, may ſufficiently perſwade vs
how faſt they held this old Religion, or Romiſh faith, that
a man is iuſtified by faith without the works of the Law.
I may therfore I truſt with <hi>Cyprian</hi> conclude,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 28.</note> that <hi>If A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> the new Romiſh Religion is this,<note place="margin">Works iuſtifie.</note> That good works
do merite iuſtification and eternall life,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſs. 6. can. 26. 32.</note> So that by their good
works they ſay they can ſatisfie for their ſinnes. And for this
cauſe when at ſhrift they haue confeſſed their faults, their
ghoſtly father (for ſo they terme him) will inioine ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
vnto them, wherby they tell them that they may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for their ſinnes, and make recompence to God for them.
For almes and faſting (ſaith one) doth eaſily carie men into

alſo we learne héere what is this iuſtification, the forgiuenes
of ſinnes. But is Chriſt onely profitable to them that were
in his time, and to vs that haue béene or are ſince? Yes verily
<hi>He declareth his righteouſnes in forgiuing the ſins that are paſt,</hi>
ſuch as his choſen ſeruantes haue committed ſince the world

But the ſumme of the auncient doctrine is this, that we are
iuſtified fréely without deſeruing euen by the forgiuenes of

                  <note place="margin">Marke. 13. 33.</note> By all which this doth appeare, that ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification

of ſinne (for we are waſhed that we ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
defile our ſelues with the filth of ſin) and that Gods
loue, doth more effectually tie vs to obey him, and to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
our ſelues to doe his will. And looke howe much the
more we are inſtructed, and aſſuredly perſwaded of the free
loue of God, ſo much the more, will our inner man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with loue to him againe. I ſay euen with ſuch loue,
as will thruſt vs forwardes to walke in good workes. And
this is notably proued by our Sauiour Chriſt who gathereth
that the ſinfull woman in S. <hi>Luke</hi> felt,<note place="margin">Luc. 7. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>That many ſinnes

is plainly proued by thapoſtle vnto the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſetting forth
the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> before our eyes, as a perfect patterne
of true faith, in that he beléeued not onely in generally, that
God could or would do ſuch a thing,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18. 19. 20.</note> but euen particularly,

becauſe that we can héer attaine to that perfection, that our

that faith that the diuels haue,<note place="margin">Iac. 2. 15.</note> as before out of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> I

teach that popiſh faith doth iuſtify, which is but an hiſtoricall
aſſent, to thoſe thinges that are ſpoken of GOD: but we ſay
that that aſſured perſuaſion which Sainte <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth

wee will haue a delight in Gods commaundementes, if once

                  <hi>that they may ſee our good

then we ſee that the auncient religion teacheth vs, that no

is in déede a good worke.</p>
               <p>But it is almoſt a common receiued opinion of our new <hi>Romiſh</hi>

as many think it muſt needs be a good worke, that a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
doth with a good purpoſe. Neither yet do they meaſure
this their intent or purpoſe, with the true line of Gods worde,
but with the falſe meaſure of their owne imaginations. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10074:20"/>
heereby it commeth to paſſe, that the outward appearance of a
good worke, is taken of many to be an action acceptable to
God, although it be not either directed to the right end, or
commaunded in Gods word, or done by him that hath the ſpirit
of regeneration. And this maketh them ſo groſly to teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
good workes, becauſe they would for the better credit
of their workes, commend the actions, not only of the wicked,
but of the Infidels alſo, that neuer knew God, as if they might
be perfect and void of ſinne. which is a thing as abſurde, to him
that by the light of Gods ſpirit, doth walk in the pathes of Gods

hatching ſome new deuotions, as not only the infinite

whereby they would beare the world in hand, that they
pleaſe GOD, and deſerue his fauour doe plainley prooue:
they therefore now in the new <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion commaund
vnto vs many things, whereof in the Scripture they can find
no one commaundment, no one example. They quite forget
the ſtraight charge that GOD layeth vpon his people,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 8.</note> when

our owne wantes may ſtirre vp vs to be the more

of that he can doe, or of that he ſhoulde doe, woulde
make the worlde beleeue, that he is able to offer vnto

his owne thoughtes will teſtifie againſt him, his

him, that hee deceaueth himſelfe, and that there
is no trueth in him. For this is the perfection which we
can looke for, and which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> deſireth to bring the

We are like bad tooles in a good hand (I ſpeake of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.)
The toole being ſharpened by the workeman hath
an edge, and can cut. So we when God hath reformed our
will by the ſpirit of regeneration, haue a readines or deſire
to doe good. But this edge if it méete with any thing that
is harde as iron or ſtone, is broken and made blunt or

the Lawe required is fulfilled of vs. For euen themſelues
confeſſe that luſt is aſwaruing from the Lawe, and is not

that theſe wordes of righteouſnes of the Lawe that muſt

               <p>But the new relligion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is,<note place="margin">Perfection in works.</note> that the works

howe that agreeth with that which they alſo affirme, that any

ſalue this ſore, <hi>Andradius Payuas</hi> taketh great paines in the place

that God requireth that we ſhould loue the Lord our God with

confeſſe that to this loue of God, or the keeping of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
we cannot attaine, they tell vs that God neuer
would deale ſo hardly with vs, as to require that of vs that we
cannot doe, and therefore that this commaundement doth but
ſhew what we ought to wiſh &amp; ſtriue for, but that God meaneth
not to tie vs to obey it in this life, as for the fulfilling of it, it
ſhall bee after this life. Woulde a man thinke that theſe men

Therfore if we be tyed vnto the performance of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

that God who gaue vs this commaundement, ſhall alſo, and

And being regenerate, yet there are in vs two men:
The new man weak and féeble,<note place="margin">The newman.</note> better (in truth) in hart and
courage, then in hand or power: called a new man when it is
compared with the old man. But when Gods ſpirit will in
déed ſet forth, how litle our ſtrength is to ſtand againſt our
ſpirituall enemies, in this our ſpirituall battell, then we are
called children in reſpect of our weaknes. Then alſo there is
in vs the old man,<note place="margin">The old man.</note> luſty and ſtrong, come to his full groweth.
Betwéene theſe two, in the godly there is a continual ſtrife.
As for the vngodly they are altogether old, there is in them
nothing new, no new hart or affections, no new mind or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
no good deſires, no godly motions. Now this old
man although in the regenerat he be but faint harted: yet hath
he ſo many helpes, and ſo many oportunities and occaſions
to do euill, and to annoy the new man that he is ouer doing,
neuer quiet, alwaies ſtriuing againſt the ſpirit: Inſomuch,
as he neuer ſéeth the new man, the ſpirituall man, the man
that yeldeth it ſelfe to the ſpirit of God to be led therby, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
or attempting any good thing, but ſtraight way this
old man oppoſeth himſelfe with might and main, ſo that he
will neuer ſuffer the new man quietly or fréely to do any

be found not only weak, but alſo rebellious. By this
meanes it commeth to paſſe, that although God of his great
mercie, by his good ſpirit, haue wrought in his new borne
babes, a will readie to ſerue him, and a deſire or readynes to
obey him: yet is not this will of ours, at any time frée or at

béeing firſt thought vpon, yet euen in Gods good and

firſt ſhew themſelues. Of which dangerous battell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this troubleſome effect, troubleſome (I ſay) to Gods
children, that their loue eyther of God or man, is not without
want, their faith, not without feare, their obedience, not
without blemiſh, their ſeruice, not without negligence, to
be ſhorte in any good thing that we will attempt, we ſhall
not be without euil to hinder the ſame. Which thinges being
well conſidered of, I truſt it wil eaſely appeare that our will
though it be good in the regenerate, yet is not at any time
altogether free to doe as it would, in reſpect of theſe corrupt
luſts of the fleſh. And that this is the auncient faith of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> that was in S. <hi>Paules</hi> time, it is more plaine
then that with any good ſhew of reaſon it may be denied. For
the Apoſtle teacheth the <hi>Romans</hi> thus much euen by his own
example. Who féeling within himſelfe, this ſpirituall battel
betwéene the ſpirit and the fleſh, (which onely Gods children
do féele) &amp; ſo by experience being taught, that when he had
done what he could, he was notable to doe that which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
he would haue done,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> he plainely confeſſeth, <hi>The good
that I would, do I not, but the euill which I would not, that do I.</hi>
Now I truſt no man will anſwere that he ſpeaketh not of
that he could doe, but of that he did: I truſt no body wil ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
but that the Apoſtle did what he could to doe good, and
not to doe euill, and yet when he had ſtriuen therein to the
vttermoſt, his regenerate and godly will, was not of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to performe his godly deſires. But if any man would iudge
ſo groſly of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> as that he might haue done more then
he did to ſtand againſt ſinne, yet would they be ſufficiently
confuted by that which the ſame apoſtle addeth almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
whereby he ſheweth by what meanes it came to
paſſe, that he was ſo driuen and drawen to doe againſt his
will.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22. 23.</note> Euen becauſe <hi>There was a Lawe in his members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
againſt the Lawe of his minde, and leading him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

ſhall we imagine that we, who are much leſſe fréed from

or power in vs? Shall we that are in compariſon, drye

is, according to that I haue before ſaid, eſpecially in the viii.
Chapter: and on the other ſide how weake wee are of
our ſelues, becauſe our regeneration is not heere perfected,
and how ſtirring and ſtriuing our luſtes are whereby we
are hindred in our good indeuours: he wil vtterly deteſt that
deceitfull doctrine of mans free will to doe good, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre

in deed profitable to any, but to ſuch as haue that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and holines of Chriſt Ieſus, ſealed vp thereby vnto their
owne conſciences. Whereby it appeareth moſt plainly, that
the ſacraments doe not giue grace, or worke righteouſnes in
vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 25.</note> or of themſelues, becauſe they are receiued of vs, do make
vs holy. But as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of circumciſion, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
verily profiteth nothing, except you keepe the Law;</hi>
ſo may we truely ſay of our Sacramentes, that not the
receiuing of our Sacramentes, but the holy obedience
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10074:29"/>
ſpringing from our faith, that is ſealed vp vnto the godly in
the Sacramentes is the thing that is acceptable to God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
before men, and comfortable to our owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For as in that place alledged, hee reckoneth them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truely circumciſed, that keepe and fulfill the Lawe, and
haue that true circumciſion of the heart, and that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
howe ſo euer they haue receiued in their fleſhe the
outwarde marke or ſigne, yet are in deed vncircumciſed: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſo howe ſolemnly ſo euer the faithleſſe and fruiteleſſe
flocke, haue receiued the Sacramentes of our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and redemption which is in Chriſt, yet if they bring
not forth ſuch fruites of the ſpirite, as doe teſtifie and ſhew
that inwarde waſhing away of the filth of ſinne, they
haue <hi>Baptiſmum fluminis</hi> the waſhing of the water, <hi>non flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
not of the holy Ghoſt: they haue the ſigne of Gods grace,
but not the ſubſtance thereof, the viſible token, but not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible
grace. But the Sacramentes are vnto ſuch as ſeales
ſet to a blanke, wherein becauſe dothing is contayned,
therefore by theſe ſeales, there is nothing aſſured. Nowe out
of this which hitherto I haue ſaide, we ſee that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
haue theſe two vſes, to aſſure vs of the performance
of the promiſe of grace, and to preach to vs repentaunce for
our ſinnes paſt, and holines in the reſt of our life that is
to come.</p>
               <p>But our now <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholickes, who are neuer content, that
eyther themſelues or other ſhould eate within the teacher of the
word of God, doe wander farre out of theſe liſtes: teaching that
our Sacramentes haue in them that grace which they ſignifie,<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 7. can. 6. 7. 8</note>
and doe giue the ſame grace, to all men, at all times if men be
not a let vnto themſelues, euen <hi>Ex opere operate,</hi> that is in reſpect
of the worke it ſelfe, becauſe the Sacraments are receiued of
them. Wherby they doe ſuch iniurie vnto Chriſt, as we that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

of.<note place="margin">Math. 1. 21.</note> For that ſauing from ſinne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 16.</note> which God by the miniſtery of the
Angel proclaimed ſhould be by his ſonne, whom for that cauſe
he called Ieſus our Sauiour, becauſe he ſhoulde ſaue his people
from their ſins, they aſcribe vnto the Sacraments. And that grace
which we can finde onely in Chriſt, of whoſe fulnes we haue all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10074:29"/>
receiued grace for grace,<note place="margin">Cyprian de bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſ. Christi.</note> they would haue vs to ſeek for in ſuch
viſible things, as are in truth but pledges of the ſame. Whether
(ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi>) it be Iudas or Paule that baptiſeth, it is Chriſt
that waſheth,<note place="margin">In 2. Cor. 3.</note> pardoneth, and putteth away ſinne. And S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
making a difference between the watering that is by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, ſaith, that to forgiue ſinnes
(in baptiſme) and to giue the holy Ghoſt, it belongeth to God
only: for the ſpirit hath bin giuen without laying on of hands,
and the remiſſion of faults without baptiſme, if we will credit
that learned Father.<note place="margin">Contra Creſcon. grammat. li. 2. cap. 21.</note> Both the good and the bad (ſaith S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>)
can dip in the water, but none but he that is alwayes good
can waſh the conſcience. Thus do theſe agree with the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>
Faith, teaching the outward ſigne, not to giue but to aſſure
vs of the inuiſible grace. And yet they are not aſhamed, ſtill to
brag that the faith of the Romans was commended by thapoſtle:
Although themſelues that boaſt ſo much thereof, as it is eaſie to
ſee, if we compare this auncient Faith, with their new deuiſes, do
ſet themſelues as ſworne enemies to the ſame, to fight againſt
that faith. And this I ſuppoſe is the effect of that which can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of theſe firſt eight Chapters of this Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
of ſuch things as are in controuerſy between vs and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
Wherin if they teach, that which theſe Apoſtles and faithful
ſeruants of God did teach, let their doctrine be beleeued. But if
they haue chaunged that auncient Religion, ſwarued from that
old Faith, corrupted that worſhip of God, and mingled that pure
wine, either with the water of their own inuentions, or the dregs
of Iewiſh and Heathniſh ſuperſtitions, why do we not deteſt
theſe deceiuing Doctors, as enemies to all truth, and hinderers of
our eternall ſaluation?</p>

this confirmed by the latter end of the laſt ſentence, which is
with full content left out by the old Tranſlation, the <hi>Rhei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>

a number, vpon whom he beſtoweth eternall life. Which
doctrine as it was daungerouſly impuyned in thoſe dayes of
S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſo was it learnedly defended by him in ſundry

heretickes burthened this doctrine withall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our aduerſaries ſhould be aſhamed to vſe them. Now if
you long alſo to know what theſe heretickes did teach, this it
is.<note place="margin">Proſperi. Epiſt. apud Auguſt. De praedeſtinat. Sanct. cap. 18.</note> That God foreſéeing who ſhould beléeue, and continue in
that faith, did predeſtinate ſuch to his kingdom. Or as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
ſaith they taught that God did chooſe ſuch as he ſawe
ſhoulde be holy by the choice of their frée will, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he ſhewed the election to bée frée, without any regard to

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:10074:31"/>
But becauſe they like worſe then to be thoughte
new (although in all thinges they are new fangled) let vs
ſee what it is that they would haue vs beléeue.</p>
               <p>No doubt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth as much as they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to obſcure and darken this doctrine, that the glory of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
may ſhine the brighter. And therefore euen Maſter <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
who in as plaine wordes as he can deuiſe, hath before
taught that this election is free without any reſpect to workes;
yet after (as he now repented him of that he had ſaid) writeth
That by predeſtination the elect get no right or clayme to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes,<note place="margin">Degra. &amp; lib. Ar. li. 2. cap. 15.</note>
neyther is it due to them, but after that by well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
they haue gotten the ſame. Can white and blacke be more
contrarie, then theſe two ſayings are one of them to the other?
So that whilſt he ſeeketh to eſtabliſh the opinion of merites, he
doth not onely gainfay the trueth, but euen himſelfe alſo. Let
vs marke the ſimilitude whereby he will illuſtrate his meaning.
A king (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) promiſeth a price to the beſt runner,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 17.</note> to
whome God reuealeth that if they runne vpon horſes, ſuch a
one ſhall winne, in wagons ſuch a one, on foote ſuch a one, by
ſhip ſuch a one. Then he appoynteth them to runne with
wagons, which he alſo cauſeth to be prepared for them. Althogh
Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may ſeeme to be runne farre from the trueth,
when by ſuch fond fictions, he would make falſhoode carie a
ſhew of ſound doctrine: yet we may ſee his meaning is that as,
the kinge propoſeth the price to the beſt runner, and then
appoynteth ſuch a kinde of running, as he knoweth he ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in, whom he would haue to winne: ſo God electeth vnto
happines, ſuch as he would, becauſe he knew before that they
ſhould merit the ſame. Is this free election? Is there in this no
regard to workes?<note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 8.</note> I ſuppoſe it is in our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Maſter verified,
that is ſpoken of the Idol makers, That they who make the Idols

ſelues, that haue eyes and ſee not, eares and heare not, yea wit

But when they haue done what they can, that auncient fayth
ſhall be founde not onely true, but alſo directly againſt their
doctrine, If election bee by grace, then not of workes, if
by workes then not by grace. And becauſe it ſeemeth they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10074:31"/>
are not yet reſolued, whether they ſhoulde mayntaine the
auncient fayth of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſometime they commende,
or this newe opinion, which they had rather follow, it were
beſt they woulde ſettle them ſelues to ſtande to the one or the
other, for they cannot make both agree together. Neyther
are they content vpon this olde garment to ſet a newe patch:<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. cap. 12.</note>
but alſo as much as they dare, they diſgrace this auncient fayth
and olde religion, when they call it a vaine preſumption and
raſh to aſſure our ſelues of our election.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29.</note> But firſt that our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is certaine I hope they dare not deny, becauſe the free
giftes and calling of God are without repentance. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
then is whether wee can be aſſured that we are choſen:
woulde he that taught vs to call him father, haue vs to doubt
whether we be his children? Or if the ſpirite it ſelfe beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to our ſpirite,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. 16.</note> that we are the ſonnes of GOD, ſhall
theſe newe vpſtart Catholickes tell vs, that ſo to doe is

like is that,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5.</note> that S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo writeth of <hi>Our ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
acceptable to God through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Nowe none can
offer a ſacrifice, but ſuch as are prieſtes, but all men muſt
offer theſe ſacrifices: (for the Apoſtles both of them write,
not onely to ſuch as were in the miniſterie among them, but
euen to the lay people, mouing then to offer theſe offerings)
therefore all men are prieſtes. Yea S. <hi>Peter</hi> in playne words
affirmeth that we are <hi>A royall prieſthoode,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9.</note> or as it is in

                  <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 6.</note> For there al muſt be kings, and al muſt be priſtes.
Neither can we reade that there is inſtituted in the newe
teſtament any other kinde of Sacrifiſing prieſtes then
theſe. And wee muſt alſo marke what our ſacrifice is that
is heere mentioned: The ſacrifice (not of Chriſtes bodie)
but of our owne bodies, the ſacrifiſing and ſanctifing of our
ſelues. Now if the Apoſtles had knowen of any ſacricire of
the Maſſe,<note place="margin">The Sacrifice of the Maſſe.</note> was there not now good occaſion to haue menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
it? Yea if it had béene in ſo greate accompt as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
hold it to be, how coulde theſe two Apoſtles, without
great impietie haue buried in ſilence, or paſſed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning, ſo neceſſarie a ſeruice of God? But then
there was no ſuch thing, and therefore it is not ſpoken of
by them, who can beſt tell vs what the olde <hi>Roman</hi> ſaith
was. It hath beene long after that time raked out of the
verie channell and ſinke of ſuperſtitions, and is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to that they taught, that if this ſacrifice of the Maſſe
had beene but once mentioned in their time, they would
in expreſſe wordes, haue made the verie name of it odious,
among Gods people. Well of this exhortation we learne,
becauſe we are both the ſacrifice, and ſacrificer, the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10074:32"/>
and the prieſt, that we muſt in al thinges apply our
ſelues in holines to ſerue God. For that which is offered
to GOD muſt haue no blemiſh: and the prieſtes were
conſecrated to Gods ſeruice: euen ſo muſt we ſtriue to be
faultleſſe, and alwaies indeuour to be occupied in good
workes, and in ſo doing we ſhall in deede as holy prieſtes,
offer vnto God moſt acceptable ſacrifices. As concerning
ſacrifices for ſinne we knowe none but Chriſt, we ſeeke none

ſo in ſuch ſort to wreſt theſe wordes could not make for
them. For if they ſay doe this, that is, ſacrifice as I doe, they
are farre from ſacrifyſing as Chriſt did. For hee did, ſacrifice
him ſelfe in his death vpon the tree. But our <hi>Romiſh</hi> prieſts,
will rather leaue their prieſthoode, then offer ſuch ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Well it doth not appeare in the writinges of theſe two
Apoſtles, that euer they dreamed of ſuch a prieſthood but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that whereof by Chriſt we are all partakers, euen all that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10074:33"/>
offer vp theſe ſpirituall ſacrifices, men, women, children, of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
ſortes, and ſexes. So that theſe ſacrificers are a new order,
whether they be regular or irregular,<note place="margin">Sacrifices.</note> it maketh no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For they were not ſo much as thought vpon, in the Apoſtles
times. And for the ſacrifices whereunto S. <hi>Paule</hi> moueth vs,
they tell vs much of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, an Idoll of their
own making, ſet vp to deface and diſgrace the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of Chriſt his death and paſſion. For when blaſphemouſly
they terme it,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24. 35.</note> a ſacrifice propitiatory for the quick and the dead,
is not that directly contrary to that free iuſtification by grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note>
by the redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſus which is eternally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
by his owne ſacrifice of himſelfe once offered,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 10. 14.</note> euen to
that propitiation which God hath ſet forth to vs in his bloude?
Which doctrine the Apoſtles teach vs euery where, and namelie
S. <hi>Paule,</hi> moſt plentifully before hath inſtructed the <hi>Romans</hi>
therein. Other offerings alſo they put vs in minde of, namely to
offer to ſtockes and ſtones, which they call ſaintes, fat offerings,
with full hands, that the greater ſhare may come to the prieſtes.
Yea they will alſo make men beleeue, that it is no meane ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to God, if you be good and bountifull to them, but that it
ſmelleth full ſweetely, and is highly accepted of him. And thus
whereas S. <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs to ſacrifice our ſelues to God, they
tell vs that eyther we muſt ſacrifice our landes, goods, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
to them or their benefite, or elſe they muſt ſacrifice for
vs in the Maſſe, and not we for our ſelues. And theſe are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and offerings that they ſpeake of: how neere of kinne to
thoſe that the Apoſtles ſpeake of let the reader iudge.</p>

I mean not héer to make my ſelfe a partie in that bitter
contention, which miſerably hath afflicted this Church of
England, which I would to God, either it neuer had bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
or had bin followed, with more moderation. I purpoſe
not curiouſly to examine what is ment by theſe particular
words of propheſying, office, teaching, exhorting, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ruling, ſhewing mercie. In which many beſtow too
much labour, more then in the defence of the truth, againſt
the ſworne enemyes to our profeſſion. We haue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
our profeſſed aduerſaries, who think their quietnes,

that which eſpecially I note in theſe words, we ſée that if all
theſe duties before mencioned,<note place="margin">Offices in the Church of Rome.</note> did belong to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
function, yet can we not find out the offices that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, will haue to bee in their
Church. We find there prophets or teachers, likewiſe ſuch
as exhort. Admit alſo that we find the Deacons there to
diſtribute. By rulers ſome vnderſtand not onely Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
Rulers, but other Magiſtrates alſo. As that lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of ſhewing mercie, may well ſignifie any that by
office in the common wealth, or Church, or béeing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by their owne priuate affection do ſhew mercy: It is
not vnlikely, but that if there had bin at that time any
other offices in the Church, the Apoſtle would haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them. And to be ſhort, the offices that the Apoſtle
mentioneth, either belong to the miniſterie of the word,
as <hi>prophecying, teaching, exhorting:</hi> Or to the care of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10074:34"/>
poore, as Deacons that diſtribute, and they that ſhew mercy,
or to gouernment and bearing rule (if in that thapoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of Church offices.) A ſecond thing that muſt héere be
conſidered of, and that which is in déed the principall intent
and meaning of the Apoſtle, is the ſinceritie &amp; that euery one
in theſe duties muſt performe. For he would haue vs faithful
in the office that is committed vnto vs, whatſoeuer it be, and
that according to the meaſure of Faith, &amp; the grace that is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

to what end the offices were appointed in the ancient. <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, &amp; what was required at the hand of each Officer.</p>
               <p>But afterwards as ſuperſtition began to grow, ſo theſe functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
heer ſpoken of by thapoſtle began to be leſſe regarded, and
other were had in a greater accompt. For theſe are the orders in
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.<note place="margin">Diſt. 21. cap. Cleros.</note> Prieſts, Deacons, Subdeacons, Candle ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
or Candle-cariers, Exorciſts or Coniurers, Readers, Porters.
Some alſo reckon the Singers amongſt their orders. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
euen the meaneſt of theſe might performe ſome neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſeruice in the Church, yet by what reaſon can they imagine
that their Candle-cariers, or Porters, are neerer to the Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
then other that haue no ſuch office in the Church? As for
their Prieſts, who are to ſupply the place of Prophets, teachers,
and exhorters, they haue in a maner altered that function, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them another work to doe. For when they take orders, the
Biſhop giuing them in their hand the Chalice with wine,<note place="margin">Durand. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. diuin. li. 3.</note> and the
couer of the chalice with one of their cakes vpon it, ſaith to them,
<hi>Receiue power to offer a ſacrifice to God, and to ſay Maſſe, both for
them that liue, and for the dead, in the name of the Lord.</hi> So prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is no part of their dutie, but only to ſacrifice and ſay Maſſe.
And if any man will obiect, that we our ſelues haue alſo want of
ſuch learned Miniſters, as are able truely and ſoundly to teach,
and rightly to deuide the word of life: I muſt needs confeſſe
that we are neither as we ſhould, neither as we would be for that
point, but wiſh and pray daily, that the Lord would increaſe
mightily, the number or paynfull and faithfull labourers in his
vineyard. But yet we are not either ſo ſenceleſſe or ſhameleſſe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10074:34"/>
that we dare alter Chriſtes ordinance. We are not ſo ſawcy, that

Doe you not know that it is high time for you to looke

ſhall not alwaies be ſatisfyed with the ſpoyle of other. But to

neyther hath one worde more then the reſt whereby we may
gather any ſuch ſuperioritie in him. And if he make any mention
of <hi>Peter,</hi> it is without any ſignification of his iuriſdiction ouer

neither when he ſetteth forth his calling, neither in pointing to his

any way ſignifyed his ſuperioritie: it followeth that eyther S.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle hauing exhorted vnto ſuch
Chriſtian dueties as we may not omit:
commeth in his xiiii. Chapter to take order
for ſuch things as of themſelues being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
are according to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be vſed or not.<note place="margin">What are the things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> Wherein we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

                  </gap>ing,) how farre they wander
from S. <hi>Paules</hi> rules. And firſt all external or worldly things,
are of themſelues, &amp; in their owne nature indifferent, meats,
and drinkes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 14.</note> apparrell, daies and times and ſuch like, <hi>I know
and am perſuaded by the Lord Ieſus, that nothing is common
of it ſelfe</hi> (that is vncleane) ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And againe <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God is not meate and drinke, but righteouſneſſe and
peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as if he had ſaid, true holines,
religion, or the acceptable ſeruice to God, conſiſteth not in
eating or not eating, drinking or not drinking, but in this
rather, that thy minde beeing rauiſhed with true ſpirituall
ioy, thou ſhouldeſt ſéeke to ſerue God (not in ſuch toyes) but
in ſincere righteouſnes, and to cheriſh thy brother in perfect
peace. And therefore for the vſe of ſuch thinges he giueth
theſe rules, <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth
not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and let not him that eateth not, iudge him that eateth.</hi>
So that he will not for ſuch thinges haue one man to iudge
another. Secondly it is neceſſary that <hi>Euery man be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fully in his owne minde,</hi> whether he may with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
grounded vpon the warrant of the worde,<note place="margin">5.</note> doe
that which he doth.<note place="margin">22.</note> For <hi>Happie is hee which condemneth
not himſelfe, in that which hee alloweth. For hee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
conſcience is damned if he eate, becauſe hee eateth not
of fayth. For whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> Thirdly,
we muſt not <hi>put a ſtumbling blocke, or an occaſion to fall
in our brothers waie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13.</note> or doe any thing that may greeue or
offende him,<note place="margin">15.</note> for whome Chriſt hath died. But yet we muſt
take heede, that we haue not ſo much regarde vnto man, to
pleaſe and beare with him in his weakneſſe, that we cheriſh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10074:37"/>
him in his ignorance or infirmitie;<note place="margin">19.</note> but withall we muſt <hi>Do
thoſe things, wherby one may edifie another.</hi> For euen Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 20. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>who made himſelfe a Iew for the Iewes, and was made all
things to all men, that he might by all meanes ſaue ſome:</hi> Yet
<hi>reſiſted Peter to the face,</hi> that is plainly and openly, when he
had not ſo due regard to edifying of others, as he ſhould haue
had,<note place="margin">Gala. 2. 11.</note> as may appeare in that ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And this is the ſumme of that, which thapoſtle teacheth
the <hi>Romans</hi> of theſe things. For that which he addeth in the
beginning of the xv. Chapter, belongeth to ſuch points as I
haue alreadie touched. And in ſuch things muſt thoſe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
be regarded,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 8.</note> which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath. <hi>But aboue all
things haue feruent loue among your ſelues, for loue couereth
the multitude of ſinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 8.</note> And that we ſhould <hi>all be of one
mind.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 5.</note> And that we ſhould <hi>Submit our ſelues euery man one to
another.</hi> Thus then we ſée, that theſe indifferent and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
things, haue not in themſelues any holyneſſe, or vnholy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but may be vſed, or not vſed, if we be rightly perſuaded
of our libertie therein, ſo that we offend not our weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but ſéek their edifying. Therfore in ſuch things we
muſt neither condemne, or commend others. And this is
the auncient and Catholike faith of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which although
it were by ſome men (otherwiſe not euill) dangerouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted,
and that not long after the dayes of thapoſtles: yet
the godly of thoſe times, did hold faſt the libertie which they
had by Chriſt, and would not ſuffer the Church to be ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to ſuch obſeruations.<note place="margin">Ignatius.</note> It may be gathered by <hi>Ignatius</hi>
his Epiſtles to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> and to <hi>Heron,</hi> that ſome
there were then, that put ſome holyneſſe in eating, or not
eating, againſt whom he gyueth this charge in both thoſe
Epiſtles, that they eſtéeme not ſuch as kéepe not faſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
rules, to belong to Chriſt, but to be wolues in ſhéepes
clothing, that ſéeke to deuour. And yet not long after, one
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> a good man,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. li. 5. ca. 3.</note> and one that alſo ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
did by too auſter diet, (no doubt thinking therein to
conſiſt ſome ſeruice of God) refuſe to vſe Gods creatures,
and gaue to other example of offence, and therof being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
by one <hi>Attalus,</hi> he afterwards reformed that his error.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10074:38"/>
Yea in the Church of <hi>Rome, Victor</hi> being Biſhop there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
ſome impechment of this libertie, whileſt he ſought too
earneſtly to tye other churches to obſerue in ſuch things the
cuſtomes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. Hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. li. 5. ca. 25.</note> But <hi>Ireny</hi> worte vnto him
in the name of the reſt of his brethren in Fraunce, letting
him vnderſtand, that neither his predeceſſors did, nor he
ought for ſuch things to diſſolue the bond of vnitie that was
among the Churches.<note place="margin">cap. 26.</note> And thus we ſée, how that a good
while after the Apoſtles daies, this doctrine commended héer
to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was continued both there and elſe
where throughout the Church, &amp; that they would not ſuffer
any neceſſitie to be decréed in ſuch obſeruances.</p>
               <p>But now the new <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, doth beare another ſtamp, and
is of another making.<note place="margin">Mark. 7. 18.</note> For where Saint <hi>Mark</hi> out of Chriſtes
mouth ſaith, that meats defyle not the man, and alſo the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
that the kingdom of God is not in ſuch things, which elſwhere
he more plainly vttereth in theſe words:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 8.</note> Meat doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vs to God, that is, to eat, or not to eat it maketh vs no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no holyer, no more acceptable to God. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
on the contrarie, hath almoſt all her Religion conſiſting in ſuch
outward obſeruances, all her holyneſſe in a maner is contayned
within theſe few precepts,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 21.</note> Touch not, taſt not, handle not, and
ſome other toyes like to theſe. What is more commonly taught
among them, then that to eat fleſh, egges, or whitmeat at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
times, is a grieuous ſinne, for any man of lawfull yeares and
in health? Or for ſome at any time to vſe them? I know they wil
aunſwer the Church hath otherwiſe commaunded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take libertie to vſe theſe things, is a ſinne, becauſe the
Church hath commaunded they ſhall not vſe them. But heer I
might examin who gaue aucthoritie to the Church to ſay that is
vnlawfull, that God ſaith is lawfull. Again I might ſhew, that
not onely in reſpect of the commaundement of the Church,
theſe things are obſerued, but euen in reſpect of ſome other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the meat it ſelfe, then ſhould be had, becauſe that more
ſuperſtitiouſly they obſerue it then Gods precepts. But if they
had regard onely to the commaundement, doubtleſſe there is
no man ſo ſottiſh, but would rather obey Gods expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
then any decree of the Church. But theſe and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10074:38"/>
ſuch other poynts I omit: onely purpoſing in this place to ſhew,
how great a piece of popiſh holines conſiſteth in theſe externall
ſeruices, wherin the Apoſtle telleth vs there is no ſuch thing. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
in abſtaining from certaine meats, in keeping of certaine
daies, in gadding to <hi>Rome, Ieruſalem</hi> or Compoſtell in pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
in holy bread, holy water, palme croſſes, aſhes, in haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
in going barefoote, in not touching mony, in not ſpeaking,
in bearing in thy boſome a piece of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> goſpell, in
<hi>Agnus deis</hi> or bleſſed grains hanging about thy neck, in a Monks
cowle, in his bootes, and great holines in S. <hi>Francis</hi> breeches, in
dead mens ſkuls, and bones, in the bloud of hayles, &amp; many other
ſuch like thinges. Whereby the true holines, whichis the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Gods holy lawes, is almoſt forgotten, while men content
themſelues, with this vnholy and trifling traſh, which for want
of better ſtuffe, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church that now is, giueth her fooles
in ſteed of bables to play withall, or make them paſtime. For
why may I not accompt and proclaime them for fooles, who wil
not ſo much as heare the wiſedome of God, and will ſo readely,
nay ſo greedely follow ſuch follies of men? Or that wil imagine
that God who is a ſpirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirite and
trueth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 24.</note> can be any thing delighted in ſuch apiſh toyes? well
to this ende haue I ſaide thus much, that we may ſee, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the olde faith of the <hi>Romans,</hi> retayned a Chriſtian liberty,
in the vſe of all theſe thinges, to be vſed according to the rule
of charitie: the new <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion, bringeth them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and followe it, into a great bondage and ſubiection,
to almoſt all the creatures, and make them to eſteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnholy, if moderately, without breach of any Lawe of
God or offence of brethren, with thankeſgiuing as God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
they vſe the ſame.</p>

The Godly know no other helpe but God, and therefore pray
to none but him, neither are thankefull to any but to him,

                  <hi>My God, my God why haſt thouforſaken me?</hi>
The whole ſcriptures agrée with this that héere is taught.
They are full of commaundementes wherein we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to call vpon God in the day of our trouble; full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the Godly, that make requeſtes to God onely:
full of thankeſgiuings, wherein the faithfull acknowledge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10074:39"/>
that euery good &amp; perfect gifte commeth from aboue from the
Father of lightes,<note place="margin">Iac. 1.</note> and therefore they are moued to ſay with
<hi>Dauid, O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for he is gratious, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

or what good thing ſo euer we conſider in our ſelues,
we muſt confeſſe, that all that we acknowledge our ſelues
bound to be thankfull for, is giuen vs of God. Whether life
or liuing, thinges temporall or eternall, or whatſoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bleſſing. And therefore to him onely muſt we make our
prayers, for that we want: to him onely muſt we giue
thankes, for that we haue. And ſuch are the prayers that
were made in the auncient Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea ſuch are
the prayers of all the godly through out the ſcriptures. And
this was the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo in the daies of <hi>Iuſtin</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyr
who liued at <hi>Rome.</hi> For he writing againſt <hi>Tryphon</hi> the

                  <hi>Thou art my God, departe not from me</hi> ſaith
thus. He teacheth that euery man muſt repoſe his truſt in
God, and aſke for health and helpe of him. So that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
did, ſo <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> teacheth vs that we ſhould doe. I might
to this end haue a whole cloud of witneſſes, out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the purer age of the Church: but becauſe I will not
be tedious in ſo plaine a matter, I content my ſelfe with that
one place out of <hi>Tertullian Aske and ye ſhall haue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De preſcript ad Haereticos.</note> 
                  <hi>is ſpoken
to ſuch as know of whom they ſhould aske, that is of him that
hath promiſed anything, euen of the God of Abraham, Iſaac, &amp;
Iacob.</hi> And for the doctrine of mediation this onely will I ſay
out of S. <hi>Auguſtine, That he only that maketh interceſſion for al,
and none for him, is the true Mediatour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contra Epiſtol. perueniam Donat. cap.</note> For as he inferreth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<hi>If <hi>Paul</hi> had beene a Mediatour, then other alſo his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Apoſtls ſhould haue beene Mediatours likewiſe. And if there
ſhould haue bin many, then <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf had no reaſon to ſay one
God, one Mediatour between God &amp; man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
Thus we ſée that S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> confuting the auncient heretiks

But the Romiſh Church that now is, as in all things els, they
frame vnto themſelues newe opinions, ſo heere alſo they haue
forſaken the old waies, yea they haue committed two euils, they
haue forſaken God,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> the fountaine of liuing waters, to digge to
themſelues pittes, broken pittes, that will holde no water. And
we need not heerein examine their doctrine: their practiſe doth
ſufficiently ſhew and proue,<note place="margin">Vowes to the Saintes.</note> what blaſphemies and ſuperſtitions
that Church cheriſheth, In perils and dangers by ſea and by
land, they will vowe and promiſe, offerings and giftes, which if
they eſcape they will alſo performe to ſuch ſaintes as they vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto. For euery ſickenes they had, and in that <hi>Romiſh</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
of more then <hi>Aegyptical</hi> darkenes, they yet haue a
peculiar Saint, to whome they would call for helpe. Yea euery
beaſt had their leach among them, and their very pigs were not
without their Saint <hi>Anthonie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Honour to Images.</note> In euery Church they had their
Images, before which they kneeled, they knockt, they crept, they
prayed, they ſwete, thy cenſed, they offered and did before
them as much outwarde honour, as they would or coulde doe
to GOD himſelfe. In their names woulde they dedicate
Churches and Chappels, thereby the rather to binde them to
heare them when they pray, and helpe them when they ſtand in
need. And whereas that pattern of prayer that Chriſt hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
teacheth vs onely to pray to him, whom we may call Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſay <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi> yet theſe <hi>Romiſh
Rabbies</hi> (in heauenly matters as blind as beetels) can very well
ſuffer the people,<note place="margin">Our father to hee Saints &amp; ſhee Saints.</note> nay they teach them to ſay that prayer, before
euery Image not of men onely, but of women alſo. What mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is this (if it were lawfull to pray vnto Saintes, which is
in trueth a greate diſhonoring of God, and manifeſtly againſt
the commaundement) to kneele before the Image of Saint
<hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Chriſt, or <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or any other
woman ſaying Our Father to them? If they coulde heare vs,
woulde not they thinke we were mad? Or in like manner

their wordes that they muſt powre out before euery Idoll,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10074:40"/>
their beades did teach them to mumble vp ſo many creedes, ſo
many Aue maries, ſo many pater noſters. Their pardons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies
require the like order. God himſelfe coulde haue no
more of them then ſuch ſtuffe as they had learned to reckon or
ſcore vp on their beades, and the meaneſt Saint ſhould haue no
leſſe. Yea the learneder ſorte, yet among other their prayers,
muſt ſalute God himſelf if at any time they would pray vnto him
or Saint Peter or any other he Saint with <hi>Hayle Mary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hayle Mary to Hee Saints.</note> Fie vpon
ſuch brutiſh and beaſtly blindnes, whereby men and women are
ſo beſotted,<note place="margin">Pſal. 109. 7.</note> that they doe not onely powre forth vaine prayers
that are turned into ſinne, wherein they can finde no comfort,
becauſe they ſeek it not of him that can help, but alſo abuſe moſt
fooliſhly the Lords Prayer which onely belongeth to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father, yet they will pray with it before euery their Saints
men or women. Well their prayers then we ſee are too abſurd.
So are their thankeſgiuinges as before I ſaide, in that they yeeld
all praiſe and glory of their deliuerance, not to God onely who
onely hath wrought it, but to their Idols of whom they asked it.
As for Mediator we haue none but Chriſt, we ſhould know none
but Chriſt: I know not (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) what other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour
to ſende to thee,<note place="margin">Meditat. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the high prieſt in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Lawe. He onely offered the peoples
offeringes, he onely entred into the moſt holy place, to teach vs
to content our ſelues with one onely Mediatour which is Chriſt.
Where learned our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks to pray to any other then
vnto God? Where learned they to ſeeke for other mediatours?
We ſee the auncient faith of the <hi>Romans,</hi> hath no ſuch comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
no ſuch patterne or example to follow, but the contrary.
Let not then from henceforth the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, brag of the
auncient <hi>Roman</hi> faith, for they haue it not, they haue chaunged
well neere euery poynt of it, they haue made it almoſt all new,

               <p>To conſider how S. <hi>Paul</hi> was exerciſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſee
how the Pope is there occupied, it would make a man to maruel
that euer thoſe prophane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare giue vnto themſeues the name

what are the ſpirituall bleſſings that this holy father of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth.
Sometime he wil ſend to ſome of his dear ſons, a golden
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10074:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roſe conſecrated, or ſome picture conſecrated, ſometime a ſword
in token that he would haue them fight for him, yea perchaunce
to embrew in the bloud of the Saints, and all muſt be hallowed
that he doth ſend. Sometimes perchaunce a Cardinals hat, to one
that hath ſhewed himſelfe ſtubborne enough againſt his Prince.
Sometime he will beſtow Kingdomes, if they vpon whom he
beſtoweth them, can get them from the right heires. Sometime
he will beſtow vpon ſubiects, immunities from performing their
dutyfull obedience, as he doth many times by his priuiledges.
As for indulgences and pardons, any bodie that will pray and
pay for them, may haue them. And they that dwell at <hi>Rome</hi> get
yet another maner of bleſſing with his two fingers, wherwith
he bleſſeth the people, that gaze at him when he is caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
To be ſhort, at certain times he bleſſeth thoſe that are
called bleſſed graines, or <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> or ſuch like ſtuffe, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

them, and purpoſed to work among them, by the powerful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

ſpirituall gifts, euen abundance of bleſſing by the miniſterie of
the word. But the Pope, becauſe he cannot skill of ſuch bleſſings

touched by <hi>Saint Paule</hi> in that epiſtle, although in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
plentifully enough by him deliuered. <hi>Saint Peter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in handling the dueties betweene man and wife, doth
thereby commend the honourable eſtate of marriage, as a
ſtate of life whereof God hath a care, and therefore giueth
lawes and rules, in obſeruing whereof huſbands and wiues
may ſerue and pleaſe God. And if he had ſo verie well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of ſingle life, as they who call themſelues his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
doe, hee woulde no doubte haue taken occaſion, to

haue put in ſome caueat for the ſame.<note place="margin">Marke. 1. 30 vpon Math. 8 ver. 14.</note> But himſelfe was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
as the <hi>Rhemiſtes</hi> themſelues confeſſe, and though out of
<hi>Hierome</hi> they would proue, that being called to be an Apoſtle
he forſooke his wife: yet how falſe that is, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
doth plainely enough declare. For he exhorteth <hi>Husbands
to dwel with their wiues according to knowledge</hi> that is, to kéepe
and continue holily and kindly with them,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 7</note> not vngodly and
vncourteouſly to forſake them. And ſhall we imagine that S.
<hi>Peter</hi> would teach others and not himſelfe? or ſay one thing,
and doe another? or that in wordes exhorting them not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from their wiues, by his example he would moue them
to leaue them? That be farre from vs once to imagine. And this
we may be ſure of, that if he had forſaken his wife, as our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Catholickes now, or ſome other in former times, iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to that holy ordinance did ſurmiſe, he woulde yet ſo haue
tempered this his general commaundement, that his example
ſhoulde not haue béene manifeſtly repugnant to his doctrine.
Therefore that he was maried the ſcriptures report, and it is
by our aduerſaries confeſſed: but that he forſooke his wife, it
hath no ſhewe of proofe, no colour of trueth. Yea further the
Apoſtle doth inſinuate that the dwelling together of man and
wife in knowledge, is a furtheraunce to their prayers.
And therefore vnto that former exhortation he addeth theſe
wordes:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7</note> 
                  <hi>That your prayers be not hindred.</hi> Thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that the dwelling together of man and wife as they
ought to doe, is a furtheraunce to their prayers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the contrarie, their ſeparating of themſelues in bodie,
may breede ſuch an alienation of mindes, with other great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
as may interrupt their prayers. And although
S. <hi>Peter</hi> meane not héereby that they ſhoulde ſo continually
dwel together, as that they might neuer withdraw themſelues
the more fréely to conſecrate as it were, and wholly giue them
ſelues to prayer and faſting: yet woulde he doubtleſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to S. <hi>Paules</hi> rules,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 5.</note> haue ſuch their abſtinence when anie

and the holy practiſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her purer

               <p>But the Church of Rome ſince that time, which would ſeem
more holy then euer god made her, or more perfect then he
requireth,<note place="margin">Vowing of ſingle life.</note> prophanely accompting of this holy ordinanuce,
as not pure inough for their vnpure Prieſts: will not admit any
into their holy orders of Prieſte or deacon that will not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounce for euer, this holy inſtitution, and vowe to lyue
alwayes a ſingle life. Which their impious and ſeruile ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hath not one probable proofe, out of Gods word, neither
was it the auncient doctrine of the Church of Rome, in ſomuch
as ſome of them ſelues, euen halfe aſhamed of their forefathers
doings, confeſſe that in the primitiue Church there was no
ſuch thing required, but that all men that would might marye.
As for ſuch as are maryed, if they wilbe made prieſtes, or enter
into their orders, they muſt not by their tirannicall decree and
decretals any more dwell with their wiues as S. Peter willeth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 7.</note>
but they muſt rather defraude one an other foreuer which Paul
forbideth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7 5.</note> and with greate reaſon myſliketh. Thus this their
vowing of perpetuall ſingle life, they doe not onely highly
commend, but alſo do force their clergy to obſerue the ſame: &amp;
yet it is not in al the Scripturs old nor new once commanded or

formance of the duties of mariage which ſo ſtraitly thapoſtles
require of all that are maried without exception, is not onely
not furthered in the Romiſh Church that now is, but alſo hinde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red

points almoſt behaue themſelues, as if they were of purpoſe
diſpoſed or ſet vp, if not quite to aboliſh, yet dangerouſly to
corrupt, alter, and change, whatſoeuer Chriſt and his Apoſtles
left pure &amp; ſincere. And thus much of the contrarietie of their

that which thapoſtles taught among the Romanes.<note place="margin">Sup. Cant. ſer. 34</note>

how little cauſe ſhe hath to increaſe her ioy if ſhe thinke
earneſtly of it, let the godly reader indifferently conſider. For
ſeeing ſhee leadeth men from the pure waters of the worde of

and to be of great efficacie for many good purpoſes: But
I pray you my Maſters of <hi>Rome,</hi> when did S. <hi>Peter</hi> beſtow
his time in making ſuch trifles, or in packing vp ſuch wares (to

be, in all their ceremonies and ſeruices, he that readeth their

for the ſame: yet they cannot teach, that S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and S.
<hi>Peter</hi> either taught the <hi>Romans</hi> to vſe it, or themſelues made
any either vpon themſelues or other.<note place="margin">Reliques.</note> Reliques they loue ſo
well, that if they cannot get the boans or reliques of good men
and women, yet any other ſuch like, be they of men or wemen
neuer ſo bad will ſerue their turne, ſo that they be ſaid to be
the Reliques of ſuch a Saint. Wherby it commeth to paſſe,
that ſome men and wemen, who while they liued, were like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
hauing no ſuperſlous lymmes of their bodie, now when
they are dead, are by theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> charmers turned into ſuch
monſters, as that they haue ſome many heads, others many
legges, others great numbers of armes: and ſo the parts of
their bodies are multiplied excedingly, (belike they were buried
in a fruitfull ſoyle) and yet euery Prieſt, that ſheweth theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
commend that they haue to be the true relique, &amp; ſome
miracle, or viſion, euery one of them alſo would commonly
faine, to proue that which they ſaid of their relique to be true.
And yet many of them muſt néedes be falſe: For one man or
woman had but one head, two armes, and ſo of the reſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
And therfore all beſides that one head, or thoſe other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10074:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
true parts of the bodie muſt needes be falſe. It is written that
one of our Kings of England named <hi>Edward,</hi> was euill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the toothache. And who knoweth not that Saint
<hi>Apolines</hi> teeth, are a préeſent remedie for the ſame diſeaſe, yf
their lyes may goe for true reportes. King <hi>Edward</hi> therefore
belike, being deſirous to haue the true teeth of <hi>S. Apoline,</hi> to
aply to his teeth, commaunded that the teeth of S. <hi>Apoline,</hi>
that were in all the Churches through the Realme kept for
reliques, ſhould be ſent to him, which being brought, were
ſound mo then would goe into ſome greate Hogſheades or
veſſels. And yet I warrant you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery Church they were
perſwaded, that they had in deed S. <hi>Apolines</hi> teeth. But in
the auncient faith of the <hi>Romans,</hi> what mention is made, or
what example is found,<note place="margin">Shrift.</note> of any ſuch reliques. To theſe may
be added their ſhrift and Satiſfactions,<note place="margin">Satiſfactions</note> very iniurious to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> his death, and that ſatiſfaction which he in his body,
hath made for vs, by that one onely ſacrifice, which vpon the

And to be ſhort their prayer in an vnknowen tongue,

ſuch like things, can be proued to be taught by word or deede
vnto that primitiue Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>S. Paule, S. Peter,</hi> or
<hi>S. Marke,</hi> which thing they can neuer doe. If then in all ſuch
poynts as are in controuerſie among vs, wherof we find anie
thing deliuered to vs, by theſe holy men &amp; meſſengers of God,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (if ſhee teach not cleane contrarie) wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
verie much from that auncient <hi>Romane</hi> faith, as in the
19. firſt chapters of this treatiſe it doth (I truſt) appeare: And
if in theſe latter points of religion mentioned in this laſt chap.
which they alſo make gret accompt of,) they haue neither word
nor example of theſe Apoſtles or <hi>S. Marke,</hi> to commende vnto
the world, ſuch doctrines &amp; deuiſes: what cauſe is there I pray
you, why that apoſtolicall Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10074:46"/>
reiected that old faith, and ſo wholy corrupted the aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent
religion that ther was taught, ſhould ſo confidently term
her ſelfe the Apoſtolicke and Catholicke Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
With what face dare they tel vs, that the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
when as nothing doth more conuince them of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
then to try the leaden religion that now is there taught, by
the touchſtone of that faith that then was there preached. And
with ſhame enough may they tell vs, that that faith of the
auncient <hi>Romans</hi> is commended, which moſt cruelly and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
condemne the ſame, &amp; perſecute it moſt bloodily in <hi>Chriſt</hi>
his members, as our faith ſo wholy and perfectly agréeing
with the Apoſtles doctrine, yet purſued of them with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
hatred, intollerable rage, and tirannicall violence doth
plainly proue. We ſay therfore, that that auncient faith of the
<hi>Romans</hi> was worthely prayſed. By it we can and doe confirme
our doctrines: By it we may and haue diſprooued their errors.
If wee ſwarne one iot from that faith, we craue no credite, to
our words or writings,<note place="margin">Pſa. 52. 11. ver. 50. &amp;. 51.</note> no preſence or acceſſe to our temples.
And becauſe they haue forſaken it,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> we hold them as <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Apoſtates,</hi> and forſake their wil worſhipings and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aſſemblies, according to the prophetes preciſe and ſeuere
prohibition, and thappoſtles comfortable application thereof.
<hi>Beare not the yoke with, vnbeleeuers, but come out from among
them, and ſeparate your ſelues ſayth the Lorde, and touch no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
thing and I will receaue you, and I wil be a father vnto you,
and you ſhall be my ſonnes and daughters ſaith the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</hi>
Whoſe aſſured and vndoubted kindneſſe becauſe wee
cannot but accept off, ſéeing we know him to be a moſt louing
Father, therefore we dare not but deteſt and hate, the ſeducing
wayes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe ſhée is a deceauing and
a mercileſſe ſtepmother. Whoſe pathes doe lead to death, and
they that walke in her wayes ſhall finde deſtruction: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
