            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108764:8"/>
Truths, whoſe unpleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences they would be loath to own? Or, is it that they are carried away with ſo high a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt this practice, by reaſon of the extreme abuſe of it, as that they are afraid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it?

Confirmation, 2 of Ordination, 3. of Abſolution &amp; re-admiſſion of Penitents. That the firſt of theſe is here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not only all Antiquity, but all late Interpreters (except ſome few Straglers) do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree: neither indeed

can it, with any probability, be taken of either of the other; Not of Ordination: What ſhould Novices have to do with that buſineſſe now in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of their Chriſtianity? Their Teachers were only concerned herein, not the Puiſnes in that School of Chriſt: Not of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion of Penitents, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony whereof (for ought we can find) began not till after the Apoſtles: Doubtleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Confirmation; for which cauſe alſo (as <hi>Calvin</hi>

               <p>For the ſenſible ſign; here were hands indeed laid on, but not with any intention of acting or conſtituting a Sacrament:

And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where is the ſolemn Word whereby that promiſe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and that ſign actuated? Surely, here, God is ſilent; men may ſpeak: For that ſet form which they bind their tongues unto, <hi>I ſign thee with the ſign of the croſſe, and confirm thee with the chriſme of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> whoſe is it?

               <p>As for any command, it is as far to ſeek, as either of the other: What Scripture can be pretended to carry the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a <hi>mandate?</hi> It is a poor ſhift of the Cardinall, in ſtead of a word of injunction, to flap

preſented to the Biſhop and the Church; and there the child which was Baptized in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, ſhould firſt by a ſhort and plain admonition be put in mind of his Baptiſme; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, how, why, and into what he was Baptized, what in that Baptiſme the whole Trinity conferred upon him, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him; namely, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peace, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of Grace; how that there he made a publique renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Satan, a profeſſion of his faith, and a promiſe of holy obedience, Secondly, that the child himſelf ſhould before the Congregation make a proper and publique profeſſion of this Doctrine &amp; Faith.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108764:40"/>
were, to ſecond it with many more: And why, my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſhould we think it fit or ſafe to leave ſo gratious an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and to walk alone in our own wayes, untracked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troden with the holy feet of our firſt and ſureſt guides? where the practice began ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to degenerate, in adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ordinance with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious additions, both of rites and opinions, there we have juſtly declined it, and do with the zealouſeſt profeſſors cry down the groſſe abuſe of that godly inſtitution to the pit of hell, whence certainly it came: But ſhall we upon this pretence caſt off that gratious act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which was ſent us from Heaven by the hands of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? What if we cannot ſecond our Impoſition of hands with ſenſible wonders as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108764:40"/>
the Apoſtles did? (elſe, as <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> could not have ſeen that the Holy Ghoſt was given by them) though we cannot work miracles, yet we can pray; and our prayers have the ſame Spirituall effects with theirs; neither did the ordinary Paſtors that ſucceeded thoſe bleſſed Apoſtles expect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iſſue of their hands impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet ſtill impoſed their hands; and whether ſhould we affect to be like them, in acting and approving the laying on of hands, or to ſome heſternall teachers that refuſe and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it? The common plea of thoſe gain-ſayers is the ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe miraculous gifts which were in the Apoſtolick times by their onely hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; (others in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had the Holy Ghoſt, none
