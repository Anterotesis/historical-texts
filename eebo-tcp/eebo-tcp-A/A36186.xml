         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Take hereof half a Spoonfull every Morning firſt, and every Night laſt, for preſervation; but if one be taken ſick, then let them drink a quarter of a pint, and cover them to ſweat. This drink will powerfully fortifie the vitals, and by ſweat throw out the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity</hi> of the diſtemper. If you ſee that the party ſweat not enough, you may give as much more; and ſo you may take a larger quantity then before is preſcribed for Prevention, as you ſee cauſe, and the Conſtitution requires.</p>

                  <head>A Drink for all Malignant Feavers.</head>
                  <p>I recommend unto you a Poſſet drink to drink after it, wherewith I have cured many hundreds, in the time of the late unhappy Wars, of deſperate Feavers <hi>Couſin (German</hi> to the <hi>Plague</hi>) which was then an <hi>Epidemicall</hi> diſeaſe, and uſed no other Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Scabious</hi> and <hi>Butter-bur</hi> roots, and boil them in poſſet drink, and let them drink largely of it; and be not too ſparing of your ingredients, for they are eaſie enough to be had.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, That it will be ſo bitter you cannot drink it: To remedy that, boil it in the milk firſt, and the longer it boils, the leſſe bitter it will be; and when the bitterneſſe is gone, ſtrain it, and ſet it on the fire again, and when it boils, put in your drink, and let it ſtand to raiſe the curd, which take off.</p>
                  <p>This poſſet drink hath ſtayed violent <hi>Vomitings</hi> and <hi>Looſeneſſe</hi>: by drinking largely of it many have been cured in 24 houres, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death hath been expected.</p>

                  <p>I will likewiſe give you an outward Medicine, as good as you ſhall find in any ſort compoſed, which you may make your ſelves. Take <hi>Bay-ſalt</hi> if you can get it, and pound it ſmall and burn it in a Fireſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel till it leave crackling; if you cannot get <hi>Bay-ſalt</hi> take <hi>White-ſalt,</hi> and powder it very fine, then take <hi>Caſtle-ſope,</hi> ſlice it thin, and pound it in a Morter; adde to it as much oil of Lillies, as will make it ſoft to an oyntment, then take two parts of <hi>Sope,</hi> and one of <hi>Figs,</hi> and one of <hi>Salt,</hi> and another of <hi>Mithridate,</hi> and mix them together.</p>
                  <p>This will not deceive you in your expectation, for it will break any

                     <hi>Peſtilentiall Bubo,</hi> or Swelling, and turn out a Carbuncle, and ſtrongly drawes out the Malignity, and makes it fit to be cured by any ordinary Medicine.</p>
                  <p>I would admoniſh all, not to ſuffer any thirſt in any of thoſe that are ſick, but forbid ſmall and cold drink; but let them drink Beer of a reaſonable ſtrength, heated as hot as they can drink it, the hotter the better; and ſuch as can attain unto it, may moderately drink fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant generous Wine, and <hi>Cordiall</hi> VVaters.</p>
                  <p>There is one main cauſe of Diſeaſes, by which many people are ſpoiled, and all are in danger to be infected with ſome foul diſtemper or another. Nay, there is none in ſafety, but his life, or at leaſt health is in danger of it, from him that ſitteth on the Throne, to him that grindeth at the Mill, and that is the <hi>Butchers</hi> in blowing their meat, when nothing is more uſuall then for <hi>ſtinking fellowes</hi> to blow up the meat with their filthy <hi>Pockey, Stinking, Putrified</hi> Breath, whereby they putrifie the fleſh; and thereby are unknown Diſeaſes communicated to the people, which is the cauſe of ſo many calamitous and ſtrange diſtempers. It were therefore heartily to be wiſhed, that the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Major</hi> and the reſt of the Magiſtrates were well informed hereof, that by their pious care the Lawes made againſt theſe Peſtilent Offenders were duly put in execution, which would conduce much to the health and ſafety of the people, which God preſerve.</p>
