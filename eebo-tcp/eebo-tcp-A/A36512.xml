         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Right Honourable
CHARLES
Earl of Dorſet, and
Middleſex,
Baron Buckhurſt, one of the
Lords of His Majeſty's
Moſt Honourable Privy
Council, Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the County of
Suſſex, and Knight of
the moſt Noble Order
of the Garter, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN addreſſing to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
tho I betray my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
I ſhall ſtrengthen the
<pb facs="tcp:54591:3"/>
opinion of my Integrity. For
by appealing to ſo great, and ſo
impartial a Judge, I give the
World ſufficient demonſtration,
that I truſt more to the Merit of
my Cauſe, than of my Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and depend rather upon
the matter, than the manner of
what I deliver, for my Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Tyde of Prejudice runs
high for my Adverſary, and the leſs
diſcerning part of the Town are
ſo prepoſſeſs'd with the Specious
Title, and the Plauſible Pretence
of Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Book, that they
think the whole Intereſt of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Religion embark'd on
that Bottom. Immorality and
Prophaneſs are things ſo juſtly
abhorrd, that whoever enters
the Liſts againſt 'em, has all Good
Men for his Seconds. And their
<pb facs="tcp:54591:3"/>
zeal for the Cauſe ſo far
blinds many of 'em, that
they neither ſee, nor ſuſpect any
Defect or Treachery in their
Champion. For men are very
unwilling to hear Truth, againſt
Prejudice, and ſuffer Reaſon to
triumph over Inclination.</p>
            <p>The Town is divided in its
Judgment of the Piece, and the
whole Conteſt lies betwixt thoſe
that are Judges, and thoſe that
are not, as Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſaid
upon another occaſion. The
latter are of the Oppoſite Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and are as much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
than the former; as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Preſumption are more
Univerſal, than Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>This makes the Prefixing your
Lordſhips name, by your own
Permiſſion, whoſe Judgment is
as little to be byaſs'd, as 'tis to
<pb facs="tcp:54591:4"/>
be queſtion'd, not only matter
of Honour to me, but of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Defence. Not that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any Protection for thoſe
Errors which I may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
They muſt be left to
the mercy of Readers of far leſs
Judgment and Candour, than
<hi>Your Honour.</hi> To be tried by
ſuch a Grand Jury, is a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I am ſo far from expecting,
that I know it impoſſible. But
the Deference due to ſo great a
Name may procure me a fair
hearing amongſt ſome, upon
whom a bare regard to Juſtice
wou'd hardly prevail ſo far.</p>
            <p>Did Mr <hi>Collier</hi> contend only
for the better Eſtabliſhment of
Virtue, and Reformation of
Manners, I ſhou'd be aſham'd to
appear againſt him. But there is
a Snake in the Graſs. Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54591:4"/>
undertakes the Patronage of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as Cunning Men do the
Guardianſhip of rich Orphans,
only to make his Markets of it.
That this is his caſe, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sheets will, I hope, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrate. His Vehemence
gives us juſt ground to ſuſpect
his Integrity, and to believe that
he has ſome conceal'd Intereſt,
or Pique at the bottom. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
enquiry after Truth is
always accompany'd with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour;
where that is wanting,
there is juſt reaſon to ſuſpect ſome
further deſign. In Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s
management, the Heat and
Smoke are too great and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
for the Fire to be long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.
His Deſign is manifeſtly
not to argue the Poets out of
their Faults, but to bully his
Readers out of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb facs="tcp:54591:5"/>
and by violence to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Impreſſions already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of thoſe matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
he treats of. His Style is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his purpoſe, fierce and
bold, full of vehement exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and haughty menaces,
he racks Sentences, and tortures
Expreſſions, to extort a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from 'em of things to which
they are abſolute Strangers. The
conſequence of this way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is, that Women, and Weak
Men, whoſe Fears are ſtronger
than their Judgments, will be
aw'd into a Perſwaſion before
they are convinc'd of the Truth
of it. For ſuch People in moſt
caſes meaſure the certainty of
Aſſertions by the Confidence of
him that pronounces 'em, and
the Importance by the falſe
weight that is laid upon 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54591:5"/>
'Twas this conſideration, not
any extraordinary Affection for
the Stage, that engag'd me in
this Argument. I look upon it
as an attempt towards uſurping
the Soveraignty of Men's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
and reſtoring the
Tyranny of Bigottry, whoſe
Yoak we have ſcarce yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhaken off. My Reaſon is
the deareſt, and freeſt part of
me, or at leaſt it ought to be ſo,
and he that puts the Dice upon
that, affronts me in the moſt
ſenſible manner. I had rather be
bubbled of my Money than my
Intellects, and ſhou'd chuſe rather
to be thought his Cully, than
his Fool. 'Tis true, theſe tricks
are not to be put upon a man
that is aware of 'em, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
I might have ſecur'd my
ſelf without making a publick
<pb facs="tcp:54591:6"/>
diſcovery. But I think it a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
piece of Caution, a ſort
of Criminal Miſpriſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at the cheating of others;
and while I am able to inform
'em, the Clamour of Knaves or
Fools ſhall never awe me to
Silence.</p>
            <p>That this is no extravagant
Surmiſe, no Hypochondriacal
Fancy, is evident from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the whole Book, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the third Chapter. Every
thing is deliver'd with an air ſo
haughty, ſo magiſterial, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive,
that he ſeems rather to
ſerve us with an Injunction to
believe him, than an Argument.
That this Impoſition may be the
more tamely ſubmitted to, he
palms the Authority of the
Church upon us, and pretends
her Commiſſion to make Fools
of the Laity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54591:6"/>
The Church is by no means
oblig'd to him, for endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to caſt the <hi>Odium</hi> of his own
Arrogance and Ambition upon
her. How great ſoever his Zeal
for her ſervice may be, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
in it does not come a
whit behind it. For to extend
the Power and Authority of the
Prieſt, he curtails the Articles of
the Church, and denies the
King's Supremacy, which ſhe has
already oblig'd him to ſwear to
the belief of.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not treſpaſs ſo far upon
Your Honour's patience, as to
recapitulate the ſeveral Invidious
things, which he fathers upon
the Church. I will hope well of
his Deſign, tho I fear the effects
of his Performance will not turn
to her Service. And I cou'd
wiſh his Motives were better,
<pb facs="tcp:54591:7"/>
or not ſo apparent. If <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was a Stickler for the honour
of <hi>Diana,</hi> 'twas becauſe he made
Shrines for her, the intereſt of
his trade engag'd him in her
Party. Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Caſe is not
much different. The Poets had
ſometimes made bold to diſplay
a vicious, or a fooliſh Prieſt, and
thoſe that were Knaves in the
World, and Drolls in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
had been made Cheats and
Buffoons upon the Stage. The
Mask of Formality and Sanctity
was pull'd off, and the Block-head
and the Hypocrite ſhewn
bare-fac'd. Thus the Profane
Vulgar were ſuffer'd to peep,
and pry into Myſteries. This
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> reſents as if he were
perſonally concern'd, and wou'd
perſwade the world, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Hypocriſie is to affront the
<pb facs="tcp:54591:7"/>
Church, than which her Enemies
cou'd not have ſuggeſted any
thing more malicious. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this miſtaken Injury has
rais'd a Flame, which will coſt
the effuſion of abundance of Ink
before it is extinguiſh'd. <hi>Manet
alta Mente repoſtum,</hi> and is never
to be forgiven while Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
can wag a Gooſe-quill.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Clergy</hi> deſervedly have
both at home and abroad the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the moſt learned
<hi>Clergy</hi> in the World, and I ſhall
venture to affirm, that they are
the Beſt in the World. Their
Candour towards thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from 'em in Opinion, their
Modeſty in aſſerting their own,
and their ſober Conduct in the
diſcharge of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and not aſſuming the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of thoſe of other men,
<pb facs="tcp:54591:8"/>
will prove what I ſay to
to be no Paradox. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> in making ſo
large a demand in their names,
has obliquely traduc'd 'em, by
giving occaſion to thoſe that
don't ſufficiently know 'em, to
ſuſpect that he acts by their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and Authority.</p>
            <p>But I forget, that while I talk
to Your Lordſhip, I wrong the
Publick, which claims ſo great a
ſhare in your thoughts and time.
I ſhall not attempt the Character
of Your Lordſhip: For, to write
of you, as I ought, to do you
Juſtice, I muſt write like you,
which I hope I ſhall never have
the vanity to pretend to. But
the Name of <hi>My Lord Dorſet</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
carries more Panegyrick
than the fruitfulleſt Invention
can furniſh. Thoſe Adventurous
<pb facs="tcp:54591:8"/>
Gentlemen, that have already
tried their Strength at it, have
by their foils taught me caution.
Their Performances fall ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſhort of the Merit of
their Subject, that when they
have exhauſted their Fancies,
their whole ſtock of Rhetorick
looks like an Oſtentation of Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.
This conſideration alone
is ſufficient to deter me from
preſuming further upon Your
Lordſhip's Goodneſs, except to
ask Pardon for my Ambition of
taking this Publick Occaſion to
declare with what profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I am</p>

            <head>Mr. COLLIER's View
OF THE
Engliſh Stage, &amp;c.
Set in a
TRUE LIGHT.</head>
            <p>THe aim of all Writers is,<note place="margin">Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or
ought to be, to maintain or
propagate <hi>Truth,</hi> to inform
the <hi>Judgment,</hi> improve the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
and rectifie the <hi>Miſtakes</hi> of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54591:18"/>
others. Where this is the real end and
deſign of a Writer, no Itch of <hi>Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
or Awe of <hi>Faction</hi> ought to bear
him from his Byaſs, or make him give
an inch to his <hi>Hopes,</hi> or <hi>Fears;</hi> and the
more Univerſal and Important the
Truths are, which he diſcovers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends,
the greater in proportion ought
to be the Zeal and Application.</p>
            <p>Were theſe rules conſtantly, and
prudently purſued, we might hope for
an honeſter, as well as wiſer world,
than it has been my fortune yet to
find any Memoirs of, ſince the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Mankind. For tho the
<hi>Declaimers</hi> of all <hi>Ages</hi> have inveighed
with great bitterneſs againſt their own
times, and extoll'd the antecedent;
yet even hence we are furniſh'd with
an argument, that all have been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
culpable, ſince thoſe times, which
we, to humble our own, affect ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
to commend, our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi>
did as vehemently condemn; and if
we do not find the <hi>Topicks</hi> of <hi>Satyr</hi> to
be in every <hi>Age</hi> the ſame; we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from thence conclude, that the
<hi>Mode, and not the Meaſure of Iniquity
is alter'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54591:18"/>
But whether the rules be ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
or not, may be matter of
doubt. For, beſides that grand Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
<hi>Intereſt,</hi> which few withſtand,
<hi>Paſſion, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Inclination,</hi> have
an almoſt irreſiſtible Influence over us;
and even in the cooleſt, and ſevereſt
of our deliberations, we are apt to give
too much to <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and to humour
<hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> beyond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>That this is no uncommon caſe, moſt
of the preſent <hi>Paper-Combats</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
in which the War on both ſides
is carry'd on with an obſtinacy and
fury, very diſproportionate to the
trifles generally contended for. The
Combatants enter the liſts againſt Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Gyants of their own raiſing,
and lay about 'em like <hi>Ajax,</hi> or <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes</hi>'s
<hi>Hero,</hi> amongſt the Sheep, Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
or Windmills, 'tis all one, if they
ſtand in their way they muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd.</p>
            <p>The moſt formidable of theſe, is the
Author of the <hi>Short View of the Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Profaneneſs of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Stage.</hi>
This Gentleman, ſome time or other,
between ſleeping and waking, had
happen'd to hear ſome of Mr <hi>Durfy</hi>'s
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54591:19"/>
Rattles, and perhaps ſome ſaucy <hi>Jack</hi>
or other of the Stage diſcharge an Oath
or two, and preſently miſtaking 'em
for a noiſe of Drums, and volley of
Shot, falls to dreaming of Invaſions and
Revolutions, that the Church Artillery
was ſeiz'd, and turn'd upon it; of a
terrible Stage Plot, and a huge Army
in Ambuſcade behind the Play-houſe
Scenes; and therefore he cries out to
have the Beacons lighted, and the Bells
rung backward in every Pariſh, to
raiſe the <hi>Poſſe</hi> of Fathers, Councils, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
School-men, and the reſt of the
Church Militia, and caſt up Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the Vanguard of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>
are upon 'em. Then he calls for his
<hi>Durindana</hi> of a Gooſe-quill, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
out <hi>Anathema</hi>'s as thick as Hail ſhot.</p>
            <p>Thus inſtructed and appointed, he
draws out his forces, and charges with
ſuch violence and fury upon the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn-Hope
of the Stage, that it had
been impoſſible for 'em to have ſuſtain'd
the ſhock, if <hi>Pegaſus</hi> had not been
train'd of old to the ſervice, and very
well acquainted with the temper of the
Enemies Fire.</p>

it broke out firſt in <hi>Spain,</hi> about
the cloſe of the laſt Century, under
<hi>Mariana</hi> a Jeſuit, who publiſhed a
Book <hi>Contra Spectacula;</hi> and after that
another, by the Special Approbation
of the Viſitor, and the Provincial of the
Jeſuits of the Province of <hi>Toledo;</hi> from
thence it travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> where it
was fomented by <hi>Franciſco Maria,</hi> a
<hi>Sicilian</hi> Monk, and <hi>P. Ottonelli,</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit;
and was thence tranſlated into
<hi>England,</hi> about ſixty years ago, by
Dr <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Mr <hi>Prynne;</hi> to <hi>France,</hi>
about thirty years ago, by the Prince
of <hi>Conti,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Voiſin, &amp;c.</hi>
and tho bury'd for ſome years
in its embers, broke out again
there not many years ago into a flame;
at which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> took fire, and
reviv'd the quarrel in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe diſputes have been manag'd
with great vehemence and fierceneſs
on the Agreſſor's parts, and had the
ſucceſs been anſwerable to their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
the ſcatter'd rout of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>
had been never able to have rally'd,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54591:20"/>
or made head again; but their Onſet
was like that of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
the Noiſe was much greater than the
Execution. I cou'd never find that the
Muſes were famous for Martial Exploits,
or that their Votaries e're ſignaliz'd
themſelves by any extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
in the Polemicks. How
comes it then, that ſuch impetuous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants
have gain'd no more upon 'em?
For as yet the very Outworks of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi>
ſeem to be in no danger. Is it
the natural ſtrength of the Place, or
Reſolution of the Defendants that
Protects 'em?</p>
            <p>Before I give a direct anſwer to theſe

a ſhort account of the occaſion,
ſtate, and progreſs of the Controverſie,
in, and from the time of the Primitive
Fathers down to our own Times; by

the ſuppoſed Authors, or Inſtruments:
Theſe Plays or Shows were uſually
preceeded by a Solemn Proceſſion of
the Gods to whom they were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Prieſts and Sacrificers in
their Formalities, with the Victim in
all its Religious Pomp, (much after the
manner of the Solemn Proceſſions in uſe
amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to this
day) this was ſucceeded by Vows made,
and Sacrifice perform'd upon the ſpot,
whether it were Theatre, <hi>Circus,</hi> or
any other place of publick Shows, or
Games. After all theſe were perform'd,

to begin, which was alſo a principal part
of the Religious Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Solemnity of the day.</p>
            <p>The Dramatick Repreſentations
ſpring both from one Original, and
were inſtituted for the ſame general
end and purpoſe with the reſt of the
Heathen Games,<note place="margin">The Drama of the ſame extraction.</note> that is, for Religious
Worſhip. Theſe (if I may be allow'd
to uſe the plural number, for that

and conſiſted of Songs in his
praiſe, Muſick, and Dancing about a
Sacrific'd Goat, intermixt with ruſtick
raillery, ſuitable to the Genius and
Temper of the Boors, and Villagers,
that were the performers. Tragedy
and Comedy were not yet become Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Provinces in Poetry,<note place="margin">Tragedy &amp; Comedy ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally one thing.</note> but either
name indifferently ſignify'd the ſame
thing, the firſt being taken from the
Sacrifice, which was a Goat, the other
from the Performers, which were the
Peaſants, or Villagers, or from the
nature of the Entertainment itſelf,
which was compos'd of Rural Muſick,
Songs, and Dances. By what ſteps
and gradations the improvements were
made, how the decorations of the
Stage were introduc'd, and when the
Drama firſt branch'd into Tragedy and
Comedy, as diſtinct members, are
pretty ſpeculations, and afford an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54591:21"/>
'Tis probable the partition of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
and Comedy was firſt made,<note place="margin">When first diſtinguiſht</note> when
the Poets, quitting the <hi>Dithyrambi,</hi> or
Hymns to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> betook themſelves

Or perhaps, that part which we now

            <p>But when,<note place="margin">The Stage under the Patronage of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </note> or howſoever this was,
tho the Sacrifice of the Goat at Plays
was left off, the <hi>Satyri</hi> in praiſe of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
diſcontinued, and the Plays ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
indifferently in honour of any
of the Gods, as occaſion directed, that
they were, as the Auditors rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<hi>Nihil ad Bacchum,</hi> yet the Stage
remain'd ſacred to and under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of its old Patron, who had
amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> his Altar on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54591:22"/>
Right hand of the Stage, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
God to whom the Play was for
that time directed, on the Left. This
was the Poſture and Condition of the
Stage in the time of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe, a Chriſtian cou'd
not be preſent, or aſſiſt at theſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
without openly countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or conforming to the Idolatrous
Worſhip of the Heathens; which the
Fathers, as became careful and pious
Paſtors, were extremely ſolicitous to
prevent. They were ſenſible of the
difficulties they had to encounter, and
the obſtacles they had to ſurmount.
The Chriſtian Religion was yet but
newly planted, and therefore till it
had taken ſufficient Root was carefully
to be cover'd and defended from the
injuries of rude Blaſts, and the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of thoſe rank ſuperſtitious Weeds
that grew about it, by which the Root
might be kill'd, or the Soil infected,
and the Sap withdrawn.</p>
            <p>Paganiſm was a Religion, invented
at firſt to oblige and captivate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Paganiſm a Religion contriv'd for popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note>
and gain'd its Credit and Authority
among 'em by indulging their Senſuality,
and even gratifying their Luſts; it was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54591:22"/>
augmented by degrees, by ambitious,
cunning men, who, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more popular, and gain an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
among the multitude, recommended
to 'em, under the notion of Religion,
what they found moſt acceptable to the
humour and palate of the populace.
By this means, the various Proceſſions,
Games, and Shows were introduc'd,
and became the moſt formal part of
their Solemnities, men being eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to like what was ſo conformable
to their inclinations, that in the exerciſe
and diſcharge of their Duties, their
Senſes were entertain'd, and their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
flatter'd.</p>
            <p>Againſt a Superſtition thus fram'd
for Luxury, and contriv'd to cajole
the Sences, Chriſtianity was to make

and deſtroy a Title founded upon the
preſcription of many ages, ſupported
by the authority of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and fortify'd in its Poſſeſſion by
Prejudice, Inclination and Intereſt;
and all this to be done with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
only of Truth, and Simplicity of
Doctrine and Manners; the Pomp,
and Magnificence of their Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54591:23"/>
was abſolutely to be taken away,
and their licentious practices to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd,
and reform'd; and inſtead of
'em ſevere Principles, and an auſtere
courſe of Life were to be eſtabliſh'd,
in an Age, and amongſt a People,
whom the Submiſſion and Tribute of
all the World for ſome ages, had made
wealthy, proud and wanton.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore to be wonder'd,
if thoſe early Champions of the Goſpel
proportion'd their Zeal and Vigilance
to the preſſingneſs of the occaſion,<note place="margin">Heathen Religion all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> and
the ſtrength of the oppoſition. The
Games and Shows of the antient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
were the parts of their Religion
the moſt generally engaging, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
moſt, and kept the Multitude
firmeſt to 'em. The reſt of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſat but looſely about 'em, they
had no fixt, or neceſſary Faith, aud
their devotion conſiſted only in a frigid
compliance with thoſe Forms and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which were purely matters of
Worſhip; their Zeal appear'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much as their Games and
Shows. For as <hi>Varro</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pompa populo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grata fuit, quia ludis mora. Var ro de Ling. Lat. Lib. 4.</note> and <hi>Seneca</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Non igno ras quam ſit odioſa Circenſibus Pompa.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, the preparatory Solemnities
were ungrateful to the ſpectators, who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54591:23"/>
impatiently expected the Show. The
Fathers, who knew where their ſtrength
lay, have employ'd all their Artillery
againſt theſe Shows, their Batteries
have play'd inceſſantly upon 'em, as
the only Forts that were capable of
making reſiſtance, and ſtopping their
Progreſs.</p>
            <p>Tho the antient Fathers bent their
Rhetorick,<note place="margin">Idolatry of the Stage, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> with all its Force, and in
all its Forms and Figures, againſt the
Heathen Shows; tho they declaim'd
with all their Nerves, and Vehemence,
and diſplay'd all their Arguments with
the utmoſt ſtrength of Colour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
yet there was nothing in which
they ſo much confided, in which they
ſo unanimouſly agreed, as the objection
drawn from the Idolatrous inſtitution
and end of 'em. They were unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
becauſe Idolatrous. It was
(in their opinion) impoſſible for a
Chriſtian, how well principled, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
however, to partake of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
without ſharing the
Pollution, or to abſtract the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
from the Guilt. They thought
it dangerous to truſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
however fortify'd, to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54591:24"/>
temptations of ſo jolly a Religion,
which was ſo far from curbing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and laying any reſtraint upon
the deſires of its Proſelytes, that many
of its duties were but Pimps to their
Luſts, and almoſt all its acts of Devotion
but ſo many entertainments of their
Sences. They knew the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature right well, and were
aware, that tho Faith might in ſome
be ſo ſtrong as to triumph over all
temptation, yet that Multitudes wou'd
fall before it, if they were permitted to
run the riſque.</p>
            <p>The portion of thoſe that embrac'd
Chriſtianity was Mortification, and
ſuffering, perpetual diſcouragement,
and frequent Perſecutions (till the time
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) their Reward was in
Reverſion; their Expectation indeed
was large, but the Proſpect was diſtant.
Now preſent Eaſe and Enjoyment are
very apt to prevail againſt a remote
Hope. In our common affairs of the
world, Futurity maintains itſelf but ill
againſt the Preſent, and neither the
greatneſs, nor the certainty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
make good head againſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54591:24"/>
This was the caſe of Chriſtianity in its
Infancy. The Heathen Prieſthood was
contented with the Countenance and
Encouragement of the State, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the directions and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, even in matters relating to
their own Myſteries; they aſſum'd no
Dominion, or Juriſdiction over private
Conſciences, either in point of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Practice; but left thoſe matters
wholly to the Civil Government, which
made Laws for the regulation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Magiſtrates for the inſpection
of Men's Manners; in which regard
was had chiefly, if not only, to the
Publick Quiet and Security, to the
Preſervation and Augmentation of the
State. If a ſcrutiny was made into the
Conduct and Behaviour of particular
perſons, 'twas as they were ſubordinate
to the Publick, and might be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
or prejudicial to the common
welfare, either immediately, by their
practices, in wronging the State, or
thoſe under the Protection of it; or by
withdrawing themſelves from, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitating
themſelves for its ſervice;
or conſequently by debauching, and
corrupting others by their Examples.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54591:25"/>
In all theſe matters the Prieſt had no
concern; and therefore 'twas no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if the People receiv'd ſo eaſily,
and liv'd ſo contentedly under a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which, tho falſe, gave 'em ſo little
diſturbance, and ſo much ſatisfaction.
For, as for the Multitude, their Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
was like their Worſhip, ſuited and
adapted to their capacities, the one
conſiſting of ſurprizing Fables, the
other of delightful Solemnities. Thoſe
that were wiſer among 'em, and ſaw
thro their Myſteries, (who were not a
few) were many of 'em <hi>Sacris initiati,</hi>
and engaged in their ſupport; the reſt
having no higher warrant than their
own Reaſon, and nothing more certain
to ſubſtitute in the room of 'em, were
perhaps unwilling to unſettle matters,
and paying a languid Complacence,
ſuffer'd things to run on in the old
Channel; whoſe Banks ſhou'd they
break down, they knew not what
courſe the Stream wou'd take, nor how
far the Confuſion might ſpread.</p>
            <p>But the Goſpel had none of theſe
advantages, it was not contriv'd and
modell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d for Popularity, it did not
humour the Inclinations, and indulge
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54591:25"/>
the Appetites of the People. To the
Purity of its Doctrine, a Conformity of
Life, and Manners were requir'd, the
Paſſions were to be curb'd, and the
Deſires moderated; inſtead of Pomp
and Ceremony, Simplicity and Sobriety
were to be their Entertainments: their
rampant Gods, whoſe fabulous Hiſtories
gave countenance to Men's Luſts, and
encouragement to their Debaucheries,
were to be caſhier'd, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and worſhip of the True One to
be introduc'd, whoſe Majeſty was as
awful, as the other was repreſented
frolickſome.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the conditions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
from Heatheniſm, and the
change muſt needs appear diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to meer Fleſh and Blood The
Fathers therefore, who knew how hard
it was to keep the Appetites in entire
ſubjection, took care to fortifie as
ſtrongly as poſſible thoſe parts, in
which they expected the Rebellion

all the Heathen Solemnities, were thoſe
that gave the ſtrongeſt temptation to
the new Converts; they had ſo little
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54591:26"/>
of the Air of Religion, that they
thought if they did not approve of the
end and deſign of 'em, they might,
without imputation, partake of the
Diverſion, in which they met with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
Examples of Innocence and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
This alarm'd the Fathers, who
knew that <hi>the tranſition from one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to another</hi> (as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> obſerves)
<hi>was natural;</hi> and juſtly apprehended,
that from a liking of the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themſelves, they might proceed
to approve the occaſion of 'em; that
the ſeeming Innocence and Virtue of
'em might reconcile 'em to a Superſtition
which recommended thoſe excellent
Gifts after ſo eaſie and agreeable a
manner, or that perhaps the delights
of thoſe places might ſoften the temper

their zeal, and ſo unqualifie and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

the Poſture and Circumſtances of the

they were ſufficiently fortify'd againſt
the danger of Corruption, to which
they might thereby be expos'd. <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs</hi>
was the Vice, which the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi>
particularly inſtanc'd in, by
which he plainly ſhews himſelf appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of the Company, not of the
Play; and therefore he would not have
young people truſted with the liberty,
and opportunity of contracting an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
before they were arriv'd
at ſome tolerable maturity of Judgment.
But Mr <hi>Collier</hi> with a dexterity peculiar
to himſelf, palms the general term
of <hi>Debauchery,</hi> for the particular one
of <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> upon us, that the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
might thereby be ſhifted from the
Audience to the Peformance.</p>
            <p>To back this, and cover the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he brings another Authority as
little to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>View</hi> page 234.</note> concerning the
force and power of Muſick, from
whence he concludes, that <hi>where the
Repreſentation is foul, the thoughts of the
Audience muſt ſuffer.</hi> What muſt they
ſuffer? Wou'd the Muſick, (as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54591:37"/>
as he ſuppoſes it) make the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
drunk, or in love with Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
No, that was no Vice of the
Stage, whatever it might be of the
Spectators, yet even by them the Scene
was not laid at the Theatres, tho the
Plot might, and the Company perhaps
be pickt up there. I ſuppoſe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,
as inveterate as his malice is
againſt Play-houſes, will ſcarce charge
'em as Schools of intemperance of that
kind, 'tis not the practice of the Stage,
not ſo much as behind the Scenes; and
I believe he will acquit Pit, Box, and
Gallery of it. For whatever ſome
may bring in their Heads, he will find
but few with Bottles in their Hands
there. This made him wave inſtancing
in the particular of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the retail
ſcandal wou'd not fit our Theatres, and
therefore he lumps it among 'em by
the general name of Debauchery, and
tacks this Citation concerning Muſick
to it, which he hopes will give the
Reader an Idea more ſerviceable to his
Cauſe, than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intended, and
make a ſuitable impreſſion upon
him.</p>

Why Mr. <hi>Paraphraſer</hi> wou'd inſinuate,
that the Spectators and the Actors,

ſure ſufficient to deſtroy an aſſertion ſo

from having <hi>Comedy</hi> in diſgrace, that
they encourag'd, and maintain'd it at

<hi>Tragedy,</hi> but he ſays not a ſyllable of
Forms or Regulations. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
were a rough unpoliſh'd people,
that were afraid, if the ſtudy of Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(the inſeparable companion of the

which were as Clowniſh, and unlickt

If ſo, his Poſition is abſolutely
falſe; for all the rough <hi>Bear Garden</hi>
Play (if I may call it ſo) was not only
tolerated, but very much encouraged
by the State. Their Women too had
their Religious Plays,<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note> a memorable
ſtoy of which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> * tells. And
'tis probable, that the Plays in uſe over
all the reſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> were permitted
there too in their Primitive Rudeneſs
and Simplicity, conformable to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the people, and the drift of
their Policy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54591:51"/>
In the excluſion of the <hi>Drama,</hi> they
aim'd only to preſerve that Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which by the whole courſe and
method of their Education and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
they endeavour'd to infuſe into,
and nurſe up in their youth, which they
were afraid the Delicacy and Luxury of
the <hi>Drama,</hi> as 'twas practic'd at <hi>Athens,</hi>
might ſoften, and that the Elegancy
and Pleaſure of thoſe diverſions wou'd
breed a niceneſs, which wou'd inſenſibly
create a diſguſt in their youth to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Cuſtoms of their Country,
and conſequently make 'em think their
Laws harſh and unpoliſh'd.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore the Virtue of the
<hi>Spartans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Morality, not the reaſon of rejecting the Stage.</note> nor their care of Morality,
that made 'em reject the <hi>Drama,</hi> but an
auſterity of temper, which render'd 'em
ambitious only of Military Glory. In
which, notwithſtanding their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Rivals the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with all
their Delicacy and Luxury, were their
equals, if not ſuperiours. What infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Manners from the Stage, cou'd
that State fear, which tolerated Theft
and Adultery? Tis plain, their
fear was, leſt the natural aſperity of
their humours, which they induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54591:52"/>

and their minds enervated. For the
ſame reaſon all ſorts of Learning lay
under neglect and diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>Whatever were the reaſons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
'em to baniſh the <hi>Drama,</hi> if Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

from the oppoſite State of <hi>Athens,</hi> both
for number and quality. But if the
<hi>Athenians</hi> rivall'd 'em in Military Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they infinitely excell'd 'em in all
other valuable Qualities, and had as
much more Manners, as they had Wit
or Wealth. So that if Mr <hi>Collier</hi> will

muſt oppoſe their old Antagoniſts to

            <p>'Tis obſervable, that the Hiſtorian

proud, and jealous of the honour, and

it ſo great an indignity and debaſement
that they made proviſion by this Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

were already, before the making
of this Law, arriv'd at that lewd heighth
of impudence, that we have already

taken notice of, which obliged the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to take this method to fright

of ſuch impurities.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Reaſons the two firſt ſeem
joyntly to have contributed to the
production of this Law:<note place="margin">Two ſins moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</note> and <hi>Livy,</hi> tho
he does not formally aſſign any reaſon

yet ſeems implicitely to intimate 'em
to us in the notice that he has taken
of 'em, tho not as cauſes, yet as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
conſiderable at that time.
The ſilence of <hi>Livy</hi> concerning any
ſuch licentiouſneſs in their Shews at
that time, is a ſufficient argument againſt
the laſt cauſe. For that Hiſtorian, who
upon all occaſions ſhews abundance of
zeal for the honour of his Country,
would not have fail'd to have done 'em
juſtice upon this occaſion, had this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
been the product of their Morals,
and regard to Virtue. It is apparent
therefore, that this diſcouragement of
the Shews, or rather this reſtraint of
the Action to Servants and Strangers,
was the reſult of their Policy, not
Manners, and is therefore an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
inſtance to Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s purpoſe,

the ruin of the Stage was agreed upon
between 'em, but they wanted a fair
pretence of quarrel; and therefore
General <hi>Collier</hi> publiſhes a tedious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto,</hi>
fill'd with ſpecious pretexts, to
give a colour to his proceedings, and
at the ſame time makes his Invaſion.
His quarrel to the Stage is like that of
the Wolf to the Lamb, when the Prey
was ready, the varniſh of Juſtice was
but a formality, that ſerv'd like a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite's
Grace, to make his Meal the
more decent; when the perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
proves too light, the Family
differences are thrown into the Scale,
and he runs 1500 years backward to
make weight. Thus he makes a true
<hi>Italian</hi> grudge of it, no change of Air,
or Soil can can make it degenerate, but
it remains entail'd upon the Poſterity,
aud ſucceſſors of thoſe, between whom
it firſt began, tho the true reaſon why
it ever began, were long ſince ceas'd,
and perhaps forgotten.</p>
            <p>But after he has, like a hot mettled
Car, with a bad Noſe, over-run the
Scent, and cry'd it falſe thro all the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ields of Antiquity, he begins to be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54591:62"/>
afraid of being whipt home, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
begins to draw towards it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
He's ſenſible, that the compariſon
betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stages
will not hold water, and to anſwer
the leaks, he begins to ply the Pump,
in order to keep it afloat, but it works
as hard, and refunds as little as a Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected,<note place="margin">P. 277.</note> is the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
exact between old <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>
will the Parallel hold out, and has
the <hi>Engliſh Stage</hi> any thing ſo bad as the
<hi>Dancing</hi> of the Pantomimi? I don't ſay
that. The <hi>Modern Geſtures,</hi> tho bold, and
lewd too ſometimes, are not altogether ſo
ſcandalous as the <hi>Roman.</hi> Here then we

of Lewdneſs between both Sexes

were frequently the diverſions of the

of the Modern Geſtures; which
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> makes bold to charge 'em
with? I dare anſwer for the Audience,
that cou'd they find any ſuch thing in
our Dancing, they wou'd be ſo much
more reaſonable than he, that they
wou'd part with all that part of the
Entertainment. But perhaps he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
ſome intentional Lewdneſs,

thinks that Monſieur <hi>L'Abbe</hi> is fallen into

yet more unreaſonable is, that without
offering one Argument to prove either
the reaſonableneſs of his Opinion, or
the reality of his Inſtances, he dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
aſſerts things monſtrouſly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the ſtretch of the moſt capacious

alone is ſufficient to deſtroy the credit

that's honeſtly ſaid, they are ſo; keep

               </gap>it

of this kind are much too fine for the

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Tho he has never heard of one,<note place="margin">His charge raſh.</note> nor

the Muſick muſt be bawdy, Atheiſtical

too ſometimes.</hi> Now whether he means
that the <hi>Fiddler</hi> himſelf is an Infidel of

<hi>Crowd,</hi> he is deſir'd to explain; for
they are both left to be catechiz'd by
him. But as for the ſounds produc'd
betwixt them, care has been already
taken to clear 'em, not only from guilt,
but from all manner of meaning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
As for the dancing, which he
calls bold, it may in one ſenſe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him; for it muſt be granted, that
he that ventures his neck to dance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top of a Ladder, is a very bold
Fellow. If this conceſſion be of any
uſe to him, 'tis at his ſervice, whether
the fraternity of Rope-dancers take it
well at my hands or not. But for the
Lewdneſs, I muſt remind him of his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54591:69"/>
appeal to <hi>thoſe who frequent the Play-houſes,</hi>
(whom he allows to be) <hi>the moſt

in theſe matters appears to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable,
ſo the modeſty of the better

who are the particular favourers of this

in ſo plain a matter, which being a

cloſing it on his ſide with a notorious
falſe aſſertion concerning the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Morality of the vocal Muſick of the
Ancient and Modern Stages, which, not
deſigning to reſume this branch of the
Controverſie any more, I am bound here
to take notice of, and rectifie.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage is more reſerv'd
than the <hi>Roman</hi> in the caſe above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.<note place="margin">P. 280.</note>
If they have any advantage in
their <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Muſick, they loſe it in
their <hi>Vocal.</hi> Their Songs are often ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54591:69"/>
lewd, and irreligious to a flaming
exceſs. Here you have the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
of Vice drawn off ſtrong ſcented,
and thrown into a little compaſs. Now the
<hi>Antients,</hi> as we have ſeen already, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive
in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Here again I am at a loſs to know
whether this is a fault of ignorance or
deſign. But be it whether he pleaſes,
the falſeneſs of his aſſertion is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably
ſcandalous; for whether he
has ventur'd to affirm beyond, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his knowledge, 'tis manifeſt
he did it with an intention to impoſe
upon his Readers, by aſſerting that
which he could not know to be true, if
he did not certainly know it to be
falſe.</p>
            <p>The Vocal Muſick of the Antient
Stage was of two ſorts,<note place="margin">Antient Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Muſick.</note> one whereof
was interſpers'd among their Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Writings, and conſiſted of Hymns,
and Praiſes of their Gods, which were
ſung and danced by the Chorus to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
grave Aires and Meaſures. Here
indeed the Poets muſt have been more
impertinently and perverſely lewd, than
Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s own corrupt imagination
can poſitively make the Moderns to be,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54591:70"/>
if they cou'd have found room for any
thing very indecent; tho an ill natur'd
Critick, with much leſs Gall or Strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has made uſe of,
might ſhew, that they were not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
inoffenſive,<note place="margin">Chorus, its office.</note> as he affirms. The
Chorus repreſented the Spectators, and
their buſineſs was to make occaſional
reflections upon the ſeveral incidents
and turn of the Fable, which was the
artificial Inſtrument, the Antient Poets
us'd to convey the Moral into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and teach 'em what to think
upon ſuch occaſions, and how to behave
themſelves in reference to their Gods
and Religion, and were therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to ſpeak the ſenſe of the Poet, or
what at leaſt he deſir'd ſhould be taken
for ſuch. Now I dare anſwer for the
meaneſt of thoſe Poets, upon whom this
Author has made his reflections, that
taking our Eſtimate of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
by his own diminutive ſurvey
of 'em, there is not amongſt 'em one
ſo arrant a Blockhead, as under
the circumſtances of the Antients to
have taken more liberty, than they
did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:54591:70"/>
But if their Chorus was modeſt and
harmleſs enough; the other part of
their Stage Vocal Muſick will make am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
amends, and make the lewdneſs of
our Poets appear, as demure as a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
at a ſilent meeting. The Antients
had luſtier Appetites, and ſtronger Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
than the Moderns, and their Poets
cookt thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Meſſes accordingly, they did
not ſtand to make minc'd Meat, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
to ſteal in their Ribaldry, and
diſguiſe it in nice Ragou's after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
way; they were for whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
ſubſtantial Treats of Bawdy. Nor
do I find, that it recoil'd upon the
Stomachs of the generality of their
Gueſts for many Ages together. The

made the Amours of their Gods, and

               </gap>d, if a
light wanton thought happens to creep
into a Song, 'tis not ſuffer'd to ſhew
its face bare, but is preſently maskt,
and cloathed decently in Metaphor,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54591:71"/>
that many wou'd not ſuſpect the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
of it, and even the moſt ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
can't take offence without offering
violence; for it comes into your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
like a baſhful young ſinner, ſhe's
civil company amongſt ſober people.</p>
            <p>The Antients, 'tis plain, were not by
abundance ſo ſcrupulous; if they had,
thoſe lewd Drolls had never been
compos'd, much leſs repreſented. But
they were for all naked, without the vail
of Figure or Dreſs, they requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Nudities
in Speech, as well as Action, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
went away with ſatisfaction, and
the Poet with applauſe.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee, that our <hi>Stage</hi>
upon the compariſon is not ſo <hi>rampantly
lewd,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> repreſents it, nor
the ancient ſo inoffenſive. To dilate
upon this head, would be both impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and impertinent; but theſe few
hints, which, all that are acquainted
with the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage,
know to be true, whether Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
does or not, may ſuffice to ſhew what
an unfair Adverſary the Stage has met
with; and to prove that he is not an
upright, or not a competent Judge of
theſe matters, in which he unauthoriz'd
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54591:71"/>
undertakes to determine, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
obtrudes his falſe Judgment upon

            <p>Another of his objections to the Stage
in general,<note place="margin">P. 281.</note> 
               <hi>is their dilating ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

his Rhetorick,<note place="margin">His Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the Topick of Love, a Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Rant.</note> and lays about him in
Tropes and Figures, he is got into his
old road of declamation, and poſts
Whip and Spur thro his Common
place upon the ſubject. His fancy,
like a Runaway-horſe, has got the Bit
between her Teeth, and ramps over
Hedge and Ditch, to the great danger
of his Judgment; no bars or fences of
ſenſe or reaſon can ſtop her Cariere, till
jaded and out of Wind ſhe flags of her
ſelf. Here then, let us come up with
him.</p>
            <p>I don't ſay the Stage fells all before 'em,
and diſables the whole Audience:<note place="margin">P. 282.</note> 'Tis a
hard Battle, where none eſcape. However,
their Triumphs and their Trophies are
unſpeakable. Neither need we much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

prepar'd for Conqueſt and Empire. There's
Nature, and Paſſion, and Life in all the
circumſtances of their Action. Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54591:72"/>
their Mein, their Geſtures,
and their Equipage, are very moving and
ſignificant. Now when the Subject is
agreeable, a lively repreſentation, and a

               <hi>Fire,</hi> where there is not ſo
much as a ſpark? If the Audience were
meer Tinder, they were out of danger.
Sure the Author had Wildfire in
his Brains, that the thoughts of the
Players could put him into ſuch
an uproar. 'Tis granted the Actreſſes
may appear to advantage upon the
Stage, and yet their <hi>Triumphs</hi> and
<hi>Trophies</hi> not be ſo unutterable neither.
For as <hi>dangerouſly</hi> as <hi>they are prepar'd for
Conqueſt and Empire,</hi> the higheſt of
their acqueſts, that I could ever hear
of, was a good keeping, which has
fallen to the ſhare of but a few of 'em;
when multitudes of their Sex have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd

encourag'd,<note place="margin">Revenge not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Stage.</note> or countenanc'd by the
<hi>Stage,</hi> that to deſire and proſecute it,
is almoſt always the mark of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi>
or a <hi>Villain,</hi> in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and <hi>Poetick
Juſtice</hi> is done upon 'em for it; it is
generally turn'd upon their own heads,
becomes the ſnare in which they are
taken, and the immediate Inſtrument
of their miſerable <hi>Cataſtrophe.</hi> Thus in
the <hi>Mourning Bride, Don Manuel,</hi> to
glut his luſt of Revenge,<note place="margin">Inſtance in the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bride.</note> puts himſelf
into the Place and Habit of his unhappy

and inſult his own pious, afflicted
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54591:73"/>
Daughter, over the ſuppos'd Body of
her Murther'd Husband. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
Poetick Juſtice overtakes him,
and he is himſelf ſurpriz'd, miſtaken
for him whom he repreſented, and
ſtabb'd by a Creature of his own,
the villanous Miniſter of his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and his chief Favourite. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more common than this ſort of
Juſtice in <hi>Tragedy,</hi> than which nothing
can be more diametrically oppoſite, or

            <p>
               <hi>Comedy</hi> indeed does not afford us

               <hi>Rage</hi> and
<hi>Barbarity</hi> are Crimes not cognizable by
her; they are of too deep a Dye, and
the Indictment againſt 'em muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
at another Bar. If ſhe admits of
any thoughts of Revenge, they muſt
be ſuch as ſpring from the loweſt Claſs
of Reſentments; that flow rather from
a weakneſs of Judgment, or a perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Temper in the Parties that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
'em, than from the Juſtice of the
Cauſe, or the greatneſs of the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Accordingly they ought to
have no great malignity in 'em, they
ought to ſpend themſelves in little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54591:74"/>
that aim no farther than
the croſſing of an Intrigue, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Match, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and never to
break out into open violence, or ravage
in Miſchief. The Paſſions have little
to do in Comedy, every one there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his capacity acts by deſign,
or careleſsly gives himſelf up to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and indulges his pleaſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.
This equality of temper of
Mind, with the diverſity of Humours,
is what makes the buſineſs of Comedy.
For while this general calm laſts, all
buſily purſue their ſeveral inclinations;
and by various ways practiſe upon one
another. And the Man of Pleaſure
follows his deſign upon the rich Knave's
Wife, or Daughter, while the other is
working into his Eſtate. The Cully is the
Sharper's Exchequer, and the Fop the
Paraſite's, or Jilt's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, were
the Paſſions too much agitated, and
the Storm rais'd high, wou'd become
impracticable; the Commerce wou'd
be broken off, and the Plot wholly
fruſtrated. Beſides that both the
Thoughts and Actions of Men, very
much diſorder'd by Paſſion, or fill'd
with too deep Reſentments, are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54591:74"/>
violent and outrageous, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
repugnant to the Genius, and
deſtructive of the End of Comedy.</p>
            <p>I grant that ſome Paſſions,<note place="margin">Love, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how to be uſed in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> ſuch as
<hi>Love, Jealouſie, Anger,</hi> are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſometimes juſtly employ'd in
Comedy; but then they are to be kept
under, and muſt not be ſuffer'd to get
the Aſcendant, and domineer over Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
if they do, they are no longer
Comick Paſſions. Love muſt not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
'em beyond Gallantry, and Gaiety
of Spirit in the Pride of Succeſs, nor
further than a light diſquiet, ſuch as
may excite their Induſtry, and whet
their Invention under diſappointments.
Jealouſie muſt not hurry 'em beyond
their Cunning, or make their Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betray their Plot. Nor muſt their
Anger break out into Flames, and puſh
'em upon raſh unadvis'd Actions. Such
Revenges therefore, as are the reſult
of Paſſions ſo moderated, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated,
are allowable in Comedy;
which can never produce any ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
effects, as to deſerve all theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

ſuch Diſorders, much leſs can <hi>Comedy,</hi>

has nothing to do with either
<hi>Fiends,</hi> or <hi>Heroes,</hi> whatever Stuff, or

a Fault to bring Duels and Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
upon the Comick Stage, from
which ſome of our Poets can't excuſe
themſelves. But 'tis a Fault rather
againſt the rules of Poetry, and true
Dramatick Writing, than thoſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
For, in Poetry as well as Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we are oblig'd to draw after the
life, and conſequently to copy as well
the Blemiſhes as the Beauties of the
Original; otherwiſe the fineſt colours
we can beſtow, are no better than gay
dawbing. The fault therefore of the
Poet lies not in ſhewing the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any of his Perſons, but in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them improperly, and in the wrong
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54591:77"/>
place, which is an Error of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not his Morals, and wou'd be as
great if he ſhou'd untowardly produce
in <hi>Comedy</hi> the higheſt Examples of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Virtue and Fortitude.</p>
            <p>An Inſtance of this kind we have in
<hi>the Comical Revenge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duel in Love in a Tub, againſt the rules of Comedy.</note> 
               <hi>or Love in a Tub,</hi>

Duel, and the Action of <hi>Bruce</hi> after it
are of a ſtrain above <hi>Comedy.</hi> Thoſe
niceties of Honour, and extravagancies
of Jealouſie and Deſpair are unnatural
on the <hi>Comick</hi> Stage; and the Reſcue
from the Ruffians, for which <hi>Bruce</hi> in
the ſame Scene is oblig'd to his Rival,
however brave and generous an action
it may appear, conſider'd ſimply in it
ſelf, is a treſpaſs againſt Juſtice and
Propriety of Manners in that place. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that whole Walk of the Play, and
the ſet of Characters peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, are more nearly related to the
<hi>Buskin,</hi> than the <hi>Sock,</hi> and render the
Play one of thoſe which we improperly
call <hi>Tragicomedies.</hi> The other Walk, as
'tis one of the moſt diverting, ſo 'tis one
of the moſt natural, and beſt contriv'd
that ever came upon the <hi>Stage.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54591:77"/>
This may ſuffice to ſhew that a <hi>Comick</hi>
Poet can't treſpaſs againſt the Laws of
Morality in this nature, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the Laws of his own Art;
and conſequently that ſuch a fault ought
rather to be lookt upon as an Error of

true draught of his Face. The Poet, as
well as the Painter is to follow, not to
pretend to lead Nature: and if cuſtom
and common practice have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
the Point, whether, according
to Equity, or not, the Poet exceeds his
Commiſſion, if he preſumes to run
counter to 'em. So that if a Comick
Poet be ſo far overſeen, as to bring his
Gentlemen into the Field, or but ſo far
towards it as a Challenge, there is no
taking up the matter without action, or
(which is all one to Mr <hi>Collier's</hi> objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
ſhewing a readineſs, and diſpoſition
for it on both ſides. And the Poet
ſtands in need of all his Skill, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to ſave their Honour, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
'em without engagement.</p>
            <p>Since therefore both by the nature of
his ſubject,<note place="margin">No breach of Morality without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of the Stage.</note> and the rules of his art, a
<hi>Dramatick</hi> Poet is limited, and oblig'd,
he can't reaſonably be charg'd with any
thing, as a treſpaſs againſt Morality, in
which he does not offend likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. For <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poetry,
like a Glaſs, ought neither to flatter,
nor to abuſe in the Image which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects,
but to give them their true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and proportion, and is only valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54591:78"/>
for being exact. If therefore any
man diſlikes the Figures, which he ſees
in it, he finds fault with Nature, not
the Poet, if thoſe Pictures be drawn
according to the life; and he might as
juſtly ſnarl at the wiſe Providence which
governs the world, becauſe he meets
more ugly Faces than handſome ones,
more Knaves and Fools than Honeſt and
Wiſe men in it, and thoſe too, generally
more proſperous and fortunate.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſome of thoſe Gentlemen,
that have taken pains to proclaim War
againſt the preſent Stage, and have
publiſh'd their cenſures of it, ſeem to
have no true Idea of the buſineſs of a
<hi>Dramatick</hi> Poet, and have arraign'd
ſome of the preſent Writers for the
Stage, either through malice or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding,
of high crimes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours,
in many particulars for
doing thoſe things which the duty of a

amiſs, for the information of Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
more eſpecially, and thoſe whom his
furious miſgrounded invectives may
have miſ-led, to enquire into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>
               <hi>And here we may joyn iſſue with

therefore we part, and whether we ſhall

by the tenour of his diſcourſe thro the

is no other way of encouraging Virtue,
and ſuppreſſing Vice, open to the Poets,

he falls upon the Poets with all the

            <p>Now, whether this conduct of the

and abſtractedly taken, without any
Application of compariſon, or relation to
thoſe that have exercis'd themſelves the

may be allow'd as their due; And Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
deference to the juſt merits of thoſe
great Genius's of Antiquity wou'd turn
to his own Praiſe, if it were paid only
as a debt to Juſtice. But proceeding
from a diſingenuous deſign, invidiouſly
to depreciate the worth, and blacken
the reputation of others, the Juſtice is
ſunk in the Malice of it, and the venom
couch'd under it gives an ill Complexion
to the faireſt Part of his Productions.
That this was the motive that induc'd
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> to ſpeak honourably of the
Stage Poets, is apparent from his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
grumbling, and ſnarling at 'em,

account of 'em. For tho upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occaſions he declares very largely in
their favour, yet 'tis only to balance
and ſway the competition betwixt them
and the Moderns on their ſide, and by
raiſing the value of their Characters, to
depreſs the others in the eſteem of the
World. This partiality will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon the examination of ſome of
thoſe Pieces of Antiquity, which Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
ſo juſtly commends, with ſome of
thoſe of later production, which he ſo
unjuſtly decries.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi> is not content to charge

or even of licentious wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but he treats 'em with the utmoſt

of a profeſs'd Hatred to Virtue,
a ſtudied Lewdneſs, and of ſubverting
the end and uſe of their Art. If this
were really their Aim, unqueſtionably
the Fable, which is the Principal Part,
and of greateſt Influence and Operation,
is contriv'd and modell'd ſo as to be
ſerviceable to their grand deſign. That
this may more certainly appear, we ſhall
take the Pains to analize ſome of thoſe
Plays, at which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> takes greateſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54591:82"/>
offence, together with ſome of the moſt
celebrated of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oedipus Tyrannus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles</hi>
has by the univerſal conſent of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all Ages, the greateſt reputation

I ſhall therefore begin with
that, and ſhew that the Fable of that
deſervedly admir'd Piece is by no means
ſo noble, inſtructive, and ſerviceable to
Virtue, by its main or general Moral, as
many of thoſe Plays, againſt which and
their Authors Mr <hi>Collier</hi> inveighs with
ſo much Bitterneſs.</p>
            <p>The Fable of the <hi>Oedipus</hi> is this;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fable of the</hi> Oedipus <hi>of</hi> Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>
               <hi>Laius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and King
of <hi>Thebes,</hi> was inform'd by an Oracle,
that it was his fate to be ſlain by his
own Son, who ſhould be born of his
Wife <hi>Jocaſta.</hi> To elude the threats of
the Oracle, <hi>Laius,</hi> as ſoon as the Child
was born, delivers him to one of his
Servants to be murder'd. This man,
mov'd to compaſſion by the innocence
of the Babe, inſtead of taking away his
life, perforating both his Feet, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a Bend thro 'em, hang'd him up by
the Heels, and left him to the diſpoſal
of Providence. In this poſture he was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54591:82"/>
found by a Domeſtick of <hi>Polybus</hi> King of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> who, taking him down, carried
him to his Maſter, who being childleſs,
receiv'd, educated, and own'd him as
his own. <hi>Oedipus</hi> being at length grown
up, and being in a conteſt of words with
a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> he reproach'd with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Birth, and being a Foundling,
of which till that moment he had by
the expreſs order of <hi>Polybus,</hi> been kept
in ignorance, reſolves to conſult the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
at <hi>Delphi</hi> about his Parentage, and
is order'd by the Oracle to ſeek no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that it was his deſtiny to kill
his Father, and beget Children upon his
Mother. Upon this anſwer, he reſolves
for ever to abandon <hi>Corinth,</hi> his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Country, and in order thereto,
takes his way towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> and on
the Road meets <hi>Laius,</hi> and a quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
between 'em, he kills him, and
all his followers, one excepted, to whom
upon his ſupplication he gives quarter.
Arriving at <hi>Thebes,</hi> he finds that City
in great confuſion, both for the loſs of
their King, whom he knew not to be
the perſon ſlain by him upon the Road,
and for the prodigious ravage and waſte
committed by the Monſter <hi>Sphinx,</hi> who
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54591:83"/>
diſtreſs'd 'em ſo, that they durſt ſcarce
ſtir out of their Walls. To rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the terrour of this Monſter, the
<hi>Thebans</hi> offer their Queen and Crown to
any man that could reſolve the Riddle
propounded by the <hi>Sphinx,</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of which only they were to be
quit of her. This <hi>Oedipus,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the miſcarriage of divers before him,
who failing in their attempt were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by her, undertakes, and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, the Monſter breaks her own
Neck, and he in reward, receives the
Crown, and Queen to Wife. For ſome
time <hi>Oedipus</hi> governs with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and has ſeveral Children by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſta.</hi>
At length a furious Plague ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and making great Havock in the
City, <hi>Oedipus</hi> deputes <hi>Creon</hi> to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to conſult about the Cauſes of, and
Means to be deliver'd from the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Hiſtory of <hi>Oedipus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
before the Action of the Play
commences; and tho the whole action
of the Play naturally ariſes from this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
part, yet <hi>Sophocles</hi> had very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
reſerv'd it to be deliver'd by
way of Narration at the unravelling of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54591:83"/>
the Plot, which is the moſt natural and
beautiful of all Antiquity. But what is
only conſiderable to our purpoſe is, that
hitherto <hi>Oedipus</hi> bears the character of a
Juſt and a Wiſe man; and if he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in any thing that bears an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Guilt, invincible Ignorance
(which the Schoolmen hold to be a
good Plea) is his excuſe.</p>
            <p>But if he is hitherto innocent of any
intentional Guilt, he is thro the whole
courſe of the Action exemplarily pious.
At his firſt appearance upon the Stage,<note place="margin">Piety of <hi>Oedipus.</hi>
               </note>
he ſhews an extraordinary concern for

<hi>Prieſt</hi> addreſſes to him, as if he

too much upon this Paſſage, <hi>Creon</hi>
enters, and breaks off the Parley betwixt
'em; He brings word from the Oracle,
that the Murtherer of <hi>Laius</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd

was this Murtherer was yet a Secret, the

hereupon ſummons a meeting of

that if any one privy to the Fact wou'd
come in, and make a diſcovery, he
ſhou'd, if concern'd therein, be indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified

inform of any other Perſon therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
he ſhou'd be liberally rewarded,
and purchaſe his Favour by ſuch Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
And if any one, conſcious of this
matter, did out of fear for himſelf or his
Friend, obſtinately refuſe to break ſilence,
he requir'd all his Subjects not to give
him harbour or ſuſtenance, or to hold
any manner of Commerce or Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with him. After this he proceeds
to imprecate the Actor or Actors of this

protected there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:54591:85"/>
But this method failing to produce

a Fatality, that directed and controul'd
all human Actions, that all things came

Mr <hi>Dryden</hi> being juſtly prepoſſeſſed for

much to enquire after any improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as additions to <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s deſign,
and by that means let ſlip this, which
was not to his purpoſe, which was to
fit it up to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage; for the

ſo much as enlargement; the ſimplicity
of the Original Fable and the Chaſms,
which the omiſſion of the <hi>Chorus</hi> muſt

(<hi>according to the Doctrine of the

Fate, that diſpoſes and governs all things;
That the Sources of mens Fortunes, and
the Springs of their Actions are plac'd out
of their reach, inacceſſible to human Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and inflexible to Entreaties; that
they move in a conſtant courſe, inviolable
even to the Gods themſelves; that cauſes
and their effects are inſeparably linkt, the

that the Caution of many has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to 'em, and that in ſhunning their
Fate, they have run upon it.</p>
            <p>That this is the moſt natural Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the very contrivance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

make out. <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh

made the <hi>Parricide</hi> and <hi>Inceſt</hi>
of <hi>Oedipus</hi> the proper Act, and Deed of
<hi>Fate,</hi> of which he was only the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and unwilling Inſtrument. Both his
Father and himſelf had been forewarn'd,
and had us'd their utmoſt endeavours
to evade the calamities that threatned
'em. But thoſe very efforts, however
ſeemingly prudent, became the Snare in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54591:90"/>
which they were taken, and the means
of verifying the Prediction of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
For the expoſing <hi>Oedipus</hi> in his
Infancy, was the occaſion of his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his true Parents, and that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of all his enſuing miſeries. All
theſe Authors give us a high Idea of his
Virtue and Prudence; and <hi>Seneca</hi> as
well as the aforecited Authors, makes him
ſacrifice his Expectations of a Crown,
and become a voluntary Exile out of an
Abhorrence of thoſe Crimes, which
were predicted of him.</p>

the Ancient Heathens, that it was
practic'd with great Reputation in all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54591:93"/>

and held in great veneration.
It could not therefore be ſcandalous to

they have grafted a Doctrine many ages

tho more naturally deducible from

'em up like Watches, and orders their

it deſtroys all title to Merit from the

from the moſt villanous actions, and
muſt neceſſarily (if heartily believ'd)
diſcourage men from the ſeverer and
more troubleſome Duties of Religion,

This is the whole of the <hi>Fable.</hi> For the

Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> is an Epiſode
detach'd from, and has nothing to do
with, and ſcarce any dependance upon
the main Action.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee a man of Impetuous,
Ungovernable Paſſion, and of a Nice,
Capricious Honour, that conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
injur'd in the moſt ſenſible part, his
honour, and meditates a Revenge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the Fierceneſs of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

            <p>The <hi>Moral</hi> of this Play is not very
obvious,<note place="margin">Moral ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcare.</note> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> himſelf does not
hint it at or near the concluſion of the
Play, but leaves it to be pickt out by the
Audience, or Readers; which may be
done two ways. Firſt, By conſidering
the Quality of the Inſtrument of Engine
of <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Ruine, which was a <hi>Goddeſs;</hi>
and the manner of bringing it about,
which was by making him ridiculous
thro a <hi>Deceptio Viſus,</hi> or an Illuſion of
the Sight; and then the <hi>Moral</hi> will be,
<q>
                  <l>Quos Deus vult perdere,<note place="margin">Moral.</note> prius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentat.</l>
                  <l>When the Gods reſolve upon a mans ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
they make away his Wits.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Or 2dly, We may conſider the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Perſon, a man of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
Boldneſs, and Turbulent Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong
Paſſions, and the Nature of his
Attempt, which was to kill all the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Chiefs; and then the Moral
may be</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54591:96"/>
               <l>—Qui non moderabitur Irae<note place="margin">2d Moral.</note>

            </q>
            <p>He that ſuffers himſelf to be precipitated
into action by his Rage, will have cauſe to
rue the effects of it.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is the moſt genuine,
and natural. For the misfortune of
<hi>Ajax</hi> ſeems not to ariſe ſo much from
a repentance of his Undertaking, as
from indignation, and a bitter ſenſe of
the Scorn and Contempt he had drawn
upon himſelf by ſo ridiculous a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and the trick put upon him by
<hi>Minerva.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moral of the Author not ariſing naturally from the Action.</note> This is all that naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from the Action; and the Author,
who ſeems ſenſible of the barenneſs
of his Plot, forages without his lines
to ſubſiſt his Moral. By this means
he has provided himſelf of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Moral, which he intimates in the
cloſe of the firſt Scene, betwixt <hi>Minerva</hi>
and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> where the Goddeſs, after
having inform'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> how ſhe had
beſotted <hi>Ajax, adviſes him to take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not to be ſo far tranſported upon
any good Fortune, or preſume ſo far upon his
own Proweſs as to provoke the Gods by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54591:97"/>
Language; who lov'd Modeſty, and
hated Arrogance.</hi> And about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Play, a Meſſenger relates to
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> what paſs'd between <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
and <hi>Teucer</hi> about the quarrel, and
hatred of <hi>Minerva</hi> to <hi>Ajax, Which was
for preſuming upon the ſufficience of his
own Strength and Courage, and refuſing
her Protection and Aſſiſtance, which ſhe
offer'd him againſt the</hi> Trojans. But this
is wholly without the Action (which
cannot properly ſuggeſt any ſuch thing)
and is introduc'd by way of Narration,
only to juſtifie the proceeding of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>
againſt <hi>Ajax,</hi> and is no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on after the death of <hi>Ajax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Moral,<note place="margin">2d Moral not very natural.</note> as it does not ſeem
to flow ſo naturally from the Fable, as
the firſt, ſo it ſeems never to have been
in <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s thoughts. For the laſt
diſgrace, and the Deſperate Action that
follow'd it, are the effect of a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Agent, (<hi>viz.) Minerva,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a ſudden Infatuation after a
ſupernatural manner; and therefore the
Poet cou'd have no juſt occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the natural ill conſequences
of Paſſion, how outrageous or ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
ſoever. For this reaſon I ſhall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54591:97"/>
purſue the conſideration of it no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The next in order is the <hi>Electra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fable of the Electra.</note> in
which there is ſcarce the ſhadow of a
Plot, nor much more of a Moral. <hi>Oreſtes</hi>
(who after the murther of his Father
<hi>Agamemnon,</hi> had by the care of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Electra</hi> eſcap'd the fury of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Clytemneſtra</hi> and her Paramour <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſthus,</hi>)
comes to <hi>Argos</hi> with his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
whom he ſends to deceive his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Sham Story of his Death,
and in the mean time diſcovers himſelf
to his Siſter, with whom he conſults
about means to revenge the Death of
his Father; is introduc'd to his Mother
as a ſtranger, kills her, and afterwards
<hi>Aegiſthus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thro the whole Play the Poet does
not ſo much as ſquint toward a Moral,
he lets nothing fall by which the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may ſo much as gueſs what he
drives at. But by the contrivance of
the Fable, wherein a Wife, that had
embrued her hands in her Husbands
blood, after having abus'd his Bed, is,
together with her Adulterer and Fellow
Murtherer, after a ſucceſſion of ſome
years of proſperous Villany, overtaken
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54591:98"/>
by Vengeance from the hands of the Son,
and ſlain; we may conclude with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi>

This Policy of <hi>Sophocles</hi> will
furniſh us with both a Plot, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which 'twill otherwiſe be hard to
find in this Play. The Poet was now
in his old age, and had long out-lived
Mr <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Fumbling Age of Poetry,</hi> and
perhaps began to be ſenſible of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
and therefore to ſupport the
weight of that reputation, which he had
acquired in the vigour of his Poetry,
he pieces out the Lyons Skin with the
Foxes Tail, and ſuſpecting his own
power to move their Paſſions as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
makes uſe of their Vanity to
ſcrue them up to the deſired pitch of
Admiration and Satisfaction. This, if
the Reader pleaſes, may ſerve inſtead of
a Plot, and the ſucceſs of it may afford
us this Moral; that <hi>no people is ſo

if their Vanity be skilfully tickled, it will
be rous'd, and exert itſelf in favour of the

which <hi>Sophocles</hi> intended for the

This Fable and Application afford ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little matter of Moral Inſtruction;
and the uſe that the Poet himſelf makes
of it, is rather a diſcouragement to
Virtue, ſince neither the Heroick Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor Actions of <hi>Hercules,</hi> nor the
relation to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> could exempt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or Family from ſuch lamentable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters.</p>
            <p>However, the misfortune of <hi>Dejanira</hi>
may ſerve as a caution againſt Jealouſie
and Adultery, which two failings in
conjunction, occaſion'd her ruin. And
<hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf may be an inſtance of
the dangerous conſequenees of a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ungovern'd Flame, which at laſt
was the deſtruction of him, who had

            <p>The Fable of the <hi>Philoctetes</hi> is this.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philocte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the Fable.</note>
               <hi>Philoctetes</hi> having an incurable Ulcer in
his Foot, from the bite of a Serpent in
his Voyage to <hi>Troy,</hi> was deſerted, and
left by the <hi>Greeks</hi> alone upon the deſart
Shore of <hi>Lemnos.</hi> But his Preſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declar'd abſolutely neceſſary to the
taking of <hi>Troy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> are
ſent to fetch him. He refuſes obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to go along with 'em, but <hi>Hercules</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:54591:101"/>
appearing, and perſwading him, he
complies.</p>
            <p>This likewiſe is a barren Story,<note place="margin">No Moral.</note> of
which <hi>Sophocles</hi> himſelf has made no
moral Uſe, and has ſcarce given occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for any one elſe to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philoctetes</hi> had been barbarouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by his Confederates the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for
which he was irreconcilably angry with
'em, eſpecially <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who had been
the Executioner of their Reſolutions in
relation to him. He therefore refuſes
obſtinately to go with, or to thoſe that
had ſerv'd him ſo baſely; but <hi>Hercules</hi>
appearing, and telling him, that upon
thoſe terms, and no other, he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his cure, and proſperity, the man
had ſo much Wit in his Anger, as to
prefer Health and Fame before ſullen
Revenge, which muſt be his own as

            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi> wou'd paſs the Speech of
<hi>Hercules</hi> upon us for a Moral.<note place="margin">Speech of <hi>Hercules</hi> not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Action. <hi>P.</hi> 93.</note> But by
his leave, how <hi>remarkably Moral ſoever
the Concluſion of this Play</hi> may be, the
morality of it no way depends upon the
Action foregoing. <hi>Hercules</hi> prevails
with <hi>Philoctetes</hi> to go with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> promiſes him Health, Honour,

of Religion to him.

            <p>
               <hi>Thus I have run through</hi> Sophocles,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
whoſe Plays (<hi>by Mr</hi> Collier'<hi>s own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>)
are form'd upon Models of Virtue,
joyn Innocence with Pleaſure, and deſign
the Improvement of the Audience.</p>
            <p>Upon this account, and the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of this Author, I have been
more particular with him upon this
head, than I deſign to be with any of
the reſt of the Antient <hi>Tragedians.</hi> I
have ſet before the Reader the ſeveral
Models of all his remaining Plays, and
have enquir'd into the Diſpoſition of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54591:102"/>
the Fable in relation to the ſervice of
<hi>Morality,</hi> that upon collation we may
with more certainty meaſure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
Morality of his and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Plays on this Article.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euripides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Art. Poet. Cap. xiii.</note> who came neareſt him both
in Time and Reputation, is yet more
defective in this point. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has
tax'd him with want of Conduct in the
<hi>Oeconomy of his Fable;</hi> but this Cenſure
being levell'd rather at the want of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
than of Moral in the Plays of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
I ſhall make no further uſe of it
here. The character of this Author's
works wou'd make us naturally expect,
that he ſhou'd be more careful of this
Article, than either <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> or <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
who aim'd more at the Pathetick.
The Plays of <hi>Euripides</hi> betray all along
an affected Oſtentation of Learning,<note place="margin">Character of the Plays of <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note>
and as great an Ambition to be thought
a Philoſopher, as a Poet. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he abounds more in Points, and
Sentences of Morality, florid Harangues,
and ſubtle Speculations, than <hi>Sophocles;</hi>
but he does not touch the Paſſions, or
raiſe the Concern of an Audience like
him. And therefore whatever we may
think of his Dialogues conſider'd ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54591:102"/>
and independant of one another,
his Plays in the aggregate are far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to thoſe of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euripides</hi> has yet remaining nineteen
<hi>Tragedies,</hi> to examin all which, as we
have done thoſe of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> wou'd be
an impertinent, as well as a tedious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
both to the Reader and my ſelf.
I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in a few of 'em, and refer thoſe
that have the Curioſity and Patience, to
proceed further to the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Oreſtes</hi> challenges the firſt place
upon the ſcore of its Reputation, and
the great Succeſs it had on the revival
of it, five hundred years after the
death of the Author.</p>
            <p>This play commences,<note place="margin">Fable of the <hi>Oreſtes</hi>
               </note> where the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectra</hi>
of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and his own conclude.
<hi>Oreſtes,</hi> by the help of his Siſter <hi>Electra,</hi>
having ſlain his Mother, is very much
troubled in mind, and haunted by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and deſponds upon the account of
his Guilt. <hi>Tyndarus,</hi> his Mother's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
endeavours to revenge her death,
and excites the People againſt him, who
vote him to be ſton'd to death with his
Siſter. <hi>Menelaus,</hi> with his Wife <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54591:103"/>
and Daughter <hi>Hermione,</hi> arrives in
the mean time and offers his aſſiſtance to
his Nephew in this exigence, but is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-aw'd
by <hi>Tyndarus,</hi> and deſerts his
Party. <hi>Pylades</hi> comes opportunely, and
perſwades <hi>Oreſtes</hi> to appear, and make
his defence in perſon, which he does,
but without ſucceſs, yet upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that his Siſter and himſelf ſhall be
their own Executioners, he is let go by
the Mob upon <hi>Parole.</hi> Being return'd
to his Siſter, they conſult about means
of <hi>Safety. Electra</hi> adviſes him and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades</hi>
to ſeize upon <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Hermione,</hi>
to kill <hi>Helen,</hi> and to Article with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus</hi>
for their own ſafety, with a Sword
at <hi>Hermione</hi>'s Throat; and if her Father
wou'd not comply with their demands,
firſt to diſpatch her, then themſelves.
This Project is put in execution, and
the Ladies are ſurpriz'd, <hi>Apollo</hi> reſcues
<hi>Helen,</hi> and appearing, reconciles <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> and makes a match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and <hi>Hermione,</hi> and betwixt
<hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Electra,</hi> and promiſing

<hi>Helen</hi> is made a Goddeſs, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

In this Play moſt of the Characters
are wicked,<note place="margin">Characters all vicious.</note> 
               <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Electra</hi> are <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides;
Tyndarus</hi> is (in his heart at
leaſt) the <hi>Murtherer</hi> of his Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<hi>Menelaus,</hi> the <hi>Betrayer</hi> of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
and Niece, whom he ought to
have protected; <hi>Helen,</hi> an <hi>infamous</hi>
Woman, and the accidental cauſe at
leaſt of the Miſeries of a great part of
<hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> yet clear of any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Guilt in this caſe; <hi>Pylades</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with his Friend in an unjuſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to murther <hi>Helen</hi> and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>Hermione,</hi> who is next to a Mute
in the Play, is the only unexceptionable
Character.</p>
            <p>This Play begins well,<note place="margin">Not of a piece all through.</note> the Agonies
of a guilty Conſcience, the Deſpair, and
the Horrors of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> promiſe a good
Moral: But the hopes of that ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;
for the firſt word of comfort from
<hi>Menelaus</hi> diſpels all his Anxiety for his
crime, and converts it to a ſolicitude for
his Safety. In order to this, he
enters upon a piece of Villany, more
execrable than that for which he was
then proſecuted, becauſe 'twas without
provocation: A Feint of that kind had
been an allowable Stratagem to have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54591:104"/>
brought <hi>Menelaus</hi> to Articles; but to
project it in earneſt was an unparallell'd
piece of Barbarity. But what after all
is more ſurprizing and unnatural is, that
the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> is happy, and the Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
rewarded, and all this ſeems to be
the reſult of <hi>Electra</hi>'s latter contrivance,
which however wicked was ſucceſsful
and proſperous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moral</hi> (if I may call it ſo) of
this Story is properly this,<note place="margin">Moral.</note> that there
<hi>is no dabbling in Villany, but that thoſe
that are once enter'd, muſt wade thro, if
they will be ſafe, and juſtify one Crime by
another.</hi> But that which makes the
winding up of this Play more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
is, that the Gods are made the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
of all; <hi>Apollo</hi> appears in perſon,
and juſtifies <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> and promiſes him
his protection, and enſures the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Electra,</hi> who had
been the ſole Incendiary and Contriver
of all this Miſchief; which is adding
Impiety to the want of Poetick Juſtice,
and making Providence acceſſary to
Parricide, and the Gods Abbetors of
Violence and Injuſtice, not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Deifying of <hi>Helena,</hi> who,
tho <hi>Jove</hi>'s Daughter, is a Woman of a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54591:104"/>
very infamous Character all through
the Play.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the <hi>Moral</hi> of this Play will
hardly riſe in Judgment againſt the
Moderns. Nor has the <hi>Electra</hi> of
of the ſame Author any more reaſon,
it being liable to the ſame exceptions
with the former, only in this the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is perpetrated, in that but deſigned;
in ſhort, this Play is the ground work of
the former, and the action of this gives
the reaſon, and occaſion of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in t'other. Here likewiſe the Gods
are impertinently brought in to finiſh
that, which wou'd of it ſelf have cloſed
very naturally without 'em. For after
the Death of <hi>Aegiſthus</hi> and <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi>
there was nothing more to be done. But
this Poet, who is very fond of Machines,
tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> unneceſſary, after all's over brings

            <p>However the Fable of this Play being

and allow it the benefit of any <hi>Moral</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:54591:105"/>
that may be raiſed out of it, tho not

that he had not imbezzled the Stores of

tho Faithfulneſs be very commendable
in a Servant, yet his was never exercis'd
in ſo ſuperlative a way, or endur'd any
ſuch ſevere tryal, as might upon that
ſcore entitle him to the great Fortune

His higheſt Merit was bare Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
enough to have procur'd him a
Certificate now adays upon change of
Service; not to challenge any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reward. He laid claim to no
active virtues, his Innocence was his
ſtrongeſt Plea, and that too ſeems to be
a little ſullied at laſt by his too eager
Proſecution of Revenge upon <hi>Creuſa.</hi>
A generous Heathen (without reaching
the Pitch of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Morality) wou'd
have forgiven, or ſlighted the Feeble
Malice of a Woman, eſpecially at that
Critical Juncture, when he ought to
have ſhewn himſelf worthy of his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

a piece of Condeſcenſion ſo baſe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
all pretence to common merit or
honeſty. For he that is content to hold
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54591:108"/>
his good Forrune by Trick and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
don't deſerve it.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee in this <hi>Moral</hi> Play,<note place="margin">Of no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</note> of
the two fortunate Perſons, one is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ought not to be drawn into

an Example; t'others Virtue is of ſo

that 'tis not very likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate,
and by no means a proper Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
to meaſure full grown Worth by.
And therefore this Play (tho we ſhou'd,
with Monſieur <hi>Dacier,</hi> allow it to be of
the Moral kind) is like to do no great
ſervice to Morality by the Deſign and
Management of its Fable.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I have mention'd the <hi>Hercules

take notice of the Character and Sufferings
of <hi>Hercules</hi> in the <hi>Trachiniae</hi> of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
There is indeed this conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the diſadvantage of this Play,
in regard to the <hi>Moral,</hi> Art, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, that here the misfortunes of
<hi>Hercules</hi> are wrought altogether by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine:
<hi>Juno, Iris,</hi> and <hi>Lyſſa</hi> or <hi>Madneſs</hi>
(which is here ſuppoſed a <hi>Daemon</hi>) are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54591:109"/>
all, and only concern'd in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
whereas in <hi>Sophocles</hi> things are
naturally brought about, and made the
reſult of Jealouſie and Credulity. What
therefore in that is but obliquely charg'd
upon the Gods, is here directly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em. So that, what from the laſt
Speech of <hi>Hyllus,</hi> and the <hi>Chorus</hi> is there
urg'd againſt the <hi>Moral</hi> of that Play,
holds more ſtrongly againſt this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the atrocity of the Fact, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
here to the Lives of his Wife
and Children, aggravates the guilt of
<hi>Iuno,</hi> who cou'd not limit her malice to
his Perſon, without comprehending
thoſe Innocents, who by no crime of
their own cou'd have incurr'd her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Theſe few inſtances may ſuffice to

it very little. His aim was wholly
at the Pathetick, and he deals almoſt
altogether in Objects of Terror; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
his Flights are frequently lofty,
but generally irregular, and his Verſe
rumbles, and thunders almoſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
but it uſually ſpends itſelf, like a
Wind-Gun, in Noiſe and Blaſt only.
He ſets out gloriouſly, launches boldly,
blown up with a Tympany of Windy
<hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and Buckram <hi>Metaphors;</hi> but
he carries more Sail than Ballaſt, and his
courſe is accordingly uneven; he is
ſometimes in the Clouds, and ſometimes
upon the Sands. In ſhort, <hi>Aeſchylus's</hi>
ſole Care and Ambition ſeems to have
been (as Mr <hi>Bays</hi> has it) to <hi>elevate</hi> and

After this Prologue I ſuppoſe no good
Moral will be expected from this Fable;
the reſt of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi>'s Fables are manag'd
after a manner little more ſerviceable, for

theſe, nor did their works very long

the <hi>Troades</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> but is taken

is not to be receiv'd into Grace, till he
has had the Penning of a Recantation for
him If Mr <hi>Collier</hi> did believe that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
the Philoſopher was the Author of
any of thoſe Plays, he ought upon the
merit of his other works, (by which he
may at leaſt pretend to vie with Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
both zeal and ſervice in the cauſe of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54591:112"/>
Virtue) to have treated ſo excellent a
Perſon with more reſpect and honour,
than to have rank'd him with, and
made him the Ringleader of thoſe,
whom he reckons <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Buffoons.</hi>
If he did not, he cou'd in Juſtice have
done no leſs than ſet him clear of the
Imputation, which by ſo rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
a charge he has brought him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For he cou'd not but know, that
the learned Perſons before-mentioned,
whoſe Authority is of great weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men of Letters, had deliver'd
their Opinions, that he was the Author
of ſome of thoſe Plays, eſpecially the
Judicious <hi>Heinſius,</hi> whom he cites, and
I ſhou'd ſuppoſe he is well acquainted
with, unleſs he does (which I ſuſpect)
like ſome Perſons, that boaſt of their
familiarity with great men, whom they
have not the honour to know.</p>
            <p>Had he known their Opinions in this
matter, it had but been a becoming piece
of Modeſty to have laid his reaſons for his
diſſent from 'em before his Reader; and
not haughtily to have ſlighted their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
as not worth his notice. Or at
leaſt he ought not in good manners to
have treated the Memory of that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54591:113"/>
at ſo ſcoundrel a rate. I ſuppoſe
he will hardly juſtifie this Indignity
from the miſrepreſentations that have
been given of him. For, not to enter
improperly into a diſpute about the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of thoſe Reports here, whatever
his private infirmities might be, we are
ſure from his works, that he bent his
Studies and Endeavours to the ſervice of
Morality as heartily and ſucceſsfully, as
ſome Chriſtians who with greater helps
and ſtronger invitations, ſeem to value
their Services much higher, with leſs
reaſon.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Seneca,</hi>

and may plead in his Juſtification, that
he leaves the Story generally no worſe

<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, in favour
of the Poets of, or near his time, that
taking the Fables of their Plays from
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54591:114"/>
Stories vulgarly known either from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
or the works of ſome precedent
Poet, they had not the liberty of rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo far from the receiv'd Tradition
in the Contrivance, and diſpoſition of
their Fables, as was frequently requir'd
to the forming a juſt and truly artificial
Model. This may be urg'd with more
juſtice in defence of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who, taking
his. Models from Authors of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
wou'd have been thought guilty
of a high piece of Preſumption, if he
had varied too much from Originals ſo
well known and received. Beſides, had
he chang'd the Fortune of his Principal
Perſons he had effac'd the Images of 'em,
which had been impreſs'd upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
who wou'd not have own'd, or

               </note> it muſt be granted, that in

            <p>This Plot, as it ſtands in <hi>Seneca,</hi> is

            <p>Having thus run through the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Antiquity, perhaps ſomething
more minutely, than may be thought
requiſite upon this Article, I ſhall not
make many reflections upon the whole,
but leave 'em to the further conſideration
of the Reader, after a Remark or two,
concerning the Practice of the Ancients
in general, in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable,<note place="margin">General Reflections on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</note> that the Ancients in
the diſpoſition of their Fables, ſeem to
have had ſuch very little regard to the
Moral of 'em, they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with delivering their Inſtructions
in wiſe ſayings, ſcatter'd here and there
up and down the Dialogue, or at the
cloſe of all; and only ſought in their
Fables matter and occaſion of moving
the Paſſions, which was generally done
by way of Narration; to which end
they furniſh'd out their Dialogue with
all the Force, Pomp, and Terrour of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54591:116"/>
Expreſſion they could, in which how
well they have ſuccceded, is not to the
preſent purpoſe to take notice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s diviſion of Tragedy.</note> no doubt, this practice
of theirs in view, when he divided Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
into <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Pathetick.</hi> By this
Diviſion of Tragedy (<hi>ratione Subjecti)
Ariſtotle</hi> plainly indicates, not only that
the Subjects of the Ancient Tragedy
were not all <hi>Moral,</hi> but likewiſe that it
was not neceſſary, that they ſhould be
ſo. He inſtances in the <hi>Phthiotides,</hi> and
<hi>Peleus,</hi> two Tragedies that are loſt, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the <hi>Moral</hi> kind; and beſides this
mention of 'em, I do not remember any
notice that he has taken of this ſort of
Tragedy. For all his Rules ſeem to
be calculated for the ſervice of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick</hi>
and <hi>Implex</hi> kinds.</p>
            <p>From this ſilence of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moral Plays not much encouraged at <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </note> and the
ſcarcity of 'em amongſt the remains of
the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedy, we may reaſonably
collect, that this ſort of Tragedy was
not much in uſe amongſt the Ancients
themſelves. For of all the Pieces of
Antiquity the <hi>Alceſtis</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in my opinion deſerves the name
of a <hi>Moral</hi> Tragedy. In this Play both
<hi>Admetus,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Alceſtis</hi> are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54591:116"/>
of ſtrict Probity, and great Piety.
<hi>Alceſtis</hi> out of a ſingular Piety, offers
her ſelf to <hi>Death</hi> a voluntary Sacrifice,
in lieu of her Husband. In the depth
of <hi>Admetus</hi>'s grief while his Wife was
yet in the Houſe, and the rites of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
unperform'd, comes <hi>Hercules,</hi> who
obſerving the Family to be in Mourning,
deſires to be excus'd from troubling his
Houſe at ſo unſeaſonable a time. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus,</hi>
unwilling to turn away ſuch a
Gueſt, diſſembles the real cauſe of his
Grief, and receives him nobly, but <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
enquiring, and being inform'd of
the Truth of <hi>Admetus</hi>'s loſs, combats
<hi>Death,</hi> recovers <hi>Alceſtis,</hi> and reſtores
her to her Husband.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> of this Play is truly <hi>Moral.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alceſtis <hi>of</hi> Euripides <hi>a</hi> Moral <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Alceſtis</hi> firſt by her Piety redeems her
Husband from <hi>Death;</hi> and <hi>Admetus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by his <hi>Generoſity</hi> and <hi>Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
by means of <hi>Hercules,</hi> reſcues her
from the Grave. Thus they recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
owe their lives to each others Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But if this Play be remarkably
<hi>Moral,</hi> it is on the other hand mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly
unnatural, and conſequently on
that account is incapable of affording
any extraordinary Pleaſure, or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54591:117"/>
This probably might be the
reaſon, why this ſort of <hi>Tragedy</hi> was ſo
little in requeſt.</p>
            <p>From the whole it appears,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antients</hi> careleſs of the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moral</hi> of the Plays.</note> that the
<hi>Antients</hi> were not ſo careful of their
Models, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> pretends; but
were on the contrary extremely negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the <hi>Moral</hi> in the <hi>Fables</hi> of their
<hi>Tragedies.</hi> So that if one or two do
afford a tolerable one, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
by the ſlight notice they take of it,
that they did not ſee it, or but caſually
found it there, rather than induſtriouſly
ſought it; and that we are more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their luck, than Judgment or good
Intentions for 'em. I grant this way
of arguing not to be demonſtrative,
but it is not therefore unconcluſive.
For ſince the ſenſe of the <hi>Antients,</hi> is not
any where (that I know of) delivered
in expreſs terms concerning this matter,
I take their Practice, backt by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to be a ſufficient
warrant for any concluſions, that ſhall
be drawn naturally from 'em.<note place="margin">Conſequence of Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s looſe way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But if I wou'd indulge my ſelf in the
Liberties of Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and charge the
<hi>Antiens</hi> at that looſe rate, that he does
the <hi>Engliſh Dramatick</hi> Poets, I might
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54591:117"/>
not only tax 'em with negligence of
their Morals, but with maliciouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Vertue, and induſtriouſly
promoting Villany, and Impiety. Nor
wou'd the Poets ſuffer alone, all the
great Men of Antiquity, that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
their works, muſt ſhare both the
Guilt, and the Sentence; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
above the reſt wou'd be even capitally
criminal, his <hi>Art of Poetry</hi> is an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
Spring of Corruption, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

univerſally with <hi>Villany, Impiety, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> of all kinds, for
above ſixteen hundred years together.
This wou'd be high Treaſon among
the Admirers of the <hi>Antients,</hi> yet 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to one of Mr <hi>Collier's</hi> declamatory
Rants, when he is in one of his Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Fits, and about to dreſs up a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

rate 'twere eaſie to turn the Satyr upon

unleſs it be to ſhew us, that the World
has been miſtaken in its notions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that wickedneſs is meritorious,
and Innocence a Crime, that Virtue, and

under our conſideration in another

            <p>
               <hi>Hamlet</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
murther'd by his Brother,<note place="margin">Fable of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Action.</note> who

Play.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:54591:121"/>
The late Kings Ghoſt appears to his
Son young <hi>Hamlet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fable after the Action commences.</note> and declares how
and by whom he was murther'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
him to revenge it. <hi>Hamlet</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
grows very much diſcontented,
and the King very jealous of him.
Hereupon he is diſpatched with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to <hi>England,</hi> then ſuppoſed
Tributary to <hi>Denmark,</hi> whither a ſecret
Commiſſion to put him to Death, is
ſent by 'em: Which <hi>Hamlet</hi> diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
writes a new Commiſſion, in which
he inſerts the names of the Ambaſſadors
inſtead of his own. After this a Pirate
engaging their Veſſel, and <hi>Hamlet</hi> too
eagerly boarding her is carried off, and
ſet aſhore in <hi>Denmark</hi> again. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
not ſuſpecting <hi>Hamlet's</hi> Trick,
purſue their Voyage, and are caught
in their own Trap. <hi>Polonius,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
to the King, conveying himſelf
as a Spy behind the Hangings, at an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
between <hi>Hamlei</hi> and his Mother,
is miſtaken for the King, and killed by
him. <hi>Laertes</hi> his Son, together with the
King contrive the Death of <hi>Hamlet</hi> by a
ſham Match at Foyls, wherein <hi>Laertes</hi>
uſes a poyſon'd unrebated Weapon. The
King, not truſting to this ſingle Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54591:122"/>
prepares a poyſoned Bowl for
<hi>Hamlet,</hi> which the Queen ignorantly
drinks. <hi>Hamlet</hi> is too hard for <hi>Laertes,</hi>
and cloſes with him, and recovers the
envenom'd weapon from him, but in ſo
doing, he is hurt by, and hurts him
with it. <hi>Laertes</hi> perceiving himſelf
wounded, and knowing it to be mortal,
confeſſes that it was a train laid by the
King for <hi>Hamlet's</hi> Life, and that the foul
Practice is juſtly turn'd upon himſelf.
The Queen at the ſame times cries out,
that ſhe is poyſoned, whereupon <hi>Hamlet</hi>
wounds the King with the envenom'd
weapon. They all die.</p>
            <p>Whatever defects the Criticks may
find in this Fable,<note place="margin">Poetick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved in this Play.</note> the Moral of it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
Here was a Murther privately
committed, ſtrangely diſcover'd, and
wonderfully puniſh'd. Nothing in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
can rival this Plot for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diſtribution of Poetick Juſtice. The
Criminals are not only brought to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they are taken in their own
Toyls, their own Stratagems recoyl
upon 'em, and they are involv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that miſchief and ruine, which
they had projected for <hi>Hamlet. Polonius</hi>
by playing the Spy meets a Fate, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54591:122"/>
was neither expected by, nor intended
for him. <hi>Guildenſtern</hi> and <hi>Roſencraus,</hi>
the Kings Decoys, are counterplotted,
and ſent to meet that fate, to which
they were trepanning the Prince. The
Tyrant himſelf falls by his own Plot,
and by the hand of the Son of that Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom he had murther'd. <hi>Laertes</hi>
ſuffers by his own Treachery, and dies
by a Weapon of his own preparing.
Thus every one's crime naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
his Puniſhment, and every one (the
Tyrant excepted) commences a Wretch
almoſt as ſoon as a Villain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Moral of all this is very obvious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moral of <hi>Hamlet.</hi>
               </note>

that no Humane Power, or Policy are a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent

of 'em ſuch, as the beſt of Antiquity
can't equal in that reſpect. His <hi>King

that ſcore, that 'twou'd be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to trouble the Reader with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

            <p>The other Tragedies upon which Mr

are ſo recent, and ſo common in the
hands of every Play Reader, that 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
an affront to their memories to
trouble 'em with too particular a Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation.
But ſince we have oblig'd our
ſelves to make good the Comparative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of the Moderns by inſtances
upon the Parallel, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> can never
deſire fairer Play, than for us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the defence of thoſe very Plays,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54591:123"/>
which he himſelf has markt out, and
aſſigned us; of which the next in order
is the <hi>Orphan,</hi> againſt which he enters

            <p>The Model of this Play is ſomething
like that of <hi>Oedipus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.</note> except that in this
the crime of <hi>Polydore,</hi> being voluntary,
his guilt is real, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<hi>Poetick</hi> Juſtice is obſerv'd in
his puniſhment, which is juſt. In this
Tragedy likewiſe <hi>Acaſto, Caſtalio,</hi> and
<hi>Monimia</hi> are innocent, virtuous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
and their misfortunes unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
which made 'em naturally objects
of Pity and Commiſeration. The
fatal conſequences of <hi>Polydore's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
luſt, and baſe raſh action,
afford matter of Terrour and Example.
This Play is exactly conſtituted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who requires only that
Tragedy ſhou'd move Terrour and
Compaſſion, which are the proper
Springs, by which it works upon the
Audience.<note place="margin">The <hi>Moral</hi> good.</note> In this it excells the Fable

a good Moral, and in the wretched
Cataſtrophe of <hi>Polydore,</hi> and the miſeries
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54591:124"/>
which his incontinence brought upon

For even the <hi>Mufti</hi> is allowed
the benefit of his Clergy, and ſhares his
Patronage. He is furiouſly provok'd at
Mr <hi>Dryden</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Prieſts of all
Religions are the ſame,</hi> when he himſelf at
the ſame time makes no diſtinction,
but treats the Prieſts of God Almighty,
<hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Anubis</hi> with the ſame
reſpect. He is for ſtrengthening his

all Faiths and Complexions; he ranſacks
<hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and enters
into a religious League offenſive and
defenſive with Sun-burnt <hi>Africans,</hi> and
Monſters of the <hi>Nile.</hi> To this end, he
labours hard to find out ſome relation
between the <hi>Mufti</hi> and the Biſhops, and
very dutifully ſtrains to extend the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
from <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> that what is

               <hi>Muſſulman</hi> of 'em all cou'd not have

Prieſts, than to have ſhifted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
from them to ours. But I hope
there is no ſuch Sympathy between 'em
(as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> injuriouſly fancies) and that
to break the <hi>Mufti's</hi> wou'd not make
our Biſhops Heads ach, or his black and

worthy great Men, who are the honour
of both our Church and Nation,
have little reaſon to thank him for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to ally 'em to thoſe, that
muſt of neceſſity, putting the mildeſt
conſtruction upon their actions, be either
groſs Fools or rank Knaves; Fools if
they believe, and Knaves if they
help on the cheat and impoſture of
<hi>Mahomet</hi> without believing. Thus Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> puts a groſſer affront upon our
Religion and Clergy, than any Mr <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
has done, and his reproof deſerves a
ſeverer correction, than t'others fault.
This perhaps is a liberty too great to be
indulg'd in any one but Mr <hi>Collier's</hi> dear
ſelf, and therefore to chaſtize Mr <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's</hi>
Preſumption and Inſolence for but

Tenour of the 2d Commandment
ſhews, that the Puniſhment of Mens crimes,
ſhall extend not only to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but if unrepented ſhall reach their
Poſterity likewiſe. In this Fable <hi>Muley
Moloch,</hi> a Tyrant and an Uſurper, <hi>Benducar</hi>
a crafty Villain and a Traytor, the <hi>Mufti</hi>
a raſcally Hypocrite and a Traytor.
Theſe three therefore are juſtly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their own proper Demerits.
The Tyrant falls by Treachery, the
treacherous Miniſter by publick Juſtice,
and the Hypocrite is unmaskt, depos'd,
and his Eſtate confiſcated. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>
and <hi>Almeyda</hi> are Characters of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Virtue, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> appears juſt and
brave, and <hi>Almeyda</hi> chaſte and conſtant
to an Heroick Pitch. Their offence was
involuntary, and a Sin of Ignorance, the
unhappy conſequence of the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Parents, and their Puniſhment
is proportion'd very well to the nature
of their Treſpaſs. For tho Inceſt be a Sin
of a very black Dye, yet their Ignorance
of the nearneſs of their Blood waſhes
away their Guilt, and makes it their
misfortune, not their Crime. In this
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54591:125"/>
caſe a bare Separation wou'd be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Juſtification of their Innocence.
But a Judgment hanging over their
heads for the ſin of their Parents, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
that ſomething more mortifying
was neceſſary, and therefore a voluntary
abdication, exile, and a recluſe religious
Life are thrown in by way of Pennance
to make weight, and give the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
its due complement. But leſt the
true <hi>Moral</hi> ſhou'd eſcape the Audience,
the Poet has taken care to fix, and
ſumm it up in the four concluding Lines
<q>

In this Play Poetick Juſtice is altogether
neglected, Virtue is every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſted,

I ſee no neceſſity for <hi>letting the Curtain

of <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> The fall of his Hero

               <note place="margin">Mourning Bride.</note> I

of the Obſervation of Poetick
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54591:127"/>
Juſtice in this Play, but this being
the proper place, I ſhall take it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more particularly into conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Fable of this Play is one of the
moſt juſt,<note place="margin">Fable very juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</note> and regular that the Stage,
either Antient or Modern, can boaſt of.
I mean, for the diſtribution of Rewards,
and Puniſhments. For no virtuous perſon
miſſes his Recompence, and no viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
one eſcapes Vengeance. <hi>Manuel</hi> in
the proſecution and exerciſe of his
Cruelty and Tyranny, is taken in a
Trap of his own laying, and falls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Sacrifice in the room of him,
whom he in his rage had devoted.
<hi>Gonſalez</hi> villanous cunning returns upon
his own head, and makes him by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
kill the King his Maſter, and in
that cut off, not only all his hopes, but
his only Prop and Support, and make
ſure of his own Deſtruction. <hi>Alonzo,</hi>
his Creature and Inſtrument, acts by his
inſtructions, and ſhares his Fate. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi>
furious Temper and impetuous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable
Paſſion, urge her to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
violences, and conclude at laſt
in a fatal miſtake. Thus every one's
own Wickedneſs or Miſcarriage deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
his Fate, without ſhedding any
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54591:128"/>
Malignity upon the Perſons and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of others. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> in reward
of his Virtue receives the Crowns of
<hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> and is happy in
his Love; all which he acknowledges
to be the Gift of Providence, which
protects the Innocent, and rewards the
Virtuous. <hi>Almeria,</hi> whoſe Virtues are
much of the ſame kind, and who Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiz'd
with him in his afflictions,
becomes a joynt Partner of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And <hi>Garcia,</hi> tho a Servant of the
Tyrant, and Son of the treacherous,
ambitious Stateſman, yet executing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Soveraigns lawful Commands,
and being untainted with his Fathers
guilt, and his Principles undebauch'd, is
receiv'd into <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s favour.</p>
            <p>All this as well as the <hi>Moral</hi> is ſumm'd

            <p>Theſe I think are all the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Tragedies, which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has by

our View of the Modern Tragedy
from that quarter, which he has alotted
to draw a Proſpect of it in, I ſhall
leave it to the Reader to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have raiſed the more beautiful
ſtructures. But if we can with theſe
Forces, which our Enemies have raiſed
for us, make head, and maintain our
ground againſt the united ſtrength of all

done, had we had the laſting, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing

            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:54591:129"/>
I ſhall only take notice of two or<note place="margin">Advantages of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns</hi> over the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> in the <hi>Morals</hi> of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> Providence not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to promote Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</note>
three things which are apparently the
indiſputable advantage of the <hi>Moderns</hi>
over the <hi>Antients,</hi> in reſpect of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Moral</hi> of their Fables.</p>
            <p>1ſt, That they never are at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a Machine to bring about a
wicked Deſign, and by conſequence
don't intereſt Providence in promoting
Villany; as the Antients have noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
done in many of their Plays;
of which number are the <hi>Electra</hi> of
<hi>Sophocles;</hi> the <hi>Electra, Oreſtes, Hippoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,

               </note> That they never engage Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to afflict and oppreſs Virtue, by
diſtreſſing it by ſupernatural means, as
the Antients have manifeſtly done, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their Gods the immediate Actors in
or directors of the misfortunes of virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, as in the <hi>Prometheus in Chains</hi>
of <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> the <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> the
<hi>Hippolytus</hi> and <hi>Hercules furens</hi> of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
the <hi>Oedipus</hi> and <hi>Hercules furens</hi>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54591:129"/>
the Moderns don't provide 'em
with a miraculous delivery, or have
recourſe to ſuch extraordinary Methods
as exceed the reach of Humane Force or
Cunning, ſo as to entitle Providence to the
Protection of 'em, which was the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Practice of the Antients; as in
the <hi>Electra</hi> of <hi>Sophocles;</hi> the <hi>Medea,</hi>
the <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> the <hi>Electra,</hi> and others
of <hi>Euripides;</hi>

            <p>From this ſhort review of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
conduct of the Antient and Modern
Tragedians, we may ſee with how much
more reſpect to Providence, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
adminiſtration, our Poets have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themſelves, than they; and how
far the Ballance of Religion inclines to
our ſide. I ſuppoſe no one can be ſo
ſilly, as to think, that I argue here for
the truth of their Faith, but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it in their reſpective perſwaſions,
in which the advantage is infinitely on
the ſide of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> of every Play is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly

they muſt be ſuited to the Mouth and
<hi>Character</hi> of the Perſon that ſpeaks 'em,

or wrong in the <hi>Poet's</hi> Judgment, but
what is natural, or unnatural for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſuch a <hi>Character</hi> upon ſuch an
occaſion to ſay, which he is to conſider,
and for which he is accountable only, as
well by the rules of <hi>Moral</hi> as <hi>Poetical</hi>
Juſtice. When therefore we find any
thing in Plays that ſounds amiſs, we
muſt examine whether it be proper to
the <hi>Character</hi> or not, before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the <hi>Poet,</hi> whom we may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
arraign as <hi>Mal a propos,</hi> as a Judge
wou'd the Kings Evidence, if he ſhou'd

            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> therefore being the main

               </gap>
'tis by the temper and diſpoſition of
that, that we are to feel the <hi>Poets</hi>
Pulſe, and find out his ſecret affections.
Not but that we may err ſometimes in
our Judgments of the <hi>Poet's Morals</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other hand. For 'tis poſſible, that the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54591:130"/>
               <hi>Poet's Morals</hi> may be very good, yet
the Man's ſtark naught, that is, that a
man may be a good <hi>Moral Poet,</hi> yet
a bad Man. So on the other hand we
may falſly meaſure his Manners by his
management, and impute to Malice and
Deſign thoſe faults, which flow from
want of Judgment or Indiſcretion. This
is hard meaſure, but ſuch as Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
has been very liberal of to the <hi>Poets.</hi>
It wou'd be a very uncharitable Error,
ſhou'd we at any time hear the ſacred
myſteries of our Faith poorly explained,
or weakly defended out of the Pulpit,
if we ſhou'd conclude, that the Preacher
played booty and betrayed the cauſe he
pretended to plead for: And I doubt
it wou'd fall heavy upon many, that
now paſs for honeſt and good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
I hope with juſtice, if their Faith
were to be meaſured by their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
and their Integrity by their parts.
But it wou'd be much more unjuſt to<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's</hi> a falſe, and perverſe Meaſure.</note>
rate all the reſt of their order by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Standard of a few. Yet thus
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> proceeds againſt thoſe, to
whom he thinks fit to oppoſe himſelf.
And yet even thus they wou'd not have
much occaſion to fear his malice, if he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54591:131"/>
wou'd proceed againſt 'em the proper
way, and not charge as their private
and real ſenſe, the Sentiments, which
they are obliged ſometimes to furniſh
Villains and Extravagants with in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to their Characters, while he
denies 'em the benefit of thoſe many
excellent and pious Reflections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in their works.</p>
            <p>Certainly had our Poets any ſuch
lewd Deſign of <hi>confounding the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
between Truth and Fiction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Fable</hi> the Engine of greateſt and moſt ſecret Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>P.</hi> 95.</note> 
               <hi>between
Majeſty and a Pageant;</hi> of <hi>treating God
like an Idol, and bantering, the Scriptures
like Homer's Elyſium</hi> and <hi>Heſiod's Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia,</hi>
it wou'd appear in the Fable,
which is the part, as we have obſerv'd,
that diſcovers moſt of the Poets proper
Opinion, and gives him the faireſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſtealing it artificially in,
and poys'ning the Audience moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
with leaſt Suſpicion. For tho
the Fable, if skilfully contriv'd, be the
Part which operates moſt powerfully,
yet it works after a manner leaſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
We feel the effects without ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cauſe, and are prejudiced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking after a reaſon. If the <hi>Poets</hi>
have any ſuch villanous Plot againſt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54591:131"/>
Virtue and Religion, they are certainly
the moſt negligent Fellows, or the moſt
unexperienced in the world to overlook
the only place of advantage upon the
whole Stage for their miſchievous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
where they might work their
Mines unmoleſted, and ſpring 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd
to moſt, and do the greateſt
execution with the leaſt alarm to the
Enemy. But they make War like <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and ſell their Enemies Ammunition
to ſpend upon themſelves. For all their
Fables are contriv'd and modell'd for
the ſervice of Virtue and Religion, and
levell'd againſt themſelves, if they be
ſuch <hi>great Enemies,</hi> and ſo <hi>remarkably
diſaffected,</hi> as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> ſays they are.
But perhaps he may, either thro mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
or malice, miſrepreſent the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and what was ſcoffingly ſaid by
the <hi>Turks</hi> to the <hi>Poles,</hi> may be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied to the caſe before us by both
Parties, that <hi>they did not know of any
War betwixt 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the management of the <hi>Fables</hi>

               </note> which, being the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,

            <p>Before I take leave of Tragedy upon

               </note> or favour of t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nor, tho I find moſt of the

<hi>Moral,</hi> do I charge 'em with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ining the Intereſt, or
leſſening the credit and eſteem of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The <hi>Moral</hi> and the <hi>Pathetic</hi> were
in their days diſtinct Branches of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
(as we have already obſerv'd
from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) of which their Poets in
all probability made choice, according to
the encouragement they obſerv'd 'em to
meet with. If therefore we find few

Moral Tragedy, as not thinking it worth
while to lay down rules for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that, which was no longer in
uſe, or eſteem amongſt his Countrymen
in his Time. Nor did this diſ-eſteem
of <hi>Moral</hi> Plays proceed from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
to, or Habit of Vice peculiar to
that Age, which might give 'em a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh
for Virtuous Entertainments. The
contrary of this is evident from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of thoſe Tragedies, which ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Athens,</hi> the Diſcourſe in which
is frequently Moral and Inſtructive, tho
the Fable it ſelf be not. But <hi>Moral</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
not admitting ſuch Incidents as
were proper to move Terrour or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
the Springs of Paſſion were

he produces to his own Rule, we
ſhall perhaps be induc'd to believe, that
he did not inſiſt upon a very rigorous
obſervation of it. For of his two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<hi>Oedipus</hi> was (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

down his Rule, he ſeems to indulge
a latitude in the obſervance, and to
juſtifie any Liberties, that may be

his <hi>Piety</hi> towards his Country, and

from Hiſtory or Tradition, and were
therefore more ſolicitous to make their

The Duping of an old Knave,
the cullying of a Coxcomb, the ſtealing
of an Heireſs from a Mercenary Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
are the uſual exploits of Comedy;
wherein tho Gentlemen are ſometimes
concerned, yet they are, or ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be ſuch, as have ſome blemiſh,
or other upon 'em, otherwiſe they are
not fit for the buſineſs they are engag'd
in. <hi>Comedy</hi> ſeems to be deſigned to
teach Men Civil Prudence, and a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Management in reſpect of one
another, rather than any thing of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and their private duty. There
their misfortunes and diſgraces are all
the immediate reſult of their own Folly
and Miſmanagement, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very well cauſe men to reflect upon
that want of Wit and Caution, which
cauſed themſelves or others to miſcarry,
and teach 'em to be more wary for the

Grace, or mend their Principles.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Comedy</hi> being ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,
thoſe Vices only fall under its

to be more naturally diſpoſed for the

but that Vice too may ſometimes be

then it muſt be join'd with, and wear

of pure Integrity to do with Intrigues
of any kind? He can't aſſiſt in the

without forfeiting his Character;
and to bring ſuch a Character upon
the Stage to be practic'd upon, is ſuch
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54591:137"/>
an outrage to Virtue, that the moſt

            <p>I grant that 'tis neither neceſſary,<note place="margin">Some Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to qualifie a Character for <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>

ſhou'd be vicious, that were to abuſe
mankind, with a ſcandalous repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But I maintain, that they ought all to
have ſome failing or Infirmity, to qualifie
'em for the buſineſs of the Place. Men of
Honour may be made uſe of to puniſh
Knaves, as Knaves to cure Fools, but
their honour ought not to be too ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced,
too ſqueamiſh and ſcrupulous.
They muſt be Perſons of ſome Liberty,
that out of an over-niceneſs will not
balk a well laid deſign, and ſpoil a
Project with too much honeſty. Men
of Hononr may be men of Pleaſure;
nay, and muſt be ſo too, or we do 'em
wrong to make 'em appear in ſuch
Company, as <hi>Comedy</hi> muſt bring 'em
into.</p>
            <p>What other natural occaſion can be
aſſigned for embroiling a Gentleman
of Quality,<note place="margin">Ne Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men but men of pleaſure ſit for Comedy.</note> with Uſurers, Pimps, Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

may all ſerve in their ſeveral capacities.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54591:137"/>
The Uſurer with his Wife, his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or his Money; the Pimp in his
Intrigues; the Jilt, the Sharper, and
the Bully in their reſpective Offices may
aſſiſt his Revenges, and be uſeful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
in thoſe deſigns, where 'tis not
proper for himſelf to appear. That
no Gentlemen but of this ſort ſhou'd
be brought upon the <hi>Comick</hi> Stage, I
think, is ſo plain, as well from <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi>
Definition, as from the Nature and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of the Place; that he that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
it forfeits all Pretence to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in theſe matters. I mean no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Wit and Senſe, but ſuch as
theſe. For Fools of what Quality
ſoever are the proper Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
of the Stage; they are the wrecks
of underſtanding, which Poets, as Lords
of the Mannor of Wit from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Preſcription, have an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
Title to, and may diſpoſe of, as
they ſee fit.</p>
            <p>A true <hi>Comick</hi> Poet like a good Droll
Painter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Comick</hi> Poetry and <hi>Droll</hi> Painting compar'd.</note> ought not to make his whole
Piece ridiculous, and conſequently
ought not to draw any Face that is ſo
regular, as not to have ſomething amiſs
either in Feature or Complextion. To
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54591:138"/>
put a Gentleman of ſound Senſe and
perfect Morals into <hi>Comedy,</hi> wou'd be
as unnatural, as to draw <hi>Cato</hi> dancing

It does not therefore follow, that none
but Rakes and Scoundrels muſt paſs
for Gentlemen in <hi>Comedy.</hi> A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Wit and Honour may be judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
introduced into it, but he muſt
be a man of wild unreclaim'd honour,
whoſe Appetites are ſtrong and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
enough, to hurry him beyond his
diſcretion, and make him act againſt
the Conviction of his Judgment on the
return of his Reaſon. Such a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
as this no more is unnatural, than
to ſee a drunken Gentleman frolicking
with the Mob, or kiſſing a Link-Boy.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more frequent than to
meet in our common Converſation,<note place="margin">Such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters real and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> and
affairs of Life, with Gentlemen of this
ſort, who, tho they may be Men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Parts, Temper, and Principles,
yet in the heat of their Blood, and Pride
of their Fortunes, are apt to be byaſſed
a little towards Extravagance, and not
to conſult the ſeverity of Reaſon, or
the exactneſs of Juſtice on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54591:138"/>
eſpecially in matters relating to
their Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>What therefore is ſo common and
obvious in the World, can't be unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
upon the Stage, but by uſing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly.
To put a Gentleman upon
the Office of a Villain or a Scoundrel,
or to make a Man of Senſe a Bubble
or a Cully in the Concluſion, is an
abuſe to the Character, and a treſpaſs
againſt the Laws of the <hi>Drama.</hi> If
therefore the Poet employs any of this
Character, he is obliged to give him
Succeſs, notwithſtanding the blemiſhes
of his Character. For, with all his
Faults, he is the beſt, as well as the moſt
conſiderable Perſon, that 'tis lawful for
him to make bold with. And if he is
at laſt brought to a Senſe of his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
and Errours, and a reſolution
of amendment, the Poet has exerted
his Authority to the utmoſt extent of
his Commiſſion; and the Laws of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
exact no more.</p>
            <p>Had Mr <hi>Collier</hi> known and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

or chief Perſons Licentious or
debauched they encourage Vice, and
Irreligion, and diſcourage Virtue.</p>
            <p>2dly. That the rich Citizens are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repreſented as Miſers and Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olds;
and the Univerſities as Schools
of Pedantry; and thereby Learning,
Induſtry and Frugality ridiculed.</p>

Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> whoſe buſineſs all thro his
Book is Invective, not Argument, lays
himſelf forth with all the Pomp of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Eloquence, and vehemence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
that he is able, to aggravate
the crime, and amplifie the guilt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
not to prove it. He is more ſollicitous
to poſſeſs his Reader, than convince him,
and for that reaſon lets ſlip the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of proof as not very material, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he found it wou'd tye him up to
ſtrict Argument, and cloſe Reaſoinng,
which is not for his purpoſe, and inſiſts
upon the General charge of Debauchery
and Impiety; which allowing him all the
Liberties of Declamation and Harangue,
give him ample Field-room to publiſh,
and diſplay his Parts, and his Malice
together; which he does moſt egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly,
and Flouriſhes moſt trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly.
Never did learned Recorder
inſult poor <hi>Culprit</hi> in more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Oratory, than he does the
Poets.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he offers ſeveral inſtances in
confirmation of his Aſſertion, which he
draws from divers of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comedies,
which, with the untoward gloſs he puts
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54591:140"/>
upon 'em, ſeem to favour his malicious
purpoſe. Theſe I ſhall conſider in their
proper places, as far as is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to our purpoſe, and leave the
farther juſtification of 'em to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
more immediately concerned,
who I ſuppoſe will not be wanting to
their own neceſſary defence.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore proceed to the<note place="margin">His firſt Article exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note>
examination of the main Branch of his
accuſation, contained in the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which is <hi>the neglect of Poetick Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
the encouraging of Vice with Succeſs,
and the Diſcouraging of Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole weight of this Objection
turns upon this hinge, that the <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi>
or chief Perſons in <hi>Comedy</hi> are
generally vicious and ſucceſsful, which he
pretends to be againſt the Law of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
which is to reward Virtue and
puniſh Vice. This objection, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
was ſtarted by Mr <hi>Dryden</hi> againſt
himſelf in his <hi>preface</hi> to his <hi>Mock-Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger.</hi>
But he objects againſt the anſwer,
which Mr <hi>Dryden</hi> there makes to it.
<hi>That he knows no ſuch Law conſtantly
obſerved in Comedy, either by the Antients
or Moderns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:54591:140"/>
This Mr <hi>Collier</hi> calls a <hi>lame Defence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This Rule repugnant to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Comedy.</hi>
               </note>
and I agree with him, tho we go upon
different grounds. For I think Mr <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
has clogg'd his anſwer with an
unneceſſary reſtriction, and by the over
Modeſty of it weakned the ſufficiency
of it. I grant, that the neglect, or
contempt of a Law, does by no means
deſtroy the Authority of it. But I ſhall
carry it ſomething farther, and ſay that
no ſuch Law ever was at all obſerv'd,
or ſo much as preſcrib'd to <hi>Comedy.</hi> Nor
do I herein truſt to the Strength of my
own Memory, or preſume upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
reach and extent of my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.
But I draw this Concluſion
from the nature of <hi>Comedy</hi> itſelf, which
will admit of no ſuch Rule in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
Mr <hi>Dryden</hi> propoſes, and Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
maintains it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comedy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon why.</note> which deals altogether in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule,
can take no cognizance of, and
give no correction to thoſe Vices and
Immoralities which it cannot expoſe on
that ſide. For this reaſon, the Sallies
of Youth, and the Licentiouſneſs of men
of Senſe and Fortune, unieſs they be
ſuch as bring their underſtandings into
queſtion, and make 'em ridiculous, how
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54591:141"/>
ever unjuſtifiable, immortal, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
they may be to ſober people, eſcape
the cenſure of <hi>Comedy,</hi> becauſe they
can't be tried in her way.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration it was,<note place="margin">Indulgence of <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> to vicious young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed by Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi> P. 149.</note> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> to indulge
their Young Men ſo far as they did,
and afford ſo many inſtance of Favour
to vicious young people, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
allows they did. He is miſtaken, when
he fancies, <hi>that</hi> becauſe <hi>thoſe Poets</hi> had
<hi>a greater compaſs of Liberty in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and that <hi>Debauchery did not lie
under thoſe diſcouragements of Penalty
and Scandal with them, as it does with
us;</hi> therefore their Poets indulg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in thoſe Liberties, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they durſt not have taken. <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Terence,</hi> eſpecially the latter,
were nice Obſervers of Mankind, and
greater Maſters of their own Art, than
to take an Improper Liberty, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'twas not dangerous. But their
Religion, falſe as it was, and the Laws
of their Country, which were very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
at <hi>Rome</hi> in this caſe, requir'd ſtrict
Morality, and Regularity of Life. If
therefore they had ſuſpected, that theſe
Indulgences had tended any ways to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54591:141"/>
Debauching of their Youth, and the
Corrupting of their Manners, they durſt
not have ventur'd 'em into publick view.
Nor wou'd their Magiſtrates, to whoſe
Cenſure they were particularly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
have ſuffer'd examples of ſuch ill
conſequence to have been produc'd
openly. Beſides, <hi>Cato,</hi> whoſe Virtue
was as ſowre and auſtere, and perhaps
as great as Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s, was a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager
of 'em, which 'tis non proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
wou'd have been, had he ſmelt any
ſuch dangerous Plot in 'em. So that
the Authority of theſe <hi>Precedents</hi> may
ſtand, and be of ſervice, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wide difference betwixt <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s
Opinion to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> have taken
no ſuch unjuſtifiable liberties,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> faithful Copyers from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
They have copyed faithfully
from Nature, and their Draughts come
incomparably near the Life. No out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is done to the Original, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
or contracting the Features, in
order to entertain the Audience with
Monſters of Dwarfs, but Humane Life
is depicted in its true and juſt Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If therefore the Images, which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54591:142"/>
their Plays reflect, diſpleaſe any froward
<hi>Cynic,</hi> the Fault is in the Face, not the
Glaſs which gives a true repreſentation;
and he quarrels with Providence, whoſe
Creature Mankind is, if he diſlikes the
fight. Any liberties therefore, which
theſe Poets have taken, wherein Nature
is not wrong'd, deſcend undoubtedly
to all thoſe that ſucceed 'em upon the
<hi>Comick</hi> Stage, who have a right to all
the Priviledges of their Predeceſſors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame terms.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> made their
young fellows, as Nature frequently
does, wild and extravagant; at which
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> is ſcandaliz'd, and appeals
from their Judgment to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Opinion of <hi>Horace</hi> enquir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>P.</hi> 149.</note> who (<hi>he ſays</hi>) was as good a

<hi>Let us ſee how far the Precept of</hi>
Horace <hi>for the drawing of youth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
differs from the Practice of thoſe</hi>
Comedians. Horace <hi>tells us,</hi> that the

Horſes, (<hi>and Whores too, as appears by
the ſequel of his Character</hi>) that he is

of the Species, ſuch as a true Idea
of the Generality cannot be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
tho perhaps ſome Individuals may
be met with, that want it. Upon this
rule let Mr <hi>Collier</hi> arraign theſe Authors
if he can. For tho they wrote before
<hi>Horace,</hi> and conſequently can't plead his
Precept in their defence, yet the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

            <p>This teſtimony of <hi>Horace</hi> is full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Mr <hi>Collier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chorus <hi>in</hi> Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> and a plain argument
that he never intended his directions for
a <hi>Chorus</hi> for the uſe of <hi>Comedy.</hi> The
<hi>Chorus</hi> in the <hi>Old Comedy</hi> had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
freedom of Speech, and took the
boldeſt liberties of any part of the Play,
and conſequently gave the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and ſtood moſt in need of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
And <hi>Horace</hi> ſeems to inſinuate,
that the <hi>Chorus</hi> was not only ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
offenſive, but that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54591:146"/>
filenc'd by Law, when he
ſays,
<q>
                  <l>—Lex eſt accepta, Choruſque</l>
                  <l>Turpiter obticuit, ſublato jure nocendi.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As if the whole Buſineſs of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in <hi>Comedy</hi> had been Scandal, and
the Law levell'd againſt the <hi>Chorus</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The event juſtifies this Expoſition;
For after the Publication of the Laws
againſt the Liberty of Scandal, which
was grown ſo rampant in the <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi>
the <hi>Chorus</hi> vaniſh'd and appear'd
no more upon the <hi>Athenian</hi> Stage in
<hi>Comedy,</hi> that we know of.</p>

of Fact. <hi>For</hi> Ariſtophanes <hi>his</hi> Plutus
<hi>is</hi> New Comedy <hi>with a</hi> Chorus <hi>in't.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Aſſertion there are two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,<note place="margin">Double mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of Mr <hi>Collier.</hi>
               </note>
which being Critical ones, I
don't much wonder at, becauſe they
contribute towards making the Book
Uniform, and preſerve the Integrity
of the Piece. Yet he building with ſo
much aſſurance upon 'em, 'twill be but
Charity to let him ſee, that his Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is too weak to ſupport the weight
of the ſuperſtructure he has laid upon
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54591:146"/>
The firſt of theſe is, that the <hi>Plutus</hi>
of <hi>Ariſtphanes</hi> is not <hi>New Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. That in the <hi>Plutus,</hi> there is
no <hi>Chorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned (whom I ſuppoſe Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> means by <hi>they</hi>) divided the <hi>Greek
Comedy</hi> into the three <hi>Claſſes,</hi> the <hi>Old,</hi> the
<hi>Middle,</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> not to mention
that the <hi>Old Comedy</hi> it ſelf is ſubdivided
into two Ages; the latter of which
commences with <hi>Cratinus,</hi> who firſt
diſtinguiſht the Parts, diſpoſed the Acts,
and fixt the number of Actors; and
comprehends <hi>Eupolis, Ariſtophaenes,</hi> and
the reſt of the Comick Poets till the
concluſion of the Popular Authority,
and the beginning of the Oligarehy,
from which time to the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
that which is now called the
<hi>Middle Comedy</hi> flouriſhed, till <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the Poets of his time, <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Diphilus, Apollodorus,</hi> and others,
quite altered the Face of the <hi>Comick
Stage,</hi> and introduc'd that which is
now call'd the <hi>New Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Divifion, which is both juſt,<note place="margin">By this the <hi>Plutus Old</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note>
and accurate, the <hi>Plutus</hi> falls to the
ſhare of the <hi>Old Comedy;</hi> to which,
notwithſtanding the deviations therein
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54591:147"/>
from the former Practice of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi>
it does moſt properly belong. But if
Mr <hi>Collier</hi> will have the <hi>Plutus</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes</hi>
to be the firſt ſtep towards the
Reformation of <hi>Comedy</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> I
ſhall not much diſpute the matter with
him. Becauſe he has in that abridged
himſelf of much of that Liberty, which
he has uſed in his former Plays. But
granting even this, <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> can at
moſt but lead up the Van of the
<hi>Middle Comedy;</hi> and is very far diſtanc'd
by the <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> has in ſome
meaſure altered his Conduct in his <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

yet he retains abſolutely the Form
and ſtamp of the <hi>Old Comedy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenches
only ſome offenſive Liberties.
The Fable of the old <hi>Comedy</hi> was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Chimerical, and the Characters
Romantick and Whimſical, neither of
'em drawn from the Obſervation of
Nature, or the buſineſs of Humane
Life, but pumpt out of the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of the <hi>Poets</hi> Brain. The Spirit
of theſe Entertainments conſiſted in the
Piquancy of the Raillery and Jeſts,
and the boldneſs of the Scandal, in
which they took exceſſive Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54591:147"/>
with particular Perſons, eſpecially
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and to which the ſucceſs

               <hi>Cratinus</hi> is
ſaid to have been very bold, and to
have taxed people freely by their names,
without miucing the matter, (I had
almoſt ſaid without Fear or Wit) and
charged them with all ſorts of Crimes,
without reſpect to Perſons. <hi>Eupolis</hi>
was ſomewhat more diſcreet, couching
real Crimes and Perſons under ſham
Names, and laſhing his Fellow Citizens
on the backs of feigned Offenders.
<hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> was frequently no leſs plain
than <hi>Cratinus</hi> in reſpect to Names, but
his Wit was of another ſort, leſs Sullen
and Chagrine. He turned all into Jeſt,
and bantered thoſe things, which the
others reprehended after a manner more
ſerious and ſevere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menander</hi> and the <hi>New Comedians</hi>
formed their Models after a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>New</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy how differing from the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </note> For having particularly
Scandal, which had given ſo much
Offence in the <hi>Old Comedy,</hi> they began
to furniſh themſelves from Obſervation
and Experience, rather than Invention,
and to employ their Judgments more
than their Fancies. They raiſed the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54591:148"/>
ſtructure of their Plays upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Nature, and made the Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
of the World, and the common
Affairs of Life the Subjects of 'em, and
the different orders of Mankind. A
hard Father, a difficult Maſter, a wild
Son, a crafty Servant, an impudent
Pandar, a Mercenary Courtezan, and
a Captive Virgin, were the moſt uſual
Characters; which being oppoſite to,
and concerned with one another, ſet
the Plot naturally to work, and give
occaſion to ſet all the Wheels of the
Machine a going.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to give us an Idea
of the difference between the <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>
and the <hi>New,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutus <hi>not</hi> New <hi>Comedy.</hi>
               </note> and to convince us
that the <hi>Plutus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> which
deals altogether in unaccountable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and ſurprizing Events, and works
by Unnatural Machines to a Chimerical,
Romantick end, is not <hi>New Comedy;</hi>
tho the Poet contrary to his Cuſtom
makes uſe of Feigned Names, and lays
aſide the <hi>Chorus.</hi> For tho theſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
be here made in <hi>Comedy,</hi> yet
both the matter and the Form (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conſiſted the main difference between
the <hi>Old Comedy</hi> and the <hi>New</hi>) remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54591:148"/>
ſtill the ſame with the reſt of his
Plays, it can by no means be admitted
into the <hi>New,</hi> both matter and form
of which were different, if not directly
oppoſite to the former.<note place="margin">Satire of the <hi>Old</hi> Comedy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Of the <hi>New</hi> general.</note> For in the <hi>Old
Comedy</hi> they proceeded from Generals
that were Chimerical and falſe, to argue
particulars that were real and true. In the
<hi>New</hi> from Particulars that were imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and falſe, they reprehended Generals
that were real. The <hi>Old Comick Poets</hi>
generally deviſed ſome extravagant and
unnatural, or at leaſt improbable tale,
into which they took occaſion to thruſt
particular Facts and Perſons that were
real, and well known. The <hi>New</hi> made
uſe of ſuch Intrigues and Perſons as
were frequent and familiar amongſt
Mankind, and thereby corrected the
common Faults, ſuch as Avarice, Fraud,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but copyed neither the Actions,
nor Manners of Individuals; and ſo
reflected not particularly upon any
One. The firſt reſembled a Limner,
that cou'd copy the Features of a Face,
but cou'd only draw Individuals like, ye
cou'd not deſign; the latter a true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Painter, that aim'd rather at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the Manners, and Paſſions
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54591:149"/>
of Mankind than the countenances.
In whoſe pieces you ſhou'd not amongſt
a Thouſand meet one Face, that you
diſtinctly knew, yet none but what
were natural and ſignificant, and ſuch
as you muſt acknowledge you ſaw
every day. The difference therefore
betwixt the <hi>Old Comedy</hi> and the <hi>New</hi>
is as great and evident, as betwixt the
Paintings of <hi>Raphael <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> or <hi>Michael
Angelo,</hi> and thoſe of Sir <hi>Anthony Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike,</hi>

of <hi>Phraſe</hi> and <hi>Metre,</hi> thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

            <p>However,<note place="margin">Arisſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes the Bgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Middle</hi> Comedy.</note> as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> has in this

from the Practice of the reſt of the
<hi>Old Comedians,</hi> and of himſelf in his
former Pieces, he ſeems to challenge
the firſt place in the <hi>Middle Comedy,</hi>
which the Learned have found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to diſtinguiſh both from the
<hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New.</hi> Becauſe ſeveral al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
were made in <hi>Comedy,</hi> of
which perhaps the Omiſſion of the
<hi>Chorus</hi> was none of the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet neither the Model or Deſign
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54591:149"/>
were totally changed till the time
of <hi>Menander,</hi> and his Cotemporaries.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s ſecond miſtake in relation
to the <hi>Plutus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>No</hi> Chorus <hi>in the</hi> Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> 
               <hi>that it
has a Chorus in't.</hi> If he means that there
is a part in this Play, which is ſuſtained
by a <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> under the name
of <hi>Chorus,</hi> Matter of Fact is directly
for him: But if he thinks that there is
any ſuch thing as a true <hi>Chorus</hi> in it, it
is as plain againſt him. This matter will
eaſily be decided, if we conſider the
Nature, and Office of a <hi>Chorus</hi> in the
<hi>Old Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chorus</hi> in <hi>Comedy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Office of the <hi>Chorus</hi> in <hi>Comedy.</hi>
               </note> was a Perſon
conſiſting of divers, either Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or both, and aſſiſted in two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.
One as an Actor, or Party
concern'd to promote and carry on the
main deſign, and help forward the
Action of the Play, which is common
to the <hi>Chorus</hi> with the other Actors,
and does not diſtinguiſh it from 'em.
The other, as the <hi>Poet</hi>'s Repreſentative,
to make the <hi>Parabaſes,</hi> or Tranſitions
from the Actors, (with whom only as
an Actor the <hi>Chorus</hi> is concern'd) to
the <hi>Gods,</hi> or to the <hi>Audience.</hi> To the
<hi>Gods,</hi> to invoke their Aid, or celebrate
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54591:150"/>
their Praiſes, as the occaſion ſuggeſted.
To the <hi>Audience,</hi> to inform 'em of
what was ſuppos'd to paſs <hi>extra Scenam</hi>
behind the Scenes, to make the Action
of the Play entire, or to make reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on what paſs'd upon the Stage for
the Inſtruction of the Audience, and to
tax the evil Practices of ſuch Citizens,
as were obnoxious to the <hi>Poet,</hi> and
the Publick. This was the part by
which it at leaſt gave offence, by the
diſorderly liberties which it took; and
ſometimes to acquaint the Audience
with the Poet's hopes and fears, his
acknowledgments and complaints, which
laſt part of the buſineſs of the <hi>Chorus</hi>
is anſwer'd by the <hi>Prologue</hi> among the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble the Reader with
the <hi>Grammatical</hi> diviſion of the parts of
the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The parts Eſſential to a <hi>Chorus</hi> omitted in the flutus.</note> (<hi>viz.) Ode, Antode, Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,</hi>
and <hi>Antiſtrophe,</hi> &amp;c. which ſignify
nothing to the point before us. But I
ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice
that in the <hi>Plutus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> this
part which alone conſtitutes the Office,
and Buſineſs of a <hi>Chorus,</hi> and which
only diſtinguiſhes it from a common
Actor is entirely omitted. The <hi>Chorus</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:54591:150"/>
in this Play appears but as an ordinary
Actor, and addreſſes itſelf to the other
Actors only, comes on, and goes off
without once ſinging or ſpeaking apart
from the reſt. The <hi>Chorus</hi> therefore,
as it is called, in this Play might more
properly have been perſonated by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
man, and called by any other name,
ſince it performs nothing of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation of this defect of the

               <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> think, that
this Play had been caſtrated, and that
the <hi>Chorus</hi> (which he confeſſes to be
wanting) was not omitted, but taken
away ſince the writing of it. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſuſpects, taken
out after it was finiſh'd, or omitted in
the writing, is not very material; 'tis
plain we have it not, and 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that 'twas the Author's own fear of

want of which caution in his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
coſt <hi>Cratinus</hi> his Life. For had the
<hi>Chorus</hi> of the <hi>Plutus</hi> ever been made
publick, I ſee no reaſon why that, as
well as the reſt of his <hi>Chori,</hi> ſhould not
have been tranſmitted to us. I would
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54591:151"/>
adviſe Mr <hi>Collier</hi> in the next <hi>Greek</hi> Play
he cites, to read farther than the Liſt
of the Perſons of the <hi>Drama.</hi> For 'tis
apparently negligence, that has led him
into this Errour, and made him think,
that becauſe he found a <hi>Chorus</hi> there, it
muſt needs be in the Play, which he
would not have allow'd to be a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<hi>Chorus,</hi> had he read the Play, and
known the buſineſs of a <hi>Chorus.</hi> 'Tis
yet in his Election which excuſe ſhall
ſtand for him.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Inſtances therefore ſignifies
nothing to his Argument, becauſe it
does not prove a <hi>Chorus</hi> conſiſtent with
the <hi>New Comedy.</hi>

it has no <hi>Chorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, I ſuppoſe, we may lay the

            <p>We ſhall not trouble the Reader with

the firſt ſteps towards the reducing

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54591:152"/>
in the dark, and the marks of 'em too
far obliterated to be trac'd backwards,
through publick neglect, that 'twas
long e're it came to be Acted at

               </note> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> according to his uſual
Method, is very conciſe, and does not
make one ſtep out of his way to gratifie
any Curioſity, which he foreſaw that
ſome of his Readers might have. But
Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> who reaſons after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
very different from the Philoſopher,
wou'd lead him a Wild Gooſe Chaſe
quite out of his road, to tell when the
<hi>Chorus</hi> in <hi>Comedy</hi> was ſilenc'd, tho 'twas
nothing to his purpoſe, and a long way
from his Text; or force him to confeſs
againſt his Conſcience that he knows
nothing of the matter. But <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
who was a better Judge than Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
of what was proper and neceſſary to
his ſubject, reſerves this point to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54591:153"/>
occaſion, and in the preceding
Chapter reprimands the unſeaſonable
Curioſity and Impatience of thoſe,<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> that
require deciſions out of Time and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Which had Mr <hi>Collier</hi> carefully
read, this Argument probably had been
ſuppreſs'd.</p>
            <p>However,<note place="margin">A parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> but loſt.</note> to oblige him with a little
ſcratching where it itches, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to take notice, that at that
time <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had actually written, or
deſign'd at leaſt to write another Book
concerning <hi>Comedy</hi> in particular, and
therefore prudently forbore to uſe thoſe
Materials here, which he knew wou'd
be more ſerviceable in another place.
This Book has been long loſt, and
therefore there lies no Appeal to it on
this occaſion. Yet becauſe he has ſuch
a mind to make <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> the Father
of the <hi>New</hi> Comedy, we'll ſtretch a
point farther than we are bound by the
Laws of <hi>Polemicks;</hi> and to ſhew that
we are fair Adverſaries, point him out
a Play, that may perhaps ſerve his turn
ſomewhat better than the <hi>Plutus.</hi> The
<hi>Cocalus,</hi> one of the laſt Plays of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>
which is loſt, is ſaid by ſome
learned men to have been the Model,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54591:153"/>
which <hi>Menander</hi> copyed exactly, and
took his deſign of the <hi>New</hi> Comedy
from. If this be true, <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> may
in ſome ſenſe claim the <hi>New</hi> Comedy
as his Iſſue. But then Mr <hi>Collier</hi> muſt
not ſay a word more of the <hi>Chorus.</hi> For
'tis certain that <hi>Menander</hi> uſed none,
and very probable, that the <hi>Cocalus</hi>
had none neither, if that were his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</p>
            <p>By this it may appear,<note place="margin">Chorus <hi>not uſed in the</hi> New Comedy.</note> that whether
a <hi>Chorus</hi> be conſiſtent with <hi>New Comedy</hi>
or not, it was not uſed in it by the
<hi>Antients.</hi> Nor was it indeed fit to be
uſed according to the liberties of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes.</hi>
And we may conclude from
the practice of all Ages and Nations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince, that they thought thoſe Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
eſſential to the <hi>Chorus</hi> of <hi>Comedy,</hi>
when they choſe rather to lay it wholly
aſide than to reform it. If <hi>Moliere</hi> has,
after two thouſand years diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
ventur'd to bring a Chorus again
upon the <hi>Comick</hi> Stage, I don't find that
his performances of that kind have any
extraordinary effect, or that they ſtir
up many Imitators to follow his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Moliere</hi> was arrived at the ſecond
Infancy of his <hi>Poetry,</hi> and might want
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54591:154"/>
theſe helps to keep his Plays upon their
Legs, which by the firſt <hi>Comick Poets</hi>
were made uſe of to teach theirs to go
upright. His more vigorous producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſcorn'd thoſe Crutches, which the
Iſſue of his old Age, that brings the
Infirmities of its Parent along with it
into the world, is forc'd to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to for its ſupport.</p>
            <p>But to what end wou'd Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
introduce the <hi>Chorus</hi> into the <hi>Engliſh
Comedy?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chorus</hi> altogether improper for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi> Stage in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>

well or better perform'd by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

be by a <hi>Chorus.</hi> The main buſineſs of a
<hi>Chorus</hi> is cut off by our Religion, and the
reſt render'd uſeleſs and unneceſſary, by
the method and diſpoſition of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
Something like it we have ſtill
in uſe, tho not in our <hi>Theatres,</hi> yet at

concern'd, and talks to the purpoſe like
one of them. This is exactly the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a <hi>Chorus,</hi> and therefore I don't
ſee why the fellow that diſcharges it
mayn't wear the Title; except it be,
that the Authors of that ſort of <hi>Drama,</hi>
are generally too illiterate to know
from whence they originally fetcht their
Precedent. Here is nothing of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a <hi>Chorus</hi> omitted, except the <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

as we have already obſerv'd, are all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better ſupply'd otherwiſe, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconſiſtent with our Religion
and Stage.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi> indeed ſeems to aſſign the
<hi>Chorus</hi> another Office.<note place="margin">Function aſſigned the <hi>Chorus</hi> by Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
               </note> He wou'd have
it to be a ſort of <hi>Monitor,</hi> or <hi>Chaplain</hi>
to the Play, to preach to the Audience,
and correct the Diſorders of the Stage.
This is a new Function, for which I
doubt he can produce no warrant from
<hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> or Precedent from <hi>Moliere.</hi>
'Tis an Office of his own creating, and
therefore he wou'd do well to execute
it a while himſelf, to inſtruct the <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and teach 'em the knack of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in which they are yet unexer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54591:155"/>
But all this Torrent of Miſreaſoning
and falſe Rhetorick flows from one
Spring,<note place="margin">Original Errour of Mr <hi>Collier.</hi>
               </note> one Original Error has branch'd
itſelf out thus amply. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> knows,
that <hi>the buſineſs of</hi> Comedy <hi>is to inſtruct
by example;</hi> and he miſtakenly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
that theſe ought to be Examples
for Imitation. Whereas, if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the nature of <hi>Comedy,</hi> he will find
juſt the reverſe of this fancy to be true.
For, as we have already taken notice,
it can employ no perfectly upright
Characters, and conſequently can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no Examples, but for Caution.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>Comedy</hi> therefore to be thought
imperfect,<note place="margin">Looſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in Comedy no Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</note> any more than the Law,
which makes no other proviſion for
the encouragement of Virtue and good
Actions, than by puniſhing Vice and
Villany. What Mr <hi>Collier</hi> objects in
this caſe is groundleſs, that the Poets,
by dreſſing up an imperfect, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
Character, with the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Wit and Senſe, and other
good Qualities, and crowning it with
Succeſs at laſt, pave the way to Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
and Debauchery. For, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Poet brings ſuch a Character
to a ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mn Reſolution of Reforming at

laſt, or not, which yet they generally
do, 'tis evident, that the ſucceſs which
attends it, is not given to the Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
but to the Wit and Senſe, or
other good Qualities, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
in the Character. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that can take Succeſs ſo beſtow'd,
and circumſtantiated as it is uſually in
<hi>Comedy,</hi> for an encouragement to Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
muſt have a very deprav'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Collier</hi> is implacably enrag'd
at the <hi>Poets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ridiculous Fear if Mr <hi>Collier.</hi>

Fellow ſhou'd ſee a <hi>Beau</hi> in all his
Glory with dirty Shoes, and ſhou'd
fancy that he made that ſplendid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
purely by virtue of the dirt upon
his Shoes, and reſolve never to have
his own clean'd again. A fine Face,
with a caſt of the Eyes, may move the
<hi>Beau</hi>'s and the Ladies to wiſh for ſuch
Features, and ſuch a Complexion, yet
it wou'd ſcarce win 'em to endeavour
to ſquint like it. Whatever Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:54591:156"/>
may think, the Underſtanding of our
Youth is not ſo very depreſs'd and low,
but they can very readily diſtinguiſh
between the obvious Beauties, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of a Character, and are not to be
fool'd like <hi>Dottrels</hi> into a vicious Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
If a Man ſhou'd know a <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket</hi>
that was an excellent Accountant,

incomparable Writing-maſter, it were
very eaſie, and very commendable, for
any one to imitate their good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without receiving any taint or
impreſſion from their Rogueries.</p>
            <p>However, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> obſerves abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Licentiouſneſs and Impurity
in the world,<note place="margin">Theatres wrongfully accuſed by him.</note> and is reſolv'd to lay it
all at the doors of the Theatres. He
ſees up and down a great number of
figures like thoſe that are expos'd upon
the Stage, and he wiſely concludes,
that the Models muſt needs be taken
from thence, and that theſe men are
but the Players apes, which is directly
contrary to the Truth. For theſe are
the Originals, of which thoſe upon the
Stage are but the Copies, the Images,
which that, like a Glaſs, reflects back

preſerve Decency, and to aſſign a proper
Fate and Behaviour to every <hi>Character.</hi>
Now if <hi>Horace</hi> wou'd have his <hi>Poet</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by the Maxims of Morality, he
muſt oblige him to Sobriety of Conduct,

            <p>To try the validity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Mr <hi>Collier</hi> links this advice of <hi>Horace</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to his account of the Riſe and
Progreſs of <hi>Comedy;</hi> and that he may
appropriate it ſolely to <hi>Comedy,</hi> skips

not ſerve his turn. For <hi>Horace</hi> in this

ſatisfy demands of this nature. He did

their <hi>Characters</hi> up to ſevere duty,
and make every one act up to the ſtrict
Rules of Morality, and be guided by
the dictates of right Reaſon and Juſtice,
or otherwiſe to puniſh 'em always in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54591:158"/>
proportion to the Deviations they made
from 'em, as Mr <hi>Collier</hi> inſinuates. All
that he requir'd was, that a Poet ſhou'd
know how it became the ſeveral orders
of men to behave themſelves in civil
Societies, according to their reſpective
Ranks, Degrees, and Qualities; that
they might thereby be qualify'd to give
diſtinct Images of every kind, whether
good or bad, without mixing of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
or confounding Ideas. <hi>Rectum

tho an imperfect one, of <hi>Poetical Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
I ſhall give it the Reader in his
own words. And becauſe 'tis the only
Statute Law of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> by which the
Poets can fairly be tried for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour,
either of Character or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
I ſhall ſupply the Defects or
Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s report of it from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
who is more full and clear.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Poetical Manners</hi>
               </note> in the Language of Poetry,
<hi>is a propriety of Actions and Perſons.</hi>
To ſucceed in this buſineſs there muſt be

               <hi>Sex, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
And nothing put into the mouths of
Perſons, which diſagrees with any of theſe
circumſtances. 'Tis not enough to ſay a
witty thing, unleſs it be ſpoken by a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Perſon, and upon a proper occaſion.</p>
            <p>In this account I obſerve many
things deficient,<note place="margin">Def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which I ſhall firſt take notice of, and
then proceed to ſupply the Defects. The
three things, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> recommends to
a <hi>Poet's,</hi> or <hi>Reader's</hi> careful obſervation,
and regard, are <hi>Age, Sex, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Of theſe, the firſt and the laſt,
<hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> are equivocal terms.
The Author has not taken care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
whether he means by <hi>Age,</hi> the
Age of a <hi>Perſon,</hi> or the Age of the
<hi>World,</hi> which he is ſuppos'd to live in.
For to both theſe great regard is to be
had, becauſe they difference the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
equally. A noble <hi>Roman</hi> of
four and twenty in the firſt Ages of
the Commonwealth, was no more like
one of the ſame Age under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
in humour and inclinations, than
either of 'em was like his Grandfather
of Fourſcore. As great, or greater is
the Ambiguity of the word <hi>Condition,</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:54591:159"/>
whereby he has not ſignify'd whether
he means Condition, as to <hi>Eſtate, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> or <hi>Circumſtances,
as to the Action of the Play, at the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
when the perſon does or ſays any
thing.</hi> Yet theſe have all an equal ſhare
in the propriety both of Words and
Actions, and ought to be conſider'd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the Manners can never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in their Propriety and Integrity.
But by ſupplying the Defects of this
Account, we ſhall remedy the danger
of miſtakes from the equivocal Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
contained in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires four conditions to

above-cited, relates to this particular
Condition only, yet is both defective

very full upon this, and takes care to
deſcribe at large the different humours
of man in the ſeveral Stages of his Life.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54591:160"/>
The ſame he does to the ſeveral orders
and degrees of men, according to their
reſpective Capacities, either Natural or
Political, and gives the Poets a great
Charge not to confound 'em. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his words upon this occaſion wou'd
be tedious, upon the ſcore of length.
However, I ſhall endeavour to give the
Reader as good an <hi>Idea</hi> of this <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Propriety,<note place="margin">Wherein it conſiſts.</note> as the narrow compaſs
I am oblig'd to will permit. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of <hi>Manners</hi> conſiſts in an exact
conformity both of words and actions
to the ſuppoſed <hi>Age</hi> both of the perſon
and the world, to the <hi>Humour, Fortune,
Quality, Underſtanding,</hi> and preſent
<hi>Condition,</hi> as to the buſineſs of the Play,
of the perſon acting or ſpeaking. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
as well as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> has expreſs'd all
this in one word, <hi>Convenientia,</hi> both
which I have render'd <hi>Proper.</hi> This
place does not afford me room for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

I ſhall deſire the Reader's patience, till
the Subject calls for 'em in their proper
places.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That they be like.</p>
            <p>This Condition relates only to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>

Traditions very well known. When
the <hi>Poet</hi> makes uſe of Names, or Stories

the Audience, who will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

            <p>Upon theſe Rules we may proceed to

               <note place="margin">Faults of <hi>Characters</hi> what.</note> or ſeparately by themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions</hi> have
ſuch a natural dependance upon one
another, that they can't be examin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
each being juſtifiable or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

ways; <hi>firſt,</hi> by being unnatural, and

are likewiſe two ways diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
by the <hi>Actions,</hi> and by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi>
when any thing is done, or
ſaid unnatural, or improper, a Fault is
committed againſt <hi>Character,</hi> which is
thereby broken, and becomes double.</p>
            <p>The Faults of Expreſſion are as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            <p>Mr <hi>Collier</hi> might unqueſtionably have

To all theſe I ſhall ſay ſomething ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
with regard to the Argument,
without entring into a diſcuſſion of the
Merits of thoſe particular Inſtances
which he brings to back his Aſſertions.
Not but I think many of 'em eaſily to
be Apologiz'd for, or rather to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd;
but becauſe it would ſpin out
this diſcourſe to an unreaſonable length,
and likewiſe becauſe there are thoſe
whoſe Abilities in this diſpute are as
much greater than mine, as their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in it, to whom I leave it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poets (ſays Mr</hi> Collier) make <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
ſpeak ſmuttily.<note place="margin">P. 8, 9, 12.</note> 
               <hi>They</hi> bring 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch misbehaviour, as is violence to
their Native Modeſty, and a miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Sex. For Modeſty, as Mr
<hi>Rapin</hi> obſerves, is the Character of Women.
They repreſent their ſingle Ladies, and
perſons of Condition, under theſe diſorders
of Liberty. This makes the Irregularity
ſtill more monſtrous, and a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to Nature and Probability.</p>
            <p>Here again,<note place="margin">This point miſtaken.</note> according to his uſual
method, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> miſtakes his point,
and runs away with a wrong ſcent;
however he opens, and cries it luſtily
away, that the Muſick may atone for
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54591:163"/>
the miſtake, and draw all thoſe that are
not ſtanch in Partners to his Error.
Mr <hi>Rapin obſerves that the Character of
Women is Modeſty,</hi> and therefore Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
thinks, that no <hi>Woman</hi> muſt be
ſhewn without it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has given
<hi>Courage</hi> or <hi>Valour</hi> as the <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> or
Mark of diſtinction proper to the other
<hi>Sex,</hi> which was a notion ſo <hi>Antient,</hi>
and ſo univerſally receiv'd, that moſt
Nations have given it a denomination
from the Sex, as if peculiar to it. The
<hi>Greeks</hi> call'd it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we <hi>Manhood.</hi>
Yet 'tis no Soleciſm in <hi>Poetical Manners</hi>
to repreſent Men ſometimes upon the
Stage as Cowards; nor did any man
ever think the whole Sex affronted by
it; how near ſoever it might touch
ſome Individuals.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Poets</hi> ſet up theſe Women of
Liberty for the Repreſentatives of their
whole Sex,<note place="margin">Faults of <hi>particular</hi> no reflection upon the <hi>Sex</hi> in <hi>General.</hi>
               </note> or pretended to make them
the Standards to meaſure all the reſt by,
the Sex wou'd have juſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of ſo abuſive a Miſrepreſentation.
But 'tis juſt the contrary, the Sex has no
Intereſt in the Virtues or Vices of any
Individual, either on the Stage, or off
of it; they reflect no honour or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54591:164"/>
on the Collective Body, any more
than the Neatneſs and good Breeding
of the <hi>Court</hi> affect the Naſtineſs and ill

            <p>In Plays the <hi>Characters</hi> are neither

               <note place="margin">Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals <hi>and</hi> Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</note> Marks ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
are the Impreſſes and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Nature, which are not to be
corrected, or improv'd by us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be meddled with. Beſides,
they give us no Idea of the perſon
characteriz'd, but what is common
to the reſt of the ſpecies, and do
not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh him. Neither
are they ſo <hi>Singular,</hi> as to extend no
farther than ſingle <hi>Individuals. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>
of ſo narrow a Compaſs wou'd
be of very little uſe, or diverſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they wou'd not appear natural,
the Originals being probably unknown
to the greateſt part, if not the whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
nor cou'd any of the Audience
ſind any thing to correct in themſelves
by ſeeing the Infirmity peculiar to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man expos'd. This was indeed
the method of the <hi>Old Greek Comedy;</hi>
but then they pick'd out publick perſons,
whom they dreſs'd in Fools Coats and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54591:164"/>
expos'd upon the Stage, not in their
own own Shapes, but thoſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's
Fancy; an Inſolence, that never

Popular Government, where the beſt

            <p>The <hi>Characters</hi> therefore muſt neither
be too general,<note place="margin">What Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</note> nor too ſingular, one
loſes the diſtinction, the other
makes it monſtrous, we are too familiar
with that to take notice of it, and too
unacquainted with this to acknowledge
it to be real. But betwixt theſe there
is an almoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> infinite variety; ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and approaching to Generals, as
the ſeveral <hi>Ages</hi> of the World, and of
<hi>Life, Sexes</hi> and <hi>Tempers;</hi> ſome Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
and more particular, as the vaſt
Varieties and Shapes of <hi>Villany, Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
Folly, Affectation</hi> and <hi>Humour, &amp;c.</hi>
All theſe are within the <hi>Poet's</hi> Royalty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and he may ſummon 'em to attend
him, whenever he has occaſion for
their ſervice. Yet tho theſe make
up perhaps the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
he is not fondly to imagine, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54591:165"/>
he has any Authority over the whole,
or to expect homage from any of 'em,
as the Publick Repreſentatives of their
Sex.</p>
            <p>Yet even granting to the <hi>Poets</hi> ſuch
an unlimited Authority (which I ſhall
not do) Mr <hi>Collier's</hi> Argument falls to
the Ground nevertheleſs.<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances in Poetry.</note> For as in
<hi>Painting,</hi> ſo in <hi>Poetry,</hi> 'tis a Maxim as

t'other homely. Now <hi>Comedy,</hi> whoſe
Duty 'tis not to flatter, like Droll Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
gives the Features true, tho the
Air be ridiculous. The Sex has its
<hi>Characteriſtick</hi> Blemiſhes as well as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;
and thoſe are to be copied,
when a Defective Character is intended,
as the others are for a perfect one. And
yet, for the reaſons already given,
when the Virtues or Vices of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Women are repreſented, the Sex
in general have no ſhare either in the
Complimeut or the Affront. Becauſe
any particular Inſtances to the contrary
notwithſtanding, the Sex may be in
the main either good or bad. So
that Mr <hi>Collier's</hi> charge of miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sex in general is groundleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:54591:165"/>
But he purſues his Argument to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
and takes notice, that even Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
it ſelf is not excepted from theſe
Miſmanagements.</p>
            <p>If Dignities conferr'd true Merit,<note place="margin">Quality no juſt reaſon for exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and
Titles took away all Blemiſhes, the <hi>Poets</hi>
were certainly very much in the wrong
to repreſent any Perſon of Quality with
failings about her. But if Birth or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
be no ſufficient Guard to a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Virtue or Underſtanding. If Title
be no ſecurity againſt the uſual Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Infirmities; I ſee no reaſon, why
they mayn't as well appear together
upon the leſſer Stage of the Theatre, as
upon the grand one of the World.
But this will be more properly conſider'd
in another place.</p>
            <p>From theſe more general exceptions,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in from the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> very looſely made.</note>
he deſcends to particular <hi>Expreſſions.</hi>
Which, that he may render the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable,
he flies out into extravagant
Commendations of the <hi>Antients</hi> upon
the ſcore of their Modeſty, and the
Cleanneſs of their <hi>Expreſſions.</hi> In this
employment he beſtirs himſelf notably,
and pretends not to leave one exceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Paſſage unremarked. But either
he has had a Prodigious Crop, or is a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54591:166"/>
very ill Husband; for he leaves very
large gleanings behind him. We ſhall
make bold to walk over the ſame
ground, and pick up ſome of his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
(for all wou'd be too bulky to
find room in this place) and reſtore
'em to their Owners, whether left by
him out of negligence or deſign.</p>
            <p>One thing I muſt deſire the Reader
to take notice of, which is, that I
don't charge theſe paſſages as faults, or
immoralities upon the <hi>Antients,</hi> but
only inſtance in 'em, to ſhew the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> who violently
wreſts the Words and Senſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
only to make that monſtrous and
unſufferable in them, which he either
excuſes or defends in the others. Nor
do I here pretend to preſent the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with a compleat Collection of the
kind. I aſſure him, that I ſhall leave
untouch'd ſome hundreds of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which I have actually obſerv'd
amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi>
and only give him ſo many, as are
indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſhew how
unjuſtly Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has drawn his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.
For ſince both <hi>Antients</hi> and
<hi>Moderns,</hi> as <hi>Poets</hi> are ſubmitted to, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54591:166"/>
ought to be govern'd by the ſame Laws,
'tis but reaſon, that one as well as
t'other, ſhou'd be allow'd the benefit
of 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shakeſpear's Ophelia</hi> comes firſt under
his Laſh,<note place="margin">Objection to <hi>Ophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>

clean under her diſtraction. He is ſo
very nice, that her breath, which for
ſo many years has ſtood the teſt of the
moſt critical Noſes, ſmells rank to him.
It may therefore be worth while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whether the fault lies in her
Mouth, or his Noſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ophelia</hi> was a modeſt young Virgin,<note place="margin">Character of <hi>Ophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>
               </note>
beloved by <hi>Humlet,</hi> and in Love with
him. Her Paſſion was approv'd, and
directed by her Father, and her Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to a match with <hi>Hamlet,</hi> the heir
apparent to the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
encouraged, and ſupported by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Aſſiſtance of the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Queen.</hi> A warrantable Love, ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
planted in ſo tender a Breaſt, ſo
carefully nurſed, ſo artfully manured,
and ſo ſtrongly forced up, muſt needs
take very deep Root, and bear a very
great Head. Love, even in the moſt
difficult Circumſtances, is the Paſſion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
moſt predominant in young Breaſts
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54591:167"/>
but when it is encouraged and cheriſh'd
by thoſe of whom they ſtand in awe,
it grows Maſterly and Tyrannical, and
will admit of no Check. This was
poor <hi>Ophelia's</hi> caſe. <hi>Hamlet</hi> had ſworn,
her <hi>Father</hi> had approved, the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Queen</hi> conſented to, nay, deſired the
Conſummation of her Wiſhes. Her
hopes were full blown, when they
were miſerably blaſted. <hi>Hamlet</hi> by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
kills her Father, and runs mad;
or, which is all one to her, counterfeits
madneſs ſo well, that ſhe is cheated
into a belief of the reality of it. Here
Piety and Love concur to make her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
piercing, and to impreſs her
Sorrow more deep and laſting. To
tear up two ſuch paſſions violently by
the roots, muſt needs make horrible
Convulſions in a Mind ſo tender, and
a Sex ſo weak. Theſe Calamities di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
her, and ſhe talks incoherently;
at which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> is amaz'd, he is
downright ſtupified, and thinks the
Woman's mad to run out of her wits.
But tho ſhe talks a little light-headed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſeems to want ſleep, I don't find
ſhe needed any <hi>Caſhew</hi> in her Mouth to
correct her Breath. That's a diſcovery
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54591:167"/>
of Mr <hi>Collier's,</hi> (like ſome other of his)
who perhaps is of Opinion, that the
Breath and the Underſtanding have the
ſame Lodging, and muſt needs be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
together. However, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>
has drown'd her at laſt, and Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
is angry that he did it no ſooner. He
is for having Execution done upon her
ſeriouſly, and in ſober ſadneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the excuſe of madneſs for Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther.

It may perhaps be objected in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Caſandra,</hi> that her Joy and

or Satisfaction, that ſhe ſhou'd take

puſhes her Reſentments too far, when

to her Revenge. Had <hi>Caſandra</hi> been
repreſented as a Woman of a furious
vindicative Spirit, ſhe might in a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fit of Rage have raſhly ſacrificed
all Conſiderations to the Violence of
her preſent Fury. But then if the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
be virtuous in the main, ſuch
Outrages are not offered to Modeſty,
till after prodigious ſtruggles, and
racking Convulſions of Mind. Paſſion
muſt not triumph over Reaſon and
Honour, but with vaſt labour and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and in thoſe Breaſts only,
where it is the ruling, uncontrollable
Power, and where the proſpect of its
ſucceſs is great, and immediate, and is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54591:174"/>
in Women provoked as well by Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
as Inclination.</p>
            <p>But this is none of <hi>Caſandra</hi>'s caſe.
She ſhared indeed amongſt the reſt the
common Fate, and became a Slave, and
a Prey to the victors Luſt and Avarice.
This might naturally make her wiſh
the utter confuſion of the Deſtroyers
of her Country and Family; but not
at the expence of her Fame and Virtue.
'Twas all ſhe had left to comfort her;
and as <hi>Andromache</hi> in the ſame Play
cou'd inform her, of infinitely more
worth, than the wretched remainder of
a ſervile Life. This therefore ſhou'd
not have been parted with at any rate,
much leſs upon a ſlender conſideration.
Had ſhe ſubmitted to neceſſity only,
and comply'd as a Slave with reluctance
to the deſires of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> as <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache</hi>
does to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> ſhe had ſaved hes
Modeſty, and ſecured her Revenge ev'ry
whit as well. The Diſaſters of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
and his Houſe, interpreted as
a Puniſhment of her's, and her Family's
wrongs, tho they were only Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
fore-known by her, had given a

               </gap>rt of Comfort, and afforded
a reaſon for her reſignation of her ſelf
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54591:174"/>
to the Conquerors Pleaſure. But if the
Poet deſigned her for ſo implacable a
Character, as to take ſuch great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in, and purchaſe at ſo dear a rate a
Proſpect only of Revenge at ſuch a
diſtance, by which ſhe herſelf muſt be
cruſhed, and all her Friends either dead,
or ſo diſperſed as to have no intereſt in
the accompliſhment of it: he ought to
have prepar'd the Audience for ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
an extravagance, by ſome
notice of the Violence of her Temper,
either by ſomething from her own mouth
or Conduct previous to this, or from the
mouth of ſome Friend of her's, that
might have abated the ſurprize of ſuch
a reſolution. Eſpecially ſince he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

more eligible. The fault of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Lovers, it ſeems, is too much
tenderneſs and fooling away their time

She is not concerned at the Nature or

that Mr <hi>Collier</hi> can be partial; his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

For tho he does <hi>non omnibus dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi>
yet he can wink at the Faults

that <hi>Seneca</hi> has no courting but this

ſuch a torrent of Citations, as wou'd

of allowance to be made to <hi>Comedy,</hi> to
which <hi>Tragedy</hi> can lay no claim. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>

Whenever therefore the

            <p>But Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> who has a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hand at ſuppoſing than proving,
takes a very odd method to clear the
reputation of that great man from the

That <hi>Socrates</hi> was no <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is clear
from Inſtances enow. To mention but one.
The confidence he had in his Daemon or
Genius, by which he govern'd his Affairs,
puts it beyond diſpute.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Socrates</hi> held,<note place="margin">This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> and believ'd the
exiſtence of <hi>Daemons</hi> or <hi>Genii,</hi> may be
an argument, that he was no <hi>Atheiſt.</hi>
But that he pretended to have any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
or hold any Correſpondence
with ſuch a <hi>Daemon</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> gives
me but a very indifferent notion of his
Faith and Integrity. It ſmells rank of
Impoſture, and muſt needs make but a
bad Impreſſion upon men of Integrity,
and Underſtanding of thoſe Principles,
which want the ſupport of ſuch diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſhifts. But this was <hi>Plato's</hi> report
of him, and perhaps was neither the
real practice nor opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
whom therefore we ſhall diſmiſs, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54591:192"/>
having already far tranſgreſſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
limits of this diſcourſe, I ſhall
treſpaſs no farther upon the Reader's
patience on this head.</p>
            <p>His next complaint is <hi>the abuſe of the
Clergy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Complaint of the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> not well grounded.</note> Were this complaint juſtly
grounded, it would merit not only
his, but all honeſt men's Indignation,
and Reſentments. But this Charge does
not ſeem to be ſufficiently made out.
For 'tis raiſed upon a very weak foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
a miſtaken Notion, that Prieſts
above all the reſt of Mankind, are by
priviledge exempted from having their
faults taken notice of this way; His
reaſon for this ſhall be conſider'd by
and by. I ſuppoſe, if Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s
Band hung awry, or his Face was
dirty, he would uſe the aſſiſtance of a
Glaſs to make all right and clean. Why
then does he reject the uſe of that
which might do the ſame office for his
mind, and help him to correct the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and management of his Life? The
caſe is plain, he is blind to his own
Faults, and mad that any one elſe
ſhould ſee 'em. This makes him call
the ſhewing any of their failings, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Clergy, as if thereby only
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54591:192"/>
they became publick, not conſidering
that the Glaſs ſhews our Faults to our
ſelves only; other people can ſee 'em
as plainly and as readily without its
help. But Mr <hi>Collier,</hi> who takes every
thing by the wrong handle, looks upon
a correction as a reproach, and had
rather a Fault ſhould paſs unmended,
than be taken notice of. But becauſe
he pleads a peculiar Charter for the
exemption of the Prieſthood, let us ſee
how he makes out his Title. The
Conſiderations, upon which he founds
it, are three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe of their Relation to the
Deity.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Relation to the Deity</hi> he ſwells
to a monſtrous ſize,<note place="margin">Their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Deity to conſidered.</note> and blows himſelf
preſumptuouſly up in his own conceit,
to a Condition ſomething above mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
He pretends to no leſs, than to
be one of the <hi>Principal Miniſters of
Gods Kingdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 127. 128.</note> to <hi>repreſent his Perſon,</hi>
to <hi>publiſh his Laws, Paſs his Pardons,
and Preſide in his Worſhip.</hi> Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s
Pride has here hurried him into prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Inſolence and Folly. To raiſe
his own Character, he has made a <hi>Pope</hi>
of every individual Prieſt, and given
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54591:193"/>
that to the meaneſt of 'em, which the
moſt <hi>Orthodox</hi> part of the Chriſtian
World deny to the pretended Succeſſor
of St <hi>Peter?</hi> Is not the whole world
God's Kingdom? What then, are its
Kings, Princes, and Rulers, if every
Prieſt be before 'em in Authority? Mr
<hi>Collier,</hi> I believe, is the firſt bold Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
that ever pretended to repreſent
the perſon of God Almighty ſeriouſly.
This to me ſounds more like Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
than any thing in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<hi>Poet.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> indeed preſumes
to ſtile himſelf <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar general,
but he does not preſume to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
of his Perſon. As Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> has aſſum'd a higher Title, ſo,
I ſuppoſe, he expects more reverence.
'Tis ſtrange that Enthuſiaſm ſhould
ſhoot to ſuch a heighth in our cold
Climate, which it ſcarce ever reach'd
in <hi>Rome</hi> its Native Place. But Mr
<hi>Collier</hi> keeps a hot Bed, where he forces
up violent Notions, in ſpight of the
oppoſition of an unnatural Soil and
Seaſon.</p>
            <p>But I ſhould be glad to know,<note place="margin">Perſonal Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Deity ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this perſonal Repreſentation conſiſts.
Does he pretend, like the <hi>Pope,</hi> to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54591:193"/>
any of the Divine Attributes? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
even of the Church itſelf,
has been long ſince juſtly exploded by
all ſober Chriſtians, that know, and
dare to uſe their Reaſon in the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of their Conſciences. And the
<hi>Pope</hi> himſelf in the heighth of his
Pride and Uſurpation, never pretended
to more. But in what does this vain
Creature reſemble his Creator? Can a
groveling Mortal ſuſtain the Majeſty
and Figure of Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>If notwithſtanding all theſe Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
expreſſions of himſelf,<note place="margin">The Power of the Church not lodged with the Prieſt.</note> and his
order, Mr <hi>Collier</hi> means no more, than
than that a Prieſt derives a ſubordinate
Authority from the Church, to exerciſe
his Function in Spiritual matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to her directions, then all
this inſolent profane Bombaſt dwindles
to nothing. For tho a very great
power and truſt is repos'd in the
Church, yet I don't find, that this
Power was ever lodg'd entire with the
Prieſt, or any other ſingle perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
And therefore Mr <hi>Collier</hi> graſps
at too much, when he claims the ſame
reſpect, and deference for every Prieſt,
that is, or ought to be paid to the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54591:194"/>
Church, and the Governours of it.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Collier</hi> finds,<note place="margin">Miſſion of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles what and how circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated.</note> that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls himſelf and the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles
the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt,</hi> and thinks
himſelf thereby ſufficiently warranted
to take upon him to repreſent the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of God.</hi> The word which St <hi>Paul</hi>
employs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
ſignifies to come by commiſſion from
another, and conſequently may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
enough be render'd, <hi>We are the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,</hi>
tho it does not always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ſo much. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> lays hold of
the word Embaſſadour, and fancies
himſelf in the higheſt, and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
poſt that can be, under God
Almighty, that is, <hi>to repreſent his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to publiſh his Laws, Paſs his Pardons,
and Preſide in his Worſhip.</hi> All this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
except the <hi>Perſonal Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
was the Office of St <hi>Paul,</hi> and the
reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting,
or leſſening the Authority of
the Clergy, I think I may lawfully que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s Commiſſion
be of equal Extent or Validity with
theirs. They were call'd to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
immediately by God himſelf, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with ſupernatural and miraculous
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54591:194"/>
Faculties, and Powers both of Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Operation by Inſpiration from
the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. They were
to plant in the World a new Faith,
which had not yet been heard of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in a very ſmall part of the world.
Their Doctrines were reveal'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to themſelves, and had no other
Evidence than their own Affirmation,
and the Works that they did, to back
and confirm what they taught. They had
occaſion for a Spirit more than natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcerning to be aſſur'd of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Converts, and for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and Power extraordinary, to
remit the ſins of thoſe that they found
to be true Penitents, and to ſupport
themſelves and their Proſelytes againſt
the Oppreſſions of the Civil Power.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances,<note place="margin">Difference betwixt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and that of the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</note> as I take it,
make a very wide difference between
the Miniſtry, and Commiſſion of the
Apoſtles, and the other immediate Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Saviour, and the Chriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
at this time. For firſt, They have
now no immediate call to the Miniſtry,
whatever ſome Enthuſiaſtick or Knaviſh
Sectaries may pretend. Secondly, They
have no natural Gifts above other men,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54591:195"/>
to warrant a Pretence to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Miſſion. Thirdly, They have
now no peculiar Revelation, nor any
other Rule of Faith, or Source of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which is not common to all
mankind with them. The Scriptures
lie open for all that will look into
'em, and our Clergy pretend to no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Gift of Expoſition above the
Laity, and conſequently can offer no
new matter of Faith. Fourthly, They
pretend to no Spirit of Diſcerning above
the condition of meer humanity to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
'em to ſee into mens hearts, and
judge of the ſincerity of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and conſequently muſt diſpoſe
of Pardons blindfold, if they exerciſe
any ſuch power, otherwiſe than condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and upon the terms expreſs'd in
Scripture. But the pronouncing an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
on thoſe terms, is not paſſing
a Pardon, any more than allowing the
benefit of the Clergy to a Malefactor in
a Court of Judicature is an act of Grace
in the Bench. Laſtly, Since the World
became Chriſtian, thoſe extraordinary
Commiſſions, which the Apoſtles and
Primitive Chriſtians had, ceas'd with
the reaſons of 'em. For when the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54591:195"/>
Princes and Rulers of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Proſelytes and Protectors of
Chriſtianity, there was no further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to propagate the Goſpel by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
methods, which had the
Civil Power on its ſide. By this means
the care of the Church devolv'd upon
the State, and the Prieſthood became
ſubordinate to it. For tho no State or
Prince can make any thing a Rule of
Faith, which was not ſo before in its
Nature, or by ſome higher obligation,
yet in matters of Practice in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
towards which the Scriptures
leave us at liberty, they have in all
Countries (not under the uſurpation of
the Pope) aſſerted their Authority by
ordering and directing the Forms and
Models of Church Government, and
appointing the Perſons of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
who are therefore undoubtedly
ſubordinate to thoſe, by whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they govern.</p>
            <p>From theſe differences 'tis plain, that
the Miniſtry at preſent ſtands upon
quite another foot, than it did in the
time of the Apoſtles; and that Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
challenges a relation to the Deity
which he has not, and in right of that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54591:196"/>
a greater Reverence and reſpect than is
due to him.</p>
            <p>His ſecond conſideration is,<note place="margin">Importance of their Office no exemption.</note> 
               <hi>The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of their Office.</hi> What that is,
has been in great meaſure laid down in
the preceding Article. How far they are
concerned in publiſhing Gods Laws, and
paſſing his Pardons has been already
examin'd. There was indeed a time,
when the Prieſts had a Monopoly of
Faith and Salvation, and retail'd out
Articles and Indulgences to the Laity,
who repair'd to the Bank of Implicit
Faith and Merit for as much as their
occaſions requir'd. But the weakneſs of
their Fund being diſcover'd, that Bank
is broke long ſince in <hi>England.</hi> and the
Laity have taken their Conſciences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own Cuſtody again, to Mr
<hi>Collier</hi>'s great Diſappointment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they preſide (he ſays) in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God. If he means by preſiding,
Officiating, he preſides over his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
as a Clerk in Parliament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
over the Houſe, becauſe he reads
the Bills, Petitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 'em. That
to officiate in the Houſe of God is an
Employment of great Importance and
honour, I ſhall readily grant. And as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54591:196"/>
they that perform their duty in that
ſtation conſcientiouſly and well deſerve
all due reſpect and honour; ſo on the
other hand, thoſe that proſtitute their
Character to baſe ends, and make the
Caſſock a Cover for <hi>Pride, Ambition,
Avarice, Hypocriſie, Knavery,</hi> or <hi>Folly,</hi>
deſerve to be corrected, and expos'd to
the Publick. The importance of the
Office, which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> pleads in bar
to any Lay Cenſure upon 'em, is a
ſtrong Argument for it. For in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the weight of the truſt,
ought to be the check upon it.</p>
            <p>There may be many Faults amongſt
the inferiour Clergy,<note place="margin">Some faults not cogniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Ordinary.</note> which eſcape the
notice, or do not fall properly under
the cognizance of the Ordinary, which
'tis convenient ſhou'd be amended, for
the reputation of the Order, and the good
of the Offenders themſelves. Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
thinks otherwiſe, he owns that they
ought not to be ſeen, but he would have
the People's Eyes put out, rather than the
Offence remov'd. A Blot's no Blot till
'tis hit; ſo the reputation of the Clergy
be ſafe, 'tis no matter for their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
for the Sin lies in the Scandal.
Elſe why is he ſo angry with the <hi>Poets,</hi>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:54591:197"/>
for taking notice, that there is ſuch a
thing now and then to be ſeen in the
world as a Faulty Clergy-man? The
Order does not pretend to be any more
exempt from failings, than other men.
Then where's the Offence in ſhewing
what thoſe Frailties are, to which they
lie moſt expos'd? 'Tis true, this can't
be done in the Dramatick way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the appearance of the Offender by
his Proxy; which ſtirs Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s
Blood, who would have the Laity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'em abſolutely without Fault.
'Twere well if they were ſo indeed,
but ſince they are not, I think it not
juſt nor reaſonable, that the Laity
ſhou'd be cheated into ſuch a belief.
The man that labours too much to
conceal his Faults, ſhews that he aims
rather at Impunity than Repentance.
For men ſeldom think of Reformation,
while they can run on in a proſperous
courſe of undiſcover'd Villany.</p>
            <p>Upon this account Mr <hi>Collier</hi>'s reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appears very odd and ſingular. For
if the concealing and covering of Men's
Vices, be the means to advance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their corruption, he ſeems to take
a ſort of retrograde way to Reformation.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54591:197"/>
But his fear is, that the Vices of ſome
few thus publickly ſhewn, ſhou'd reflect
upon the whole Order, and weaken
their Credit and Authority in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Function. This objection is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
anſwered in the article of the <hi>Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of Women;</hi> what has been
there ſaid holds good here, and needs
no repetition. It can therefore be of
no ill conſequence; For thoſe that
are juſt, and Conſcientious in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their Functions will loſe no
Credit or Authority; and thoſe that
are not, have too much, if they have
any.</p>
            <p>If Prieſts be without Fault,<note place="margin">Prieſts not miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unleſs fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</note> then to
paint 'em with any is a Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and an abuſe, a malicious ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Order. But if they be not,
'tis fit that the rotten Sheep ſhou'd be
mark'd and driven from the Flock, to
prevent the contagion, whether of the
Diſeaſe or the Scandal, which are
equally catching. But Mr <hi>Collier</hi> has
learnt Politicks of <hi>Hudibras,</hi> and wou'd
have Prieſts whipt by Proxy; their Faults
ſhou'd be chaſtiſed on Laymens Backs.
We thank him for his kindneſs, and are
very willing to be his Deputies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54591:198"/>
he can prove that the Phyſick
will have its effect that way. I have
been told, that a Purge given to a wet
Nurſe, wou'd operate with the Child;
but I never heard of a Med'cine that
wou'd work <hi>Vice verſa.</hi> I grant, that
they ought not to be corrected on the
Stage for Lay Follies. Their Characters
muſt be proper, in order to which,
whether they play the Fool or the
Knave, it muſt be ſeaſoned with a caſt
of the Profeſſion; otherwiſe they are
Lay Fools and Knaves in Maſquerade.
But as the Characters ought not to be
ſo general, as to repreſent whole Bodies
of Men, ſo neither ought they to be ſo
particular, as to ſtigmatize Individuals,
as they did in the <hi>Old Comedy.</hi> If this

Another exception,<note place="margin">Rude treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nobility a falſe charge.</note> which Mr <hi>Collier</hi>
makes to the Stage is, that <hi>they treat the
Nobility rudely.</hi> I muſt confeſs 'tis no
complement to make a Fool of a Lord.
But if Birth or any other Chance ſhou'd
make a Lord of a Fool, I ſuppoſe the
reſt of that Noble Order wou'd not think
themſelves accountable for his Follies,
or abus'd in his Picture. Shou'd the
Poets preſume to make ſuch a one the
Repreſentative of his Order, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him as a common Standard, by
which the Endowments of Quality in
general were to be meaſur'd, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
wou'd deſerve the ſevereſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement
that cou'd be given. Or
ſhou'd any one of 'em dare to characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
too nearly and particularly any of
thoſe Noble Perſons, no doubt but he
wou'd ſoon feel the weight of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,
and ſmart ſorely for his
ſawcy Liberty. But while the Poet
contents himſelf with feign'd Perſons,
and copies cloſely after Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
preſſing upon her in her private
receſſes, and ſingling out Individuals
from the herd, if any Man, of what
Quality or Employment ſoever, fancies
himſelf concern'd in the repreſentation,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54591:203"/>
let him ſpoil the Picture by mending
the Original. For he only is to be
blam'd for the Reſemblance. If Men
of Honour and Abilities cou'd entail
their Wiſdom and Virtues upon their
Poſterity, then a Title wou'd be a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſure ſign of Perſonal Worth, and
the Reſpect and Reverence that was
paid to the Founders of honourable
Families ought to follow the Eſtate,
and the heir of one ſhou'd be heir of
t'other. But ſince Entails of this kind
are of all kinds the moſt liable to be
cut off, 'tis not abſolutely impoſſible
but there may be ſuch a thing in the
world, as a Fop of Quality. Now if
there be ſuch a thing, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me, that becauſe the Perſons
are great, and elevated by their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
above the reſt of Mankind, and
draw the Eyes of the People upon 'em,
more than other men do, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Faults or Imperfections will
be leſs viſible, or leſs taken notice of,
or that the Splendour of their Figure is
an infallible Antidote againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their Examples. Unleſs it
be ſo, it is convenient that ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Expedient ſhou'd be allow'd to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54591:203"/>
prevent the Miſchief of Imitation, and
that thoſe who are too big to be aw'd
out of their Follies, may be ſham'd out
of 'em. But this is only Hypothetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer'd. Mr <hi>Collier</hi> perhaps will tell
us, that there are no ſuch Perſons, that
a Fool of Quality is a meer Poetical
Animal, and ought to be rank'd amongſt
the <hi>Harpyes, Hippogryphs, Centaurs,</hi> and
<hi>Chimaera's</hi> of Antiquity. If he proves
this, my <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in this point falls to
the ground, otherwiſe I think it may
ſtand in oppoſition to any thing that
has yet been ſaid.</p>
            <p>If theſe and abundance of other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
in the <hi>Antient</hi> Poets were compar'd
with thoſe which Mr <hi>Collier</hi> produces
out of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> the comparative
Rudeneſs and Prophaneſs of the latter
wou'd vaniſh. But he preſumes upon
the lazineſs, or ignorance of the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Readers, and does not expect
that any of 'em ſhou'd be at the pains
to confront his arbitrary, and unfair
accounts, with genuine quotations. But
'tis time to have compaſſion upon the
Reader, who has run the Gauntlet thro
a tedious Refutation; in which if his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
equals his Patience, the Author
thinks his pains ſufficiently recompenc'd.</p>
