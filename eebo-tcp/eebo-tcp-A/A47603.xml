            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Preſent Great Intereſt
Both of
KING
AND
PEOPLE:
IN
A LETTER
Written
To one of the Lords of the Privy-Council.</head>
            <head type="sub">By a Lover of his King and Country.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſo often reſolved to wait on your Lordſhip, and as
often been diſappointed of thoſe Reſolutions, by ſuch
publick concerns as did intervene, that I now reſolve, what
ſhould then have been the ſubject of my diſcourſe with
your Lordſhip, had my occaſions permitted me to come to
<hi>London,</hi> ſhall be now compriſed in this ſhort Epiſtle; and
I hope your Lordſhip will not deſpiſe the well meant
Offering of your Lordſhips old Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>My Lord, Among the reſt of other matters, (during
twenty Years laſt paſt) I have particularly taken notice of
the moſt remarkable publick Occurrences that have been in
this Nation; and when I review them, to me they ſeem
ſtrange. I will only obſerve, with your Lordſhips leave, theſe things; Firſt, My Lord,
You cannot but remember, with what an univerſal Joy did all Parties amongſt us, even
as one man, receive the King at his Return. <hi>England</hi> lookt like the moſt peaceable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
in the world: We began to entertain the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit again of Love and
Loyalty.—But behold! How ſoon was our growing Hopes blaſted, all hands at work
to hinder any Settlement either in Church or State?</p>
            <p>Firſt, The old Enemy of our Religion, the Papiſt, attempts the greateſt Perſonages
with their <hi>Nicknacks</hi> of Religion, and had an excellent Harveſt, eſpecially among a ſort
of Religious Women; who when they had thrown off all ſenſe of Modeſty and Honeſty,
ſhelter'd themſelves under the Prieſts ſhroud of Confeſſion and Abſolution, (a rare way to
finde out the Intrigues of Proteſtant Princes!)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60081:2"/>
2. The Sectarian he immediately ſtept in too, with Diſputes about the Garments of
Religion, and muſt needs have long Conferences at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> Whether it were more
Apoſtolical, a ſhort Cloak, or a <hi>Holland</hi> Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet theſe Zealots pretend,
the Articles of Religion in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are ſound. But King <hi>James,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
told us, He knew that ſort of men very well, that they would be always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
alterations in Religious Eſtabliſhments; but could never agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
what 'twas they would have and be quiet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſort of wild fantaſtick men, called <hi>Fifth-Monarchy,</hi> aroſe to diſturb our Peace,
which would have neither Church nor Monarchy, as eſtabliſh'd; but overturn all, to
bring down Our Saviour to reign perſonally amongſt them: and no doubt he would have
had admirable Subjects!</p>
            <p n="4">4. With theſe, in comes a Torrent of Atheiſm and Debauchery, as if all ſenſe of Good
and Evil were quite obliterated out of their mindes. What Curſing, Swearing, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Blaſpheming, even in the face of the Sun! all manner of filthineſs, even to a
Prodigy: And he was no Gentleman, nor Perſon of any Honour, that had not in two
hours ſitting at Wine, invented ſome new modiſh Oath, or found out the late Intrigue
between the L. <hi>B.</hi> and the L. <hi>P.</hi> laught at the fopperies of Prieſts, and made <hi>Lampoons</hi>
and Droll on the ſacred Scriptures themſelves: This was and is the practice of our young
Nobility and Gentry, to the great Scandal and Reproach of their Families.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The old Cunning Stateſman obſerving this, ſteps forth, and appears vigorous too,
on behalf of the Diſcontented; ſets up Green-Ribbond-Clubs, and lets fall doubtful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
at each Coffee-houſe, that it may look two ways, and neither true nor underſtood;
has his Emiſſaries every where to whiſper Treaſon and Sedition, ſmite the <hi>King</hi> through
the Dukes ſide, Libel and Lampoon him, make him the Author of the preſent miſeries:
Cry out daily of Property and Liberty, that it's like to be invaded; when quite contrary,
their deſigns are abſolutely bent to invade the Prerogative of their Prince, and render
him onely the bare Complement of a King, and no more. Yea, they have of late made
our Citizens Stateſmen too—whoſe buſineſs lies quite another way (one would think)
every little Ale-draper now can tell what the Privy-Councel intend to do a Month hence,
and what the King ought to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Very fine by my troth—Well, but the Stateſman
goes farther yet, for in the Countrey he appears for all the Diſcontented at Elections for
Parliament-men; there he recommends Godlineſs in ſuch a man, Courage in another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Popiſh and Epiſcopal Plotters; when a man might have heard of ſome of them thirty
years ago, violent againſt King-Plotters, that is, thoſe Loyal perſons that endeavoured
the Kings Reſtoration. Now, My Lord, we have brought our ſelves to a very fine paſs: let
me but a little Animadvert on what I have obſerved, and then propoſe ſome Remedies
for the Cure of our preſent Miſery.</p>
            <p>My Lord, methinks it ſhould have been impoſſible that theſe things ſhould come to paſs
in our days as we now ſee, when we had groaned twenty years under the ſeveral Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies
of Mechanick Princes, Reformation Workmen, Sanctified Covenanters, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Coblers, and what not? that our great ones ſhould ſo far forget themſelves, as to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the ſecret whiſpers of thoſe Anti-Chriſtian Traders, to endeavour a return to that
Slavery, under which moſt of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> have lain many years; to countenance
a Religion ſo full of wickedneſs of all ſorts; to Plot, contrive the death of Princes, in
order to their deſign. Surely Proteſtant Religion was never well grounded in theſe perſons,
or if it had, they have ſinn'd away all ſence of it, that teaches other things in Chriſtianity.
Indeed, as for the Female ſort that have departed from our Church to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> of late
years, they were a diſhonour to our Church, and no protection or allowance in it to thoſe
Adulteries and Fornications which are their daily practice: ſo that no wonder they are
departed ſince into that Church, where they can ſin and repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet be as innocent
as the late Saints departed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, methinks the ill ſucceſs our diſcontented Brethren had in their former Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
for Reformation, the Miſeries, Murders, Ruine both to Church and State; loſs of
one of the beſt of Kings, by the hands of their Leaders, ſhould deter them from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like again. But, my Lord, I have obſerved among thoſe ſort of Men, a ſpirit full
of trouble and diſcontent, let the times be good or bad, for they are and muſt be even as
they fancy. Truly if Laws wiſely contrived to keep us all quiet, be put in execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, oh then, the beloved Doctrine of Perſecution is held forth powerfully, to
untye the purſe-ſtrings of the good Women of the Congregation; and to ſay truth, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60081:3"/>
have then the beſt harveſt. Well, but if no Law be put in-execution againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they
are permitted to ſay and do what they pleaſe, truly then, one or other of the Biſhops is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Popiſhly inclined, and ſometimes they are all ſo but two. Then again, if a ſound
able Preacher of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or two, appear againſt their foppiſh way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Canting, (as the worthy <hi>Sherlock</hi> and <hi>Falkner</hi> have done) ſo that thereby their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
begin to grow thin; oh then, a hue and cry goes out againſt them, Seize the
<hi>Arminian,</hi> he is departed from the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Articles, and its Homilies; ſeize the
<hi>Socinian,</hi> that denies the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. So that were not Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> a very tall
ſtout man, Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> at <hi>Lynn,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Jane</hi> under the Proteſtant Biſhops protection,
'tis ten to one but they had been delivered up to the Rabble, as a great man was about 1643.
for being charged with the ſame Crimes. And then they are admirable too at recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Publick Magiſtrates; if they were but the Sons of ſome of the old Rebellion, and have
never ſo little tincture of Fathers crime, but eſpecially if they hunt Jeſuits day and night,
and appear at a Conventicle at leaſt once a Lords day; that's the Man all the Rabble ſhall
be poſſeſſed with; he is a precious man to ſit in Parliament, to defend us, and promote our
cauſe againſt Popery and Prelacy.</p>
            <p>Now my Lord, for the other ſort of Monſters that have principally given their helping
hand to bring ruine and deſtruction on us, I mean the Debauchees and the Atheiſt, I
know not what to ſay to them: I would only ask the Juſtices of Peace and other publick
Magiſtrates theſe two Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether if they had obſerved to put in execution the Laws eſtabliſht in this Nation
againſt theſe Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> (who thus bid defiance to God and all things Sacred, or had
not been frighted from their duty by great examples) we had ſeen the preſent miſery of this
Age? Is it not a ſhame in a Chriſtian Kingdom, to permit ſuch Monſters amongſt us? I
cannot forget one of this ſort, that is, <hi>One of Davids Fools, that ſaid in his heart,</hi> &amp;c. is
mighty angry firſt with himſelf, for being puniſh'd ſeverely for his ill life, then with all
Mankind; proving they are in a worſe condition than Beaſts, becauſe he himſelf has ſuffer'd
like one. <hi>A ROD for that FOOLS back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether if the Magiſtates had put in Execution the Laws made againſt Popiſh
Recuſants and other Sectaries, we had heard of ſo many Plots and Contrivances againſt
our King, Government, and Religion? Then, I ſay, my Lord, let not the King be evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, that theſe things are come upon us, but charge it on the careleſs Magiſtrate, that
has forgot God and his Duty; and as long as we have ſuch Magiſtracy, we ſhall wax
worſe and worſe, till we are beyond recovery, and muſt of neceſſary Conſequence be ſo.</p>
            <p>In all Ages, the Sanction of Laws duely executed, were the beſt defenſatives for any
Kingdome or Common-wealth. 'Twas Debauchery, and not obſerving the Laws, brought
to nothing the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Had our Laws been duely executed, ſhould we have heard
the cryes of the Fatherleſs and Widdow in our ſtreets, ſo much as we do? ſhould not
Curſing, Swearing, and Blaſphemy, been out of faſhion,
and eſteemed diſhonourable in
the higheſt, and abandoned by the meaneſt? Would not Adulteries and Fornications, and
the lewdneſs of the preſent times, have crept into the dark, and not appeared ſo out-da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Laws of Modeſty, as well as the Laws of our Land? judge you that are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of the Land.</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſurely it is high time for ſome of the moſt prudent among the Nobility and
Gentry, to ariſe on behalf of God, Religion, and the Laws, that our <hi>King</hi> and we periſh not
together; for if there be not a hook put into the Noſtrils of theſe unruly and ungodly
perſons, 'tis impoſſible but we ſhall come to confuſion, and every evil work; and alſo that
we in the lower ſphere ſhould carry our ſelves humbly and loyally to our King, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to put to ſilence the turbulent hot-ſpurs of the Age, that gape after change in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but I hope the Lord will diſappoint their expectations, and blaſt their deſignes.
In order to which, I onely will, with your Lordſhips leave, propoſe theſe eight things to
the conſideration of both King, Lords and Commons; and ſo ſhall bid your Lordſhip
Good night.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Would it not much conduce to the rooting out and deſtroying the preſent ill
Manners of the Age, if His Sacred Majeſty would be pleaſed to appoint fit perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
Integrity, Sobriety, and Loyalty, to enquire into the Lives of all his Officers
and Servants, from the higheſt to the loweſt; and find out the moſt expedient way by the
Law, to reform the Swearer, the Blaſphemer, the Whoremaſter, the Flatterer, and the Lyer,
the neglecter of God and his Worſhip, or to remove them from his Perſon and Service? then
would Vertue be in faſhion at Court.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60081:4"/>
2. That great care be taken, to admit none to be Juſtices of Peace, but ſuch as are of
very unqueſtionable Loyalty, and firm to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of ſober Converſation
and Piety, <hi>that would mind an Oath;</hi> then ſhould our Laws be put in execution againſt
Offenders, and Juſtice not perverted, to the deſtruction of our peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſince of late, through the wickedneſs of the times, there hath been Indulgence
given to Diſſenters, That ſome perſons be appointed very often to hear them, in order to
put an awe upon them, leſt they preach againſt the Eſtabliſht Government; and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be given to ſuch perſons employed in that ſervice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Nurſeries of Sedition and Rebellion (Coffee-houſes) be forthwith put down,
and ſome reaſonable compenſation given to the perſons of that Profeſſion, who ſhall ſuffer
thereby.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That an exact Regiſter of all the Popiſh Families in <hi>England</hi> be returned to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
and with them their Children alſo; that care be taken they may have no St.
<hi>Omers</hi> Education, in the ſeveral Counties by the Juſtices thereof; and to make return of
ſuch as dare ſend their Children beyond ſea for Education in Religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That to take off the Scandal and Contempt from the <hi>Clergy of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the Biſhops in their ſeveral Dioceſſes would viſit in perſon, and not by their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours;
and would not ſuperficially, but ſtrictly and ſeverely enquire into the Lives and
Manners of their Clergy, and take all care to diſcard them from their Exerciſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Office, till they become as they ought to be. And further, that they would by no
means admit ſo many into Holy Orders, before they be Thirty years of age, and well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with Learning and Parts to exerciſe their Office; then ſhould not our Univerſities
ſpue out ſo many every year of Sizers or Servitors, with a little Learning and leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to take upon them the Curateſhip of ſome Doctors Pluralities, which with a preſent
Marriage, and a ſmall Stipend, (let the Living be what it will) he becomes the ſcandal of
the Pariſh, Poverty being ſo eſteemed every where in this degenerate Age. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that 'twould hugely conduce to the encouraging of Learning, if the great Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church were given to the moſt Learned and deſerving Men, ſuch as are
ſound for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that no Pluralities be admitted to any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
unleſs to a poor Vicar, whoſe Vicarage cannot ſcarce maintain his Family in
Bread.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That ſome of the moſt noble Perſonages of the Kingdom, Men of Integrity and
Learning, and reputed Loyalty, together with ſome of our Worthy and Pious Biſhops,
would by way of Humble Addreſs to his Royal Highneſs, repreſent the preſent jealouſies
and fears which are upon the minds of the people of this Nation, by his being inclined
to the Romiſh Religion; and to repreſent to his Highneſs the miſchievous conſequences of
altering the Religion his Father dyed for, and he himſelf is obliged to by the obligation of
Baptiſm, and the dying advice and command <hi>of his Royal Father and Martyr;</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to preſs him to make a publick ſatisfaction to the Nation in that reſpect; otherwiſe,
the miſchiefs that will inevitably follow, may too late be prevented.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To conclude, That all honeſt and Loyal hearts would joyn unanimouſly together,
to ſupport the Intereſt of the King and the Church, againſt all thoſe that have ſet their
hands to work to pull them down; their ſeveral Characters you have before in this Epiſtle,
and 'tis no hard matter to meet with them in all places of converſe, where they aſſert and
maintain their Democratical principles. I ſay, let us ſtand up in behalf of our King and
Church, as ſtoutly as they are Enemies to them, and God will no doubt ſave us from the
deſtruction and miſery, devaſtation and ruine that threatens us at this time.</p>
