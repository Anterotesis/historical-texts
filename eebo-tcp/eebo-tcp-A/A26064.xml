            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING made my ſelf a Debtor to the Publick, for <hi>A Plain Method of Devotion for Sick and Dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> And one chief part of that Devotion being the Exerciſe of a true Repentance, (for the Miniſter who viſits the Sick Perſon, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Church of <hi>England</hi> to examine, <hi>Whether he repent him truly of his Sins?)</hi> leſt Men ſhould from hence be encouraged to defer their Repentance to a Sick and Dying Bed, (as if they might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy their Sins in their Health, becauſe they are admoniſhed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb facs="tcp:62655:4"/>
when they come to Dye) I have therefore very faithfully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that matter: And have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in the following Treatiſe to convince them, That though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as all other Graces, muſt be exerciſed and improved upon the approach of Death (for our Lamps muſt be trimmed when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes) yet <hi>A Death-bed Repentance is neither comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor ſafe.</hi>

            <head>A DISCOURSE Concerning a Death-bed Repentance.</head>
            <p>'TIS the faint Dictate even of Natural Reaſon, but the more clear and full Diſcovery of Revelation, That when we dye, when our Souls ſhall be ſeparated from our Bodies, when we leave this World, we ſhall not then periſh like the Brutes, and ceaſe to be; but ſhall ſubſiſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in another State and Capacity, either of Happineſs or Miſery, to all Eternity. And we are further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed from Divine Revelation in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62655:6"/>
the Holy Scriptures, That this preſent Life, this ſhort and uncertain time of continuance in this World, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpace of Probation and Trial, to fit and prepare us for our future Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State. <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo it lies.</hi> There is no Work nor Repentance in the Grave. But as Death ſhall ſeize us, in the ſame Capacity we ſhall appear before the Throne of God, and ſhall then be diſpoſed of in an irreverſible unalterable State, either of Happineſs or Miſery.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who make their own Will their Law, and who are guided and acted by their own vicious ſenſual Inclinations, they ſhall be eternally miſerable. Or according to our blunt way of expreſſing it in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, They ſhall be <hi>Damned,</hi> that is, they ſhall be condemned to that ſtate of Miſery, which the Juſtice of God hath prepared to be the ſad Lot and Portion of all impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand; Thoſe who follow the Divine Conduct, and are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62655:6"/>
obedient to the Laws of the Goſpel; ſuch Perſons, through the Mercy of God, and the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved and preſerved from the Wrath to come. And ſhall be placed in that happy State and Capacity, where they ſhall not only be freed from Miſery, but ſhall further be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the unalterable enjoyment of an unexpreſſible Happineſs and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>From theſe Conſiderations you are fully convinced, that it is both your Intereſt and Duty to take care of your Souls, and provide for Eternity. But the ſad miſtake is this, (and it is the ruin of thouſands) you fancy it is time enough hereafter to entertain ſuch Thoughts. 

<q>You have ſo much Diverſion and Employment in the World, that you have little or no time for the Duties of Religion. But when you have ſettled your Affairs, and diſpatched <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that:</hi> When you have improved or cleared your Eſtates: When you have taken in this Mortgage, finiſhed that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62655:7"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the hurry of theſe things is over, and that you can call your Thoughts your own, <hi>then</hi> you promiſe your ſelves to be very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; that is, when you have done with this World, you will provide for the next. When your Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be crazy, and your ſtrength to decay; When you are laid upon a Sick-bed, and have loſt the reliſh of ſenſual Pleaſures, then you fancy you ſhall have both leiſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to repent of your Sins, and to beg Pardon for them. And whenever you do Repent, (tho' it be but upon your Death-bed) God, who is very merciful, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I appeal now to your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences if this is not the very Language of your hearts: But know, that your hearts are deceitful, and take heed leſt they be further hardned through the deceitfulneſs of Sin.</p>
            <p>That I may therefore awaken your Conſideration, and convince you of your danger in truſting to a broken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62655:7"/>
Reed: That I may make you ſenſible how unſafe it is to depend upon a <hi>Death-bed Repentance,</hi> I ſhall very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly examine that matter. By ſhewing,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>What is meant by true Repentance?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. I ſhall enquire, <hi>How far, and in what manner a Sick and Dying Sinner can be able to Repent?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. I ſhall deſire ſuch Perſons ſadly to conſider, <hi>What ſmall hope there is, that ſuch kind of Repentance ſhould find acceptance with God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. I ſhall examine thoſe <hi>Two</hi> noted Scripture-inſtances commonly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in favour of a Death bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>viz. The Labourers in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, who came in at the eleventh hour.</hi> And, <hi>The Thief upon the Croſs.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But as Preparatory to my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on theſe Particulars, whereby it will be more diſtinct and inſtructive; I muſt <hi>firſt</hi> premiſe, what is meant by a Death-bed Repentance.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62655:8"/>Now a Death-bed Repentance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>

            <p>This kind of Death-bed Repentance is ſo far from being a miſtake, that it is a neceſſary Duty, and is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practice of good and pious Men. But,</p>

               <q>When a Man then begins to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when he comes to dye. When a Man hath ſpent all his Life in the gratifying of his Luſts, and hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his own vicious Inclinations. When he hath denied himſelf no carnal Satisfactions, but hath taken his fill of ſenſual Pleaſures: And yet ſuch a Man, when his Body is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and Death approacheth, ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62655:8"/>
that he hath neither time nor incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Sin any longer, will pretend to be ſorry for his Sin, and Repent.</q> This we call a Death-bed Repentance.</p>
            <p>Now how <hi>unſafe</hi> and <hi>uncomfortable</hi> ſuch a Death-bed Repentance is, I ſhall endeavour to convince you, by examining the formentioned Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>What is meant by true Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vulgar and common Notion of Repentance, is evidently this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When a Man hath committed a fault, and hath done ſomething amiſs, and is then ſorry for it; is grieved and troubled that he hath done it, and doth heartily wiſh it had not been done.</hi> Such a Man, we uſually ſay, doth Repent of ſuch an Action.</p>
            <p>But this is not the full adequate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Goſpel-Repentance; of ſuch a Repentance as ſhall find acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>This is but the Repentance of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors at the Gallows; nay, it is no other than the Repentance of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62655:9"/>It is obſerved, That the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate condemned Wretch when he comes to dye, will be very ſorry for what he hath done. He will be much aſhamed, and will have great Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt himſelf, to think he ſhould be ſuch a fool to part with his precious Life, and all the Comforts and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this World, in ſuch a vile ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious manner, to be tied up like a Dog, perhaps for the taking of a few Sheep. How will ſuch a Fellow fawn upon, and flatter the Judge, <hi>That if he will but ſpare him, O what an honeſt Man he will then be!</hi> And yet do but procure his Pardon, and let him looſe, and he is quickly at the old Trade. Nay, 'tis great odds but you have him again by the next Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>Now will any one pretend that in ſuch a Caſe as this, there is true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
            <p>Which yet is more evident from thoſe Scripture-Inſtances of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems very probable, from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Story, that <hi>Cain</hi> did
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62655:9"/>
repent of the Murther of his Brother. <hi>My puniſhment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is greater than I can bear,</hi> Gen. 4.13. But becauſe in the Judgment of ſome Learned Men, this is rather an inſtance of Deſpair than Repenting-Sorrow; I ſhall not much inſiſt upon this of <hi>Cain.</hi> But as to the other inſtance of <hi>Judas,</hi> 'tis expreſs and undeniable.</p>
            <p>You read his Story, Matth. 27.3, 4, 5. <hi>Then Judas which had betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was comdemned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of ſilver to the chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſaying, I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent Blood. And they ſaid, What is that to us? ſee thou to that. And he caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are as ſignal Inſtances that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did ſincerely repent of what he had done, as can poſſibly be given. For beſides the expreſs Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, which in plain terms tells us he did Repent, and that he himſelf declared, <hi>He had ſinned in betraying the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62655:10"/>
innocent Blood</hi>: He further gives this evidence, that he was in earneſt, he not only reſtores the <hi>thirty</hi> pieces, but in horror and conſternation of Mind, <hi>he went and hanged himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is, I ſay, in this inſtance as much Grief, and Trouble, and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Commiſſion of a Sin, and as noted evidence that he was heartily ſorry for it, as can poſſibly be ſuppoſed. And yet 'tis as plain, that this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Judas</hi> was not an Evangelical Repentance, ſuch a Repentance as was accepted by Almighty God. Our Bleſſed Saviour, who is Truth it ſelf, having paſſed this Decree upon him: <hi>Wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man, if he had not been born,</hi> Matth. 26.24.</p>
            <p>It appears from theſe premiſes, that there is more required to a ſaving Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Repentance than trouble of Mind. <hi>When a Man hath committed a ſault, he may be ſorry for it, he may grieve and mourn that he hath done it; he may hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh it had not been done; he may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62655:10"/>
make Reſtitution of his ill-gotten Goods.</hi> All this may be done; thus far he may proceed, and yet his Repentance is but imperfect, and ſhall never find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a pure and holy God.</p>
            <p>But here you will ſay;</p>
            <p>If Men may proceed thus far, and yet their Repentance is not true and ſaving; How ſhall we know that we have true Repentance; and wherein doth the nature of it conſiſt?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>God only can inſtruct us what is true Repentance. That is, it is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Majeſty and Sovereignty of God to preſcribe the Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Salvation, and to appoint his Creatures what they muſt do; how they muſt behave themſelves to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him.</p>
            <p>Now there is no other way to be informed in this matter, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Holy Scriptures. In thoſe Sacred Writings, the Divine Wiſdom hath ſufficiently revealed his Will, and hath plainly told us, <hi>What it is that he required of us</hi>; and <hi>what we are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62655:11"/>
to do, that we may inherit Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are expreſly admoniſhed, <hi>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>That the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God. Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: but if ye through the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. <hi>For the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he ſhall reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works,</hi> Matth. 16.27. <hi>And</hi> the Son of God <hi>being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly admoniſh
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62655:11"/>
us, That <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8.</p>
            <p>From theſe places of Scripture (to omit many others) it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>That actual Holineſs, and actual Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel is the indiſpenſible Condition of Salvation.</hi> And conſequently to be only Sorry for our Sins; to be troubled that we have done amiſs; unleſs this Sorrow do bring forth fruits meet for Repentance; that is, unleſs it be attended with actual Reformation and Amendment, it is not a true and Evangelical Repentance, ſuch a Repentance as God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to accept.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to examine, <hi>How far, and in what manner a Sick and Dying Sinner can be able to Repent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I ſhall beſt perform by a plain repreſentation of matter of Fact. Whilſt I faithfully remind you, how,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62655:12"/>
or in what manner you may happen to dye.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You may dye ſuddenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath been many a Man's caſe, and you have no aſſurance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but it may be yours. If ſome hidden Diſtemper do not thus extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Lamp of Life, your own Sin and Folly may then puff it out. You may happen in ſome private Quarrel, unexpectedly to dye at the point of a Sword, and ſo may fall a Sacrifice to your Luſt, to your Malice, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. But whatever may occaſion your Death; if it be ſudden, it is then impoſſible for you to Repent upon your Death-beds. And if you have not taken care in your life-time to perform that great Work, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Goſpel, you are utterly loſt and undone for ever. <hi>For except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You may dye raving Mad, or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly Senſleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a ſufficient Maſs of vicious corrupted Humours, or (as Phyſicians
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62655:12"/>
phraſe it) of Morbiſick Matter in any of your Bodies, as may occaſion theſe ſad Symptoms and diſmal Effects. And if this be your caſe, where then is your Death-bed Repentance?</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to Repentance (even in the vulgar Notion of it) that you ſhould not only remember your Sins, but ſhould alſo be ſorry for them. But now ſuppoſing your Diſtemper is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Frenzy</hi> or a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> or in any other inſtance of ſuch a nature, as ſhall wholly deprive you of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Underſtanding, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is then impoſſible. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing it is neither <hi>thus</hi> nor <hi>thus</hi> with you; but that God in his Mercy gives you a ſlow and eaſy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of this World. Suppoſe your Diſtemper is ſo gentle, that it neither diſtracts you with Pain, nor diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders your Faculties; but that, as we phraſe it, <hi>You have your Senſes to the laſt.</hi> In ſuch a caſe as this (which is the moſt favourable that can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) I will now examine, how far any Man who hath ſpent the time of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62655:13"/>
his Health in Sin and Vanity, can be able to Repent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wicked men, when they come to die, may remember their Sins, which they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom think on in the time of their Healths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generality of men are ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with the Deſigns of This World, that they have neither leiſure nor inclination to think of the Next. In what a hurry ſuch men do ſpend the Day, is very obvious to obſerve; and at Night, being loaden with Wine and Buſineſs, they ſleep over their Cares and their Sins together.</p>
            <p>But when ſome lingring Diſeaſe ſhall confine them to their Chambers, or nail them to their Beds; when their Sleep is departed from them, and that they lie rowling and tumbling, and wiſhing for the Day: Then they are at leiſure to conſider their Ways, and to remember what they have done, and to recollect the former Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of their Lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wicked men, when they come to die, may not only remember, but alſo may be very ſorry, and much troubled for their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62655:13"/>
Sins; and may likewiſe make a penitent Confeſſion of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This evidently appears from the former Inſtance of <hi>Judas,</hi> who was not a little troubled for betraying his Maſter; and as freely makes confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Fault: <hi>I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is undeniable even from daily obſervation: Thoſe who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Sick-Beds, and hear the dying Groans of departing Sinners, are beſt able to tell you how they will lament their former Lives, and what wretched Sinners they have been. And at ſuch a time they will be very free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in their Confeſſion, with <hi>a thus,</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> have I done; and withal they may mightily judge and condemn themſelves for it.</p>
            <p>If ever you have been laid upon a Sick-Bed, with the Terrors and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of another World before you, then I appeal to your own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience for the truth of what I have now ſaid.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62655:14"/>3. <hi>Wicked men, upon their Death-Beds, may not only make a ſorrowful Confeſſion of their Sins, but alſo they may earneſtly beg Pardon for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Principle of Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the moſt vicious carnal man, which prompts him to be ſolicitous for deliverance from an imminent Danger. A noted Inſtance of this you have in Seamen; ſuch men (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the common Sailers) are not uſually over-zealous in Religion, and yet in a dangerous Storm, or in a leaky ſinking Ship, thoſe who ſeldom named God, unleſs in Oaths and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations, will now fall to their Prayers.</p>
            <p>And thus the moſt graceleſs, ſenſual, worldly Perſon, when he comes to die, and hath the proſpect of another World immediately before him; when he ſees the Infernal Pit open to receive him, O with what earneſtneſs will he deprecate the Divine Vengeance! How paſſionately will he pray unto God to ſpare him, to be gracious to him, to pardon and forgive him!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62655:14"/>Nay, even thoſe who have been ſo careleſs and unconcerned, that they could never in their whole life-time be perſuaded to remember our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Paſſion in the way of his own Inſtitution in the Holy Sacrament; yet theſe very Perſons on their Death-bed will pretend to remember it. They will then plead his Merits and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and will beg God's Pardon for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This likewiſe, as to matter of Fact, is undeniably evident.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Wicked Men, when they come to dye, may further make very ſerious Reſolutions of amendment of Life.</hi> And in ſuch caſes this is the noted Language of a Death-bed.</p>
            <q>O what a wicked Wretch have I been? I have done <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus.</hi> But if God will now pleaſe to ſpare my Life, and reſtore me to my Health, I'll become a new Man. I'll no more be guilty of ſuch Intemperance. I'll be wanton and laſcivious no more. I'll take heed of lying and ſlandering. And I'll refrain from this curſing and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62655:15"/>
ſwearing. I'll be more careful to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify the Sabbath. I'll not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Church, but for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I'll no more be guilty of vain Sports and Paſtimes on the Lord's-day. And on the Week-day, tho' I muſt follow my worldly Buſineſs, yet I'll do it in dependance upon God's Providence, I will never more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to pray unto God; but do now reſolve Morning and Evening to bend my Knees to my Creator and Redeemer.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As an evidence that he is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <hi>He may make Reſtitution and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in ſeveral inſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He may declare that he bears no Malice, but doth freely forgive all the World. He may likewiſe reſtore his ill-gotten Goods; and may give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to thoſe he remembers to have wronged.</p>
            <p>And not only ſo, but for the cloſe of all, he may be large in his Charity in Reverſion; and by his laſt Will and Teſtament may bequeath a bountiful Legacy to the Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62655:15"/>All this may be done, and it is the utmoſt that can be done upon a Death-bed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us now impartially examine, <hi>Whether all this will amount to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</hi> Such a Repentance as ſhall find acceptance with a Pure and Holy God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wicked Men when they come to Dye may remember their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuch remembrance being no other than the exerciſe of a natural Faculty, is neither Repentance, nor any part of that Saving-work. The vileſt Wretches do but too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Sins, and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that Carnal Satisfaction they had in the enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, this is not the Caſe. For ſuch a dying Sinner doth not barely remember his Sins, but he remembers them with Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is much troubled for the committing of them. <hi>And this Trouble, and Sorrow, and Compunction of Mind, we hope will be accepted as true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62655:16"/>
To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Such a dying Sinner is indeed very much troubled, and is under great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and perplexity of Mind. But let us now ſtrictly examine what's the occaſion of all this Conſternation? Is he ſorry that he hath offended God, that he hath tranſgreſſed the Laws of ſo gracious a Majeſty? This pretence is not probable, when we reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his former Converſation. He who made his own Will his Law, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied himſelf in any Carnal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; but tho' God himſelf in his holy World hath expreſly delared, That <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> things ought not to be done; yet becauſe of ſome preſent Pleaſure and Profit he is reſolved to commit them. He who was not only pleaſed with his Sin, but gloried in his Sin, and boaſted in his Sin; 'tis very unaccountable, that ſuch a Man all on the ſudden ſhould be thus ſorry for his Sin. 'Tis ſtrange that his Judgment and Appehenſion of things ſhould be thus changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62655:16"/>For his Conviction, I'll ſuppoſe him to be reſtored to his former Health and Vigour, and that the former Paſſages of his Life, in any inſtance, could be repeated. Being under ſuch pleaſing Circumſtances, can he then honeſtly and conſcientiouſly make this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation of <hi>Joſeph, How can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Man is now troubled; but for what? 'Tis not for his Sin, (which he never had any Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) but in plain terms, it is for the puniſhment of his Sin.</p>
            <p>He is indeed thus far troubled for his Sin. He is very much out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that he can Sin no longer; that he hath loſt his reliſh and inclination to it. It makes him heavy and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, that all his pleaſant Days are paſs'd and gone; and that nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but a ſad Reckoning and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all theſe things God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62655:17"/>
will bring thee into judgment.</hi> 'Tis this <hi>Judgment,</hi> this Reckoning and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that makes him quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>When a poor dying Wretch, who hath neglected God and his Duty all his life long, ſhall be now convinced by the decays of Nature, that his Soul muſt immediately be torn from his Body: When he looks upward, and there beholds a juſt Judge ready to pronounce a ſad Sentence upon him: When he caſts his Eye downward, and there obſerves that place of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that flaming Furnace juſt ready to receive him: When he now ſees and conſiders theſe things, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the days of his Vanity he had no leiſure to think on; and further reflects, that all this Miſery is now brought upon him by his own folly, and that with a very little care and forecaſt it might have been prevented. Being under ſuch ſad Circumſtances as theſe, 'tis but a natural Love of a Man's ſelf; 'tis no other than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Self-preſervation to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62655:17"/>
and perplexed. In plain terms, This anguiſh of Mind for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is loſt, and the Torments that ſhall be endured, is the very Worm of the Damned that dieth not. And if ſuch Sorrow and Vexation as this is true Repentance, then thoſe miſerable Creatures ſhall ſadly repent to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The dying Perſon is not only ſorry for his Sin, but alſo makes Confeſſion of it, and very humbly begs Pardon for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. And will not this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as true Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer.</p>
            <p>We are indeed aſſured by St. <hi>John, If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 John 1.9. But what kind of Confeſſion ſhall be accepted, the Holy Scriptures muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>
            <p>In theſe Sacred Writings we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten admoniſhed, that it is not an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Confeſſion</hi>; 'tis not a bare-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that we have done <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus</hi>; but it is a Penitential Confeſſion ſhall find acceptance. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62655:18"/>
confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. A ſick dying Man may indeed confeſs his Sins; but how far he can be able to forſake his Sin, that is, to amend and reform, ſhall be conſidered in its proper place.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>He not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, but he begs pardon for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and we have a gracious promiſe that at ſuch a time we ſhall be heard, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify me,</hi> Pſalm 50.15. And our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour hath aſſured us, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you,</hi> John 16.23. Now here is a poor languiſhing Creature in great diſtreſs and trouble, and will not God accept him for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>I anſwer;</p>
            <p>All the Promiſes of God in Jeſus Chriſt are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, moſt ſure and certain. But then you muſt alſo know, theſe Promiſes are condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and the performance of them on God<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s part, doth ſuppoſe certain Qualifications and Conditions on our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62655:18"/>
part. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. intimating, that unleſs we cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, and do thus perfect Holineſs, we have no title to theſe Promiſes.</p>
            <p>Indeed Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed, <hi>thoſe that come unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt them out,</hi> but will kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and treat them as Friends. But upon what terms he will receive them, and own them as Friends; he himſelf hath told us in theſe words. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you,</hi> John 15.14. <hi>And being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal ſalvation unto all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9.</p>
            <p>I have now ſhewed you, that actual Holineſs, or actual Obedience (which are one and the ſame thing) is the Goſpel-condition of Salvation. And if you can make it appear, that a Man who in the time of his Health was ſo far from the practice of Religion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62655:19"/>
that he contemned and deſpiſed it, nay, perhaps ridiculed and burleſqu'd it: If, I ſay, ſuch a Man when he is laid upon a Sick-bed, and is able to do nothing elſe, can obey the Laws of the Goſpel, and walk in the ways of God's Commandments, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you ſay ſomething; otherwiſe here is, as yet, but very ſlender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſuppoſe further, <hi>That the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon makes very ſerious and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reſolutions of amendment of Life. And will not the Mercy of God accept theſe Reſolutions? In ſuch a Caſe will not he take the Will for the Deed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer;</p>
            <p>That when Men are in a great fright, and are under the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome eminent Danger, 'tis then the moſt common thing in the World to make Reſolutions. What will not ſuch Men promiſe, if they may but eſcape ſuch and ſuch a Danger! The Vows of Mariners and Seamen in a violent Storm, are a noted inſtance of ſuch Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62655:19"/>Let us now ſtrictly examine, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or how far, God will accept ſuch dying Reſolutions?</p>
            <p>To ſtate this Matter truly, you muſt obſerve, That Religion is repreſented in the Goſpel as our reaſonable or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Service, and conſequently that the exerciſe of it muſt proceed from Judgment and Deliberation, not from ſadden Heats and Paſſion. We are admoniſhed by the wiſe man, <hi>Not to offer to God the ſacrifice of fools</hi>; but when we make a vow or promiſe to him, deliberately to conſider how far, or in what manner we can be able to perform it.</p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>Two</hi> Things to be conſider'd in a dying Sinner's Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Ability.</hi> Sincerity in his <hi>Intentions,</hi> and Ability in his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> it is not likely that a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner's <hi>Intention</hi> ſhould be ſincere; but that he may promiſe what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intends to perform. Such a Wretch who hath ſo far corrupted his Morals, may by the juſt Judgment of God be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62655:20"/>
depraved in his underſtanding and may vainly imagine that God is ſuch a one as himſelf. And becauſe he obſerves that frail Men have been often cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and have really believed him, whilſt he made Promiſes and Proteſtations of what he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he is ſo fooliſh as to fancy, that an Omniſcient God may be likewiſe thus impoſed on. And therefore he will be as large and as paſſionate in his Promiſes of Reformation, as the moſt notorious Malefactor ever was in hopes of Pardon. Whereas ſhould God reſtore him to his former Health and Vigour, he would then be as looſe and profane, as <hi>Luſtful</hi> and <hi>Intemperate,</hi> as <hi>Envious</hi> and <hi>Malicious,</hi> as <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Worldly,</hi> as ever he was before. We ſhould then quickly have him at his old Cant: <hi>The charms of beauty and good Company are not to be reſiſted. God forgive me, I am ſo uſed to this ſwearing, I rap out an Oath before I think on't. And I am naturally ſo paſſionate, I ſee I cannot help it.</hi> But <hi>be not deceived; God is not mocked: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap,</hi> Gal. 6.7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62655:20"/>But ſuppoſe the dying Sinner were ſincere, and did really intend that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which is now ſo ſolemnly promiſed; let him ſadly conſider, how unlikely it is he ſhould be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all this.</p>
            <p>For his Conviction, I muſt remind him;</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two</hi> things neceſſary to all great Undertakings. <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Ability</hi>; How difficult, if not impoſſible, it is for a ſick and dying Sinner to reform his Nature, if ever it hath been your own caſe, you your ſelves will be eaſily convinced. When a man is oppreſſed with pain, diſturb'd with Viſits, diſtracted with the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his diſſatisfied Relations: Amidſt all this noiſe and diverſion, What can poſſibly be done? what Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can be performed? Do but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think upon it, and your own Apprehenſions will excuſe my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing he had the greateſt Capacity, pray, what time is now left
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62655:21"/>
him to perfect ſo vaſt a Work? Evil Habits which have been long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, are not ſuddenly rooted out. When Luſts and Paſſions (by being often indulged) are grown rampant, they are not eaſily mortified. A tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Reformation is a work of time, and muſt be done ſucceſſively, and by degrees. This is fully intimated whilſt we are admoniſhed <hi>to go on to perfection. And to grow in grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what can that man do who is now a dying? When the Sentence of Death is paſſed upon him, and his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician hath given him over? To talk then of reforming his Life, when he now finds he can live no longer, is ſuch an intolerable piece of weakneſs, as in any other inſtance would ſcarce be heard with patience.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a dying Father, who had ruined his Family by his Extravagant Courſes, ſhould thus comfort his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, impoveriſhed Children;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be of good chear, I am now reſolved to be very frugal. I'll provide for you, and get you a good Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62655:21"/>Pray, what could be replied in ſuch a Caſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alas, Sir, you're a dying. You cannot lift your head off the Pillow. You cannot live till the morning. And how ſhould you get us an Eſtate?</hi> To tell them further, <hi>Ay, but I reſolve it, and I hope you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Reſolution would be but mean Satisfaction; and a very ſlender ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all their Wants.</p>
            <p>The Application is eaſy, and pray make it effectually to your ſelves. In ſhort; Promiſes and Reſolutions are not Performances. Nor were ever ſo accepted by God or Man. But you will ſay;</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He actually, thus far, performs his Promiſes and Reſolutions, that he makes Reſtitution, and that in ſeveral Inſtances. Will not this be accepted as true Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>That as <hi>Reſtitution</hi> is a moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty, to which all injurious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders are ſtrictly obliged; ſo it is the ſureſt Expedient to ſatisfy the Conſcience, and to convince both our ſelves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62655:22"/>
and others of the truth and ſincerity of our Repentance.</p>
            <p>But upon a ſtrict inquiry it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how difficult it is for a dying Perſon to make ſuch Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>For his Conviction I muſt remind him: That the word <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> in its Latitude, denotes <hi>Two</hi> Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The being reconciled to the Perſon whom we have offended.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>The giving him Satisfaction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Damage hath been done him.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To explain this further, we are to obſerve; That in Sins againſt the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Table, there is not only an Act of Diſobedience towards God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of affront and injury againſt our Brother. And he who truly repents, in both theſe Inſtances will cancel and undo, and take away his Sin as far as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine, how far both theſe can be done by a dying Perſon.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62655:22"/>1. The dying Sinner pretends to be reconciled to thoſe whom he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. 

<q>He declares, He is very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the envy and hatred, the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and malice he hath been guilty of; And aſſures his Neighbour he is now very real, and deſires that what is paſt, may be forgiven and forgotten mutually on both ſides. He is heartily troubled that he hath ever done him any wrong, and deſires <hi>him</hi> to forgive him; and withal aſſures him, that he himſelf doth now forgive <hi>him</hi> and all the World, as he expects to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given for Chriſt's ſake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is plauſible and ſeemingly pious. But let me thus expoſtulate with this dying Sinner.</p>
            <p>You ſay, you are now ſorry for the Wrongs and Injuries you have done to ſuch and ſuch Perſons. Let me ask you this ſhort Queſtion:</p>
            <p>Are you now able to affront them any longer? Is it in your power to do them further miſchief? Is not your Malice now bridled, is not your Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour limited and reſtrained?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62655:23"/>For your Conviction pray reſolve me;</p>
            <p>You ſay, you do now forgive. But were you thus ready to forgive in the days of your Health and Vigour? Did not you then, on all occaſions, expreſs your reſentments to the utmoſt? Did not you then gratify your Spleen, and take the pleaſure of Revenge when it lay in your power? What reaſon is there now to believe you, whilſt you proteſt you do forgive him?</p>
            <p>You ſay, you forgive him, becauſe you do not hurt him. You do not hurt him, becauſe you cannot.</p>
            <p>Again, You ſay, you forgive him. But what hypocriſy is this, to pretend to forgive, when you have had your Revenge already, and that to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, at leaſt as far, as your own ſafety, and reſpect to the Laws would permit you to take it.</p>
            <p>I'll explain this further to you, in this following Caſe.</p>
            <p>An inſulting <hi>Mahometan</hi> confines his poor innocent <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slave in a noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Dungeon, where with bad Air,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62655:23"/>
and worſe uſage, the poor Man's heart is broke. And being told, that he is dying, he pretends to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and gives order for his releaſe. But what a cheat is this, to ſay he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him, when he can keep him no longer? God hath releaſed him. For in the Grave, <hi>the weary be at reſt.</hi> There <hi>the priſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the oppreſſor,</hi> Job 3.17, 18.</p>
            <p>By the light of this Example you will eaſily underſtand the value and acceptance of a Death bed forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>And juſt at the ſame rate,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The dying Sinner makes Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Satisfaction.</p>
            <q>He is convinced that he hath inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch a Man, having wronged him in his Dealings to ſuch a value; And is now not only ſorry for the injury, but is alſo ready to make him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>And is not this ſufficient evidence of the ſincerity of his Repentance?</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Anſwer;</p>
            <p>It is indeed very pleaſing to God, that thoſe who have been wronged by you, ſhould receive ſatisfaction for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62655:24"/>
Wrongs you have done them. And if this Reparation is not made by you in Perſon, it muſt then be made by your Heirs in Reverſion. But withal you muſt be reminded; that tho' what is paid and ſatisfied by your Heirs, may in the ſenſe of the Law be called your payment; yet I much queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſight of God it will be ſo accepted.</p>
            <p>For to ſtate the Caſe fairly.</p>
            <p>You are now ready to part with your Eſtate, and to diſtribute it in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe you have wronged. But, pray, who thanks you for this, To bequeath your Eſtate when you can keep it no longer? <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> Luke 12.20. that is, they are then none of thine. So that Satisfaction in Reverſion is not thine, but thy Heirs. And he who thus makes Reſtitution, he only pays his old Scores, by drawing a Bill upon his Executors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62655:24"/>I have now diſtinctly examin'd what it is that a dying Sinner can be able to perform in order to Repentance. As alſo, what ſmall hope there is, that ſuch kind of Repentance ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by a pure and holy God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A man may remember his Sins; He may be ſorry for his Sins; He may confeſs his Sins; He may beg Pardon for his Sins, with firm Reſolutions of Amendment; nay, He may make actual Reſtitution to thoſe he hath wrong'd, and yet may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay,</p>
            <p>This is very harſh and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine; and we can ſcarce think that you your ſelf will be ſo ſevere and ill-natur'd, as to practiſe accordingly. When you viſit Sick-Beds, and hear a poor Dying Creature to lament his Sins with Tears, and moſt earneſtly beg Pardon for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt: When you obſerve how paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately he reſolves, <hi>That if God will but ſpare him, he'll become a new man, and never more be guilty of ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62655:25"/>What do you ſay or do in ſuch a Caſe? Nay, what muſt ſuch a wicked man do, who having lived a vicious Life, ſhall thus happen to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Death?</p>
            <p>Dare you be ſo uncharitable as to paſs the Decree upon him, and ſay, <hi>That he is paſt hope: There's no remedy, but he is certainly damned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dare not preſume to limit the <hi>Holy One,</hi> whoſe Mercies are Infinite. In ſuch a Caſe I will not cenſure, but admoniſh and inſtruct. I will exhort the dying Sinner to remember his Sins; to bewail his Sins; to beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his Sins; to make firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of Amendment; and where there is occaſion, to make Reſtitution. And having prayed earneſtly for him, and commended him to God's Mercy, <hi>Do I then ſay, Such a one ſhall be damned? No; I dare not. But do I ſay he ſhall be ſaved? No; I cannot.</hi> What then do I reſolve? What do I determine in this matter? I will be ſilent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing. For as I dare not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62655:25"/>
flatter him into a falſe and groundleſs Preſumption, ſo neither would I ſink him into the horror of Deſpair. <q>I ſay, I will determine nothing; <hi>I will judge nothing before the time. All that I can do, in this dark, intricate Caſe, is to</hi> commend him to the Extraordinary Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, to which we must leave ſome great Caſes, not knowing what to judge of them our ſelves. Poſſibly, God, <hi>who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> may pleaſe to let this Dying Sinner be a ſignal Example of his Unlimited Power and Prerogative, to ſave beyond all ordinary Rules.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it may be <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>thus,</hi> I dare not determine. What God can do, <hi>ex plenitudine Poteſtatis,</hi> or by his Prerogative, is not for us to diſpute. However, I muſt be ſo faithful to my Office, as to admoniſh this dying Sinner, That the Goſpel, by the Laws of which we muſt be judged, doth expreſly declare, <hi>That actual Holineſs, and actual Obedience, are the neceſſary Conditions of Salvation.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man hath been vicious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62655:26"/>
all his Life long, if God doth accept his Dying Reſolutions, 'tis more than he hath Promiſed: And 'tis more than he hath given us Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Preach and Declare.</p>
            <p>But are we not told in the Goſpel, <hi>That the Labourers were rewarded who came into the Vineyard at the Eleventh Hour</hi>? And that <hi>the Thief upon the Croſs was received into Paradiſe</hi>? And are not theſe <hi>Two</hi> Examples ſufficient for a Death-bed Repentance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very deplorable, what ſlight, trifling Pretences, what thin, fig-leaf Excuſes ſome men will make for the neglect of their Duty. As, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, may appear by a ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe <hi>Two</hi> Inſtances.</p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62655:27"/>This is the Parable. The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of which, the meaneſt Capacity will thus eaſily comprehend.</p>
               <p>Almighty God, the great Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, calls ſeveral Labourers, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> into his Vineyard, the Church. At ſeveral hours of the Day, that is, in different Ages of the World, and at ſeveral times of mens Lives. Thoſe who came in at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, that is, in the declining part of their Lives, they had their reward of Glory, as well as thoſe who came in at the firſt.</p>
               <p>From which Parable ſome Perſons have made this Inference.</p>
               <p>That tho' a Man may have loiter'd all the Day, and waſted the time of his Life in Sin and Vanity, yet if he comes <hi>in</hi> at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, that is, if he Repents, and is ſorry for his Sin at his Death, God will then both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and reward him.</p>
               <p>But this is a very groſs and fatal miſtake, and it is the greateſt Charity to make Men ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62655:28"/>Now in order to ſuch Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, I ſhall deſire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They who came in at the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> hour, they came in and work'd as ſoon as they were called. Had they been called ſooner, they would have work'd ſooner. Had they been called at the <hi>Ninth</hi> hour, they would have work'd from the <hi>Ninth</hi> hour. Had they been called at the <hi>Sixth</hi> hour, they would have work'd from the <hi>Sixth</hi> hour. Had they been called early in the Morning, they would have work'd from that time. This being the very reaſon they gave for their Idleneſs, <hi>viz. No man hath hired us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this to the Caſe of a dying Sinner now under the Goſpel? Who was called upon, and invited to work, not only at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, or at the <hi>Ninth</hi> hour, or at the <hi>Sixth</hi> hour, but early in the Morning, even in the very beginning of his Life; from his Childhood, in the dawning of the Day, he was called to this State of Salvation. But he obſtinately
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62655:28"/>
refuſed to work, and reſiſted the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Calls and Invitations of God, and ſlighted the Warnings and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Miniſters. He waſted his Time, and ſquander'd his Days in Idleneſs and Luxury; and being now come to the period of his Life, he only begs pardon for not working. I ſay, What pretence of comfort can he frame from this Parable, that God will reward him only for <hi>Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Wouldings</hi> at the laſt Gaſp? But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe Labourers who came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vineyard at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, tho' indeed they came <hi>in</hi> late, yet they work'd <hi>one</hi> hour, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued labouring to the cloſe of the Day. But had they ſtaid to the <hi>Twelfth</hi> hour, when working was over, and ſhould thus make their Confeſſion to the Steward: <hi>Sir, 'tis true, you hired us in the Morning, and we promiſed you to come and work. But ſo it happens, we have been idling, and loitering, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves all the Day. However we are now ſorry for it, and hope you will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62655:29"/>
paſs it by, and give us our Wages amongſt the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray, what anſwer would he make to ſuch Men as theſe?</p>
               <p>This is the very Caſe of a Death-bed Repentance. For the dying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth not ſo much as come <hi>in</hi> at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, but ſtays till the <hi>Twelfth</hi>; till <hi>Night cometh, when no man can work.</hi> He hath been trifling and loitering, revelling and careſſing all the time of his Life; and now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects at his Death that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, becauſe the Labourers in the Vineyard, who came not in till the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour, did receive their Wages equal with the firſt. But, I ſay, how great a cheat he puts upon himſelf in this compariſon, will eaſily appear from theſe premiſes to any conſidering Perſon.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, Thoſe who came in at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour they had their Wages, for they did work <hi>one</hi> hour. But what then? <hi>Therefore</hi> thoſe ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who did not work at all. This is indeed the noted Logick of a dying
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62655:29"/>
Sinner. But the Inference is too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling to deſerve a Confutation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Inſtance commonly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in favour of a <hi>Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> is</p>

               <p>YOU read his Story, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. from <hi>Verſe</hi> 39. <q>Our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour being crucified between <hi>two</hi> Thieves, <hi>One of them railed on him, ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If thou art what thou pretendeſt to be, a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> if thou art not a Cheat and Impoſtor, <hi>ſave thy ſelf and us. But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, Doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

and <hi>Romans</hi> do thus barbarouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>And he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Tho' theſe contemn and revile thee as mean and deſpicable, yet I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thee to be a Great Lord, and that thou haſt a Kingdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily, I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe</hi>; that is, immediately after thy Death thou ſhalt go to a place of Happineſs, and there abide with me, as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that my Kingdom which thou ow askeſt for.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the Story of the Thief upon the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whoſe Example, Carnal, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Perſons do thus encourage themſelves in their extravagant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
               <q>We are fully convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance. And we do as fully reſolve, ſome time or other, to Repent. But why ſhould we be ſo forward to diſturb our Pleaſures,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62655:30"/>
and neglect our Buſineſs as to do it <hi>now,</hi> ſince we may Repent hereafter at better leiſure? And tho' we ſhould be ſo far diverted, as not to Repent till our Death, yet we have here an encouraging Example, we ſhall then be accepted. This Thief had been very notorious and extravagant, an Offender of the firſt Rate; and yet when he calls for Mercy, tho' it was with his laſt Breath, his, <hi>Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom,</hi> was comfortably anſwered with a <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe.</hi> And therefore, tho' the greateſt part of our Lives, like this Thief's, may have been ſpent in Sin and Vanity, yet if we can but ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> with our laſt Breath, we ſhall likewiſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</q>
               <p>To this I</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'TIS a dangerous thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on God's Mercy. And ſo provoking is ſuch Preſumption, that if the bare ſaying of theſe words, <hi>Lord
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62655:31"/>
have mercy upon me,</hi> would ſave thy Soul; it may ſo happen, through the juſt Judgment of God, thou mayſt not be able to do it.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt dye ſuddenly, or thou mayſt dye Stupid, or raving-mad.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe thou haſt both Breath, and the uſe of thy Reaſon to ſay theſe words, here is very ſlender encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Example of this Thief, that a dying Sinner, who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented till his Death, ſhall then find Mercy.</p>
               <p>For to prove the Validity of a <hi>Death-bed Repentance,</hi> from the Example of this Thief, <hi>Two</hi> things are ſuppoſed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That this Thief was a very wicked Man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That he continued in his Sin, and did not repent till the time of his Death.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Now, if neither of theſe <hi>Two</hi> can be proved, then the Caſe of this Thief is not parallel, nor a firm foundation for the Validity of a <hi>Death-bed</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62655:31"/>1. It doth not appear, <hi>That this Thief was a very wicked Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is called indeed a Thief, and dies as a Malefactor. But now, a good Man, and who is ſo in the general Courſe of his Life, may by ſurpriſe, and the violence of a Temptation, be guilty of a very bad Action, of which he afterwards doth ſincerely Repent. The very Caſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> But further, he is called indeed a <hi>Thief</hi> in our Tranſlation; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Greek, Latro</hi> in the <hi>Latin.</hi> But what theſe words do properly ſignify, we muſt further examine.</p>
               <p>It was the Character of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Robber.</hi> So we Tranſlate it, <hi>John</hi> 18.40. But what kind of Perſon he was, may be infer'd from other places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of this <hi>Barabbas,</hi> That <hi>for a certain ſedition made in the city, and for murther, he was caſt into priſon,</hi> Luke 23.19. And St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, Chap. 15. Ver. <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>There was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them, who had made inſurrection with him,</hi> that is, at his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62655:32"/>
and Procurement. He was, it's probable, the Ringleader and Captain of the Rebels. The which conjecture is further confirm'd by the ſtory of this <hi>Barabbas</hi> in St. Matth. 27.16. <hi>They</hi> (that is, the <hi>Jews) had then a notable priſoner called Barabbas</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>an Eminent Perſon, a Man of Note and Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Barabbas</hi> then was the Head of the Party. Who as Zealots for their Nation and Religion, had made a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt the <hi>Romans</hi>; in which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt being unſucceſsful, they were puniſhed as Malefactors. And yet this <hi>Barabbas,</hi> tho' the Captain-General of a Party, is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Latro,</hi> a <hi>Thief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in Confirmation of this, I muſt further obſerve to you, That the word <hi>Latro,</hi> which is now a term of Ignominy and Reproach, and is uſually tranſlated, a Thief, or a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; did anciently ſignify no more, as the beſt Authors inform us, than a <hi>hired Souldier.</hi> And <hi>Latrocinari</hi> pro
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62655:32"/>
                  <hi>Militare,</hi> is noted Language in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this penitent Thief, as great a Malefactor as he is uſually ſuppoſed, was no worſe (for ought we know to the contrary) than a Souldier, who hapning to be on the wrong ſide, was puniſhed as a Malefactor.</p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſing,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Thief had been a very wicked Man; (which is more than was ever yet proved againſt him) yet, <hi>How do we know that he did not Repent, even long before he died?</hi> And if ſo, if he had formerly repented, then his Caſe is nothing to the purpoſe, nor can his Example, with any ſhew of reaſon be urged in favour of a Death-bed Repentance.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Thief was, 1. <hi>A very wicked Man,</hi> not a Souldier, as the word may be render'd, but a <hi>Thief,</hi> and a <hi>Robber,</hi> in the ſtricteſt Senſe. And ſuppoſing, 2. <hi>That he did not Repent till his Death.</hi> Yet I ſhall ſhew, <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti,</hi> that his Example ought not to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62655:33"/>
be urged in favour of a Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. As will more fully appear by examining the Circumſtances of this Thief's Converſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis poſſible he never heard of Chriſt till his Crucifixion.</p>
               <p>If he was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and not a <hi>Jew,</hi> 'tis highly probable he never did. For Chriſt, at firſt, <hi>was not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> And the Commiſſion, <hi>Go, teach all Nations,</hi> was not enlarged till the day of his Aſcention. If this was his Caſe, <hi>How could he believe on him, of whom he had not heard?</hi> So that on this Suppoſition, no other than a Death-Repentance was poſſible to this Thief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſing he had heard of Chriſt, and that he was informed by common Fame, that there was a Man called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who had done great Miracles: And that ſeveral had this opinion of him, That he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom God had promiſed to ſend into the World: Yet all this was but general and confuſed knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62655:33"/>He had indeed heard of Chriſt, and the ſeveral Paſſages concerning him. But ſuch was the Courſe of Life this Thief is ſuppoſed to have led, that he had no great curioſity to inquire over-ſtrictly into ſuch matters. But when it ſo hapned that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for Robbery, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to dye at the ſame time with Chriſt; this in all probability made him curious to inquire after him, and to learn all the Circumſtances of his Apprehenſion, Tryal, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. From whence he obſerved ſo much as convinced him, that he was the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, and had Salvation by him.</p>
               <p>But what encouragement is this to thee, O preſuming Chriſtian! who was baptized into Chriſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly inſtructed in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, even from thy Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?</p>
               <p>Had this Thief, as thou art, been early admitted into the Church; had he then been inſtructed in his Duty,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62655:34"/>
and conſtantly admoniſhed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it: And if after ſuch Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch Inſtructions and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had he ſtill lived upon the Pad, and ſpent his time in Roving and Robbing, in Luxury and Injuſtice; and had rejected the Warnings and Admonitions of his Teachers. Had this been his Caſe, we have then the juſteſt reaſon to pronounce, That a ſhort Ejaculation at his Death would not have been accepted; and his <hi>Lord remember me,</hi> would have been rejected with a <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not, thou worker of Iniquity.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Caſe of this Thief was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and extraordinary.</hi> And that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the Penitent, or the Grace of God in pardoning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Thief; probably he had lived in great Ignorance, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the means of Grace till now. And therefore to profeſs his Faith in Chriſt, when he ſaw him hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62655:34"/>
the Croſs, was very ſignal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
               <p>He confeſſed Chriſt when his own Diſciples fled from him, and when <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf denied him. Nay, ſo great was the Scandal of the Croſs, that all Men then forſook him, and loſt their Faith in him, and had no further hope of Help and Salvation from him.</p>
               <p>Now to confeſs and own him at ſuch a time as this, was ſo pleaſing and acceptable to our Saviour, that he makes him a ſignal Inſtance of his Grace and Favour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was very agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to do ſomething extraordinary on ſuch a ſolemn Occaſion as this. Thereby to ſignalize the Efficacy of our Saviour's Mediatorſhip, and that at ſuch a time, when the Dignity and Glory of his Perſon was moſt clouded and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured.</p>
               <p>From theſe Premiſes it appears, That this Inſtance of the Thief upon the Croſs, was miraculous and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62655:35"/>
And we have a known Rule, <hi>Extraordinaria non debent eſſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla,</hi> Extraordinary Caſes are no Rule for practice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had Manna ſhowred down from Heaven. Will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave your Husbandry, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect your Bread from the Clouds?</p>
               <p>Will you adventure to leap into the Sea, becauſe you read that <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſaved from thence? Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Thief as a <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Sea; A Miracle of Grace; a Prodigy of Providence.</p>
               <p>A King in his Progreſs paſſing by the Place of Execution, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Royal Favour, pardons a Thief with the Rope about his Neck; Dare you therefore be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to play the Thief, in hopes of ſuch a ſtrange and unuſual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</p>
               <p>And if you dare not thus venture your Life, your Temporal Concern; dare you hazard your Soul, your Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concern?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62655:35"/>

                  <label>To conclude.</label>Our Bleſſed Saviour in pardoning this Thief, in ſuch an extraordinary manner, hath ſhewed us what he <hi>can</hi> do, that none may Deſpair. But he hath likewiſe declared in his Holy Word what he ordinarily <hi>will</hi> do, that none may preſume. He hath plainly told us, <hi>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. And <hi>that every one ſhall receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10.</p>

But the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to perſuade you, give me leave to enforce my Admonitions, with the noted words of a truly <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Good Man,</hi> now with God.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>LET no Man deceive you with vain Words, or with falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſlight and ſudden Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Do not delude your ſelves with vain hopes, that this Work may be done at any time, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; and that if you can but faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your laſt breath into <hi>Lord have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62655:36"/>
mercy upon me,</hi> this will prevail with God, and make Atonement for the long Courſe of a wicked and ſinful Life.</p>
                  <p>What ſtrange thoughts have Men of God and Heaven? As if Heaven were an <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> founded on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to receive all ſick and maimed Perſons; that when they can live no longer to the Luſts of the Fleſh, and ſinful Pleaſures of this World, can but put up a cold and formal Petition to be admitted there.</p>
                  <p>No, no, as ſure as God is true, they ſhall never ſee the Kingdom of God, who inſtead of ſeeking it in the firſt place, make it their laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and Retreat. And when they find themſelves under the Sentence of Death and Damnation, only to avoid preſent Execution, and ſince there is no other remedy, do at laſt bethink themſelves of getting to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and fall upon their Knees, to Petition the <hi>Great Judge of the World,</hi> that they may be <hi>tranſported</hi> thither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62655:37"/>Can any Man in reaſon expect that ſuch a Petition will be granted? <hi>I tell you nay; but except you repent</hi> ſooner, and at a fitter time, and after a better faſhion, <hi>you ſhall certainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> As much as God deſires the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men, he will not proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſet the Gates of it wide open to thoſe, who only fly to it in extremity, but never ſought it in good earneſt, nor indeed do now care for it, or deſire it for any other reaſon, but to excuſe them from going to <hi>Hell.</hi> They have no value for <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe they are in no wiſe fit for it. But yet they think <hi>Hell</hi> to be the worſe place of the two.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid this is the true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of many a Man's Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who hath deferr'd it till he comes to dye. I do not ſpeak this to diſcourage Repentance even at that, time. I deny not the poſſibility of the thing. But to ſpeak the beſt of it, it is a very dangerous Remedy. For, alas, how unfit are moſt Men
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62655:37"/>
at ſuch a time for ſo great and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Work as Repentance is, when they are unfit for the ſmalleſt matter, and how hard is it for any Man then to be aſſured of the truth and reality of his Repentance, when there is no ſufficient opportunity to make trial of the ſincerity of it? I deſire to have as large apprehenſions of the Mercy of God as any man. But withal, I am very ſure that he is the hardeſt to be impoſed upon, of any one in the World. And no Man that hath any worthy apprehenſions of the Deity, can imagine him to be ſo eaſy, as to forgive Men upon the laſt Word and Intimation of their Minds; and to have ſuch a fondneſs for Offenders, as would reflect upon the Prudence of any Magiſtrate and Governor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God grant that I may ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live a Holy and Virtuous Life; and may have the comfort of that when I come to die. And that I may never be</hi>
