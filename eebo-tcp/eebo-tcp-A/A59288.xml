            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Play implores Your Patronage, it is an Humble Addreſſor to You, even for that common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Humanity, as the Reception of a perſecuted <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugee,</hi> hunted out of the World, and now a Shelterer under Your Hoſpitable Roof. And if Your Good Graces ſhall vouchſafe it that kind Entertainment, I Beſeech You to look upon it as a forlorn Brat, turned out abroad under the Curſe of thoſe Sour Grapes, the Faults and Misfortunes of the unhappy <hi>Author.</hi> And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, under that Prejudice that lours upon me; I may truly ſay, could I pretend to never ſo great an Intereſt in the <hi>Muſes,</hi> as that I am far from; I Plant but at a <hi>North</hi>-Wall, rear that Fruitleſs Nurſery, where I am certain to be Chill'd and Blaſted: So miſerable it is to live, where not one Beam ſmiles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50749:3"/>And indeed, a Poet, under a hard Name, groans beneath a perfect <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Subjection, where Sentence and Execution are ſo wholly Arbitrary, that the Black Robe, and the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring are ſent him, without Proceſs or Tryal.</p>
            <p>But the happier Favourite Quils, (Lord!) What Wonders can they perform! Can Write as the Famous <hi>Witherington</hi> Fought, upon their very Stumps. For,
<q>
                  <l>The Lucky have whole Days, and thoſe they chuſe.</l>
                  <l>Th' Unlucky have but Hours, and thoſe they loſe.</l>
                  <l>—As a Poetick Oracle tells us.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Poetry is ſo much the Creature of Favour, that 'tis not the Oar, but the Stamp that ſets the value. A Darling <hi>Muſe</hi> ſhall make Medals of what an Abdicated Scribler ſhall hardly paſs for Counters.</p>
            <p>But to leave this Melancholy Theme, the ſeverity of this poor Plays Fortune, and change to a cheerfuller Cauſe; 'tis now Lodged in the hands of Mercy; for 'tis Dedicated to Worth and Goodneſs; Titles, ſo properly Your own; that to a Natural Candour, Sweetneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, prideleſs Familiarity, and all that Generous
<pb facs="tcp:50749:3"/>
Diſpoſition of Mind, that warms where You Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and charms where You Converſe; You have the Additional Acquiſitions and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt Generous Education too, as no ſmall Superſtructure upon ſo ample a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. You challenge that bountiful Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Feather not in every Gentlemans Creſt, that we may trace Your Rich Fountain up to the Banks of <hi>Cham,</hi> as nurtur'd and cheriſh'd no leſs by the Beams of an <hi>Alma Mater,</hi> than Your own ſmiling <hi>Genius;</hi> Inſomuch that ſo truly accompliſht, You are equally furniſht as well for the Courtier as the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>And, faith, Sir, now I have named an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, he that with all the true Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Gentility, lives like Your ſelf, above the World, Attendance and Dependance the <hi>Cowlean</hi> Curſe far from his Door, a plentiful Eſtate his fair Field Argent, and a Bravery of Spirit to enrich that fair Coat, may be truly ſaid to be more a Prince than he that fills a Throne: whilſt free and uncontrould, within his own ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Province of Command, he Reigns more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, than the prouder Crowned Head in all his Realms and Territories, that larger Canton of the Globe; who beſides his Cares and Fatigues
<pb facs="tcp:50749:4"/>
(a pain You feel not) weilds but a ſhackled Scepter, under a bounded Dominion, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>But whatever ample Theme Your Merit fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me, I dare not be too bold upon that ſubject: for Panegyricks are only acceptable Gueſts where there's Pride and Vanity to welcome and receive them. But ſo extraordinary a Modeſty ſhines in You, that inſtead of attempting the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyriſt, I muſt rather check the Publication of thoſe fair Truths, though never ſo juſtly Your due, as knowing that You can eaſier deſerve Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums than hear them; under which ſilencing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon me, I can only conclude with ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing my ſelf</p>

            <l>WELL, Gentlemen, our Author bids me ſay,</l>
            <l>He Treats you with an Out-of-faſhion Play.</l>
            <l>His fair Court Miſs, perkt in her Raigning Glory,</l>
            <l>In the late Age had been a modiſh Story.</l>
            <l>But now the old dull Tale will never do.—</l>
            <l>And yet I'll Swear the Play has ſomething new.—</l>
            <l>New, did I ſay? Yes, if it has no more,</l>
            <l>Here's Two new Legs, you never ſaw before.</l>
            <l>Nay, and what's more, they come to Court you too:</l>
            <l>Ay, Sirs, You ſee what Wonders you can do;</l>
            <l>Bring a young Suppliant to thoſe Sweet Faces,</l>
            <l>To beg to our poor Play your kind good Graces.</l>
            <l>Faith Sirs, for once lay by your Critick Thunder,</l>
            <l>Not for the Senſleſs Poet, Hang him Blunder,</l>
            <l>But for Our ſakes Your angry Vengeance ſtay:</l>
            <l>Conſider, Sirs, this is the Womens Play.</l>
            <l>And when we wooe your Favour, ſure you are</l>
            <l>Not ſo hard-hearted to deny our Prayer.</l>
            <l>Beſides, let me intreat, baulk not a poor</l>
            <l>Petitioner, that never begg'd before.</l>
            <l>Grant me but this Firſt Suit, a Boon ſo eaſie,</l>
            <l>And in Return, I'll one day hope to pleaſe ye.</l>
            <l>Encouraged by your Smiles a Beam ſo fair</l>
            <l>Here's Two Good Works at once, for I Declare</l>
            <l>You will both ſave a Play, and make a Player.</l>
