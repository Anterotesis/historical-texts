         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THese Letters of Yours to Yours, had not seene the world, if you your self had not given just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the incivilitie. There was a time (I would it had never been) when you voted and principally caused the Sacred Letters of your Soveraign, and his Queen (the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net as it was stiled) to be made publick. There was a time (would it had never bin) when at <hi>Longworth</hi> you tore in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with your own hands, the Kings Commission of Array. Pretty devices these (Collonel;) but now you see the times of retaliation are come: I am very glad they are come, that such rebellious and inhumane persons may be in their kinde requited. <hi>I know your genius of old, being of long acquaintance, ever since you liv'd in Aldersgate-street, under the tuition of the</hi> then call'd Blew-nos'd Romanist your Father, who was the best Civilian in our Horizon, and a Sin-swinger, as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This last, I could have wish'd <hi>Casus omissus,</hi> but you thought otherwise, and return'd the

streames to the Sea, that is, your ebb of expences reflux'd to the Sins and Venerie from whence their Flood was. Pious use's money was spent in impious, and the Commutation fee spent upon Community. Let these Letters stand a charge for ever against you, higher then that for your life, and testifie what a Reformer you and your fellow-Governours of this Nation were like to be; who, if they were all so well decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered, I believe we should finde them as true as your self to the Smock, or your Page <hi>Dick, Pettingall.</hi> Blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers! <hi>Noll</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> or <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Noll, Ingeniosi nequam,</hi> Madam <hi>Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Mary Ward,</hi> and Old Nick take you, if you were not <hi>Ad perdendam Rempublicam &amp; Regem maxime idonei.</hi>

Like Master like man, is a very good Proverb, and <hi>Moll</hi> is as good in the dark as my Lady, and <hi>Dick</hi> as <hi>Hall.</hi> With what a battery of language dost thou storme that Castle, which surrendred at a parley of <hi>Harry Martens:</hi> Thy great Guns play'd night and day, before the sweet Rendition. Curst theif! what Qualmes she put thee in, before thou hadst made use of <hi>Astolphos</hi> storie, thy self, poore Lad, wert <hi>Orlando Furioso!</hi> but at last, what can hold out for ever?

Importunity is as prevalent as Gold; but Dick, learn these verses against the courting of your next Lady (if Madam <hi>Mary</hi> may not be totally yours now.)
<q>
                  <l>Pulveris aurati pluvia sit sparsa papyris,</l>
                  <l>Rescribet Danae solicitata veni.</l>

               </q>
What store of this golden powder hath beene strewd upon her let the lost Manours of that exhausted Collonel speak, whose Father did disinherit him in leaving him so vast a Fortune, as the Poet sings,
<q>
                  <l>Exhaeredavit te Philomuse Pater.</l>
                  <l>The Estate that's left an unthrist Son,</l>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32460:6"/>
I could, how <hi>I</hi> came to deserve (from men I mean) the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours I undergo in the losse of that reputation and estate <hi>I</hi> left behind me, bendes the manifest inconveniencies and difficulties <hi>I</hi> carry with me for the ietching out a pursued life in a strange land.</p>
               <p>Upon serious consultation (it seems to me) the Royal party could contrive no one sacrifice so proper to appease the ghost of their often foiled cause, both in point of revenge &amp; interest, as the persons who had the boldness to make an example of their Ring-leader.</p>
               <p>The report of the crimes charged upon me overtakes me wheresoever <hi>I</hi> go, though the reporters know not how nearly some of their auditors are concerned therein, and it runs to this effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extended or extenuated according to the severall affections of the relater.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>I</hi> with divers others about 11 or 12 years past, did sit in judgement upon the late King, and signed a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Execution, accordingly he was put to death, and I thereby became guilty of Treason and Murther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>I</hi> with some others did flie for the same.</p>
               <p>Thereupon calling a Court at home, and to the best of my understanding having acted <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> the Lion and the Moon-shine (with lesse partiality perhaps one way, then would have appeared the other in the Votes on your side the water) <hi>I</hi> stood clearly acquitted upon the whole matter, yet could <hi>I</hi> not satisfie my self with keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Verdict in my pocket, which (for ought <hi>I</hi> knew) might be serviceable for my Countrey, if by your meanes, and according to your discretion communicated; for though <hi>I</hi> doubt not but my fellow Commissioners now in question with you, upon that account are as well read as my selfe in the same truths <hi>I</hi> shall declare, yet considering they are to fence for their lives with Masters in the Art, and their Masters too, it will probably behoove them neither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, nor to exasperate.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:32460:6"/>1. My self far enough from both those cares, am content to acknowledge the bare matter of fact, that is, <hi>I</hi> did with others, about such a time sit in judgement upon such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and signed a Warrant for his execution, whereupon <hi>I</hi> believe he was after executed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Could <hi>I</hi> have foreseen how dearly publick freedome must be bought, and how hardly it can be kept, <hi>I</hi> would have used onely my passive valour against all the late Kings oppressions, rather then voted, as <hi>I</hi> did, any War at all, though a defensive one: for you must understand that this act, whether its name be Treason and Murther, or Reason and Justice, its Parent was a Civil War.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had <hi>I</hi> suspected that the Axe which took off the late Kings head, should have been made a stirrop for our first false General, <hi>I</hi> should sooner have consented to my owne death then his.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>I</hi> am satisfied in my conscience that the said King thought in his conscience he died unjustly; wherein (if it were not presumption too high for me) <hi>I</hi> should blame the Parliament for having alwayes forborn to declare unto him his subjection to the Law, nay for having upon the matter so behaved themselves towards him, as might encourage him to think himself unaccountable to man for whatsoever he should do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>I</hi> believe it was irregularly done of the Parliament, both in the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> case and in this, to order the triall of any particular person, their proper business having been antiently <hi>Legis lature</hi> and <hi>aeris dature</hi>: at that time the whole Parliaments work, and the Supreme Magistrates was devolved into one house. Whereunto neverthelesse no juridicative power ought to belong, though there be here and there presidents of it in former times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. My opinion is, that the way of triall by Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without a Jury was yet more irregular, for he ought not to have been put into a worse condition then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

Then <hi>I</hi> believe Mr. <hi>C</hi>— will be with thee either to day or to morrow morning with a small token of my love. But dost thou wonder that <hi>I</hi> should know thy minde as well as if <hi>I</hi> were in thy belly? why thou know'st mine, and if <hi>I</hi> thought there were ever a corner in it dark towards thee, <hi>I</hi> would set it on a light fire but thou shouldst see it. Oh the pitifull butter that thy man bought the other day! this <hi>I</hi> hope is better, but if it be not, I could not help it, for it was past nine this morning ere my doore was unlocked, and then the first businesse was to borrow a little money of one of my fellow prisoners, so that by that time I can send for any thing the best of the market is gone. Here is somewhat else for thee too, as bread, and beer, and spara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guss, and 3 s. to buy thee coles (for if your countrey be not hotter then this, you will hardly know it to be mid-day by the weather) which is more by 2 s. 9 d. then <hi>I</hi> was worth three hours agoe.

Since I wrote thus far, Master <hi>T</hi>— advises me to rid away the girle so soon as ever <hi>I</hi> can conveniently, for the strictnesse encreases, though no body knowes any reason for it.

And so good morrow to my sweet Soul, and the Gentleman that is as whole as a Fish, and to my least of brats, and to <hi>Clem,</hi> together with <hi>Betty</hi>'s commendations, that has been very earnest with me to send her a piece of Lamprey: I am fain to tell her that <hi>Glem</hi>'s Mistress must have the disposal of all <hi>I</hi> send.

               <p>I Do not thank thee for the hundred fine things thou sentst me last night by the woman, nor care for any thing thou hast done, or canst do, but coming to me; and that thou must do this day: it is already laid, thus; first thou art to make a rogue of thy self, then to take what guard thou wilt to the waterside, then a boat at what stairs thou wilt, that may bring thorow-bridge (the tide is ordered for the nonce) to be at the by-ward about one of the clock, and then come in with the crowd, but without thy brother or thy friend, or any body that has been seen with thee: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body will take notice of thee there, but one, that stands there on purpose to bring thee off, if need be. In case thou hast a couple of Squires to conduct thee so far, thou may'st

               <p>THy last letter got two six pences in it, and so thou thought'st to finde in this too, did'st not? but thou art mump'd; for I am resolved I will not send thee one farthing to day. Both my sisters brought their dinner with them, and dined with me yesterday, and the elder of 'um this morning sent half a dozen bottles of small beer, and some scraps of good cheer, whereof thou shalt taste, because it is in mammocks; so I gave the messenger just as much as I send thee. But monday will come, you Chits-face you, therefore I won't be jeer'd for a beggarly rogue, especially so long as <hi>I</hi> have leave to walk once a day into the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Porters lodgings, and on the top of his leads. I am able to give thee a bottle of rare Sack too, so thou canst keep it cool, either in gravell, or in water, with salt-peter in it; any other water will make it hotter; and to give thee a piece of roasting Beef, and a shoulder of Mutton; Veale <hi>I</hi> would have had, but the butcher dares not kill any for feare of the weather.

               <p>ANd thou shalt have a Letter <hi>(my own sweet Love)</hi> though <hi>I</hi> robbed a Copie of Verses of half a sheet to write it in: for my Nuncle, <hi>I</hi> thank him, has gutled up all my brown paper and white too. The reason why <hi>I</hi> did not write the last time <hi>I</hi> sent, was the hast my messenger was in, being with me by stealth, <hi>viz.</hi> the butchers man, for the honest porter is not suffered to come in: for truly <hi>I</hi> do not grudge thee my pains half so much as I do thy owne in scribling, and yet I cannot finde in my heart to forbid thee, because I need not tell thee how handsom a piece of paper looks that comes from a body's Dear. But now you talk of handsomnesse, let <hi>Peggie</hi> have a care, for if she get any pits upon her lips, I shall not endure to kiss her, unlesse her sister Sarah speak for her. I hope my little brats mouth is well, <hi>I</hi> liked her eating raw meat better then that of her mothers chewing hitherto: my Keepers mind holds for giving thee a visit to morrow about one of the clock; but thou shalt know the certainty in the morning, and receive something to receive him withall: and when you be together, I shall wish you both whipped if you do not contrive thy coming to me the next day after to eat a little fish. On Monday last my Lord M. and my daughter, and Jinny, brought 3 or 4 dishes of victuals and dined with me, but he got away all my wine that I had provided for thee, because he liked it: I know where that grew though, and in the mean time thou must be content with a bottle of such which my cousin Ned C— (who visited me the same day too) brought me for a special drink. So for this time I bid thee good morrow, and rest, my sweet Soul, thy own every day that goes over my head, every night too, whether I talk to thee or no, whether <hi>I</hi> dream of thee or no.</p>

Concerning the offer thou hast of a new Dear, there was a time <hi>I</hi> confesse, when I was such a Hog, as to think my throat cut by any body that would have a share in thee besides my self: <hi>I</hi> am reformed, but not the ordinary way, by not caring who enjoyes that which I have done taking pleasure in, but by binding up all my pleasure in thine: and as it has been pretty common with me to think that good bit tasted best which went into thy mouth; so still or more do I relish thy happinesse beyond my own; if it were not complementing, that is for fear of seeming to complement, I would tell thee, that I would not live: I am sure I would not beg to live, but because I finde thou wouldst have me live: therefore good Soul, if ever thou hast a design of satisfying me (which I believe thou art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without) study how to satisfie thy own mind, and there lie <hi>I</hi> as quiet as a Lamb. For all that, <hi>I</hi> cannot let thee goe without an item. My poor Heart, take heed of every body, especially of the fairest offers; thou hast been bitten, and bitten, and bitten by such as were no meer strangers to thee; by that time thou art a little older thou wilt take every word thou hearest for an errand lie, the world is grown so false. What <hi>B</hi>— saies I have not leisure to tell thee now. My brats will dine with me, and Harry C— brings them. <hi>I</hi> would fain have them neer me, and thee too, if possible. I rest.</p>

               <p>THy letter was very welcome to me, and that J need not tell thee; and how ill thou canst spare me and thy little brats, thou needst not tell me.

I had not my full swinge of discourse with her, because first a Gentleman, and afterwards my two sisters came in upon us: but this she told me, that in regard it was so long ere she heard again from you, she disposed of 60 l. which she had laid by on purpose, and has not now above 40 l. left, if that; besides, she believes the goods are rated high enough (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her skill without seeing) especially the Diaper and the Damask. Worse then all that, J. W. is newly gone into Berks, and will not be returned till the end of next week. Mr. L— came not yesterday. When <hi>I</hi> heare from thee what space is allowed by the articles for thy refusall, <hi>I</hi> will have another bout with the good woman; and as she saith, if they be richly worth the money, it is encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to borrow; if the pennyworths be hard, thy share will be the better in money.

Well, as thou say'st, when we have done our utmost then let God do his pleasure. They tell me, thou art about to take a maid, and J must needs say, thou hast need enough. Withall, though thou hast nothing left now to be robbed of, prethee take a care what cattel thou harbourest under thy roof, to sleep with thee and thy three arm-loads of treasure, onely it cannot be long (thou knowest) she can stay with thee: for if any luck ever serve, thou must go down without her, and take fresh in the countrey. Yesterday morning my L.L. was here, thinking (it seems) to finde L. with me, or that he had been with me. Some bargaine or other they have jumbled up betwixt them, which J am sure J shall like better then they believe J will, because J shall then know what to trust to, and not be drilled on much longer. Thy Court-news J do not value of a half penny, nor would have thee mind it, there is no sense in it.

               <p>NOw stand thy ground; I was told on Tuesday night, that the House of Commons had given us all up on monday, and had appointed a Committee to bring in a bill for that purpose, which cannot require much time, and if I wish any thing in the world, it is, that thou hadst been with me, when the tidings came, and ever since, to see if thou couldst finde any alteration in me, sleeping or waking. My paper is not quite ready for thee yet, but I am upon it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foot; and in the mean time, will give thee such cordials as ordinary people give to one another. Perhaps the bill will not pass when it comes in, perhaps the Lords will not passe it, when it comes there; perhaps the King has given way to his friends to set this on foot, on purpose to have the whole honour of pardoning to himself; perhaps some names may be excepted in one House, or in the other; and thy Deare may be one of them. He that has time, has life; a thousand things happen betwixt the cup and the lip: and it is some comfort that we can still send to each other. Visiting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed growes pretty difficult; but after the opening of my door in the morning, I have the freedom of the whole house till we have dined. J was not so hasty to send thee this news yesterday; J believe <hi>I</hi> had not now neither, but that <hi>I</hi> was afraid thou wouldst hear it from another hand, that would make it worse.
