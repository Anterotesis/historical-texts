            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN my former Letters I made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to your Reuerence, not onely of the ſtate of this our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the bordering Kingdomes, where by the goodneſſe of Almighty God, wee haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers who diligently trauell in the Vineyard of our Lord: but alſo I haue further ſignified vnto you, the fruit and increaſe which dayly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from our labours, ſometimes by Preaching, Teaching and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Mahometans,</hi> whoſe conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moſt hard: Other ſometimes by reducing the poore deceiued ſoules of the <hi>Armenians, Neſtorians, Iacobites,</hi> and other ſuch like, vnto the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are heere in great number; and haue little of Chriſtianity, more then the Name; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom wee doe much good, and gather great plenty of fruit into the ſtorehouſe of our <hi>Lord,</hi> which is the greateſt comfort wee inioy in theſe Deſarts of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>This onely heretofore, hath beene a diſcomfort vnto vs, that this our
<pb facs="tcp:14969:3"/>
Miſſion on our behalfes, hath gone on too fauourably, and hath not beene accompanied with tortures, torments, Impriſonments, and effuſion of our Blood, for the <hi>Goſpell of Chriſt</hi> which we profeſſe, and deſire to plant in theſe partes; as we reade of in other Miſſions; and are neceſſary for vs to ſuffer, aſwell for the teſtimony of the Truth, as for the edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and incouraging them to bee conſtant in the Faith; which hitherto <hi>God</hi> hath not beſtowed vpon vs, though we often deſire it at his hands, for confirmation of his Truth.</p>
            <p>True, it is, that heretofore there hath not beene wanting, nor yet at this preſent there is wanting, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and opportunities, to merit, and to offer ſomething to our Lord: yet generally the King heere though a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> hath heretofore alwayes ſhewed towards vs, ſo great ſignes of affection and loue; that for our ſakes he hath not moleſted any Chriſtian, vnder the name and title of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: But if at any time hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſome of the <hi>Armenians</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:14969:3"/>
deny their Faith; he hath done it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour, that they haue otherwiſe diſpleaſed him, or for that they had not wherewithall to pay him, that which they ought, or vnder ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretext; vntill now of late with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few dayes, it hath pleaſed his Diuine Maieſty in part, to heare our Prayers, and to comfort his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by giuing them a taſte of the ſweetneſſe, which thoſe inioy, who ſhed their blood, and yeeld their liues for his loue, though it hath not beene fully accompliſhed in vs, yet ſo it is that he hath giuen vs a little taſte, to ſtrengthen our hopes, that hereafter it may be fully accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vs; for not many dayes agoe, he hath bleſſed this Miſſion with the happy Death of fiue Martyrs, and watered it with their Blood: ſo that now wee hope that it will yeeld a moſt plentifull harueſt, to the great content of all our Congregation, but eſpecially to your Reuerence who hath beene ſo great a fauourer of it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other <hi>Perſians</hi> which in theſe laſt Monthes we haue Baptized
<pb facs="tcp:14969:4"/>
heere at <hi>Haſpahan;</hi> there were fiue (that is to ſay) <hi>Elia, Chaſſadir,</hi> (his Cozen) <hi>Alexander, Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brani. Elia</hi> hath ſerued vs ſometimes in our houſe, and was the Husband of that <hi>Thereſa,</hi> of which I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my former Letters, who was likewiſe Baptized by our Fathers; and after Baptiſme God gaue her ſo great Zeale; that like an Apoſtolike Woman, ſhee preached and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and trauailing into her Countrey, which is a Prouince of the Ringdome of <hi>Sciras,</hi> ſubiect to the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> ſhe conuerted diuers, and with the reſt the aforeſaid <hi>Chaſſadir,</hi> and in thoſe partes enkindled in them ſuch a deſire of Chriſtianity, as that the Gouernour of that Prouince ſent diuers times, and laſtly his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sonne to our Fathers in <hi>Haſpahan,</hi> earneſtly intreating them to ſend two Fathers vnto them, to the intent to teach them the Faith of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> which at that time could not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, becauſe the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was then incenſed againſt the <hi>Portugals,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14969:4"/>
preparing to wage war againſt them in <hi>Ormus,</hi> (being an Iſland of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> in the Eaſt Indies, ſomewhat further diſtant from the firme land, then his other Kingdomes are) as accordingly he ſhortly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performed.</p>
            <p>Theſe foreſaid fiue Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptized at ſeuerall times, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for ſome weekes, in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the holy faith, departed to make their aboade in their owne houſes. But we perceiuing the Kings indignation to increaſe againſt the <hi>Francans (Francks</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Christians</hi> that follow the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the <hi>Latines,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Greekes, Armenians,</hi> and others) thought it more ſafe, for them to retire themſelues to <hi>Ormus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> thereby both to ſecure themſelues from the Kings fury, and the better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo to confirme them in the holy faith: To this effect <hi>Father Iohn of St. Eliſeus</hi> (who hath bin long times Vicar generall of the reformed <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melits</hi> in theſe Countries) wrote vnto our Fathers, who reſided there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:14969:5"/>
to a Captaine of <hi>Ormus,</hi> that they would entertaine them, and prouide for them there, vntill the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation was ouer-paſſed. Hee ſent his Letters by <hi>Elia,</hi> as by one who beſt knew the wayes, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Country, and in whom he put the more confidence, for that he had ſerued in our houſe. <hi>Elia</hi> trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onwards with great alacrity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee fore-ſaw the great perill, whereunto he was expoſed, for at that time the Country was all in Armes, and <hi>Ormus</hi> was beſieged by the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But the ardent deſire, which this ſeruant of <hi>God</hi> had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing whatſoeuer for his ſake, made him ſet light by al dangers, and thence-forth chuſing only for his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion in the iourney, his aforeſaid Couſin <hi>Caſſadir,</hi> he went cheerefully forward, vntill that in his way, he was diſcouered by an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are reſident in <hi>Perſia,</hi> to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke with the King for Silke, which they finde there, and brought to be accuſed before the <hi>Chan,</hi> that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke that gouerned the ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:14969:5"/>
Kingdome of <hi>Sciras,</hi> in the name of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as his <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> who was going to the ſiege of <hi>Ormus,</hi> who preſently ſhut him vp in priſon, and ſearching him, found the Letters, which after he had peruſed, he cauſed him to be racked, and asked him what he was? <hi>Elia</hi> anſwered that he was a <hi>Francke,</hi> whereupon the Chan or Duke commaunded him, that hee ſhould ſpeake in the language of a <hi>Francke,</hi> but being ignorant of the language, he pawſed a while, and then ſaid, that he was a <hi>Christian Francke,</hi> (which is as much as to ſay, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue, a <hi>Chriſtian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> or one that yeeldeth obedience to the Pope) afterwards the Chan asked <hi>Caſſadir,</hi> Couſin to <hi>Elia,</hi> what he was, and whither he went, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what affaires? and finding him to be a Chriſtian newly Baptized, who went to accompany his Couſin, and that they had no other buſineſſe, but to carie the Letters hee found about them, out of the hatred hee bore to Chriſtians: the Chan begun to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged like a dogge, and endeauoured
<pb facs="tcp:14969:6"/>
by diuers meanes, that is to ſay, by threatnings, torments, perſwaſions, and promiſes, to make theſe two new Diſciples of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> to deny the holy faith, and to returne to the falſe obſeruance of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> But <hi>GOD</hi> (who neuer abandoneth thoſe which trauaile for him, and put their truſt in him) fauoured them with ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of his graces, that they ſet light by the threats, and torments, and reſpected not the promiſes of the Tyrant; but freely confeſſed that they were Chriſtians, and that <hi>GOD</hi> had ſhewed his fauour vnto them, to draw them out of the darkneſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and the falſe ſect and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to the end they might know the true and onely faith of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> in which they were both of them reſolued to liue and dye.</p>
            <p>The words of <hi>Elia</hi> like darts pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the heart of the Chan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with new indignation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to be caried into the ſight of <hi>Ormus,</hi> (eight dayes diſtant from that place where they were at
<pb facs="tcp:14969:6"/>
that time) and in the preſence of the Chriſtians of that Citie to bee put to death, in ſuch manner, as heare after ſhall bee declared. In theſe eight dayes of trauaile they were moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely handled and iniured, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during hunger, thirſt, and watching, to which the cruell inſtruments of the diuell, fierce in heart, and ſauage in behauiour, added another more greater, which was to labour diuers times, to take from them the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treaſure of the ſacred faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by threats, other whiles by promiſes, now by flatteries, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by ſtripes, vnder pretext to make them Runnagates and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes. But theſe true ſeruants of <hi>God,</hi> tried like fine gold in the midſt of ſo many perſecutions, ſuffered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all theſe cruelties, with ioy of ſpirit, and vnſpeakeable conſtancie, yeelding thankes to our good Lord <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> for the grace he beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on them, in making them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer, and endure anything for his loue, and for the holy faith, which they had receiued in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
<pb facs="tcp:14969:7"/>
Being argued in ſight of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> theſe fierce and cruell miniſters flayed an Aſſe, and ſowed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Elia</hi> in the skinne, and afterwards nayled him on high to a great peece of wood: he liued in this moſt cruell torment ſome houres, praiſing and bleſſing <hi>God,</hi> and preaching the faith of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> after the beſt manner he could. <hi>Caſſadir</hi> was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this ſpectacle, who in ſtead of aſtoniſhment, and looſing his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for the torments that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon his Couſin, was the more animated, and remained alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, confeſſing <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting with an holy diſdaine, all thoſe that counſailed him to returne vnto the Sect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which was the cauſe that they tyed him to a Stake, and ripped vp his belly. Thus thoſe two holy Martyrs finiſhed their fraile life, to the end to poſſeſſe and begin another eternall, and happy; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the miniſters of cruelty, and thoſe other Infidels that were there preſent, remained confuſed and aſtoniſhed, at the conſtancie of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:14969:7"/>
two Martyrs. I could not as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what became of the bodies of theſe two glorious Martyrs, but I hope that <hi>God</hi> will preſerue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſo great a treaſure.</p>
            <p>The Chan of <hi>Sciras</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by theſe two glorious Martyrs <hi>Elia,</hi> and <hi>Caſſadir,</hi> what thoſe three other Chriſtians were, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fathers Letters, were to be ſent to <hi>Ormus,</hi> and hauing notice both of their names, by which they were baptized, as for the others, they had when they were yet <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> ſignified the whole proceedings by his Letters to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſent him thoſe Letters which the holy Martyr <hi>Elia</hi> was to carie to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> The King hauing receiued this newes (who at that time was three Leagues from the Citie) commanded the foreſaid three Chriſtians to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, who were not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and commanded the <hi>Daraga</hi> (that is to ſay, the Gouernour of the Citie of <hi>Haspaphan</hi>) and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Campe, to repaire vnto our Couent, and ſhut vs vp therein:
<pb facs="tcp:14969:8"/>
which they punctually performed, locking, and ſealing vp the Cells of the Couent, and ſhutting all of vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Chamber: After this, they asked Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> whether hee thought he had done well, or that it were fitting, that hee ſhould be the cauſe of ſuch a matter, conſidering that the King had alwayes entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and honoured him? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Father anſwered, that hee came not into <hi>Perſia</hi> for the honours and fauours which the King had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him; but for the only hope he had, not only to conuert the King, but his whole Kingdome to the faith of <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> With this anſwer the Gouernour and the Captaine of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, departed, leauing the Monaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie full of Souldiers: <hi>God</hi> ſo would that one of the Fathers was yet faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (notwithſtanding that it was more then two of the clocke after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone) and thus conſumated hee the holy Sacrament. That night they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad vs to performe our accuſtomed ſpirituall exerciſes, beleeuing that we would ſet ſome Charmes, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries
<pb facs="tcp:14969:8"/>
a worke. Yet did wee that which vpon ſuch like occaſion, the Prophet. <hi>Daniel</hi> did. Your Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may conſider in what eſtate we were, the houſe being full of Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Sergeants that were Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, the gates of the Monaſtarie locked, when as we might not ſpeake to any of our friends, or know what was done, but were all of vs cloſed vp in a Chamber, preparing our ſelues to giue our liues for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> One onely thing afflicted vs, which was, that wee could not giue ſuccours to the new Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowing for certaine, that they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great neceſſity of all things, and for that wee could not counſell, and animate them, being doubtfull of their perſeuerance in the faith.</p>
            <p>At that time, wee betooke our ſelues to our prayers, beſeeching our <hi>Lord</hi> to giue them force, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, offering vp our prayers to the two holy Martyrs <hi>Elia,</hi> and <hi>Caſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir,</hi> to the end they ſhould interceede, and pray for them. Wee remained priſoners thus, for three dayes ſpace,
<pb facs="tcp:14969:9"/>
during which time, each of vs prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to dye, and made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confeſſion after the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we could. The firſt day we read the life of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr, the ſecond of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and the third that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Katherine.</hi> I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vnto you the conſolation, and inward ioy that we felt, nor the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or ſenſible apprehenſion and zeale of the Fathers: euery houre was vnto vs a thouſand, whilſt we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to giue vp our liues for <hi>Ieſus Christs</hi> ſake, and no leſſe able am I to expreſſe vnto you, the deſire which we had, that our deaths might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many torments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feruent acts which we did to that effect. We taſted (deare Father) of the force, and efficacie of Gods grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the fidelity which <hi>God</hi> vſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who expoſe themſelues to dangers, by the meanes of holy obedience; in ſuch ſort, that mee thought I ſaw, that which in ſuch like occations <hi>God</hi> operated in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day of our impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:14969:9"/>
the King ſent theſe Letters to <hi>Father Iohn</hi> (by a Secretarie, to the Gouernour of the Citie) which hee had written by the holy Martyr <hi>Elia</hi> to Father <hi>Baltaſer,</hi> and the Captaine of <hi>Ormus,</hi> with the interpretation of the ſame, but vnfaithfully and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly tranſlated by the direction of the Chan of <hi>Sciras,</hi> commanding him to certifie him, whether theſe Letters were his, and whether they were well interpreted, and that hee ſhould interpret them himſelfe, and call to his remembrance what honours and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours he had done him, and whether this was the acknowledgement which he ought him, and the reward of the bread and ſalt they had eaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; intending hereby, how often times the King had inuited our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to eate with him, perticularly vpon the occaſions of the arriuall of great Ambaſſadours, and at Feaſts, at which time, the King is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make great banquets, to which hee alwayes inuited Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> with ſome other Fathers, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them very much vpon ſuch like
<pb facs="tcp:14969:10"/>
occaſions, placing them alwayes neere himſelfe, feaſting them at his owne diſh, and doing ſuch like things: (This is a phraſe amongſt the Perſians to ſay, they inuite them to eate bread and ſalt, when they inuite to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.) Father <hi>Iohn</hi> read the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his owne Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the King had ſent him, and finding them full of lyes, and falſhoods; hee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted them, and ſignified to the Meſſenger, which was ſent vnto him by the King, that hee acknowledged the graces, and honours which he had alwayes receiued at his Maieſties hands, that thoſe were his Letters; and that it was true, that he had bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized thoſe fiue. And being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why he Baptized them? the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwered: why doth the King inforce Chriſtians to forſake their faith, and become <hi>Mahometans?</hi> as his Maieſtie endeauoureth for <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> ſo will I doe my vttermoſt for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in whoſe place I am here ſet: and for this cauſe, who ſo euer they be, that deſire to become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, thoſe will I freely baptize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:14969:10"/>
onely ſent into theſe Countries, with theſe my Companions, to that intent. The Miniſters deliuered the anſwere, which the Father ſent to the King, who was highly contented, both with the interpretation which the Father had made of his owne Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which he had ſent vnto <hi>Ormus,</hi> (being much different from thoſe which were ſent him by the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Sciras,</hi> tranſlated wholy into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſence, and as it may be thought, by ſome enemies of our holy faith) as alſo with his conſtancie, and for that cauſe, the King ſaid the Father had reaſon.</p>
            <p>Full two hundred <hi>Mulaz</hi> (which are the Doctors of <hi>Mahomets</hi> law) were preſent with the King, when the Fathers anſwere was brought vnto him, who making ſome tumult, and noyſe; and almoſt mad with anger, were aſſembled there, to the end to complaine vnto his Maieſtie, for that the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> grew out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and for that we had ſent more then fiue thouſand baptized <hi>Perſians</hi> into Chriſtendome, inciting him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb facs="tcp:14969:11"/>
the ſame, and prouoking his diſpleaſure againſt vs. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much diſpleaſed, turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towards them (after hee had heard the Fathers anſwere) reuiled, and taunted them with bitter ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, telling them, that the Father had reaſon; but that they were villaines, and old crafty Foxes, commaunding them out of his preſence: ſaying, for ſixteene yeeres ſpace, I haue frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Fathers company, yet hath he neuer told me any vntruth, neither haue I found any ill beſeeming beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour amongſt the Fathers, and I hold them for honeſt men. Hereupon the <hi>Mulaz</hi> departed, confuſed: At this time the King expreſſed the affection which hee bare to Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> which truly is very great, whereupon wee ſuppoſe, that the ſeuerity which at this preſent he ſheweth, and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vſed towards the Chriſtians his Subiects, as to the <hi>Armenians</hi> and others, euill intreating them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſometimes, that their children ſhould be made ſlaues, and forcing ſome of them to deny their faith, is to
<pb facs="tcp:14969:11"/>
no other end, but to giue ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the <hi>Mulaz,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in that hee feareth ſome reuolt, hauing perticularly diſcouered diuers times conſpiracies againſt himſelfe, whereby he ſtoode in danger both of his life, and Kingdome, wherein one of his ſonnes was intended to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which hath beene the cauſe that he hath put two of his ſons to death, and as it is preſumed, hath cauſed the third in like ſort to be ſlaine, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leaue one of his eldeſt ſonnes children, to ſucceede him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who as yet is a little Infant, and incapable of the Empire.</p>
            <p>True it is alſo, that the King natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is both angry and chollericke, both by reaſon of the conſpiracies which haue beene alſo addreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as for the death which he hath inflicted on his owne naturall children, ſo that this paſſion hath gotten ſo great power ouer him, that ſometimes he ſeemeth to be out of his wits, and at that time acteth beaſtly reſolutions. All theſe thinges being thus paſt betwixt the King, and the
<pb facs="tcp:14969:12"/>
Father, the King commaunded thoſe three priſoners to be brought before him, that were impriſoned in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Haspahan,</hi> by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence the <hi>Chan</hi> of <hi>Sciras</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, together with theſe ſixe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who deſired to bee Chriſtians, and were ready to receiue ſacred bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, being for this cauſe alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon. The King himſelfe asked them whether they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or no? to whom theſe <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> anſwered together, with two of the three other Chriſtians, (that is to ſay <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Hebrain</hi>) that they were none; <hi>Alexander</hi> onely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great courage, that he was a Chriſtian. The King commaunded him to forſake his faith, and to returne to <hi>Mahometiſme:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> with greater feruour, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, ſaid, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commit ſuch a ſinne, as to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe from the true faith of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> for the falſe Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that he hoped through the mercy of <hi>God,</hi> to liue and die a Chriſtian. The King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being ſtrangely
<pb facs="tcp:14969:12"/>
moued by this free and confident an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere (as one who was vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to heare replyes, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his commaundements) ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced him to bee preſently ſtoned to Death, and afterwards burned to Aſhes. The miniſters ſodainly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Kings commaund, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Alexander</hi> publiquely confeſſing <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> gaue him thankes, for that hee thought him worthy to looſe his life for his ſake. We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not as yet, learne the other particularities of this glorious ſeruant of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe the Execution was ſodaine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Citty: wee onely know that the Reliques are in the handes of the Chriſtians, and are kept by them with honour and reuerence.</p>
            <p>The other eight (that is to ſay) the two Chriſtians and the ſixe <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> who had beene brought before the King, with the holy Martyr <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> were by his Maieſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment led vnto Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> to know which were the two that were Baptized, for all of them had denyed themſelues to be Chriſtians. We thus
<pb facs="tcp:14969:13"/>
locked vp as wee haue ſignified vnto you, the next day following about an houre within Night, whileſt we were occupied in mentall Prayer which we vſe to make for one houre in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening and another in the Morning; behold the Eight inchayned Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, together with the miniſters of Cruelty, came vnto vs, commaunding the Father to certifie them, which of thoſe were the two Chriſtians. The Father animated and exhorted them, to confeſſe the true and holy Faith, which he had taught them, and that <hi>God</hi> had engraued in them by holy Baptiſme, and which they, with ſo much gladnes, had at that time teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and alſo ſhewed vnto them, that it was not lawfull for Chriſtians to deny the Name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> at ſuch time as they are conſtrained to confeſſe the ſame, and afterwards hee tolde theſe whom the King had ſent, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Hebrain</hi> were the two, which he had Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (for the Father knew that the King was well informed of all) one of theſe two relented a little, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:14969:13"/>
the Father had diſcouered him, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth certaine wordes, whereby hee diſcouered his apprehenſion of the danger, the other ſpake not one word. Heere we haue an occaſion, wonderfully to admire the meanes which his Diuine Maieſty vſed at this time, to aſſiſt thoſe two ſoules, and to crowne them with the crowne of holy Martyrdome, prouoking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the very miniſters of Cruelty, who led them to Martyrdome, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate them vnto Death for the loue of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> for one of them ſaid, be not afraid of Death, becauſe it is our moſt aſſured heritage: Thou art a Chriſtian, dye then in the Faith of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> Another ſaid this life paſſeth in a moment, you ſhall goe and liue with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> The laſt ſaid, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is aliue, and is not dead as <hi>Mahomet</hi> is; continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and you ſhall aſcend to the fourth Heauen of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they brought vs backe the Eight that were chayned together, and with them a <hi>Portugall</hi> called <hi>Sebaſtian
<pb facs="tcp:14969:14"/>
Duz,</hi> taken Priſoner by the Kings Souldiers in his Warres, and for that cauſe detained in Priſon in <hi>Haspahan;</hi> this did <hi>God</hi> ordaine for his greater Glory, and the ayde of theſe new Chriſtians: Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> iſſued out of the Gate, with Bread to diſtribute amongſt them, and to refreſh them a little, but the <hi>Catechumens</hi> would take none, yet did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Hebrain</hi> receiue the ſame, and gaue thereof likewiſe to <hi>Sebaſtian Duz,</hi> entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Father <hi>Iohn</hi> with a ioyfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and great contentment, who called all the other Fathers and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, for the common conſolation of all, and after he had exhorted the two Chriſtians to perſeuerance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare to confeſſe their <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Sauiour,</hi> who gaue himſelfe for our Redemption, and to eſteeme it to bee a great grace and bleſſing to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and to remember themſelues of the vertue, courage, and conſtancy, of their three companions, <hi>Elia, Caſſadir,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who like glorious Saints, enioy and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall enioy Eternall glory: whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:14969:14"/>
interceſſion he promiſed them, as alſo our prayers; but aboue all the ayde and aſſiſtance of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in their paſſion, and that their torments would ſeeme ſweet, and pleaſant vnto them: After this each one with teares in our eyes, imbraced each other, enuying their happines, and reputing our ſelues not worthy of ſo great a fauour, we tooke our leaue of them, and they departed comforted, ioyfull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted with a new Spirit; but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſad and afflicted, for that we were depriued of the Crowne of Martyrdome, which wee ſo much deſired: wee ſetled our ſelues to prayers, to aſſiſt them the beſt that wee could, conſidering that it was not permitted to vs, to doe otherwiſe, neither to accompany them as wee deſired, and as we endeauored to doe. But <hi>Sebaſtian Duz</hi> ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed our places, heartning, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and inciting them alwayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues like the true ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>Sebaſtian Duz,</hi> with the ſixe <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> in religion, were led through the Citty of <hi>Haspahan,</hi> and turned three times about the ſame, and were then conueyed to the Kings preſence, meane while <hi>Sebaſtian Duz</hi> with the two new Chriſtians, confeſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes (both paſſing thorough the Citty, and in the way, with a loude voyce, and in the Kings preſence) the Name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The King ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, commaunded that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Hebrain,</hi> ſhould bee ſtoned to Death, and their Bodyes to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that <hi>Sebaſtian Duz,</hi> with the ſixe <hi>Catechumens,</hi> ſhould be led backe to Priſon: and to this purpoſe it was Proclaimed throughout the Citty of <hi>Haſpahan,</hi> that thoſe that loued <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould repaire to the Execution place, with Stones to chaſtice thoſe, who had denyed the Faith of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Being arriued at the place where this Execution of theſe two happy Chriſtians, was to bee performed, The Gouernour of the Citty who is an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and hath abiured Chriſtian Religion,

               </gap>t him, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelfe to perſwade theſe two Martyrs, to make profeſſion of the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> attempting them, with their ordinary, carnall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall reaſons, promiſing them not onely their liues, and the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but alſo great Rewards, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that not onely the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and hazarded their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo the credit of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Mahomet: Ioſeph</hi> anſwered with great courage, ſaying; That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were the firſt that denyed himſelfe to bee a Chriſtian, at ſuch time as the King queſtioned him thereupon, yet now in no ſort hee would commit ſuch an errour, for that the offence he had committed was too great already, when in the Kings preſence hee had denyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee a Chriſtian, hoping that our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo much fauour, as to call him to become a Chriſtian, would now giue him grace and force to ſuffer Death for his loue: Whereupon
<pb facs="tcp:14969:16"/>
they that were about him, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Mulaz</hi> tooke vp ſtones to ſtone him, which, whileſt they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Saint hauing his Head al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready broken and in peeces, cryed out with a loude voyce: Bleſſed bee the holy Name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> his Faith is holy and true; and that of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> is falſe, and no man can be ſaued thereby; But Brethren <hi>God</hi> pardon you, and giue you his holy light: tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them further, that hee felt no paine. <hi>Hebrain,</hi> that was the laſt to dye for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> was tempted and likewiſe aſſaulted anew, to deny the holy Faith, and to profeſſe and proteſt that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whereunto hee anſwered; that he would not doe it, and that hee was a true Diſciple of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the true <hi>God,</hi> and true Man, wiſhing them, that they ſhould not looſe any more time to perſwade him to ſuch lyes, and that they ſhould not delay any longer, to beſtow that Crowne on him, which his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons enioyed in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and that he was diſpoſed to ſhed his Blood for him, and for his Loue, who with ſo
<pb facs="tcp:14969:16"/>
great exceſſe of loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had giuen his Corporall life for them and him, to the end to giue them an Eternall life: And whileſt they bound and faſtned him to the ſtake, he ſaid to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Execution, that hee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them, and deſired that <hi>God</hi> would not demaund accompt of his Blood at their hands. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expreſſe with what rage theſe Miniſters of the Deuill ſtoned this holy Martyr, out of the diſpite they had, for that they could not peruert him, whereupon they remained wholly confuſed and derided by all men. Hauing ſtoned theſe two Saints, they burned their Bodyes, and ſet a watch ouer the reliques and aſhes of the Saints, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Chriſtians gathered them all vp, ſo that nothing was left vnpreſerued.</p>
            <p>The Kings Miniſters repented themſelues for that they had Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Martyrs, becauſe they did not beleeue, that ſo great a conſtancy could bee in the Saints, conſidering the torments which they ſuffered,
<pb facs="tcp:14969:17"/>
and the rather, becauſe they ſaw ſo great a murmure amongſt the people, who flocked together in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to ſee the ſpectacle they had neuer ſeene, and they openly ſaid, that the faith of the Chriſtians was more ſtrong, and better then theirs: Whilſt this Martyrdome was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee that were locked vp, and guarded by our ordinary Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, prayed <hi>God</hi> that his holy name might be ſanctified in theſe his Saints. Not long after this the King departed and went to <hi>Kanda,</hi> where his Army attended him; but before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hee cauſed the <hi>Catechumens</hi> in Chriſtian Religion, to be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ordained, that not onely they ſhould haue their free liberty, but that they ſhould be honoured, and and left free as they were before, to doe their offices in our Church.

But <hi>GOD</hi> draweth the beſt from all things, for by this perſecution, wee haue gotten the loue of diuers <hi>Perſians,</hi> and are in good reputation with them, and thoſe that kept vs, teſtifie our pouerty in all places, and that we are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which wee could not haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our proſperity. The ſenſible apprehenſion that all the Citie ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, giues vs great occaſion to praiſe <hi>God,</hi> becauſe all of them thought, that wee ſhould haue beene put to death, by diuers torments. For go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once along the Citie, and making ſome little walke, preſently after the death of theſe Martyrs, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held vs, with ioy and contentment, and great reuerence, bleſſing <hi>GOD.</hi> Although as yet, wee are vnder the afore-ſaid guard, and in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, yet doe we ſay our offices in the Church, and we ring our bells
<pb facs="tcp:14969:18"/>
(which are very good) as we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as you doe in <hi>Europe,</hi> and notwithſtanding our need of money, wherewith we are preſſed, yet within theſe few dayes, wee haue bought a very good Bell, for feare leaſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee broken, hoping in <hi>God</hi> that we ſhall one day ſee them, in the beſt Idolatrous Church in this Citie (that is to ſay) in the Synagogue of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Wee remaine very much comforted, and the rather becauſe wee already ſee the efficacie of the interceſſion, which thoſe fiue Martyrs make for this Miſſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the fruit of their bloud, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is watered, hoping to haue greater one day, and to ſee through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole Kingdome, the holy Croſſe triumphantly erected, which <hi>God</hi> graunt for his great and infinite mercy ſake.</p>
            <p>The Parents of the Martyrs are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well affected towards vs, diuers of the moſt Learned and Principals of <hi>Haſpahan,</hi> ſend vs ſalutations, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelues, that for the preſent they cannot come to ſalute vs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:14969:18"/>
becauſe as yet thoſe thinges that are paſt, are new, and freſh in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And although we are thus cloſed vp, I will not ſay Impriſoned, yet ſome haue not failed to come vnto vs (although with great danger) impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning vs to Baptize them. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three Territories of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Chriſtians, who are vnder the Kings Obedience (as at other times I haue certified your Reuerence by my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) had playde the Apoſtataes, in another Perſecution, and were for the moſt part become <hi>Mahometans,</hi> (although as I beleeue it was not in heart) by the example of theſe fiue Martyrs, they haue all of them decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues to bee Chriſtians, and proteſt they are ready to dye for CRHISTS ſake and his Loue. The King hath taken no notice hereof, but hath commaunded, that euery one ſhould liue according to that Faith wherein hee was borne, and to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Forty Territories, he hath made reſtitution of their Chriſtian Bookes, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, when they abjured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14969:19"/>Theſe are the fruites of the Death, and interceſſion of theſe Fiue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Martyrs. There are ſome, that for the preſent labour to put this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation into an authenticall forme by a publique Notary, with many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which were preſent at this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Martyrdome, amongſt which there ſhall bee the Miniſters of the King: which once obtained, I will ſend it to your Reuerence, with all the other particularities that may be knowne, to the end, you may make vſe of them at <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>I will certifie your Reuerence no further as touching the workmen in this Miſſion, leaſt I ſhould grow too tedious, but this, that they liue in great obſeruance, and with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as if this houſe were a Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and they Nouices. They hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly require the Prayers of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and eſpecially and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of your Reuerence, and your holy Benediction, in which wee haue much confidence.
