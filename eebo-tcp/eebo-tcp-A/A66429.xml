            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, &amp;c.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words, there is contained (as I have before ſhewed)</p>
            <p n="1">1. A deſcription of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis God's <hi>ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. That God has actually revealed his Will <hi>at ſundry times, and in divers manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What are the Characters of true Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62726:4"/>
3. I am now in order to prove that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> do contain the Matter of Divine Revelation, and have upon them the Characters belonging to it.</p>
            <p>For the better diſpoſing of what I have to ſay under this Head of Diſcourſe, I ſhall obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis one thing to aſſert and prove the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture to be true, and another to prove it to be of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis one thing to prove the matter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be of Divine Revelation, and another to prove theſe Books to be of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis one thing to aſſert that there were once ſuch Books ſo inſpired; and another thing to prove this Set of Books, which now make up and compoſe the Canon of the Old and New Teſtament, to be thoſe very Books.</p>
            <p>From hence ariſe Four Queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. How we can prove the Matter of Scripture to be true?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. How we can prove the Matter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be of Divine Revelation? Books of mere Human Compoſition may contain nothing but Truth, without any Supernatural Aſſiſtance;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62726:4"/>
and therefore though we were never ſo well able to maintain and prove the Truth of the Matter, that is not ſufficient, unleſs we can advance high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and prove the Authority and Divinity of the Matter?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. How we can prove thoſe Books to be of Divine Inſpiration? The Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> was ſometime read in the Church (as the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> anciently was, and is now with us) becauſe of the Excellency and Profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Matter; but yet it was not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Canonical, and of immediate Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. How we prove theſe Books, that are now extant and received by the Chriſtian Church as Canonical, to be thoſe Books which were once in time paſt wrote by Inſpiration from God?</p>
            <p>It will be of ſome uſe to us in the proſecution of this Argument, to conſider the Firſt Queſtion, concerning the Truth of the Matter of Scripture, by it ſelf, and apart from the Divine Authority of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Matter of Scripture is of various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as Morality, Doctrinal Revelation, Inſtitution, Prophecy and Hiſtory: Of which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62726:5"/>
the greateſt part will be here ſet aſide: For it is not neceſſary to prove the Truth of the Moral part of it, which is no other than the Dictate of Nature; and therefore, though explain'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and illuſtrated in Scripture by many uſeful Rules, Principles and Obſervations, needs no proof.</p>
            <p>That of Doctrine and Inſtitution, falls in with the Divine Authority, and ſo belongs to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Prophecy, if yet to be accompliſhed, is not capable of other proof than Revelation; and if already fulfilled, by the Event following and correſpondent to the Prediction, it is the proof of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>So that the Part now remaining to be proved more eſpecially, is Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Hiſtory; which is a Relation of matter of Fact, of what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, been declared, or done, in the ſeveral Periods and Ages of the World for Four thouſand Years together, and upwards.</p>
            <p>Under which Notion, I do not queſtion but it may be made appear, That there is more to be ſaid for the truth of Scripture-Hiſtory, than for any thing of that kind in the whole World.</p>
            <p>I don't queſtion again, but it may be made appear, that no Authors had greater advantages for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62726:5"/>
Information in the Subjects they treat of; nor were there ever any Writings that bore upon them more ample marks of Ability, Impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Care. So that if after all <hi>that</hi> is to be ſuſpected, nothing of that kind is certain, and we call in queſtion all matters of the like nature whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But this is further to be inquired into.</p>
            <p>Now of this kind, there are ſome things to be found only in Scripture, and no where elſe. In which caſe we have no other way to judge of the truth of it, than by the Credibility of the matter, the Self-agreement, its Concordance with time, place, and other circumſtances of Action, together with the Credit and Reputation of the Pen-men of it.</p>
            <p>But there are other things which fall in with other Writings; and then beſides the former way of trial, we are to have recourſe to ſuch Books, to compare them, and determine concerning the truth by ſuch a compariſon.</p>
            <p>So that we have three ſorts of Proof before us, or ſo many Characters by which we may judge concerning the Truth of what the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62726:6"/>
1. The Credibility of the Matter therein revealed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Self conſiſtence and Self agreement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its concordance with other Books of good and ſufficient Authority; where ſuch there are.</p>
            <p>And if this be made out, we have as much Evidence for the Truth of Scripture as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have, in our circumſtances; and where the Matters related were tranſacted in place and time far remote from us. For all the Evidence we can have, is to be reſolved into Teſtimony, and that Teſtimony into the Credibility of the Relators, or of the Matters related: And if we have as much Evidence of this kind as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing will bear and admit, we have as much as is reaſonable in it ſelf, and ſufficient to ground a certainty upon. For according as the nature of the thing is, and the ground upon which its Proof and Evidence depends, ſuch is the Certainty: And as in things Mathematical, Demonſtration is the Proof; and in things Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Senſible, Senſe is the Proof; and in things Rational and Moral, Reaſon and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the Proof; ſo in Matters of Fact (where we our ſelves are not preſent) Teſtimony and Records are the Proof; though for a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62726:6"/>
of it, there is the collateral proof of Moral Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> the credibility of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Perſons, into whoſe Teſtimony and Veracity the Matters are finally reſolved. And beyond this we cannot go, in the Evidence for the truth of the Matters of Fact; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if we have this Evidence, we have as great a certainty in things of this nature, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration is in things Mathematical, and Senſe in things ſenſible; I ſay, beyond this we cannot go, unleſs we advance to ſupernatural Evidence; but that belongs not to this place.</p>
            <p>So that here we have no reaſon to doubt; and where there is no reaſon to doubt, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. And if we can be certain of any thing we our ſelves have not ſeen, or been preſent at, we may be certain of what is recorded in the Scripture: Since there is no Evidence for any thing of that kind, which we have not for the Truth of Scripture; and I may ſay we have that Evidence for it, which no Matters of Fact beſides have. If then there be any certainty in ſuch things, if any credit be to be given to them; then there is here a ſufficient Evidence to ground that Certainty and our Belief of it upon: And if there be no certainty in them, and no ground to believe them; then there is no certainty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62726:7"/>
in the world, and no credit to be given to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, or has been allow'd by others in the world: Then there is no more credit to be given to the Commentaries of <hi>Caeſar</hi> (which he wrote himſelf) nor to the Hiſtories of the Four Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, nay to thoſe of our own Nation; than there is to <hi>Achilles Tatius</hi> or <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> than to the Vaineſt Romances, the Fables of Poets, or the Legends of the moſt Superſtitious and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Ages of the world.</p>
            <p>And with all our Hiſtories, though never ſo famed, and commonly received; we are in no better a condition, than if <hi>Varro</hi>'s <hi>fabulous and obſcure Age</hi> had been continued, and all the Ages were now this day what it was before the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads,</hi> wrapt up in Invention and Conjecture.</p>
            <p>But if there be any credit to be given to ſuch Memorials, and that we read approved Hiſtories with another ſort of appetite and aſſurance, than we do Fables; and that we read <hi>Lucan</hi> (a Poetical Hiſtorian) with another ſort of reliſh than <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſes;</hi> then the like Credit is to be given to the Scriptures as to any; and ſo much the more, as the Evidence proper to its kind is beyond the Evidence we have for any other Writings whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62726:7"/>
And this I ſhall undertake and proſecute, by proving,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Scripture has ſufficient Evidence of that kind to ground a certainty upon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it has all the Evidence that any Writings or Matters of this kind have, and more.</p>
            <p>In order to which it may well ſerve as an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to what is to follow, briefly to reflect upon the Writers themſelves and their Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; upon whoſe Credit and Authority there muſt be confeſſedly ſometimes an abſolute reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Since the Relators of matters of Fact profeſs not to Write out of their own Heads, but to receive what they Write from a conſtant and uninterrupted Tradition, or to Collect from the beſt Records and Memorials, or to ſet down what is of their own Knowledge and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore the Reputation of their Reports and Narratives doth very much depend upon their Skill and Judgment, that they be not abuſed by falſe Informations, and upon their Honeſty and Integrity in not putting abuſes upon the World.</p>
            <p>As for the ways of Information, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind wanting in the Sacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62726:8"/>
For the Firſt Writer, <hi>Moſes,</hi> lived ſo near upon the Traditionary Age, and the things he Writes of are of ſuch a nature, as may well be ſuppoſed to be deliver'd down without any difficulty from Progenitors to Poſterity, had there been no other means of Conveyance; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (as has been before ſuggeſted, Sermon II.) if we conſider the few hands they were to paſs through, when at the moſt Eight Perſons only in ſucceſſion continued the Line of above Two thouſand five hundred years, from the Deluge to the time of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that the Matters were ſnch as all thoſe held themſelves concerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them down as they had received them. Foraſmuch as all the Prophecies they had receiv'd, which concerned the Good of Mankind, and of their Poſterity, depended upon the careful and faithful preſervation of theſe Memorials; both as to Time and Pedigrees, as well as the Matters which the Series of Times and Deſcents were to be the great Supporters of.</p>
            <p>From hence it was afterwards that theſe Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Tables, and Genealogical Rolls were in all times exactly kept, and which upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they might have recourſe to; and that there were Annals in future Ages that were looked upon as Sacred Repoſitories: And from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62726:8"/>
whence the Holy Writers drew their Materials, and to which they do Refer, as may be obſerved in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we add hereunto, That a great part of what is the Subject of Holy Writ, was what the Writers themſelves had the Perſonal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, bore a part in, and what happened in their own Times; it gives the greater Authority to what they have Written. And this was the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> as to the Four laſt of his Books; of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of the Prophets, and of the Evangelical Writers. So that if we will grant any thing to be allowed to Tradition, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Ages, to Reports of Eye and Ear-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, there is the higheſt Credit to be given to the Divine Authors, in what they have Collected and made Report of. And what has been done with ſo much Faithfulneſs, Impartiality, and Judgment (as their Compoſers teſtify) that even that what tends to the diſparagement of their Nation and Anceſtors, their Families and Perſons, is not concealed, when it might tend to the Glory of God, the Reaſons of the Divine Proceedings towards them, or the giving any Life to the Matters they Relate. A practice rarely to be obſerved in other Authors; and when it is, doth give Credit to what they Report.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62726:9"/>
But the chief thing is the Credibility of the Matter (which I ſhall now proceed to)</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Credibility of the Matter, which is a ſtanding Character that we are to judge of the Truth of a Relation by.</p>
            <p>But then we muſt judge aright concerning the Credibility of it. For that at firſt ſight may ſeem to be Incredible, which upon farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and examination may prove to be Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6. 8. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> It might ſeem a thing Incredible at the firſt propoſal, as it did to the <hi>Athenians Acts</hi> 17. 32. but the Apoſtle ſtates the Caſe right, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35. in Anſwer to that Queſtion, <hi>Some man will ſay, How are the dead raiſed up, and with what body do they come? thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die. And that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but God giveth it a body,</hi> &amp;c. Where he firſt of all confirms it by a like Inſtance in Nature, and then reſolves it into the Power of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis for want of theſe Two Conſiderations, that is, of the Underſtanding of Nature, the Order, Power, and Operation of ſecond Cauſes; and of the Power of God, the Supreme Cauſe, that we often miſtake about the Credibility of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62726:9"/>
things; and judge that to be Impoſſible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, which in it ſelf, and often in the Event proves to be Poſſible and Credible.</p>
            <p>And thus it frequently fares in matters of Fact, of the Credibility or Incredibility of which, we are as liable to miſtake, as about the Poſſibility or impoſſibility of Effects in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; when we judge of other Nations and Ages by our own, and of what we do not know, by what we do; and ſometimes are ſo vain as to reaſon againſt others Experience and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus it was with the Ancients, that thought the Torrid-Zone Uninhabitable; and with others, that accounted the Opinion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes Fabulous and Impoſſible. Hence it is that the Errors of former Writers are ſo often Corrected by Modern Obſervations. But this we may confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm of the Holy Scripture, that after it has ſtood the Teſt of above Three thouſand Years in whole or in part (for ſo long is it ſince the time of <hi>Moſes)</hi> and that nothing has been left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by its Adverſaries to overthrow its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it has yet maintained it, ſo as to be the moſt Exact, Faithful, and Impartial Relation the World ever had.</p>
            <p>For the better Judging of whoſe Veracity, and Confirming its Credibility, we may obſerve;</p>

1. That a great part of it carries with it its own Evidence, and has the common Conſent of Mankind to atteſt it. Such I account the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, the Formation of Man, and the Degeneracy of Human Nature, to be. The firſt of theſe was univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; nor was the Creation of the World ever Queſtioned or Diſputed, till above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years after the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was of that Opinion, acknowledges, <hi>de Coelo, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>). And the laſt was the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all Ages.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a Relation of ſuch things in Scripture, as have in them the face and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth; and of which no certain or tolerable account can be given by any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Hiſtory that are, or ever were extant in the World. Such are the Age of the World; the Diſperſion of Nations; the Variety of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; the Diſtribution of Time, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if the Account given of theſe things in Scripture be True, we are capable of Solving the greateſt Difficulties as to theſe Matters. And that they are True, there is good Reaſon to conclude. As for Inſtance, let us conſider the Inſtances before given, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62726:10"/>
(1.) The Origine of the World as it is in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi> I acknowlege there may be nothing in the Compoſition of it, or in the Courſe of Nature, to determine this Point more in favour of <hi>Moſes,</hi> than of the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans,</hi> or <hi>Chineſe.</hi> But to lay aſide all other Arguments from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of Arts and Sciences, and the reputed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of them; it is certain that in the Account given by <hi>Moſes</hi> there is an Exact Order, the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration begins and is carried on with a ſtrict Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and let us trace it back from the Flood to <hi>Adam;</hi> or from <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſuppoſe) to the Flood, there is a very regular Relation of Perſons and things. But beſides the Incredibility of the other, of the Thouſands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Hundred thouſands of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the Millions of the <hi>Chineſes;</hi> it all ends at laſt in Fable, in Apotheoſes, or imaginary Gods and Heroes, and Self-Contradictions (as has been ſhewn by many Learned Writers on this Argument).</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As to the Diſperſion of Nations, and the Conſequents of it, the Pedigree of <hi>Moſes</hi> is juſtified in the Names of Places agreeing with thoſe of the Perſons; as has been abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Bochart</hi> in his <hi>Geographia Sacra.</hi> And which would appear to the Eye of every Reader, if a Table was made of the Tenth Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62726:11"/>
and compared with the Ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and ſhould have been here inſerted, were there a place for it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) As to the Diſtribution of Time, there is an orderly Progreſſion, both with reſpect to the Genealogies of Families, and the ſeveral Periods from the Creation to the Flood, from thence to the Law at <hi>Sinai,</hi> from thence to the Rearing of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, from thence to the Captivity, and from that to our Saviour's Death. Time and Place are good Characters of the Truth of any matter of Fact, as well as good Marks and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors; and carry in them a great appearance of Truth where they are to be found. And then none can be preſumed to be more certain than the Scripture, where the Relation theſe had to the Meſſiah, and each Perſon had to his Tribe, and each Tribe to its Place and Scituation, made them to be ſcrupulouſly exact and Critical.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are other things that are highly Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and have nothing difficult to be admitted; and if admitted, are a wonderful Inſtance of the Divine Providence; as in the Puniſhment of profligate and incorrigible Wickedneſs, in the Two Notorious Examples of the Deluge and <hi>Sodom;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5, 6: So in the Preſervation of Pious Perſons, ſuch as <hi>Noah, Abraham, Lot, Joſeph, David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62726:11"/>
But above all is this evident in God's erecting, eſtabliſhing, guiding and preſerving his Church, when in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> though perpetually ſurrounded with watchful and malicious Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and recovering ſo much of it out of Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as was ſufficient in a continued Succeſſion to anſwer the end of accompliſhing all the Scripture-Prophecies in the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was to deſcend from the Lineage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Family of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as the Ancient Genealogies, together with the Chronology of Scripture, were carefully recorded, to demonſtrate to ſucceeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the World had a beginning, and a late beginning in compariſon: So the later Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies from <hi>Abraham</hi> were very exactly preſerved, that ſo it might appear to all the World, that what had been foretold above 1800 years before, was in its order and time punctually fulfilled: Which if the Genealogies had been loſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, could not have been obſerved; and ſo we had been wanting in a conſiderable Evidence of the Deſcent of our Saviour, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his being the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the whole Scripture Hiſtory is little elſe than the Hiſtory of Divine Providence; where there is an admirable concatenation of Relations
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62726:12"/>
of various kinds, but all ſubſervient to the ſame End; and were there an Extract made of it, and all the Events rehearſed, and Operations therein deſcribed, brought into one entire Body, it would be the beſt Commentary on that Divine Subject in the whole World, and infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any Human Compoſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other things that are difficult, either as to the Relations themſelves, or the manner and circumſtances of them; but what ſhould no more prejudice us againſt the truth and certainty of the things related, and much leſs of the whole, than the Difficulties of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould warrant us to deny it; and for want of not underſtanding ſome of its Operations, or Events, we ſhould take encouragement to deny what we do underſtand. 'Tis an excellent Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Auſtin, De Doctrina,</hi> l. 4. c. 6. (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Divine Writers) <q>Where I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, there is nothing ſeems to me more wiſely or more eloquently expreſſed: But where I do not underſtand them, there to me appears leſs of their Eloquence; but yet I do not doubt it to be ſuch, as it is where I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ought rather to ſuſpend our Cenſure, with the modeſty of this Father, and for the ſake
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62726:12"/>
of what we do underſtand, think the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of what we do not.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as when we have uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reaſon to believe a Providence, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties about it are no ſufficient reaſon to call the Doctrine of Divine Providence into queſtion: So when we have ſo great reaſon to believe the Scripture's Relation of things to be true, the Difficulties about it ought not to derogate from its Veracity; nor give us the confidence any more to queſtion the Truth of Scripture, than the Certainty of Providence. For by this way of proceeding, not only the Truth of Scripture, but of all other Books whatſoever will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; nay the plaineſt and moſt obvious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in Nature. And yet of this kind are many of the Objections that are brought into the Field, and are made to ſerve in the Cauſe of Impiety: Such as theſe, <q>That we don't know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands thoſe Books have fallen, nor in what Copies ſuch various Readings have been found; or whether there are not more of that kind in other hands.</q> 
               <hi>Theol. Polit. c.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>The iſſue of all which is, That if this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the Truth of Scripture, it will alſo invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date that of all Writings whatſoever; and ſo is no more to be regarded, than an Argument againſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62726:13"/>
Motion, which is rather to be contemned than anſwered.</p>
            <p>'Tis but reaſonable then that we ſhould give the ſame quarter to the Scripture, that we allow to other Writings. And therefore all Objections levell'd againſt the Scriptures, which will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be managed againſt any others, ought not to be allowed, unleſs we will give credit to nothing but what we our ſelves hear and ſee: And then to carry on the Cauſe, We muſt recede again, ſince there are thouſands of Caſes happen, where even our own Senſes may be ſubject to Error and Miſtake.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another Character for the proof or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the truth of Hiſtory, is Self-conſiſtence and Agreement.</p>
            <p>This is a neceſſary Character, and abſolutely requiſite to all true Hiſtory; for nothing more ſhews the weakneſs and injudiciouſneſs of a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that he comprehends not his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and 'tis a ſign he doth not comprehend it, that contradicts himſelf, and makes one part to diſagree with another.</p>
            <p>I grant that this alone is not an infallible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Truth, that it is ſelf-conſiſtent; for where the Plat is wholly fictitious and imaginary,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62726:13"/>
there may be an exact agreement throughout the whole: The Model may be ſo regularly ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and laid out, that there may be a becoming Symetry; and Place, and Time, and all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances made to concur, to ſet it off with the greater advantage. But though this may be, where Truth is not; yet that cannot be true, which is without it, Truth being always conſiſtent with it ſelf. But there is this above all others obſervable in Scripture, That it is a Syſtem of ſeveral Books, wrote by ſeveral Perſons, in ſeveral Ages, on ſeveral Subjects; and yet however different in Style and Phraſe, Method and Order, are like the ſeveral Features in the Face, that beſides the ſweetneſs in each alone, there is what we call Beauty, that ariſes from the mixture of all.</p>
            <p>Thus it is in the Sacred Hiſtory, which has a great variety in it of matter, diſperſed up and down ſometimes to quicken the Appetite, and excite the Diligence of the Reader, where each has its Order and Uſe: But when conſidered in one complex Body, and compared and ſhewn together, there is ſuch a wonderful Agreement between the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> the Types and Anti-Types, the Predictions and the Events, &amp;c. that it makes a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62726:14"/>
lively, and admirable Appearance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch inconſiſtencies as may make it liable to have its Veracity queſtioned, if duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and ſeriouſly examined.</p>
            <p>I ſay, if duly conſider'd, and ſeriouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd; for elſe it muſt be acknowledged, that there are ſome appearances of this kind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But I account not thoſe to be Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which in other Authors may juſtly be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Errors of the Tranſcribers; and for which no Author ſuffers in his Reputation. As for inſtance, When the Famous Hiſtorian <hi>Herodotus</hi> in one <note place="margin">Euterpe. <hi>c.</hi> 53. <hi>Vita</hi> Hom.</note>place ſaith, That <hi>Homer</hi> lived about Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before his Time; and in another place, That it was about Six hundred. This eſcape doth not leſſen his Reputation among Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Perſons; but for all that, he preſerves the Character of <hi>Pater Hiſtoriarum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and is eſteemed as no injudicious or careleſs Writer. And ſo if a greater number in Scripture is taken for a leſs, or a leſs for a greater, when there are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Directions therein for the Correction of it; 'tis not reaſonable to charge this as an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, and to urge it as a reaſon for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Credit and Veracity of it.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62726:14"/>
            <p>If it be ſaid, How doth it appear that they are the Faults of the Tranſcriber?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I Anſwer, 'Tis apparently ſo ſometimes, as may be obſerved in the various Readings; which could not be, were there not ſuch miſtakes in the Tranſcriber: And where it doth not appear ſo to be, we ought in reaſon ſo to judge, where there are all the appearances of Faithfulneſs, Diligence, and Obſervation in the Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As for inſtance, What can be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Penn'd than the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in which there is a punctual account of the Scituation and bounds of each Tribe, as it was ſet out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf, the Chief Arbiter and Director of all; and if there ſhould be found in his Book any Literal Errors, one Name put for another, or a different Reading of the ſame Names, we cannot in reaſon judge it to be an overſight of ſo Sufficient, and ſo Careful a Writer, but that it might proceed from ſome one that Tranſcribed it after the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Copy, in ſome ſucceſſive Generations, and which in reaſon 'tis impoſſible wholly to prevent.</p>
            <p>'Tis not here neceſſary for me to enter upon a debate, how far the Providence of God doth herein concern it ſelf in preſerving the Text free
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62726:15"/>
from all Corruptions: I am now Treating upon this Argument humanly ſpeaking, and of the Truth of it ſeparately from its Divine Authority. And admitting there are ſuch petty Errors that creep in by ſuch imperceptible ways, though we cannot tell when or how they came in, and have been diſſeminated into all Copies, for ought we know, that are Extant; yet I don't know any reaſon why they ſhould be charged upon the Original and the Compiler of it; nor how the main Cauſe is herein concerned.</p>
            <p>It is a reſpect due and given to all Authors of any Repute for their Care and Fidelity, that Write conſiſtently as to the main, to paſs the moſt favourable Conſtruction upon any ſuch little Errors; which if theirs, were not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; or rather, not to make them theirs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an apparent neceſſity for it.</p>
            <p>And ſurely we ſhould not then preſs the caſe with the utmoſt ſeverity, and make that, which is in it ſelf, and in all Books beſides, a Venial Error, to be no leſs than a Mortal one in the Scripture, and to ſtab its Veracity to the heart, and ſpoil its Credit for ever for the future.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid there is more reaſon for this in the caſe of Scripture than in any other Book; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe That alone pretends to Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62726:15"/>
I Anſwer, That for the preſent is not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under Conſideration; we are now upon the Point of its Truth, and content our ſelves to enter upon this Debate, as if it had no pretence to Divine Authority and Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>And ſo we claim the ſame Favour and Right on its behalf, as we do for any other Author's Credit and Repute, of great Antiquity; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reception.</p>
            <p>And therefore there ought no ſuch Arguments or Objections to be urg'd for the Invalidity of its Authority, which it is not decent or reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to offer againſt other Writings; and we may reaſonably claim the ſame allowance for that which all Mankind do give, or in reaſon ought to give, in things of this nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I don't account theſe to be Inconſiſtencies or Contradictions, which do not affect the main body or part of the Hiſtory; but that are like a Parentheſis in a Sentence, that whether inſerted or omitted, the ſence is perfect and compleat. And therefore when the Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing his Sons is the Subject under Conſideration; whether it was as <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 31. <hi>He bowed himſelf upon the bed's-head,</hi> or as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>He wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped—upon the top of his ſtaff;</hi> is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62726:16"/>
And ſo it may be in many caſes beſides; But what real prejudice will redound to the Reader by the miſtake of any thing of this kind, or what prejudice is there to the Relation, when a thing of no moment is omitted or inſerted, exchanged or altered? I ſay not this as if I deſpaired of having an account given of theſe matters (for that I am ſenſible is to be done, as in the Caſe before-recited) but to ſhew how unreaſonable it is to condemn Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that which we will let others go away with, free from all Blame and Cenſure; and they ſhall be good and laudable Writers, and their Hiſtories admitted to be true and exact, though they have many Errors of this kind; and in the mean while the other ſhall be ſifted to the very bottom, and every Molehill be a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and upon every little ſuppoſed defect, it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>It has been weighed in the balance</hi> of Reaſon and Examination, and has been <hi>found too light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus partial are theſe ſort of perſons, while they malevolently lay the Right hand upon the youngeſt, and their Left upon the eldeſt.</p>
            <p>If indeed the inconſiſtency were like a Diſeaſe in the Vitals, that affects the Heart or the Brain, it is to be accounted Mortal; if it did affect the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62726:16"/>
main Body of the Relation, and had originally proceeded from the Author, it would have been a juſt Allegation, and his Truth and Fidelity, his Knowledge, and his Care might with good reaſon be called in queſtion. But that we deny; and appeal to all the various Readings and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on Scripture as our Compurgators in this point. And conſequently the Scripture will ſo far remain as a true Relator of matters of Fact, and may compare with, and be deſervedly ſet above all other Writings whatſoever; in which no one Man, whoſe hand paſs'd through the whole Work, can compare with that to which ſo many Hands in various Circumſtances, at ſeveral times did ſo exactly concur and agree, as if they had been wrote by one Hand and at one Time, and were but one intire Argument running through the whole.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another Character is the Agreement of Scripture with other Authors; when ſuch there are.</p>
            <p>I may well ſay, when ſuch there are.</p>
            <p>Since it is evident that there are no Writers can pretend to the like Antiquity with <hi>Moſes;</hi> and then we muſt wholy rely on his Authority for what he relates. But however, though the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62726:17"/>
moſt ancient among the Heathens are much later than him, and ſo wanted thoſe Advantages for Information which he had; yet they (ſo far as they agree with him) give a Confirmation and Credibility to what he relates, ſince they deliver it as the Senſe of the Ages before, and of thoſe in which they themſelves lived. It is not here ſo much to our purpoſe to enquire from whence they derived the knowledge of the things they relate, whether from the Jews, or from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tradition (which was beſt to be known from the Eaſtern Parts of the World) as it is to obſerve their concurrence in them with the Sacred Writers. It is indeed probable that the Ancient Writers of the Heathens were (if at all) leſs beholding to the Jews for their Information, and the Later more; as may be obſerved from the great difference between the one and the other, the later being much plainer in many things than the former: For the higher we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the time of the Olympiads, the more intricate, obſcure, and fabulous they are. So that generally ſpeaking, it is with them as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſaith of Geographers, That rather than leave any vacant places in their Maps, fill them up with inacceſſible Mountains, Frozen Seas, or Monſters. So when ſuch Hiſtorians would
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62726:17"/>
compleat their Narratives; rather than be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in it, they inſert wonderful and tragical Stories; and like Nations that can give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Pedigree and Original, derive themſelves from the gods, or from the Earth, and become <hi>Aborigines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, though this be too truly the ſtate of the World for about 3000 Years from the Creation; yet there is a mixture of fine Gold with the greater droſs; and from whence we may extract ſo much as may ſerve to confirm what the Scripture advances for Truth, and we for the ſake of it receive as ſuch; as might be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>This is a Tract has been often beaten by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and Moderns, by <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> by ſeveral of the Fathers, ſuch as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Euſebius,</hi> &amp;c. and by many in theſe Days. And it were eaſy <note place="margin">Bochart, Huetius, <hi>Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet, &amp;c.</note>to form a Hiſtory out of them; eſpecially if we change but the Names, and inſtead of <hi>Saturn,</hi> read <hi>Adam;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Pandora, Eve;</hi> inſtead of the Garden of <hi>Jupiter, Eden;</hi> inſtead of <hi>Ogyges</hi> or <hi>Deucalion, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. for we ſhould find more of the Truth under the diſguiſe of the Fable than at the firſt appears; and that the former gave occaſion frequently to the later.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62726:18"/>
But over and above this, we have a great part of the Ancient Hiſtory of Scripture confirm'd by the expreſs Teſtimony of ſome of their graveſt and ſtricteſt Writers, as the Collection that has been made in that way by ſeveral of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhews. To go no further than that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is placed by ſome of them in the firſt rank of the chiefeſt Lawgivers, and whoſe Wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> are not obſcurely referr'd to by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When there is a Diſagreement between the Scripture and other Authors, there is ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prefer the former before the later, and to rectify theſe by that. As for the firſt 3000 Years it is acknowledged, That there was elſewhere little elſe than Fable and Conjecture, Confuſion and uncertain Tradition, as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: And who is there that is not able to ſee the difference between an <hi>Adam</hi> and a <hi>Saturn,</hi> a <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> between the Building of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Tower, and the War of the Giants with the gods; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Hiſtory and the Fable?</p>
            <p>Who can obſerve the various Accounts amongſt the Pagan Writers, their inconſiſtencies one with another, their apparent ignorance of what they write about, eſpecially when it concerns other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62726:18"/>
Nations or Ages, than thoſe in which themſelves liv'd; but muſt needs ſurrender up the Cauſe, and own that the one has much the advantage of the other in point of Credibility?</p>
            <p>So that ſetting aſide the Divine Authority of Scripture, yet it has upon it all the Characters of Truth, which any Book or Books in the World can pretend: And if there be any thing neceſſary more than what thoſe have, to eſtabliſh its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and Credibility, that is not wanting. In concluſion, After all the attempt made to weaken its Authority, it is with no better ſucceſs than that of <hi>Celſus</hi> or <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who endeavoured to ſet up an <hi>Ariſteas</hi> or an <hi>Appollonius,</hi> in Competition with our Bleſſed Saviour; and oppoſed their pitiful Shifts and Impoſtures, to his approved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable Miracles.</p>
            <p>But there is ſomewhat farther to be reſpected. Hitherto we have conſider'd the Scripture as able and ſufficient to ſupport it ſelf without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Aid; and by the ſole evidence of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Teſtimony, and ſuch Characters as belong to other Writings in common with that: But there is a further point in reſerve, and which I had chiefly in my Eye, and that is an Authority ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all others, and peculiar to Scripture, That I mean of Divine Revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62726:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it was inſpired from above. And this, the due Conſideration of it as an excellent Hiſtory will open a way to; when we find not only all the Principles, Precepts, and Means, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a virtuous Life therein taught and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; but alſo admirable Examples of it in Fact, that nothing might be wanting to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and incourage us to the like practice. See it in the <hi>Noah</hi>'s, the <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, the <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, the <hi>Job</hi>'s, the <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, the <hi>David</hi>'s, and all the Patriarchs of old. See it in the Holy Apoſtles, the Martyrs and Confeſſors; but above all in the Example of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>Here is a Hiſtory, that fills the Mind with the beſt Ideas and Images of things, that repreſents the Inſtances of our Duty with all the advantage to our Thoughts, that recommends it ſelf to our Attention by the importance and profitableneſs of the Argument, as well as the force of its Authority. Upon this therefore let us dwell, and make it the delightful Subject of our moſt ſerious Hours, which will abundantly reward all our Pains, and is ſufficient to <hi>furniſh us throughly unto all good Works.</hi>
