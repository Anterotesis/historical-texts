            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The humble Proposals of sundry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines within the Kingdom, Concerning the Engagement intended to be imposed on them for their Subscriptions.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E Ministers of the Gospell of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who have all of us from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> faithfully served the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and have in pursuance of those great and honourable ends of just Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Reformation, suffered many and grievous things in our Names and Estates from the common Enemy: and to this day have adhered <hi>to our first Principles,</hi> and do still promise in our Places and Stations to <hi>maintain the Peace of this Nation, and to pay obedience to the Lawes thereof;</hi> conceiving it our duty in such a time as this, in all wayes of meekness and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to endeavour the Preservation of our inward Peace and outward Safety, <hi>being streightned in Conscience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the case of the present Engagement,</hi> do humbly offer these ensuing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That although we hold our selves bound by our <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> former <hi>Solemn Covenants and Engagements, in that sense of them wherein they were by publick Authority imposed on us,</hi> yet being convinced of the necessity of civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a Land, for the preservation of Humane
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100396:3"/>
Society, and prevention of all those Evills which the outrages of wicked men unrestrained would produce, and upon mature deliberation considering, That when the wise and holy Providence of God (whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are unsearchable, and wayes past finding out) shall at any time so shake the foundations of States and Kingdoms, as to disable one Government from afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing protection and preservation, and to admit any other to obtain it; it is not then strange to the will of God, light of Nature, judgement of the learned, and practice of Christians in former ages, nor to our own principles or former Engagements, to live quietly and peaceably in our places and callings, <hi>and to submit to such things as are imposed upon, or required of us, by the powers which are in actual possession, being things in themselves lawfull and necessarie to the preservation of our selves and others,</hi> (for this we conceive may be done without disputing the right or title of those that are in place of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) we do upon these premises declare <hi>that we wil accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly</hi> behave our selves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we do humbly conceive that there is a <hi>great difference between</hi> these things and a Subscription to this Engagement, in the words wherein it is required, and that in divers respects.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>This Subscription (as to our Consciences)</hi> doth imply <hi>an approbation of the present establishment, as effected by a full and a free Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>An active concurrence, and as it were a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying consent of the people thereunto, it having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the originall of all just power is in the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100396:3"/>
Thirdly, An obligation, <hi>to act an all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and capacities;</hi> to the promoting and strengthening of it, &amp; not only of it (but by a parity of Reason) of any other, which by the possible advantage of power, may at any time hereafter, even to the prejudice and ruine of this, <hi>set up it selfe, and then require of us the like sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Being by this Engagement bound up to these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as the words seem to import, we further conceive, That we shall by this subscription, violate those former Engagements, in Oathes, Protestations, and in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, wherein we were by the former Commands of Parl. obliged, in which last par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, if the time we entred into it be considered, <hi>viz.</hi> In the day of our extremity, or the Religious solemnity, with hands lifted up to the most high God; or the matter of it, which is comprehensive of things Sacred and Civill, and particularly of the Rights and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament, and the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: or the sense wherein we then took it; or the asseveration, that we would never be drawn from it, by any Terrour or Combination whatsoever; or the durable obligation which we brought upon our selves by it, even all the dayes of our lives; or the Considerations which we had before our eyes in the taking of it, namely the Glory of God, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdome of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the Happinesse of the King and his Posterity. These things being duly considered, do leave such an awfull impression on our Consciences, that <hi>anlesse the consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof with this Engagement be made unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clear unto us, it cannot but render our</hi> Consciences trembling &amp; doubtfull, &amp; so the act of Engaging, by the Apostles rule, to us unlawfull, as by a parity of Reason
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100396:4"/>
it would have been undoubtedly inconsistent with our Covenant, to have subscribed an Engagement to the King and Lords, without the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> if it should by their Agreement and Authority, have been required of us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These things being considered in the nature of the <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> Engagement, and in the full relation to which it stands to former Engagements, cannot in our judgements but minister matter of <hi>generall scandall and offence to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men,</hi> both good and bad, many of whom being not able to make, or happily so much as understand subtile distinctions, whereby guilt may either be evaded or palliated, will look upon us as breakers of our Oaths and Covenants, as prevaricators of the most sacred and solemn things, as men of ductile spirits, and prostituted Consciences, led by principles of fear or interest: which prejudice (though we would grant, were more foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ignorance and mistakes of these men, then many solid and just reasons) would yet grosly wound the Gospel, expose our Ministry to scorn (the honour whereof ought to be dearer to us then our lives) endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the reputation, and so weaken the power of it in the Consciences of our hearers (who though through fear or other private ends may themselves have subscribed, yet retain low thoughts of us, as if we acted on the like principles) as that we cannot but believe, but <hi>Christ</hi> would be a greater looser by our subscription, then the state can any way be a gainer by it; we desire alwayes to keep in mind the noble resolution of the Apostle, who would not in case of scandall <hi>use his own just power, but chose rather to suffer all things, lest he should binder the Gospel of Christ</hi> and concluded, it was better for him to die, then that any in that behalf should make <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100396:4"/>
void.</hi> Upon these and such like grounds, purely consciencious, and not out of any private interest or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, contrary to the peace of this Common-wealth, we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to forbear Subscription, untill either <hi>by solemn debate of the Engagement</hi> (as of the Covenant) or otherwise, our Consciences shall be cleared of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant scruples.</p>
            <p>So we humbly crave leave further to represent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> that our former Governours (not duly considering that men even in highest authority as well as others, are by the doctrine of the Scriptures concerning scandall, bound to avoid the laying of shares and stumbling-blocks in the way of their Brethren) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>And therefore we do presume that those in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> power (according to their professed Principles and Resolutions, to have respect to tender Consciences) wil not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> us to the sad <hi>Dilemma</hi> of chusing either sinne or affliction, and hope that the many years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of our <hi>quiet behaviour</hi> and faithfull service, may give them a better assurance and security for our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conversation, then the fained Subscriptions of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>We being at present shut up under such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these, do humbly beseech those in present power, not to compell us (whose reputation is as necessary for others, as a good conscience for ourselves) to draw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon Religion,  and vilifie the reputation of the Ministry, by which the service of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and cause others to think we esteem Oaths as changeable as opinions; and so brand us with the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mark of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
