         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For Heaven is no place for ſuch an Eſtate as <hi>Adam</hi> had

            <p>I ſhall wonder if any will be ſo bold as to affirm, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was Created <hi>in Patriâ,</hi> and not <hi>in Viâ.</hi> How

Heavenly Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons which I alleadged,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> notwithſtanding any
thing you ſay againſt them, ſeem cogent. 1. By the
Second Death, you might ſee, I meant not the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51647:5"/>
yet the ſame kind of puniſhment. The Scripture
ſeems to ſpeak of ſeveral degrees of Hell-Torment, yet
all is called the <hi>Second Death.</hi> And this Second Death,
<hi>viz.</hi> Hell-Torment, <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin became liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
therefore if he had not ſinned, he ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a Life directly oppoſite to that Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Glory. The perpetual Death which <hi>Adam</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Saviour) ſhould have ſuffered, was not a perpetual
abiding in the Eſtate of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> a perpetual ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Soul and Body, or a meer privation of that Life
he had before his Fall, but an enduring of eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſo conſequently the Life promiſed upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Obedience, was not a perpetuating of his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Life, but the fruition of Heavenly Happineſs. 2. I
grant, God was able to change <hi>Adam</hi>'s State, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Place; but it ſeems rather, that both ſhould have
been changed. And though we know not the Nature of
the Life to come, yet we know it is not ſuch a Life as
<hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe, to Eat, Drink, Marry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
3. It is not in vain to ſay, How in an ordinary way of
Providence ſhould there have been room for Men upon

<hi>[Eſpecially ſeeing God knew there would be no place for
ſuch difficulties]</hi> I know not to what purpoſe it is. For
the Opinion, which I impugn, doth ſuppoſe that upon
which ſuch difficulties do ariſe. 4. How ſhould Paradiſe
be a Type of Heaven, if Man ſhould never have come to
Heaven? If Heaven had not belonged unto him upon
condition of his Obedience? Whereas you ſay, That <hi>you
little know where or what that Paradiſe was;</hi> I do not
well know what you mean. By [that Paradiſe] I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you underſtand (as I and others do) the Garden
wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was placed: a place upon Earth for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it was, and very pleaſant; yet ſuch a place as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Adam</hi> lived a natural Life, far beneath that happineſs
which he was made capable of.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51647:5"/>

            <p>I do not ſay that any now are altogether as <hi>Adam</hi> was

doth ſay <hi>[Obey perfectly and live];</hi> or, <hi>[If thou ſin,
thou ſhalt die eternally].</hi> But there are many in the
World to whom God doth not ſay <hi>[Believe,</hi> &amp;c.] that
Promiſe is altogether unknown unto them, they live and
die without ever hearing of it, ſo that to them it is as if
it had never been. Conſider (I pray) what the Apoſtle
ſaith to this purpoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. Might not the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
have continued in that condition unto death? Do not
many continue in the ſame Condition? I yeeld, that none
are ſo under the Covenant of Works, but that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe they ſhall have Mercy, and that by vertue
of the New Covenant: but that which I ſtand upon is
this, That the Covenant of Grace wherein Mercy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
being not revealed unto ſome, nor any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed
unto them, they cannot be ſaid to be under it, nor
ſhall be judged as tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
            <p>Add, 1. Though the Covenant of Grace had never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
been, yet I ſee not but ſuch Mercies as the <hi>Indians</hi> enjoy,
(ſetting aſide the poſſibility of partaking of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant)
might have been enjoyed. Add, 2. Though
the Covenant of Works vouchaſafeth no pardon of ſin upon
Repentance, yet ſurely it requiring perfect Obedience,
conſequently it alſo requireth Repentance and turning
unto God. Elſe if the Covenant of Grace had not been
made, Man after his Fall, though plunging himſelf into
ſin continually more and more, yet had contracted no
more Guilt, nor incurred any greater Condemnation,
than he did by his firſt Tranſgreſſion. And, 3. Chriſt
as Mediator ſhall judge even thoſe that never heard of any
Salvation to be obtained by him; and conſequently he
will not judge them as guilty of neglecting that Salvation.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51647:6"/>
Chriſt judgeth wicked Men as Rebellious Subjects; but
as rebelling (I conceive) only againſt the Law, not
againſt the Goſpel, they being ſuch as never were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it. Add, 4. There are common Mercies, (which
might have been though the New-Covenant had not been)
the abuſe whereof is ſufficient to condemn; yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement

doth make Sinful, Chriſt's (Paſſive) Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth make Righteous; and in that reſpect only doth
the Apoſtle oppoſe Chriſt's Obedience to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>1. The Apoſtle ſaying,<note place="margin">10</note> That <hi>Chriſt was made under

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it ſeems to be without doubt, That it was the
Will of God that he ſhould obſerve the Law.<note place="margin">58.</note> For is it
not the Will of God that his Law ſhould be obſerved by
ſuch as are under it? Yet Chriſt might obſerve the Law
for ſome ends peculiar to himſelf, as for thoſe ends he
was made under it. Chriſt according to the fleſh was
a Jew, therefore meet it was he ſhould obſerve the Jewiſh
Law, otherwiſe he had been an offence unto them.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51647:7"/>
2. As Chriſt was not made Man for himſelf, ſo (it is
true) he was not bound to obſerve the Law for himſelf.
But thus you ſhould not limit it to ſome Works; for all
his Works were ſo for us, as he was <hi>nobis natus, nobis
datus,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. Yet being made Man, as Man he was
bound (I think) to perform that Obedience which God
did require of Man. You ſay, That he uſed the Legal
Ceremonies to ſhew his ſubjection: So ſay I; and this (I
think) is againſt you, it being meant of ſuch ſubjection
as the Law required of all thoſe that were under it.
3. If Chriſt were <hi>ſub Lege,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith he was,
then it was <hi>ex Lege</hi> that he obſerved thoſe legal rites. Yet,
I grant, it was <hi>ex vi ſponſionis propriae;</hi> ſo all that he
did, ſo his very being made Man was. Whereas you
ſay, <hi>[Elſe the Law would have obliged him to the act
and end together];</hi> I Anſwer, The Law doth oblige, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Will of the Law-giver, who might oblige
Chriſt to it otherwiſe than he did others. I think the
Ceremonial Obſervances, beſides the Typical Nature of
them, are to be conſidered as Religious Rites, whereby
God was honoured and worſhipped; and ſo Chriſt as
Man was obliged unto them, Man being bound to honour
and worſhip God, ſo as God doth require of him. That

from that Law, whereby the Creature is to ſhew his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

Man, muſt be under ſubjection. He goes on ſaying,

that it ſhould be meritorious.</p>
            <p>The intereſt of the Divine Nature doth certainly put

not how Chriſt's good Actions (I ſpeak of meer Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Ibid. 61.</note>

could properly be meritorious, they being otherwiſe due,

ſatisfaction to be made for him. Though I am not of
their mind, who think that the Son of God ſhould have
been incarnate, though Man had never ſinned; yet I ſee
no reaſon to doubt but ſo it might have been: Now <hi>hoc

have been due, but not his Paſſive Righteouſneſs.</p>

the words of the Threat were not ſo meant, as that the
Sentence ſhould immediately be executed to the full, yet
your very Argument ſuppoſeth, That if the Sentence
ſhould have been ſo executed, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould preſently
have died. Now though Chriſt had not died, yet this

been ſuſpended, and ſuppoſing the propagation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind

ſay nothing.</p>
            <p>I deſire to be as favourable an Animadverter as Truth

I defend what you ſay,<note place="margin">11. 68.</note> I do not ſee. If you had uſed the
word <hi>[Chaſtiſements],</hi> it would not have freed you from
mine Animadverſion. For I ſhew that Chaſtiſements are
Puniſhments. And whereas you ſpeak of my great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
it is indeed your great miſtake; for I did not take
thoſe words to expreſs your Opinion, only you ſeemed
therein to allow the diſtinction betwixt Afflictions of
Love and Puniſhments; this is it which I thought worthy
of an Animadverſion.</p>

You might ſee,<note place="margin">15.</note> that I make the Afflictions of God's
Children in their Nature to be Evil, and a Curſe, though
not ſo to them, they being ſanctified and working for their
good. And I preſume, thoſe Divines whom you oppoſe,
meant as both you and I do, though you interpret them
otherwiſe. The difference here betwixt you and me is
this; You allow their Expreſſion, and diſlike their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I allow their Meaning, and diſlike their Expreſſion.
They diſtinguiſh betwixt Chaſtiſements and Puniſhments,
which diſtinction in your <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> you ſeem to allow,
only diſliking the Application of it. The diſtinction it
ſelf I diſlike, though I think that ſome who uſed it, did
not err in that which they intended in it. In the Contents
of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. there are theſe words, <hi>[God's Chaſtiſements

that <hi>Aphor.</hi> p. 71. you ſpeak of a mixture of Love and
Anger, and ſay, <hi>That there is no Hatred, though there

            <p>God is not the Father of the Unregenerate,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> though Elect,

which were as all upon the Earth, ſo many of them
earthly, and none comparable to the happineſs of the

            <p>1. Though there be ſeveral degrees of Damnation,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

there is ſuch difference between one degree of Damnation
and another, as there is betwixt the ſcratch of a Pin,

<hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he ſhould have had that happineſs
which all thoſe Priviledges that you mention tend unto;
and by his ſin he forfeited all that happineſs. Beſides,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Nay indeed, if Baptiſm be a Seal of remiſſion of ſins,
then remiſſion of ſins (I think) is not the end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
For the thing muſt be, before it be ſealed, <hi>i. e.</hi>
confirmed. Though Baptiſm therefore be ordained to
this end, to ſeal remiſſion of ſins, yet none can make this
uſe of it, until they believe, and ſo have their ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Neither doth this make for <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> for
Circumciſion was of the ſame nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.
Yet were Infants circumciſed.<note place="margin">Of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>ch.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>[Not all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
(ſaith Bp. <hi>Downam) are truly juſtified].</hi> And
again, <hi>[It is not neceſſary, that every one baptized,
ſhould preſently be regenerated, or juſtified: but Baptiſm
is a Seal to him of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, either to
be applied by the Holy Ghost to the Elect dying in infancy,
or to be apprehended alſo by Faith in them, who living to
years of diſcretion, have grace to believe].</hi> Again alſo,
<hi>[The</hi> Papiſts <hi>themſelves teach, That the Sacraments do
not confer Grace</hi> ponenti obicem mortalis peccati; <hi>but
all that come to Baptiſm, are guilty (if not juſtified
before) of mortal ſin, not only</hi> adulti, <hi>who to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal

is as well a Seal of Sanctification, as of Remiſſion of
Sins; for it ſeals the whole Covenant, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
contained in it. And as Circumciſion ſignified
and ſealed the taking away of the Foreskin (or ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of naughtineſs, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Chap. 1. 21.)</hi>
of the Heart, ſo doth Baptiſm ſignifie &amp; ſeal the waſhing
away of the filthineſs, as well as of the guiltineſs of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in one of his <hi>Diatribae,</hi> would have the thing
ſignified in Baptiſm, to be only the ſanctifying Grace of
the Holy Ghoſt; wherein I cannot ſubſcribe unto him,
Whereas you ſpeak of an External Covenant, as ſome

External Being in the Covenant, which is all that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
we can be aſſured of in reſpect of others, and
which is enough for admittance to the Sign and Seal of
the Covenant. The People of the Jews, until by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. even in that Covenant, which they

the Heart, whereby one is made a new Creature.</p>
            <p>I think that properly there are not diſtinct Laws,<note place="margin">23.</note> from
whoſe diſtinct condemnations we muſt be freed:<note place="margin">Ibid. 103.</note> That the
Goſpel doth not condemn any,<note place="margin">Ad. 1.</note> but only leave ſome to
the Law to be condemned by it, though their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by reaſon of the Goſpel, as of every Mercy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
or abuſed, will be the greater.</p>
            <p>The Father (as I have ſaid before) doth judg,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> though
by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ad. 2.</note> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. And however, I ſee not how
you can conclude any thing to the purpoſe by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If for every ſeveral Accuſation there muſt be a ſeveral
Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">24.</note> then there will be need of infinite Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes,<note place="margin">Ad. 3.</note>
ſeeing there may be infinite accuſations. But
one Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Chriſt's Satisfaction for
us, will take off all Accuſations brought againſt us; elſe
how doth the Apoſtle ſay; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the
charge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 33, 34. Indeed the Promiſe is made
upon condition of believing, and therefore the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of the Condition, debars from benefit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
But this (I conceive) is not properly a new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
but only a making good of the former accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we having nothing to ſhew why it ſhould not ſtand
in force againſt us. Your ſelf did well diſtinguiſh <hi>p.</hi> 22.
betwixt a Condition as a Condition, and a Condition as
a Duty. Now Faith as a Condition, is required in the
Goſpel, but as a Duty in the Law; For the Law requires
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51647:13"/>
us in all things to obey God; that is comprehended in the
firſt Precept, therefore it requires us to believe in Chriſt,
God commanding it. Elſe not to believe, were no ſin;
<hi>for ſin is a tranſgreſſiin of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. Now as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is a Duty, ſo notbelieving doth afford matter of
Accuſation, and cauſe of Condemnation: But as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is a Condition, ſo Not-believing doth only leave
the Accuſation otherwiſe made in force againſt us; and
for ſin, whereof we are accuſed and found guilty, leaves
us to condemnation. Thus (I think) are thoſe Texts to
be underſtood, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>ult.</hi> Whereas you ſay,
That <hi>the Accuſation may be three-fold,</hi> truly in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it may be manifold: But indeed the Accuſation is
but one and the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are <hi>Non-credentes:</hi>
For <hi>Pagans</hi> do not ſo much as appear, and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Solifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are no Believers, as believing is a receiving of Christ, and that is the believing by which we are juſtified.</note>
               <hi>Solifidians</hi> do but appear to be Believers.</p>
            <p>For the ſeveral Sentences from whence you argue;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
1. You urged <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22.<note place="margin">Ad. 4.</note> to prove that God Creator judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
none. 2. How are any freed from the Sentence of
the firſt Law, but by the benefit of the New Law? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſee no ground for that which you ſeem to inſinuate,
<hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt firſt be freed from the Sentence of one
Law, and then of another. Indeed I do not ſee, That
the Goſpel hath any Sentence of Condemnation diſtinct
from the Law; only it doth condemn Unbelievers, in
that it doth not free them from that condemnation which
by the Law is due unto them.</p>
            <p>That there is a ſorer puniſhment,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as of a diſtinct kind,
than that Death threatned <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Ad. 5.</note> you do not prove,
neither (I preſume) can it be proved. There are (I
grant) ſeveral degrees of that Death, yet all of the ſame
kind, <hi>viz.</hi> The loſs of Heavenly Happineſs, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
of Hell-Torment. And if there muſt be a ſeveral
Righteouſneſs for every ſeveral degree of Puniſhment,
there muſt be more Righteouſneſſes than you either do or
can aſſign.</p>
            <p>I ſay as before,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I do not think this, <hi>[Thou art an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer]</hi>
(I ſpeak of Unbelief as a not-performing of the
Goſpel-Condition) to be a new Accuſation,<note place="margin">Ad. 6.</note> but only a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51647:13"/>
Plea why the former ſhould ſtand good, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are
ſinners, and ſo to be condemned by the Law, becauſe the
benefit of the Goſpel which we lay claim to, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto us, we not performing the condition to that end
required of us.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>[We are devolved to the New Law
before our Justification is compleat].</hi> Are we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
to it for the very beginning of our Juſtification? So
again, <hi>[Christ's Satisfaction is imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>But the New Covenant gives the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Interest].</hi> Doth not the New Covenant give Chriſt
alſo, in whom we have intereſt? I note theſe Paſſages,
becauſe your meaning in them perhaps is ſuch as I do not
ſufficiently underſtand.</p>
            <p>I ſay ſtill,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Here is no occaſion properly of a new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
but only of a <hi>removens prohibens,</hi> a taking
away of that which would hinder the force of the former
Accuſation. And ſo there is no new Righteouſneſs of
ours required unto Juſtification, but only a Condition,
without which we cannot have intereſt in Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
that thereby we may be juſtified.</p>
            <p>In your <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> you ſpeak only of a Two-fold Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
requiſite unto Juſtification;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> now you ſpeak of a
Two-fold Juſtification neceſſary to be attained. But the
Scripture ſpeaks of Juſtification by Chriſt, and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Faith, as of one and the ſame Juſtification, <hi>Acts
13. 39. Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>The Second Cauſe (as you call it) <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">25.</note> 
               <hi>[Whether the
Defendant have performed the condition of the New
Covenant]</hi> is indeed this, Whether he have any thing truly
to alledge, why upon the former Accuſation he ſhould not
be condemned? And ſo he muſt be juſtified indeed by
producing his Faith, (and ſo his ſincere Obedience to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his Faith) yet not as a new Righteouſneſs of his own,
but only as intitling him to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as
that whereby he muſt be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſpeak of a Three-fold Guilt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>viz. [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus
culpae. 2. Reatus non-praestitae Conditionis.
3. Reatus poena propter non praestitam conditionem].</hi> 1. As
<hi>Omne malum est vel Culpae, vel Poena,</hi> ſo <hi>omnis reatus</hi>
ſeems to be ſo too. 2. The not-performing of a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as a Condition, brings no new guilt of Puniſhment,
(if it did, ſurely it were <hi>Culpa,</hi> and ſo the ſecond Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51647:14"/>
falls in with the firſt) but only the loſs of the Remedy,
or Reward promiſed upon the performing of that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
though the not performing of the Condition as a
Duty, will bring a new guilt of Puniſhment. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Reatus peenae</hi> is not properly <hi>ob non praestitam
Conditionem, but ob culpam admiſſam,</hi> which <hi>Reatus</hi> doth
remain in force, becauſe the Condition required for the
removing of it, is not performed.</p>
            <p>We muſt take heed of ſtraining Law-terms too far in
Matters of Devinity. I ſee not how the firmneſs of my
title to Chriſt's Righteouſ neſs for Juſtification,<note place="margin">26</note> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called my Righteouſneſs whereby I am juſtified;
though the firmneſs of that title may be queſtioned, and
muſt be proved; yet if it prove falſe, it is not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
which doth condemn, (I ſpeak of the Meritorious
Cauſe of Condemnation) but ſin committed againſt the
Law, is that which doth put into a ſtate of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for want of that Title, there is nothing to free
from Condemnation.</p>
            <p>The Obligation unto Puniſhment is not diſſolved by
Satisfaction made by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as to Unbelievers, becauſe
for want of Faith, the Satisfaction of Chriſt is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them.</p>
            <p>1. For that far greater Puniſhment,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which you ſpeak
of, I have ſaid enough before. 2. Is that Non-liberation
from former miſery a diſtinct puniſhment from that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Though the former miſery may be aggravated by
neglect of that which would procure a liberation from it.
If God had never made a New Covenant, there had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
been a Non-liberation from that miſery, which the
breach of the firſt Covenant did bring upon us; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that miſery they muſt lie for ever, who neglect the
Remedies provided for them; and as their neglect doth
aggravate their ſin, ſo will it encreaſe their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Immunity doth reſult from the New Covenant,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
the Penality from the Old, unto which Unbelievers are
left, the New Covenant affording them no Remedy by
reaſon of their unbelief: and the Penality of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is accidentally increaſed by the New Covenant, in
that by neglect of its Remedy ſin is increaſed.</p>
            <p>I am of this opinion,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That the New Covenant hath no
other Penality, but that it doth leave Unbelievers to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51647:14"/>
Penality of the Old Covenant, and by accident increaſe
the ſame.</p>
            <p>If that Penality be but the ſame Death,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it hath no
more than the former; neither can that Act of Grace be
properly ſaid to appoint a new Puniſhment, but only to
leave to the former Puniſhment, as not delivering from
it. You ſpeak indeed of Double Torments appointed
by that Act for ſuch as do reject it; but ſo (I think) the
Similitude doth not hold. For I ſee not; that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace doth ſo, but only (as I have ſaid)
leave ſome upon their not performing the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them, to the Puniſhment appointed by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works; which Puniſhment will be the ſorer,
as Sin by neglect of Grace offered is the greater.</p>
            <p>3. Though our Mediator do not believe,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> repent and
obey for us, but we our ſelves muſt believe, repent and
obey, yet it doth not follow that our believing, repenting
and obeying, is that Righteouſneſs by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
            <p>4. Though we be not guilty of not performing the
Condition of the New Covenant, yet this is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">27</note> by which we are juſtified, though
without it we cannot be juſtified, becauſe not partàke of
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>5. The rejecting of Chriſt may be conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. As
the receiving of Chriſt is a Duty Commanded. 2. As
the receiving of Chriſt is the Condition of Pardon and
Salvation offered. In the former reſpect, the rejecting of
Chriſt is properly a ſin; and ſo againſt the Law, though
aggravated by the Goſpel, in that Chriſt is rejected not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the benefit to be obtained by him. That
the Law doth not ſpeak of Chriſt, is nothing; for it
ſpeaks of obeying God in all his Commands, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
it ſpeaks of receiving Chriſt, when God doth
command it. In the latter reſpect the rejecting of Chriſt
(I think) doth not properly bring a new guilt, but only
continue and aggravate the former.</p>
            <p>6. But <hi>recurrit queſtio,</hi> viz. Whether the New Law
doth require the Condition as our Righteouſneſs: it
ſeems to me to require it only to that end, that Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs may be imputed unto us, and that ſo by
that Righteouſneſs we may be juſtified.</p>
            <p>7. Faith, as a Duty, is a Conformity to the Law,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51647:15"/>
though a partial and imperfect Conformity unto it, and
ſo there's no being juſtified by it. As a Condition, it is
a conformity to the Goſpel, but no Righteouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs by
which we are juſtified, though a Condition upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of which we are juſtified by Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>8. I deny that there is any other condemnation of the
Goſpal, but only a not-freeing in ſome caſe from the
condemnation of the Law.</p>
            <p>9. The Condition being conſidered meerly as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and not as a Duty, to object that we have not
performed the Condition, is not to bring a new Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only to take away the Plea, why the old Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ſhould not prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>10. The performance of the Condition of the New
Covenant, being deſigned to that uſe, which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz. [to be the ſinners ſelf-denying acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his ſin and miſery, and inſufficiency to deliver
himſelf]</hi> it doth hence rather follow, that properly it is
not our Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified, though
it be required of us to that end, that we may be juſtified
by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>11. That the Condition is not of ſo large extent as
the Duty commanded, ſeems not to the purpoſe, the
Queſtion being of the Condition as a Condition, not
as a Duty. Faith as a Duty (I grant) is part of our
Perſonal Righteouſneſs; but that is not it by which we
are juſtified.</p>
            <p>12. As the Condition is a Condition, and no more, ſo
the performing of it is no <hi>Juſtitia</hi> at all: as it is a Duty,
ſo indeed the performing of it is <hi>Juſtitia particularis,
&amp; ſecundum quid,</hi> as the performing of every Duty is: but
ſuch a <hi>juſtitia</hi> I dare not rely on for Juſtification. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you ſay, <hi>That Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is not ſimply
our Vniverſal Righteouſneſs</hi> it is true, if by [ſimply]
you mean <hi>[abſolutè &amp; nullâ interpoſitâ conditione]</hi>
otherwiſe our Univerſal Righteouſneſs it is, ſo that we
have no need of any other Righteouſneſs for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
though we have need of ſome thing to that end,
that we may partake of Chriſt's, Righteouſneſs, and be
juſtified by it.</p>
            <p>13. The Goſpel as diſtinct from the Law, doth ſhew
us our Remedy; the Law as diſtinct from the Goſpel,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51647:15"/>
doth preſcribe unto us our Duty. Or if the Goſpel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
doth preſcribe unto us our Duty, yet no other Duty,
though upon other terms than the Law doth preſcribe.
However, though the performing of the Duty be in ſome
ſort our Righteouſneſs, yet it is not that Righteouſneſs
by which we are juſtified. Still I diſtinguiſh of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſidered as a Duty, and conſidered as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As a Duty, it is our Righteouſneſs, but not that
whereby we are juſtified; as a Condition, it is that
whereby we are juſtified, but not our Righteouſneſs; it
is only that whereby we receive Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that Righteouſneſs indeed by
which we are juſtified. Whereas you ſay, <hi>[The difference
of the two Laws or Covenants, is the main ground
which ſhews the neceſſity of a Two-fold Righteouſneſs].</hi>
The neceſſity of a Two-fold Righteouſneſs is not denied,
but only the neceſſity of a Two-fold Righteouſneſs unto
Juſtification.</p>
            <p>This Two-fold Juſtification ſeems to be a new conceit.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
I remember not that you ſpake any thing of it in your
<hi>Aphoriſms;</hi> neither (I think) will it eaſily be granted
becauſe of your Poſitions and Suppoſitions, but rather
they will be rejected, as inferring that which is not to be
admitted. For truly where the Goſpel doth ſpeak of
more Juſtifications than one, (in that ſence as we treat
of Juſtification) I am yet to ſeek.</p>
            <p>From a Two-fold Covenant you infer a Two-fold Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
But is there a Two-fold Covenant, by which we
are or may be juſtified? I conceive, we are juſtified only
by the New Covenant. For <hi>by the Deeds of the Law</hi>
(the Old Covenant) <hi>ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Rom. 3. 20.
See alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>1. To be accuſed as an Unbeliever, and a Rejecter of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be accuſed as a finner, and as one that
did not continue in all things written in the Law to do
them. For elſe Unbelief and rejecting of Chriſt were no
ſin; that Chriſt is not ſpoken of in the Law, is nothing,
as I have ſhewed before. 2. That Accuſation (that a
Man is an Unbeliever, and a Rejecter of Chriſt) if it
be made good, doth leave a Man to the Law, and makes
all its Accuſations to be in force againſt him, with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his Sin for contempt of Mercy.</p>

though we be freed from the guilt of Diſobedience. This
(except Libertines) none, I preſume, will deny. But
all this, as to the Controverſie betwixt us about a Two-fold

lib. 2. cap. 18. I cannot imagine, for nothing do I there
ſee for you, but much againſt you, though touching other
Particulars in debate betwixt us. As in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Chapter; <hi>Ex efficientibus Justificationis

<hi>cap.</hi> 18. for there are but nineteen Chapters of that Book.
What you can gather from this (if this were it you aimed
at) I cannot tell, eſpecially he referring us to the other
place before mentioned, where there is much againſt you,
but nothing (I think) for you. And as little for your
purpoſe do I meet with in <hi>part 2. lib. 1. cap. 7. pag.</hi> 144.
where he only ſaith, <hi>Accedat etiam oportet, ut idonei

Regnum Coeleſte comparemus,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. Matth. 25.
34, 35. But doth he ſay; That this Habitual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
(which he maketh all one with Holineſs, therein
oppoſing you as I do) is requiſite unto Juſtification?
Otherwiſe that it is requiſite, Who doth queſtion?
Whereas you next cite <hi>part. 2. lib. 1. cap. 5. p. 127. n.</hi> 3, 4.
I doubt whether you did well obſerve what the Author
there meaneth. He only anſwereth an Argument of
<hi>Hemingius,</hi> denying that which (he ſaith) <hi>Hemingius</hi>
ſuppoſeth, <hi>viz. Eandem juſtitiam eſſe viam ad vitam
aternam, cum in Lege, tum in Evangelio.</hi> But of a
Two-fold Righteouſneſs he there makes no mention; not
(I ſay) of a Two-fold Righteouſneſs required of us at
all, much leſs required of us, that thereby we may be
juſtified. He ſaith indeed, <hi>Quid enim ſi Lex Dei in
decalogo ſit norma illius juſtitia, quae e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t via Vitae Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae?
Si praeter hanc in Lege praeſcripta ſit alia via in
Evangelio conſtituta, quid impediet, quo minùs juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficetur
quiſpiam ſine Legis impletione?</hi> He doth not
mean, That the Righteouſneſs preſcribed in the Law, is
one Righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs conſtituted in
the Goſpel another Righteouſneſs, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified;
but that we are juſtified only by this latter, and
not at all by the other. He was far from thinking of
your Legal and Evangelical Righteouſneſs, as being
both neceſſary unto Juſtification; he only aſſerts Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Righteouſneſs as neceſſary in that reſpect, which
Righteouſneſs he makes to conſiſt meerly in remiſſion of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51647:17"/>
ſins. See <hi>part. 1. lib. 2. cap. 2. n. 12.</hi> &amp; <hi>cap. 3. per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
To the very ſame purpoſe (<hi>i. e.</hi> nothing at all to
yours) is that <hi>Ibid. cap. 6. p. 138. n.</hi> 2. where he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Hemingius</hi> for taking it as granted, <hi>Nullam eſſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam,
vel injuſtitiam, niſi in Lege praeſtitâ, vel non
praeſtitâ:</hi> And then he ſaith, <hi>Nam ſi alia ſit juſtitia,
quae Lege non contineatur, fieri potest, ut alia etiam ſit
via Aeternae Vitae conſequendae.</hi> He doth not grant (as
you ſeem to underſtand him) that <hi>Juſtitia, quae in Lege
continetur eſt una juſtitia, quae ad Juſtificationem à
nobis requiritur;</hi> for that indeed he denies, and ſaith,
That there is another Righteouſneſs now in the Goſpel
ordained for that end; and remiſſion of ſins (as I ſaid)
he makes to be that Righteouſneſs, even the only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
by which we are formally juſtified. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after indeed he adds that which I cannot allow; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
nec peccatum quidem Legis in Decalogo cancellis
circumſcribitur.</hi> This is not directly to the Point now
in hand; yet becauſe it may reflect upon it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
we have about it afterward; I therefore think meet
to note it by the way, and ſay, That if it be as he ſaith,
then (it ſeemeth) St. <hi>John</hi> did not give us a full defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſin,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 4.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the
Law:</hi> but of that more hereafter. <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Argument
is of ſmall force; <hi>Fides (inquit) in Chriſtum crucifixum
non praecipitur in Lege:</hi> but I have before him, ſhewed
that it is otherwiſe. He himſelf preſently after cites that,
1 <hi>John 3. 23. [This is his Commandment, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
&amp;c.] Now the Law contained in the Decalogue,
requires us to do whatſoever God commandeth; for if
we do not ſo, we do not make him our only Lord God,
as the Law requireth. That the Apoſtle doth oppoſe (as
he ſaith) Faith to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. makes nothing
for him. For Faith, as a Duty, is required in the Law,
though as a Condition it be required only in the Goſpel.
Neither doth that advantage him, which he alſo objecteth,
That the Law hath nothing to do with Chriſt as Mediator,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. For though the Goſpel only hold out Chriſt as
Mediator to be believed in; yet Chriſt being ſo held out,
the Law doth require us to believe in him. For the Law
doth require a belief of every Truth that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal,
and a performance of every thing that God doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn.
Now for <hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> If the Juſtification which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51647:18"/>
he ſpeaks of, <hi>Quâ ut ſanctificati ac regeniti abſolvimur
à falſis Diaboli &amp; improborum criminationibus,</hi> be
meant of ſome particular Acts, of which we are accuſed,
it is but ſuch a Juſtification as the Reprobates themſelves
may partake of, who may be accuſed of ſome things
whereof they are not guilty. See <hi>Bradſhaw de Juſtif.
cap.</hi> 25. If it be meant of our eſtate in general, (as I
ſuppoſe it is) then this is indeed no diſtinct Juſtification,
but only a confirming of the other. For in vain do we
pretend to be juſtified by Faith, (by which alone <hi>de Dieu</hi>
grants we are juſtified) ſo as through Chriſt to be freely
acquitted from the guilt of our ſins, if yet we remain
unregenerate and unſanctified. By the way I obſerve,
That <hi>de Dieu</hi>'s words are againſt you, [Jacobus <hi>non
agit de Juſtificatione, quae partim fide, partim operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
peragatur].</hi> Thus much I had ſaid in reference to
this Author before I had him upon the Epiſtles; but now
that I have him, I ſhall ſpeak more fully to him, or to you
of him, from that other place to which you remit me,
<hi>viz.</hi> his Notes on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. There he ſpeaks likewiſe
of a Two-fold Righteouſneſs, and of a Two-fold Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
yet ſo as but little to patronize your Cauſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Imputed Righteouſneſs, which we have in Chriſt,
there is alſo (he ſaith, and who doth not?) an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteouſneſs which we have in our ſelves. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Righteouſneſs (he ſaith) is that, <hi>Quâ nos Deus,
etſi in nobis ipſis Legi adhuc diſſormes, plenè tamen, ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius

Altera eſt, de quâ,</hi> Rom. 6. 13. Epheſ. 4. 24. 1 Joh. 3. 7.
<hi>Quâ nos Deus per regenerationem in nobis etiam ipſis
Lege ex parte conformatos, ex parte nunc juſtificat, &amp;

advenerit, de quâ Juſtificatione agitur,</hi> Jac. 2. 21, 24.

Opera Legis ingrediuntur; ut primam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituit
ſola Fides,</hi> i. e. <hi>juſtitia Chriſti fide imputata, non
opera; ſic alteram cenſtituunt opera, non fides.</hi> Here,
1. he makes Inherent Righteouſneſs imperfect, and ſo
alſo the Juſtification which doth ariſe from it. By this
Righteouſneſs we are but <hi>Legi ex parte conformati, &amp;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51647:18"/>
ex parte nunc juſtificati:</hi> But Imputed Righteouſneſs,
and Juſtification by it, he acknowledgeth to be perfect:
hereby we are <hi>plenè juſtificati; tanquam Legi plenè
conformes in capite Chriſto.</hi> 2. He makes Faith only,
<hi>i. e.</hi> (as he explains it) the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by Faith, that whereby we are fully and perfectly
juſtified. Now you make all Righteouſneſs, as ſuch,
perfect: for otherwiſe you make it to be no Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
if it be imperfect. And you make Faith and Works
to concur unto the ſame Juſtification, though you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

            <p>Thus then <hi>de Dieu</hi> in the Matter it ſelf doth not differ
from other Proteſtant-Writers, who generally hold, That
the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, is that by
which we are fully and perfectly juſtified; and yet we
muſt alſo have Inherent Righteouſneſs, which will juſtifie
us in ſome ſort, but not fully and perfectly, becauſe it
ſelf is imperfect.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Placeus</hi> I have him not; but becauſe you alledge
his words, I will ſay ſomething to him. He ſpeaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of a Two-fold Accuſation, and of a Two-fold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
But, 1. he ſeems to differ from me and others
only <hi>modo loquendi.</hi> For he ſaith, <hi>Ab accuſatione priore
(qua ſc. objicitur nos eſſe peccatores) ſola fide juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur;
qua Chriſti gratiam &amp; juſtitiam amplectimur:
à poſteriore, (qua objicitur nos eſſe infideles) juſtificamur
etiam operibus, quatenus iis Fides (N. B.) oſtenditur.</hi>
This ſeems to be in effect the ſame with that of <hi>Macco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Fide Juſtif. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 12.</note>
               <hi>Conciliationem hîc (inter</hi> Paulum <hi>&amp;</hi> Jacobum)
<hi>hanc ponunt Theologi, &amp; quidem ex Scriptura, ſola Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
nos juſtificat apprehenſivè, opera declarativè.</hi> 2. To
ſpeak properly, they are not (I think) two diſtinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.
For to omit this, That to be <hi>Infideles,</hi> is to
be <hi>Peccatores;</hi> and ſo the one Accuſation doth include
the other: To omit this (I ſay) the latter Accuſation
is but a re-inforcing of the former. Thou art a Sinner,
ſaith the Accuſer, and therefore to be condemned. Not
ſo, ſaith the Party accuſed, for I am a Believer, and
therefore juſtified. Hereupon the Accuſer replies, Nay,
it is not ſo as thou pretendeſt, thou art indeed no Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
therefore the guilt of thy ſins is upon thee, and thou
art under condemnation. All this is but one Accuſation,
proſecuted and confirmed againſt a Plea made againſt it.
If they were diſtinct Accuſations, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en we might be freed
from the one, and yet be condemned by the other: but
it is here quite otherwiſe. For the force of the former
Accuſation doth depend upon the latter; neither are we
freed from the former, except we be freed from the latter;
whereas you ſeem to carry it ſo, as if we were firſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the former Accuſation, and then were again to
be juſtified from the latter: this ſeems to be the reſult of
your Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51647:19"/>
1. Becauſe I grant Faith to be required of us, that ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs may become ours, do I therefore
make Faith it ſelf to be our Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that
whereby we are fully juſtified. A part of Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
(I grant) Faith is, by which we may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in ſome meaſure; but that is not the juſtification
here enquired of. 2. You ſhould not put me to prove,
That your Aſſertion is without Scripture; it is ſufficient
for me to ſay it, until you alledge Scripture for it.
3. Chriſt's Satisfaction is ſolely and wholly our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
whereby we are juſtified from all Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though except we believe in him, we cannot enjoy
that benefit by him;<note place="margin">(p. 36.)</note> See 2 <hi>Cor. 5. ult.</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39.
4. The New Covenant doth hold out unto us Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs to be made ours by Faith, that ſo we may
be freed from the Condemnation of the Old Covenant,
to which Condemnation we are left, if we believe not;
and our Condemnation will be ſo much the ſorer, by how
much the ſin in neglecting ſo great Salvation is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
5. I confeſs indeed that there is more than Faith in
the Condition of the New Covenant, but not as to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For that which you add, [James <hi>ſaith, We
are juſtified by Works, and Christ by our Words];</hi> the
queſtion is not, Whether we be ſaid to be juſtified by our
Works or Words; but how and in what ſenſe we are ſaid
to be ſo juſtified. There is a Particular Juſtification, and
a Declarative Juſtification; thus we are juſtified by our
Works and Words: but a full and formal Juſtification is
only by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs through Faith imputed
unto us. 6. To ſay, That we are healed partly by the
Medicine, and partly by the Application, I ſtill think to
be improper; neither do you bring any thing, whereby
to ſhew the propriety of it. The Application of the
Medicine is indeed requiſite, yet it is the Medicine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
that doth heal, though not except there be an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it. Common Speech is not always Proper
Speech; neither can any that are acquainted with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and know how to diſtinguiſh between Proper and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Speeches, think it ſtrange that there are improper
Speeches found in Scripture. What will you ſay of thoſe,
<hi>[This is my Body] [The Rock was Christ]</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſuch-like? For Rules of Logick, if you had made
uſe of any, I might have conſidered of them. 7. May
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51647:20"/>
not a Similitude illuſtrate, though there be ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as you ſpeak of, betwixt that from which it is fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that to which it is applied? But why do you joyn
Repentance and Obedience with Faith in point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
I ſpeaking only of Faith, and you as yet having
ſaid nothing for the joint intereſt of the other? 8. In
your <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> you plainly aſſert two diſtinct Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes,
as requiſite unto Juſtification; that there you
make them ſubordinate, is more than I obſerve. But
though Faith be ſubordinate unto Chriſt's Satisfaction in
the matter of Juſtification, yet that we are juſtified by
Faith as a diſtinct Righteouſneſs, I cannot yeeld, no more
than that the Application of a Medicine is a diſtinct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
by which one is healed. I am glad that you plainly
diſclaim a Coordination of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and
Faith in the Work of Juſtification: But if they be but
ſubordinate, then (me-thinks) they ſhould not be two
diſtinct Righteouſneſſes, by which we are juſtified. I ſee
not how we can be juſtified (I ſpeak of an Univerſal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
oppoſite to all condemnation, that which <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
calls <hi>Justificationem Vitae)</hi> both by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Chriſt imputed to us,<note place="margin">Apud. Lud. de Dieu <hi>in</hi> Rom. 8. 4.</note> and alſo by our own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Righteouſneſs. You ſay, <hi>[A Man having a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
and not applying it, may properly be ſaid to die
for want of Application];</hi> but to ſpeak properly, I
think, It is not the want of Application of the Medicine,
but the Diſeaſe that doth kill the Man; So though a Man
wanting Faith ſhall be condemned, yet take Faith meerly
as a Condition, not as a Duty, it is not properly the
want of Faith, but Sin that is the cauſe of his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
though his want of Faith may as aggravate his
Sin, ſo increaſe his Condemnation.</p>
            <p>That I ſpeak your words,<note place="margin">Ibid. 20. 108.</note> is more than I do know.
How Chriſt's Righteouſneſs may be called our Legal
Righteouſneſs, I ſhewed by <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. viz. as ſerving
us inſtead of that Righteouſneſs which the Law required
of us, and for want of which the Law otherwiſe would
have condemned us. Neither did I blame you meerly for
calling Chriſt's Satisfaction our Legal Righteouſneſs, but
for making another Righteouſneſs of our own, which you
call our Evangelical Righteouſneſs, neceſſary unto Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Now alſo you overlook that, which I alledged
about Chriſt's Satisfaction, as being our Evangelical
Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51647:20"/>
1. Doth the Old Covenant preſcribe Chriſt's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as our Righteouſneſs?<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> You ſaid a little before,<note place="margin">Ib. 110.</note> 
               <hi>[I
do not think, that Christ's Righteouſneſs of Satisfaction is
that which the Law required];</hi> as if I ſaid, That the
Law did require it; whereas I meant only this, That the
Law required Satisfaction, and Chriſt made it for us, ſo
that Chriſt's Satisfaction ſerveth us inſtead of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
which the Law required of us, and ſo may be
called our Legal Righteouſneſs. But the New Covenant
doth hold out Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to be apprehended
by us, and made ours Faith, that ſo thereby we may
be juſtified. Where the Scripture ſpeaks of a Two-fold
Righteouſneſs ſo as you do, or how this makes for the
unfolding of the main Doctrine, or tends to heal our
Breaches, I do not ſee: You affirm theſe things, but do
not prove them. 2. What plain ground you laid down
in your <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> for that Two-fold Righteouſneſs, I
do not know: What I could obſerve any way Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
I was willing to examine, and ſo am ſtill.</p>
            <p>1. If it imply Blaſphemy, to ſay, That Chriſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/>
               <note place="margin">21. 111.</note>
and believed for us; Doth it follow that Faith or
Repentance is our Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
Can nothing be required of us, and performed by
us, but it muſt therefore be our Righteouſneſs, and by it
as our Righteouſneſs we muſt be juſtified? 2. The
Scriptures which I alledged, (viz. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 29. &amp; 10. 6.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. and <hi>Rom. 3. 22.)</hi> do ſufficiently diſtinguiſh
Faith from that Righteouſneſs, whereby we are juſtified,
and ſhew it to be only a means, whereby we partake of
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and ſo by that Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt are juſtified. The Argument (I think) is good,
notwithſtanding any thing you ſay unto it. Faith is only
a means whereby Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed unto
us unto Juſtification: Therefore it is not that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by which we are juſtified,<note place="margin">De Fide Juſtif. §. 15 &amp; 16.</note>

to be wholly freed from all Condemnation; the ſame
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51647:21"/>
that Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> meant by Univerſal Juſtification:
You know ſufficiently the diſtinction betwixt <hi>Simpliciter</hi>

modo juſtificari poſſunt.—Hoc modo juſtificari non eſt
penitùs à peccati reatu, ſed ab hujus vel illius peccati
imputatione injuſtâ liberari.</hi> 2. Comparative Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
I ſhewed to be but a leſs degree of Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
but Ironical Righteouſneſs is down-right Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
whereas a leſs Unrighteouſneſs in compariſon
of a greater, is a kind of Righteouſneſs. <hi>Minus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
reſpectu majoris habet rationem boni.</hi> 3. I do not
deny the Righteouſneſs of Faith, though I deny Faith
to be that Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified.
Though our Salvation depend upon our Faith, and ſincere
Obedience, yet are we not therefore juſtified by Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but <hi>Declarativè,</hi> as it is the fruit of Juſtifying
Faith; nor by Faith, but <hi>Apprehenſivè,</hi> as by it we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

            <p>1. I never doubted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 32.</note> much leſs denied Faith to be a part of
Inherent Righteouſneſs. 2. It is indeed a ſtrange Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
that will not juſtifie ſo far forth as it will reach:
but it is not ſtrange to Proteſtant-Divines, that Inherent
Righteouſneſs cannot reach ſo far as to juſtifie in that ſenſe
as we ſpeak of Juſtification.<note place="margin">De Juſtif. Habit.</note>

to cite Authors to this purpoſe. For what more
common with our Divines (I ſpeak of ſuch as are of
chief note) than to acknowledge Inherent Righteouſneſs,
and yet to deny that we are juſtified by it? What you
mean, when you yeeld that we are not univerſally juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Faith, I do not well underſtand. For if you mean
(as you ſeem to do) that we are not freed by it from
the Puniſhment of the Old Covenant, but only from
the Puniſhment of the New Covenant; 1. I know no
Puniſhment of the New Covenant, but a leaving to the
Puniſhment of the Old Covenant, with an aggravation
of it for contempt of Mercy offered. 2. Faith, though
not as our Righteouſneſs, yet as the means whereby we
partake of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, doth free us from the
Puniſhment of the Old Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Death. For
<hi>the Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Rom. 1. 17. And in that
ſenſe Faith doth univerſally juſtifie us. For <hi>being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. Whereas you ſpeak of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
againſt the Accuſation of Non-performing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the New Covenant; I muſt ſtill tell you, That
taking the Condition meerly as a Condition, the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of non-performing it, is but a confirming a former
Accuſation of being guilty of the breach of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and therefore to be condemned, as having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

not performed. 3. If I do ill oppoſe the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

(our Perſonal Righteouſneſs) by all means to be perfect;

And of ſuch Actions Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> (whom you cite) doth

There is indeed ſome defect in the beſt Actions of the beſt
Men, <hi>quoad gradum:</hi> But ſhall we therefore deny them
to be good, becauſe they are ſome way defective, and ſo
not perfectly good? And ſee here I pray, to what you
have now brought the matter; even to make Imperfect
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51647:24"/>
Holineſs no Holineſs, as well as Imperfect Righteouſneſs
no Righteouſneſs. For is not Holineſs Goodneſs as well
as Righteouſneſs? Therefore if every defect make Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
no Goodneſs, then there is no more an Imperfect
Holineſs (which yet you grant) then there is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Righteouſneſs. Thoſe words, <hi>[Neque put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
eſt, fieri poſſe, ut per Legem ſaltem aliquâ ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
juſtificemur]</hi> taken in <hi>rigore</hi> are not true. For then
there were no ſuch thing as a particular Juſtification;
neither do they accord with that which I cited before out
of <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. to which place you did
refer me. Indeed we cannot be ſo juſtified by the Law, as
thereby to be freed from all condemnation; and this ſeems
to be all that your Author here cited did mean, when he
ſaith, <hi>Si non es Legem tranſgreſſus, Lege juſtificaris: ſi
tranſgreſſus es, condemnaris.</hi> But this doth no more
prove, That Righteouſneſs muſt either be perfect, or it
is none at all, (though indeed it is none as to abſolute
and univerſal Juſtification) than it doth prove, that there
is no Holineſs at all, except it be perfect. For doth not
the Law require perfect Holineſs as well as perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?
And is not every tranſgreſſion of the Law a
privation of Holineſs, as well as of Righteouſneſs?
How then can you admit an Imperfect Holineſs to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and yet deny an Imperfect Righteouſneſs to be
Righteouſneſs? And if our Inherent Righteouſneſs (for
of that we ſpeak) muſt needs be perfect, if it be any at
all, muſt not the ſame be ſaid of our Holineſs, this being
a conformity to the Law as well as the other?</p>
            <p>1. You do not anſwer my Queſtion,<note place="margin">34</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> Whether
thoſe Orthodox Writers (a multitude of whom you ſay
you could heap up) do make our Perſonal Righteouſneſs
that by which we are juſtified. If they do not, their
calling it Evangelical is to no purpoſe. 2. It is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
to ſay, That Righteouſneſs (<hi>viz.</hi> inherent)
is required unto Sanctification; it being that whereby we
are ſanctified, as Imputed Righteouſneſs is that whereby
we are juſtified. You ſaid before, That I did ill oppoſe
that whereby we are juſtified, as if the ſame thing might
not do both: You grant then (it ſeems) that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
may ſanctifie; I think it muſt, and ſo is required
unto Sanctification. How you can make Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs

you had ſpoken abſolutely without any qualification, <hi>[He
that affirmeth a man Righteous,</hi> (viz. <hi>by Inherent
Righteouſneſs) and yet denieth him to be juſtified,</hi> viz.
<hi>by that Righteouſneſs, contradicteth himſelf]</hi> you had
condemned all our famous Divines (I think) of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradiction.
But your ſpeech being ſo qualified, as it
is, <hi>[ſo far as he is Righteous]</hi> I know not at whom it
ſtriketh. But though none by the Law of Works can be
pronounced perfectly righteous, and therefore if they be
tryed by it, all will be found unrighteous, yet doth it not
therefore follow, that there is no ſuch thing as an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>You ſeem not to diſlike what I ſay,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> neither do I what
you now ſay. I grant, that the New Covenant is to the
wicked an unſpeakable mercy, in that by it they may be
freed from the condemnation of the Old Covenant: yet
until they embrace the New Covenant, they remain under
the Old, even under the condemnation of it.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning Chriſt's Satiſfaction,<note place="margin">35</note> how it may be
called both our Legal and our Evangelical Righteouſneſs,
I have ſpoken before. Legal Righteouſneſs may either
ſignifie the Righteouſneſs of the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the
Righteouſneſs which is of or from the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
There is great difference between theſe two, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is aſſerted, but the latter is exploded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4.
&amp; 10. 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. Chriſt's Satisfaction may be called
our Legal Righteouſneſs in the former ſenſe, not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But in both reſpects it is our Evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
as being the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Righteouſneſs
which by the Goſpel we are made partakers of through

is of Faith, <gap reason="foreign">

but a Similitude, which proves nothing; and I

you now ſay, <hi>[In reſpect of the condition of our perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

is imputed unto us inſtead of our perſonal performance

performance of Perfect Obedience might be required as a
Condition to make Chriſt's Satisfaction ours, which were
very ſtrange. For if Perfect Obedience could be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

to be imputed to us, except for ſin committed or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

That Faith is as effectual or ſufficient a Condition under
the New Covenant, as perfect perſonal Obedience, if
performed, would have been under the Old Covenant:
if this were all that you meant, though I like not your
expreſſion, yet I allow the thing; only this I think meet
to obſerve, That perfect perſonal Obedience was ſo the
Condition of the Old Covenant, that it was alſo the
Righteouſneſs required in it: But Faith is ſo the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>2. The acceptance of a Gift, being a means to enjoy
it, is a means whereby the Gift doth inrich; and ſo
Faith is a means whereby Chriſt's Righteouſneſs doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
us, as being a means whereby it is imputed unto us,
and made ours. But properly it is the Gift that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,
though not without the acceptance of it; and ſo it
is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt that doth juſtifie, though
not without Faith. The Tryal of a Man's Title in Law
to a Gift, depends on the Tryal, and Proof of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of it, becauſe otherwiſe except he accept of the
Gift, it is none of his: Yet for all this, it is the Gift
that doth inrich, though it muſt be accepted, that it may
do it. And ſo it is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs that we are
juſtified by, though Faith be required of us, that it may
be made ours, and ſo we may be juſtified by it.</p>
            <p>That my words are contradictory one to another,<note place="margin">36</note> you
ſay, but the Reaſon which you add for proof of it, is of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
force. I deny it to be as proper to ſay, <hi>[We are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Faith as a Condition]</hi> as to ſay, <hi>[We are juſtified
by Chriſt's Satisfaction, as the Meritorious Cauſe];</hi> yea
and as the Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified. What
inconvenience doth ariſe from it, if <hi>Paul</hi> and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do oftner ſpeak improperly than properly in this
Point? May not improper Speeches, concerning ſome
Point, be more frequent in Scripture, than proper? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Speeches, wherein the Sign is called by the
name of the Thing ſignified, are improper: Yet are they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51647:26"/>
more frequent in Scripture, than thoſe which in that kind
are more proper.</p>
            <p>1. You not clearing the Queſtion,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> either there or any
where elſe (that I know) in your <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> ſeemed
to leave it doubtful; and ſo I thought meet to note it,
that you might prevent any ones ſtumbling at it.</p>
            <p>2. What you now add upon review, doth leſs pleaſe;
For the Holineſs that is in us, is from God, the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it is from our ſelves; this therefore may be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
though God's Work be good.</p>
            <p>1. Relation when it is founded in Quality,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> may (for
any thing I ſee) be intended and remitted,<note place="margin">Vide Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſ. <hi>lib. 2. c.</hi> 5.</note> as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is wherein it is founded. I like not <hi>Scheiblers</hi> joyning
Similitude and Equality together, as if there were the
ſame reaſon of both. One thing cannot be more or leſs
equal, though it may be nearer to, or further from Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
than another; but one thing may be more or leſs
like, when yet there is a true and proper likeneſs in both.</p>
            <p>2. That no Man ever performeth one act fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
conform to the Law of Works, is the ſame that
I ſay: But why do you put in theſe terms <hi>[fully and
exactly]</hi> if there can be no conformity but that which is
full and exact?</p>
            <p>3. That our Inherent Righteouſneſs (for I muſt ſtill
mind you that we are ſpeaking of it) is <hi>Non-reatus poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
I deny; and all that you add there in that Page is

ſeem to come up to what I ſay, when you grant, that our
Goſpel-Righteouſneſs conſidered <hi>in eſſe officii,</hi> as related
to, or meaſured by the Precept, ſo our Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
admit of degrees. Here by Faith and Holineſs, you
mean the ſame with that which immediately before you
called Goſpel-Righteouſneſs, which muſt needs be meant
of Inherent Righteouſneſs. As for thoſe words which
you inſert, [and that only <hi>quoad materiam praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam]</hi>

to the Precept as a Precept. Now this you muſt
grant, may <hi>recipere magis &amp; minus:</hi> for ſo you grant
that Holineſs may. And if Congruency, why not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity?
For Congruency and Conformity, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
words, yet import (for any thing I ſee) one and
the ſame thing. I take Faith to be in part our Inherent
Righteouſneſs, as it is <hi>Officium,</hi> not as it is <hi>Conditio
praeciſè conſiderata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whether Habitual Faith, or Actual, be properly
the Condition of the Covenant, is little to our purpoſe.
And for the thing it ſelf, as I ſhall grant, that we muſt
not content our ſelves with a habit of Faith, but muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
act Faith: So (I think) you will not deny, that we
are <hi>Fideles,</hi> and ſo juſtified, even when we ſleep, though

            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51647:27"/>
You ſay nothing to that which I anſwered concerning
our Divines,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of whom you ſpake, <hi>viz.</hi> That they hold,
That the Righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified, is not
our Perſonal Righteouſneſs; and therefore though they
ſay, (as you alledge) That our Juſtification is perfect,
and therefore (as you infer) our Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
whereby we are juſtified, muſt be perfect alſo; yet all this
is little to your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>2. To what you ſay, I have ſaid enough before, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Faith which is the Condition of the New Covenant,
as to Juſtification, is not our Righteouſneſs whereby we
are juſtified, but only a means to partake of Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
the only Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified.
And for being <hi>rei poenae Novae Legis</hi> for non-performance
of its Condition; I ſay ſtill, I know no puniſhment of
the New Law for want of Faith as its Condition, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a leaving to the puniſhment of the Old Law; which
puniſhment yet (I grant) will be ſo much the more
grievous, as the ſin, which an Unbeliever, both as an
Unbeliever, and otherwiſe, is guilty of by Goſpel-Aggravations,
is the more hainous.</p>
            <p>1. I as little doubt but that ſincerity of Righteouſneſs
doth conſiſt with imperfection of Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">38</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Righteouſneſs, which is really the ſame with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
how-ever in this or that reſpect we may diſtinguiſh
the one from the other.</p>
            <p>2. How Hypocriſie can be taken for a ſeeming or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
better than we are, yet without affectation or
diſſimulation, I do not underſtand. If without any
affectation or diſſimulation of ours, we ſeem better
than we are, it is another's errour, not our fault; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we therefore be called Hypocrites. Your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
diſtinctions of Sincerity do ſerve rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Reader, than to unfold the matter. I take ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to be no diſtinct Grace, but the <hi>Modus</hi> of other
Graces: but why that <hi>Modus</hi> may not admit of degrees,
I confeſs I do not ſee. I conceive Zeal to be of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet one may be more or leſs zealous, and ſo alſo
more or leſs ſincere. You ſay here, [There is no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
inter Ens &amp; non Ens]</hi> of which I make no doubt
but <hi>pag.</hi> 2. you think Relations to be <hi>inter Ens &amp; Nihil;</hi>
and what difference between <hi>Nihil &amp; non Ens?</hi> You

to the Rule of the Condition, doth conſiſt in <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili.</hi>
Indeed you have divers times affirmed, That all
Conformity is of that nature, but I could never yet ſee
it proved. But why do you now ſpeak of Conformity to
the Rule of the Condition? I take Conformity to the
Rule of the Precept to be our Perſonal Righteouſneſs,
and the Sincerity of that Conformity to be the Sincerity
of this Righteouſneſs. And this Righteouſneſs, though
it be ſincere, I hold to be imperfect, becauſe the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Rule is imperfect.<note place="margin">

               <hi>[Sincerity</hi> (ſaith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Blake) is ſaid to be the New Rule, or the Rule of
the New Covenant. But this is no Rule, but our Duty,
taking the Abſtract for the Concrete; Sincerity for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
walking, and this according to the Rule of the Law,
not to reach it, but in all parts to aim at it, and have
reſpect unto it.</hi> Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I
have reſpect to all thy Commandments, <hi>Pſal. 119. 6.
And this is our Inherent Righteouſneſs, which in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to its Rule (N. B.) labours under many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections].</hi>
And a little before he ſaith thus, <hi>[I know no
other Rule but the Old Rule, the Rule of the Moral
Law: that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, the only
Rule].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It ſeems very incongruous to grant, that <hi>Apoc. 22.
11. [Be holy ſtill]</hi> doth import an encreaſe of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and yet to deny, that <hi>[Be righteous ſtill]</hi> doth
import an increaſe of Righteouſneſs. For any thing I
know, ſome on the contrary may as well ſay, That the
latter words import an increaſe of Righteouſneſs, and
yet the other no increaſe of Holineſs. Whereas you
ſpeak of varying the ſenſe according to the variety of
Subjects, you take it for granted, That here the Subjects
are various; whereas both by this, and divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before cited, it ſeems clear to me, that the Subjects,
<hi>viz.</hi> Righteouſneſs and Holineſs are really the ſame one
with the other. For the <hi>Formale</hi> of Righteouſneſs, what
is it but Conformity to the Law, the only Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?
And why ſuch Conformity may not be more
or leſs, I am yet to learn. That place indeed, as many
other, ſpeaks of a true Perſonal Righteouſneſs in the
Saints, but yet not of a Perfect Righteouſneſs in them; and
conſequently not of ſuch a Righteouſneſs, as whereby
they are juſtified, except it be only in ſome ſort, and in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51647:28"/>
ſome meaſure, which is not the Juſtification about which
we contend. This Imperfect Righteouſneſs is meaſured
by the Law of Works, as a Rule, though it be accepted
only by the gracious condeſcenſion of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. you give many Anſwers, but they
ſeem but ſo many Evaſions.<note place="margin">39</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. I think there is no Queſtion, but the Apoſtle ſpeaks
by way of Precept and Exhortation. <hi>q. d.</hi> If you have
indeed learned Chriſt, and have been taught by him, you
have learned to do ſo and ſo; therefore have a care to do
ſo. Surely the Apoſtles words import a duty required,
and ſo implicity contain a Precept or Exhortation.</p>
            <p>2. That he ſpeaks as well to Believers, True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
as mere Profeſſors, is as little to be doubted. For
he ſpeaks unto them upon a ſuppoſition, that they had
learned Chriſt, and had been taught by him; which
though it may belong to mere Profeſſors, yet to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
much rather.</p>
            <p>3. If the New Man, which is created in Righteouſneſs
and Holineſs, may encreaſe, as you grant, then ſurely
Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, in which the New Man is
created, and without which the New Man is nothing,
muſt increaſe alſo. To ſay, That the New Man may
increaſe in Holineſs, but not in Righteouſneſs, is for
one that would ſay any thing, ſo that he may but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
As well might it be ſaid, That the New
Man is created in Holineſs, but not in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>4. The Form of Righteouſneſs is Conformity to the
Law, to which we muſt labour to conform ſtill more and
more, not only <hi>extenſivè,</hi> but alſo <hi>intenſivè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The very conjunction of the words here, as in other
places, ſhews that they are uſed as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
how we ſhould give unto God the things that are

conform to the Law, which doth preſcribe our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and towards Men, I cannot ſee: and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conformity to the Law, is the Righteouſneſs now in
queſtion.</p>
            <p>1. If we be juſtified from the Accuſation of <hi>Reatus
poenae primae Legis propter peccatum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> What need is there
of any other juſtification?<note place="margin">Of the Coven. If <hi>c. 14. p.</hi> 95.</note>

Conviction, then ſurely Condemnation. If the Law do

            <p>2. For the accuſation of <hi>Reatus poenae Novae Legis ob
non praeſtiam Conditionem,</hi> it is no new Accuſation, but
a making good of a former Accuſation; and ſo <hi>Reatus

            </p>
            <p>3. I confeſs, I was not before acquainted with theſe
two Juſtifications which you ſpeak of: I did not find them
in your <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> but only two ſorts of Righteouſneſs
as requiſite to one and the ſame Juſtification, ſo I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it. But truly now that you lay open your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
more than before, I can ſee no ſolidity in it. We
are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt participated
by Faith; but not by Faith, as being it ſelf our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
Faith is indeed required unto Juſtification, yet
not as our Righteouſneſs, but as a Condition, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Means (for I would not ſtrive about words)
whereby we partake of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. I ſee
not, that the Scripture doth ſpeak of ſuch a Two-fold

that,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which I ſaid about the Materiality and Formality,
as well of Holineſs as of Righteouſneſs.</p>

Law, as it doth <hi>conſtituere debitum officii,</hi> ſo I conceive

which touch not me, in your <hi>6th,</hi> you grant as much as I
did, or do deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>our Perſons muſt be juſtified
and reconciled, before our external Obedience can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
Whereas you there add, That <hi>it was not as they
were an imperfect Conformity to the Law of Works, that</hi>
Abel<hi>'s Works were accepted:</hi> I anſwer, It was not indeed
by the Law of Works; yet as they were a ſincere, though
imperfect Conformity to that Law, as a Rule, ſo they
were accepted by the New Covenant. The Law of Works
directs, the Covenant of Grace accepts, though we come
ſhort of what the Law requires.</p>
            <p>[The Law <hi>(as Mr.</hi> Blake <hi>ſaith)</hi> ſtill commands us,<note place="margin">Of the Coven. ch. 16. p. 9, 10.</note>
though the Covenant in Chriſt, through the abundant
Grace of it, upon the terms that it requires and accepts,
frees us from the Sentence of it]. <hi>And again,</hi> [A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Sufficiency to attain the end I willingly grant,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 111 112.</note>
God condeſcending through rich Grace to crown weak
Obedience: In this ſence our Imperfection hath its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs;
otherwiſe I muſt ſay, That our Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
is an Imperfect Righteouſneſs, in an imperfect
Conformity to the Rule of Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.] He
means the Law of Works, which (as before noted) he
ſaith is,</hi> a Rule, a perfect Rule, the only Rule.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall not deny,<note place="margin">40, &amp; 41.</note> but that our Faith and Obedience
may be ſaid to be juſtified from the accuſation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs:
Yet I think, That this is but a making good
of our Juſtification againſt the Accuſation of being Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
For beſides that the unſoundneſs of Faith (and ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51647:30"/>
of Obedience) is ſin; beſides this (I ſay) if our Faith
be not ſound, it is in vain, we are yet in our ſins, we lie
under the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, there
being no freedom for us without Faith.</p>
            <p>2. I know none that ſay, Our Actions are juſtified
through Chriſt's Merit by the Law of Works. For my
part I ſhould ſay, We and our Actions are juſtified from
the Law of Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the condemnation of it,
God for Chriſt's ſake accepting us and our Actions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
our imperfection, for which the Law, if
we ſhould be ſentenced by it, would condemn us. But
here by the way, let me obſerve this, That your retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what you ſaid in your <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> doth ſeem to
manifeſt thus much, That when you compoſed thoſe
<hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> you either knew not, or liked not that Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Juſtification, which now you ſo often ſpeak of, and
ſomewhere ſay, That my ignorance in this Point is it,
that doth mainly darken all my Diſcourſe. That common
ſaying is not always true, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>For my words; 1. I ſee not why thoſe, <hi>[Acquitting
us from all ſin]</hi> ſhould offend you. For you might ſee
by what I there ſaid, That I meant the not-imputing of
any ſin unto us. And ſo the Phraſes uſed in Scripture,
of God, <hi>not remembring our ſins, his covering them,
caſting them behind his back, into the bottom of the
Sea,</hi> &amp;c. they all import ſuch an acquitting of us from
ſin, as I intended; not as if God did account us to be
without ſin, which were falſe, but that God doth not
charge ſin upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as to exact ſatisfaction for
ſin from us. I mean the very ſame with Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
in the words which you cited <hi>p. 39. Non hoc dicitur,
Deum apud ſe judicare, illos pro quorum peccatis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis
Chriſtus ſatisfecit, nihil mali unquam commiſiſſe,
aut boni debiti omiſiſſe; ſed eodem habere loco quoad
mortis reatum, &amp; jus ad vitam aeternam, ac ſi nihil
vel mali admiſiſſent, vel boni debiti omiſiſſent.</hi> Thus
Chriſt ſpeaks to the Church, <hi>Cant. 4. 7. Thou art all
fair, my Love, and there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> What?
may ſome ſay, Is there no ſpot in the Church? No, none
in her, ſo as to be imputed to her. <hi>Sine maculâ deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gilber. ad Loc.</note>
               <hi>quia culpa non imputatur,</hi> as one doth no leſs truly
than elegantly expreſs it. You your ſelf yeeld as much
as I deſire, or as my words import, <hi>viz.</hi> That God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitteth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51647:30"/>
us from all ſin, ſo as it induceth an obligation to
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>2. When you ſay; That to acquit us from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Old Law, is one Juſtification, and to juſtifie
us againſt the accuſation of being ſo obliged, is another
Juſtification; I confeſs <hi>(Davus ſum, non Oedipus)</hi> I do
not well underſtand what you mean, for to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
theſe are one and the ſame. Me-thinks it muſt needs
be, That what doth acquit us from the Obligation of the
Old Law, doth alſo <hi>eo nomine</hi> juſtifie us againſt the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of being ſo obliged. For how are we acquitted
from the Obligation, if not juſtified againſt the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being obliged?</p>
            <p>3. I marvel why you ſhould trouble your ſelf with
ſpeaking of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and of final
unbelief, when as you could not but know, that I ſpake
of all ſin, from which we may be juſtified. Why might
not one as well quarrel with thoſe words of the Apoſtle,
Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified from
all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. I grant the New Covenant not to be violated but by
final unbelief, yet (as I expreſly added in that very place
which you take hold on) ſo that this be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
For the right underſtanding of it, I ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before; and for further explication, I refer you to
Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>5. But in the next you do moſt ſtrangely, even without
any cauſe that I can ſee, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and (as they
ſay) <hi>fluctus in ſimpulo excitare.</hi> That [firſt our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and then our Duties and Actions may properly be
ſaid to be juſtified, that is, accepted as juſt, and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from all accuſation brought againſt them, though in
themſelves they be not ſuch, but that ſin doth cleave unto
them] why ſhould this ſeem ſuch horrid Doctrine, as
that your Heart ſhould deteſt it?</p>
            <p>1. I ſpeak of good Actions: for it is abſurd to ſay,
That evil Actions are accepted as juſt, though we may be
ſo accepted notwithſtanding our evil Actions.</p>
            <p>2. I plainly ſay, That ſin doth cleave to our good
Actions; yet (I ſay) God doth accept them as juſt,
notwithſtanding the imperfection of them, and the ſin
that doth cleave unto them. If this be offenſive to you,
as well (I think) may you be offended at that <hi>Nehem.</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:51647:31"/>
13. <hi>21. Remember me, O Lord, concerning this, and
ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy Mercy.</hi> And
ſo at that 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. You alſo as lively ſtones are built
up a Spiritual Houſe, an Holy Prieſthood, to offer up
Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable unto God through Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> Neither is there any reaſon why thoſe words <hi>[ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
from all accuſation brought againſt them]</hi> ſhould
diſtaſte you. For what though an Accuſation be true, if
yet in ſome other reſpect it be of no force? May not
they be properly ſaid to be acquitted from all Accuſation,
who notwithſtanding the Accuſation, are freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
What matter is it how we are accuſed, ſo
long as we are ſure not to be condemned? Therefore the
Apoſtle uſeth theſe Expreſſions as equipollent, <hi>[Who
ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?]</hi>
and <hi>[Who is he that condemneth?]</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34.
Might you not as vehemently fall upon thoſe words of
the Apoſtle, <hi>[Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge,</hi> &amp;c.]
as you do upon mine? Might you not ſay, Why? I will
lay this, and that, and that, and ten thouſand things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
to their charge? Yea, but when you have done all
you can, to what purpoſe is it? <hi>For who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
them, notwithſtanding all the Accuſations
brought againſt them?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Medull. lib. 1. c. 27. §. 20.</note> Theſe very words of the Apoſtle
doth <hi>Ameſius</hi> alledg in the former of thoſe Sections
which you cite. And if (as you ſay) all may be there
fully ſeen in <hi>Ameſius,</hi> that you would ſay in this, then I
ſee not that you would ſay any thing againſt me, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you do ſay nothing. But what do you mean by thoſe
words, <hi>[and that as to the Law of Works]</hi> which by a
Parentheſis you thruſt in among mine? As if I meant,
that as well our Actions as our Perſons are accepted as
juſt, and acquitted from all condemnation by the Law of
Works. Truly I think <hi>tàm quàm,</hi> as well the one as the
other, that is indeed neither the one nor the other. The
Law doth convince of ſin, and (as much as in it lies)
condemn for ſin, both us and our Actions, even the beſt
of them: But by the New Covenant, Through Faith in
Chriſt we are accepted as juſt, though guilty of manifold
ſins; and our Actions are accepted alſo, though full of
imperfection. When you ſay, That the <hi>Reatus Culpa</hi>
cannot poſſibly be removed, or remitted, though I think
it is but a ſtriving about words, which I do not love, yet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51647:31"/>
I cannot aſſent unto it. For I think it is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſaid to be remitted or pardoned; neither doth that
ſeem proper or pertinent, which you add by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
[that is, <hi>The Man cannot be, or juſtly eſteemed
to be a Man that hath not ſinned]. Quid tum poſtea?</hi>
Cannot therefore the guilt of ſin be remitted? Yea, how
ſhould ſin be remitted, if it were not committed? I think
it is as proper to ſay, <hi>Remittere culpam,</hi> as <hi>Remittere
poenam.</hi> Surely if I may argue from the frequent uſe of
Phraſes, and hence infer the propriety of them, as you
did, there is nothing more uſual in Scripture, (and ſo
in other Writings, and in common Speech) then to ſay,
that Sins, Faults, Offences are remitted. <hi>Grotius</hi>

in reference unto Puniſhment: <hi>Remittere,</hi> or
<hi>miſſa facere peccata,</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith) is as much as
<hi>punire nolle.</hi> Yet this hinders not but that ſin, or the
guilt of ſin is properly ſaid to be remitted or pardoned;
yea (I think) it doth confirm it. For if it be proper
to ſay, That God will not puniſh ſin, and this is as much
as to remit or pardon ſin; then it is proper to ſay, That
God doth remit or pardon ſin. In a word therefore, my
words, about which you make ſo much adoe, are ſuch as
that I ſee not why any ſhould ſtumble at them. They do
not import, that our Actions, even the beſt of them, if
ſtrictly examined, are not ſinful; or that God doth not
ſee any ſin in them; but only that God doth pardon and
paſs by the ſinfulneſs of them, and accept them in Chriſt,
(who is the High-Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, that doth bear, and ſo take
away the Iniquity of our holy things, <hi>Exod. 28. 38.)</hi>
as if they had no ſin in them. Neither do I ſee why you
ſhould deteſt this juſtifying of our Actions, and yet grant
the juſtifying of our Perſons. Your Reaſons ſeem to
make as much againſt the one as againſt the other. For
are not our Perſons ſinful as well as our Actions? Surely
if the Action be ſinful, the Perſon whoſe Action it is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51647:32"/>
muſt needs be ſo too. And though you paſs over the
next, becauſe you reverſe your former Aſſertion, yet in
that which I there ſaid, you might have ſeen enough to
vindicate me from all that you have here ſaid againſt
me.</p>
            <p>1. You grant what I ſay.</p>
            <p>2. I have ſaid before,<note place="margin">42.</note> That though (in mine Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
ſin may properly be ſaid to be remitted, yet this is
in reference unto puniſhment.</p>
            <p>3. You had no reaſon to imagine, that I ſhould think,
that my Actions, or the Actions of the beſt upon Earth,
can be juſtified againſt all Accuſations, as if they were
abſolutely good and perfect; when in that very place I
ſpake of the imperfection and iniquity that is in our beſt
Actions, and how it is through Chriſt covered, and not
imputed unto us. Yea, and immediately I cited divers
places of Scripture <hi>(viz. Eccleſ. 7. 20. James 3. 2.
1 John 1. 8, 9. Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 4. Exod. 28. 38.)</hi> to prove, that
neither our Perſons, nor our Actions are ſo righteous,
but that we may be accuſed of, and condemned for ſin in
them, and ſo without the mercy of God in Chriſt muſt
be. It is ſtrange how you ſhould paſs by all this, it being
directly before your eyes, and ſhould raiſe a ſuſpicion, as
if I ſhould mean quite contrary.</p>
            <p>1. It will not follow that our Perſons being once juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> afterward they may be juſtified by our
Works, when once our Works themſelves are all juſtified
in that ſenſe as I explained it, <hi>viz.</hi> That firſt it is meant
only of good Works; and then that God doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thoſe good Works for their own ſake, as if they were
fully and perfectly Righteous, but for Chriſt's ſake par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
and paſſing by the imperfection that is in them.

merited by Chriſt, might well have been ſpared, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing at all againſt me, who am far from making
our Works meritorious, when I make even the beſt of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51647:32"/>
them imperfect, and to need pardon. 2. It is evident by
this very Section, to which you now reply, that I ſpake
only of good Actions. For how abſurd and ſenſleſs were
it to ſay, that our Sins are not fully and perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as I there ſay that our Works are not? The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sections alſo clearly ſhew of what Works I ſpake; ſo
that here you do but <hi>nodum in ſcirpo quaerere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Aſſerting may well enough be called Confeſſing,<note place="margin">

though it be that, and ſomewhat more.</p>
            <p>2. I cannot tell what Judgment ſome others may be
of, I ſpeak for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>3. I take all ſin to be againſt the Law, as it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from the Goſpel, though ſome ſins may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
by the Goſpel. Of that Law I ſuppoſe St. <hi>John</hi>
ſpake, ſaying, <hi>Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 4. And St. <hi>Paul, By the Law is the knowledg of ſin,</hi>
Rom. 3. 20. And again, <hi>I had not known ſin but by
the Law: for I had not know luſt,</hi> (or as the Margent
hath it, <hi>concupiſcence, viz.</hi> to be ſin) <hi>except the Law
had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. I think it
is the common judgment of Divines, that every ſin is
againſt ſome of the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>4. It is no hard matter to conceive how unbelief, and
neglect of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſins againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Decalogue. The firſt precept requires us to
have the Lord, and him only, for our God; and ſo to
believe whatſoever he doth reval unto us, and to perform
whatſoever he doth require of us. The ſecond Precept
requires us to Worſhip God as he himſelf doth preſcribe;
and conſequently not to neglect any of God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
See Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> of the Sabbath,
<hi>Part. 2. Chap.</hi> 4. §. 21, 22, 23. What you add after,
makes all for me in this particular, only ſome things ſeem
meet to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>1. This (I confeſs) to me is ſtrange Philoſophy,
That the Earth, of which Man's Body was made, ceaſed
not to be Earth ſtill, when it was made Man. As well
may you ſay, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s rib, of which <hi>Eve</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
ceaſed not to be a Rib ſtill; and ſo that all the
Elemenrs retain their ſeveral Natures in all mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Precept and Threatning</hi> (you ſay) <hi>are parts
of the New Law, though they be common with the Old.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51647:33"/>
Here you ſeem to grant, That nothing is commanded, or
threatned in the New Law, which is not commanded or
threatned in the Old. Me-thinks then you ſhould not
make a Two-fold Righteouſneſs, and a Two-fold Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
one in reſpect of the Old Law, another in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the New. The Precept <hi>[believe]</hi> belongs to
the Old Law; but as it is not only a Precept, but alſo a
Condition, upon performance of which Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<hi>[Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved]</hi> ſo it belongs
to the New Law. So this Threatning <hi>[If thou doſt not
believe, thou ſhalt periſh]</hi> belongs to the Old Law, as
threatning death for every ſin, and conſequently for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
which is a ſin: and it belongs to the New Law,
as leaving an Unbeliever under the condemnation of the
Old Law both for that ſin of unbelief, and alſo for all
other ſins, from the guilt of which he cannot be freed,
becauſe he doth not perform the Condition, which the
New Law to that end doth require of him. And (as I
have before noted) the Condemnation of an Unbeliever
is now increaſed, as his Sin is, by neglecting Salvation
offered upon condition of believing.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay, That <hi>the promiſſory part of the Law of
Works doth not oblige.</hi> But your Reaſon ſeems invalid,
<hi>Quia ceſſat materia, vel capacitas ſubjecti.</hi> You mean,
no Man can perform the Condition; and ſo no Man is
capable of the Promiſe made upon that Condition. But
why may it not be ſaid, That as the Precept, which is
alſo the Condition, ceaſeth not, though none be able to
obey it; ſo the Promiſe doth remain, though none can
enjoy the benefit of it? It may ſeem unreaſonable, that
the Threatning ſhould ſtill be in force, and the Promiſe be
quite taken away.</p>
            <p>4. You ſay again, That <hi>the Earth, of which Man's
Body was made, doth ſtill retain the form of Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which ſurely doth need further Explication, or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or both.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The threatning of the New Law</hi> (you ſay) <hi>hath
ſomething proper to the New Law:</hi> But for any thing I
ſee, the New Law doth threaten nothing, which the Old
Law doth not threaten; though as by the New Law there
is an aggravation of ſin, ſo there will be an increaſe of
condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51647:33"/>
6. Whereas you ſay, that the right ſtating and clear
apprehenſion of this part, <hi>(viz.</hi> of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Law and the Goſpel, and how far the Law of
Works is abrogated) is of greater moment and difficulty
by far than my Animadverſions take notice of, or than
any thing (as to difficulty) that I deal with; truly my
deſire was, and ſo is, only to give you ſome hints for the
further clearing of things in the Second Edition of your
<hi>Aphoriſms.</hi> But if you think, that here in this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is ſomewhat long, you have ſufficiently expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
thoſe Points, I am not of your mind.</p>
            <p>1. All that you here ſay is nothing to my <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
               <note place="margin">44.</note>
only you ſtrive a little about the acceptation of thoſe
words <hi>[the Moral Law].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Neither do I make the Moral Law as taken for the
Precept conjunct with the Threatning, a true part of the
New Law: yet the Moral Law ſo taken, being not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or abrogated by the New Law, as you grant, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
while they remain ſuch, both for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and for their other ſins, are under condemnation, as
belonging unto them by the Old Law, there being no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
provided for them by the New Law; which hath

            <p>1. He that is juſtified,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 47, 48, 49.</note> is ſo freed from all condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he is liable to no condemnation, <hi>Rom. 8. 1,
33,</hi> 34. And he that is ſo freed, is perfectly freed, and
conſequently perfectly juſtified, though the freedom from
condemnation, and ſo the juſtification be not ſo fully and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51647:36"/>
perfectly made manifeſt as it ſhall be. The freedom from
condemnation <hi>per ſententiam Judicis,</hi> of which you
ſpeak, doth not add to the freedom it ſelf, but only to the
manifeſtation of it. The Sentence is indeed paſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 18. though it be not ſo ſolemnly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as it ſhall be.</p>
            <p>2. He that is freed from all Condemnation, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
freed from all Accuſation, ſo as that no Accuſation
can be prejudicial to him; though he may be accuſed, yet
it matters not, ſeeing he cannot be condemned. Elſe the
Apoſtle had triumphed before the Victory, ſaying, <hi>Who
ſhall lay any thing to the charge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth?</hi>
Rom. 8. 33, 34.</p>
            <p>3. The Apoſtle doth not only ſay, <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. but
alſo, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's
Elect?</hi> v. 33. <hi>viz.</hi> when they are in Chriſt, and ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Which in effect is as much, as if it were ſaid,
There ſhall be no condemnation to ſuch. But you grant,
That other Texts ſpeak as much, and that ſuch neither
now are, nor ever ſhall be under condemnation. Yet
you ſay, That they would be to morrow condemned, if
no more were done than is done. You mean (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
if they did not renew the Act of Faith: but (I
ſay, and you grant it) they who are once juſtified,
though they ſin daily, yea, and may lie long in ſin, as
<hi>David</hi> did, yet they ſhall renew the Act of Faith, and
have the joy of God's Salvation reſtored unto them, as
he prayed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. Neither is there any interciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Juſtification, though there may be a privation of
the joy and comfort of it.</p>
            <p>To your Objections, I anſwer, <hi>Ad</hi> 1. He that is
once juſtified, can contract no guilt ſo as to fall from his
Juſtification. Beſides, when I ſpake of Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfect, I only mean, That a Juſtified Perſon is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
not in part only, but fully, <hi>i. e.</hi> from all ſins
which at preſent he is guilty of: not but that his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hath need to be renewed in reſpect of new ſins;
and ſo his Juſtification may be ſaid to increaſe <hi>extenſivè,</hi>
as extending to more and more ſins, as they are increaſed
more and more. But that in this reſpect we ſhall be more
fully juſtified at the laſt Judgment than we are now, is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51647:36"/>
but by accident, and not from the Nature or Eſſence of
Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Ad 2. <hi>Juſtification</hi> per Sententiam Judicis, &amp; Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam

There is not the like reaſon of Predeſtination,

perfect, though it be not ſo perfectly made manifeſt as
hereafter it ſhall be. So if by <hi>[Marriage not ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized]</hi>
you mean a Marriage not publickly celebrated, I
ſee not but that a Marriage privately celebrated may be in
it ſelf as perfect as the other. But it ſeems ſtrange, that
you ſhould think, that we ſhould ſcarce be called Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51647:37"/>
now, but in reference to Juſtification at the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
when-as both Scripture and Divines uſually ſpeak
of Juſtification as a thing that we are here actually parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of. What you ſay of Mr. <hi>Lawſon,</hi> as if he held,
That Juſtification here is but a right to Juſtification here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
I much wonder at: His Reaſons I know not, but
if that be his Opinion, the whole current of Scripture,
and the general conſent of Divines (I think) is againſt
him. Whereas you call the ſolemn pronouncing of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
at the laſt day, Sentential Juſtification, I ſhould
rather call it, Publick Sentential Juſtification, or a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
manifeſtation of the Sentence of Juſtification. For
ſurely our Juſtification here is<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See the</hi> Oxford <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> p. 7. <hi>and</hi> Ameſ. Med. lib. 1. cap. 27.</note> Sentential. God doth
now pronounce and ſentence Believers Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though not in that clear and evident manner as he
will at the Laſt Judgment. Neither do I think that our
Divines commonly uſing the word <hi>[Juſtification]</hi> for
Juſtification (as you ſay) by Sentence, do underſtand
it of the Sentence at the laſt Day, but of the Sentence
whereby God doth now juſtifie thoſe that believe.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will ſay, Where is that Sentence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is in the Scripture. But (you may ſay)
The Scripture ſpeaks only in general. Well, but if God
in the Scripture ſay, That <hi>all that believe are juſtified,</hi> as
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. then conſequently he ſaith, That you and I
believing, are juſtified. And this Sentence God by his
Spirit doth bring home to Believers in particular; though
it is true, they have not that clear evidence and full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as they ſhall have hereafter. So for Condemnation
at the laſt day, I think it to be but a more ſolemn and
publick pronouncing of the Sentence, together with the
immediate and full execution of it. For otherwiſe the
Sentence is paſt already, <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already,</hi> John 3. 18. I do not deny, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative
Juſtification at the laſt Judgment, is properly
Juſtification; only I think it is the ſame Juſtification
which Believers here have, though it ſhall then be more
fully manifeſted than now it is. That which you ſpeak of
Juſtification being more full at death than before, only
ſhews that it is more full <hi>Extenſivè,</hi> as freeing from the
guilt of more ſins: but that is only <hi>per accidens;</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in it ſelf conſidered, was as perfect before: for it
freed from all ſin, and from all Condemnation, and the
other doth no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:51647:38"/>
What the meaning of your Queſtion was,<note place="margin">50.</note> 
               <hi>[If we be
not one real Perſon with Chriſt, then one what?]</hi> I
could not tell: but the words did ſeem to imply, That
we muſt either be one real Perſon with Chriſt, or elſe we
could not any way be one with him; whereas the Scripture
is clear, that Believers are one with Chriſt, though that
they are one real Perſon with him, is not to be admitted.
Therefore I thought meet to anſwer as I did, <hi>viz.</hi> That
we are <hi>one Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
17.</hi> that is, ſpiritually one with Chriſt, as being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of one and the ſame Spirit with him. No doubt but
further Queries may ſtill be made: and who is able to
clear all Difficulties that do occur in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Yet I ſee not why we ſhould not content our ſelves
with thoſe Similitudes and Reſemblances, which the
Scripture doth uſe to illuſtrate this Myſtery, as of the
<hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> Joh. 15. and of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
Epheſ. 5.</p>
            <p>To your next Section I need ſay no more than this,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>Non oportet litigare de verbis, cum de re conſtet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſhewed my meaning all along,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt's
Satisfaction, and not Faith, is properly that by which we
are juſtified. Whereas you ſay, <hi>[We are juſtified by Faith
it ſelf, as the Condition, and not ſo by Chriſt]</hi> I can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it only thus, That Faith is the Condition required of
us, that ſo we may be juſtified by Chriſt. Otherwiſe I
cannot yeeld, that the performing of the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us unto Juſtification, is properly that by which
we are juſtified; but of that enough before. For the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
and Act of Faith, I little doubt but that Habits and
Acts are of a different nature. For Habits may be in us
when we ſleep, or otherwiſe do not act and exerciſe thoſe
Habits. I think alſo, that though acquired Habits fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Acts, yet infuſed Habits (ſuch as Faith is) go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>2. The Act of Faith being the receiving of Chriſt, I
ſee not how any can make the Act of Faith, but the Habit
to be the Inſtrument of receiving Chriſt. And if any of
our Divines ſay, That it is not the Habit of Faith, but
the Act that doth juſtifie; I think they mean, that Faith
doth juſtifie as acting, <hi>i. e.</hi> receiving Chriſt. So that
they do not deny the Habit of Faith to juſtifie, yea, they
make it the inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtification; only they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51647:38"/>
make the Act of Faith requiſite unto Juſtification. The
Similitude betwixt the Hand and Faith is to the purpoſe,
though they differ as you ſay. No Similitude is to be ſet
on the Rack: if it ſeem to illuſtrate that for which it is
uſed, it is ſufficient. But except you ſpeak of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
perfection of the Soul, I ſee not how Faith is the
perfection of it. For the Soul hath its natural perfection
without Faith, or any other Habit. Whereas you labour
much to prove, that the Habit of Faith is not properly
an Inſtrument, I think you trouble your ſelf to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
though (I know) you have ſome end in it. But
what if it be not an Inſtrument properly, if yet it may
not unfitly be ſo termed? And for any thing I ſee, it
may, even as generally Divines do ſo term it.</p>

we ſhall ſcarce know how to ſpeak: It is well if
we can find words, whereby to expreſs our ſelves ſo as
that others may underſtand (if they pleaſe) what we
mean. All that our Divines mean, when they ſpeak of
Faith juſtifying Inſtrumentally, or as an Inſtrument, I
ſuppoſe, is this, and ſo much alſo they uſually expreſs,
That Faith doth not juſtifie abſolutely, or in reſpect of it
ſelf, but Relatively in reſpect of its Object, Chriſt and
his Righteouſneſs laid hold on and received by Faith.
Neither ſhould you (me-thinks) ſtrive about the word
<hi>[Receiving]</hi> how it ſhould be the Act of Faith. It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth,
That the Scripture makes Believing in Chriſt, and
Receiving of Chriſt, one and the ſame, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12.

to the Reformed Cauſe and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>My meaning is,<note place="margin">52.</note> That Faith juſtifieth, as it apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

            <p>You miſtake my Argument, and do not mind the
Text which I alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all
that believe are juſtified,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore not only all that
believe in Chriſt are juſtified, but it is by him that they
are juſtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Obedience, as it is expreſſed
<hi>Rom. 5. 19.</hi> So that Chriſt's Obedience is that which is
properly imputed for Righteouſneſs, though it be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
only to thoſe that believe; Faith to apprehend it,
is required of us, that it may be imputed to us; and in
that reſpect Faith is ſaid to be imputed for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt Note ſeems to ſhew thus much, That ſome
may make Faith an Inſtrument of Juſtification, and yet
deny that we are properly juſtified by it as by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51647:42"/>
Though if this be granted, I ſee not what you
gain by it. For (as I ſaid in the <hi>Animadverſion)</hi> they
that make Faith an Inſtrument of Juſtification, when
they deny that we are properly juſtified by Faith; they
mean, That Faith is not the<note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt juſtitia, nec juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia loco habetur, &amp;c. Rivet <hi>before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </note> Righteouſneſs by which
we are juſtified; and that we are therefore only ſaid to
be juſtified by Faith, becauſe by Faith we receive the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which Righteouſneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
we are juſtified. That this is the meaning of our
Divines, appears by that which I have before alledged.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore who thoſe be, of whom you ſpeak, I do
not know: However, I do not ſee that your Objections
are of force. For Faith is not wholly excluded as to the
Text, though it be ſo interpreted, as that by [Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted]
is meant Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> before cited.</note> as
apprehended by Faith; and I preſume that they whom
you tax, did ſo underſtand it. And this doth not exclude
Faith, but include it. Your Queſtion therefore ſeems
captious, <hi>[If by Faith be meant Christ's Righteouſneſs,
then what word doth ſignifie Faith?]</hi> For by Faith is
not ſimply meant Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Faith.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, which I cited, are clearly to
the purpoſe to which I cited them; neither do I ſee any
thing in them, which argue him to have been of another
mind than I am of. Whereas you add, <hi>[It ſeems he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the mistake of them, that affirm Christ's Active
Righteouſneſs as ſuch to be our Righteouſneſs].</hi> I think
your Scribe did miſtake, and it ſhould be, [he diſcerned
not]. For therein indeed, in that Chapter, but not in
the words which I cited, he differs both from you and me:
But I was willing to let that paſs, both becauſe it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our preſent purpoſe; and alſo I like not to ſhew
my diſſent from any eminent Writer, except I be forced
to it.</p>
            <p>4. What you ſay you will alledge out of <hi>Davenant</hi>
againſt me, is to be conſidered when it is alledged. But
here you profeſs your ſelf far from approving what he
ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt's Righteouſneſs <hi>est formalis
cauſa juſtificationis ex communi noſtrorum ſententiâ;</hi>
You ſhould ſay, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to us:
for ſo <hi>Davenant</hi> hath it in the words which I cited. And
you ſhould alſo conſider how immediately before thoſe

               <hi>That</hi> to demand what is the formal

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Justification, who deny themſelves to be formally just in

            <p>Thus there is difference among our Divines about the

a want of the Condition required in the Goſpel, ſo (as

they may anſwer for themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. I take affiance (which is a Believing in, or Relying
on) to be an Act of Faith it ſelf, the Act of Faith being
as well <hi>Credere in,</hi> as <hi>ſimpliciter Credere.</hi> But internal
Obedience or Love, (for theſe you make both one, though
indeed Believing it ſelf is inward Obedience as well as
Love, the one being commanded as well as the other) is
not the Act of Faith, though cauſed by Faith; not <hi>actus
elicitus,</hi> though <hi>actus imperatus:</hi> therefore this is not ſo
immediate a product of Faith as the other.</p>
            <p>3. I conceive Affiance to be a part of Juſtifying-Faith,
and not only a Fruit of it. <hi>To believe in Chriſt,</hi> which
is as much as to rely on him, and to have affiance in him,
is requiſite unto Juſtification. <hi>He that believeth on him
is not condemned,</hi> John 3. 18.</p>
            <p>1. As Juſtification is begun upon ſole Believing,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſo is
it alſo continued and conſummated. The Scripture (ſo
far as I ſee) makes Juſtification ſimply and abſolutely to
depend on Faith, and not only in reſpect of the beginning
of it: yet (it is true) Juſtification is neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
nor continued, nor conſummated upon ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
as is not attended with other Duties. That this
is the Uniform Doctrine of the prime Proteſtants, I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51647:45"/>
ſhewed by the confeſſion of our greateſt Adverſary, to
which you oppoſe nothing.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this long Section I need not ſay much.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For now
that you explain your ſelf, there ſeems to be but little
difference betwixt us. All that I aim at, is this, That
Chriſt ſimply conſidered, is not the Object of Juſtifying
Faith, but Chriſt as promiſed in the Goſpel: ſo that to
believe in Chriſt, doth imply a believing of the Promiſe,
and that not only ſo as to aſſent unto it, but ſo alſo as to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51647:45"/>
apply it. And therefore we often find in Scripture, That
the Axiome or Propoſition concerning Chriſt, is made
the Object of Juſtifying and Saving Faith, ſee <hi>Rom. 10. 9.
1 Joh. 5. 1. Acts 8. 37. Joh. 6. 69.</hi> And thus our Divines
often ſpeak of Faith juſtifying as apprehending the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>

            <p>But I willingly grant, That the Axiome, Propoſition
or Promiſe doth but ſerve to convey Chriſt unto us, and
the apprehending and receiving of him, is the Faith by
which we are juſtified. Only I ſay, it is Chriſt in the
Promiſe, or Chriſt promiſed, who muſt be apprehended

            <p>All this I like well enough, ſave that he ſeems to make
the Act of Faith exerciſed about an Axiome or Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be only Aſſent, as to that which is true; whereas
ſomtimes it is alſo Apprehenſion and Receiving as of that
which is good, though (it's true) this Act of Faith is
principally terminated in the thing, which the Axiome or
Enunciation doth contain in it.</p>
            <p>1. I do not ſay,<note place="margin">56, &amp; 57.</note> That the receiving of Chriſt as King
is <hi>Fides quae juſtificat,</hi> though I grant it is <hi>Actus fidei

2. I refer <hi>[quà]</hi> to <hi>[Juſtificât] q. d.</hi> [Faith
which juſtifieth, doth receive Chriſt as King; yet this is
not the Act of Faith, whereby it juſtifieth]. Or if you
will, thus; Chriſt as King is the object of Faith, which
juſtifieth, but not of Faith as it juſtifieth. Indeed Faith,
which juſtifieth hath reſpect to the whole Word of God,
yet only to the Word of Promiſe concerning Chriſt, and
the Mercy of God in Chriſt, as it juſtifieth.</p>
            <p>Non tam quaeritur (inquit <hi>Ameſ.)</hi> quae aut quid ſit

Chriſto. Hinc omnes illi, quorum fides in eo capite
<hi>(Heb. 11.)</hi> laudatur, collimabant ad promiſſionem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
miſerecordiae in Chriſto.</p>
            <p>3. Where do I ſay, That the receiving of Chriſt as
King doth juſtifie, that you ask me in what ſenſe it doth
ſo? I ſay, Juſtifying Faith doth receive Chriſt as King,
but not as juſtifying; or that Faith in that reſpect doth
not juſtifie.</p>
            <p>4. Faith as the Condition of Juſtification is the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Chriſt as ſatisfying for us.</p>
            <p>5. If Chriſt's Satisfaction only be our Righteouſneſs,
by which we are juſtified; and Chriſt as Prieſt only made
Satisfaction for us, then by receiving Chriſt as Prieſt only
we are juſtified. This you might perceive was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Argument, though I left out the word [only].</p>
            <p>And here alſo I have Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> agreeing with me, as
(I think) in every point, wherein we differ, if he have
occaſion to treat of it.<note place="margin">Of the Coven.</note> 
               <q>[It is true <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that
Faith accepts Chriſt as Lord as well as Saviour: but it
is the acceptation of him as Saviour,<note place="margin">c. 12. p. 79.</note> not as Lord, that
juſtifies. Chriſt rules his People as a King, teacheth
them as a Prophet, but makes atonement for them as a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51647:46"/>
Prieſt, by giving himſelf in Sacrifice, his Blood for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sins. Theſe muſt be diſtinguiſhed, but not
divided: Faith hath an eye at all, the Blood of Chriſt,
the Command of Chriſt, the Doctrine of Chriſt: but
as it ties and faſtens on his Blood, ſo it juſtifies. <hi>He is
ſet out a propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom.
3. 24. not through Faith in his Command. It is the
Blood of Chriſt that cleanſeth from all ſin, and not the
Sovereignty of Chriſt. Theſe confuſions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
parts of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip, and the ſeveral
offices of Faith may not be ſuffered. Scripture aſſigns
each its particular Place and Work. Sovereignty doth
not cleanſe, nor Blood command us: Faith in his
Blood, not Faith yeelding to his Sovereignty, doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us. There are ſeveral acts of Juſtifying-Faith,
<hi>Heb. 11.</hi> but thoſe are not acts of Juſtification. It is
not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience, <hi>Moſes</hi> Self-denyal, <hi>Gideon</hi>
or <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Valour, that was their Juſtification, but
his Blood, who did enable them in theſe things by his
Spirit].</q>
            </p>
            <p>Your Similitude is not ſuitable; for a Woman recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Man for her Husband, may be enriched or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by him, though ſhe never look at him as rich or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
but only as her Husband. But we muſt look
at Chriſt as a Prieſt, and as making Satisfaction for us,
that ſo we may be juſtified by him. For the Scripture
doth ſet forth Chriſt unto us in that reſpect for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
ſee <hi>Apoc. 1. 5. Heb. 9. 26. 2 Cor. 5. ult. Rom.
8.34.</hi> where thoſe words <hi>[It is Chriſt that died]</hi> ſhew
how Chriſt doth juſtifie us, and free us from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> by dying, and ſo ſatisfying for our ſins. That
which follows of Chriſt's Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeems (as
to our Juſtification) but for our more full aſſurance of
the benefit of Chriſt's Death, and for the effectual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of his Satisfaction, which he made for us by his
Death, that ſo we may be juſtified by him.</p>
            <p>6. You grant, that Chriſt, not as King, but as Prieſt,
doth juſtifie us meritoriouſly and ſatisfactorily; and that
is it which I urge, That Chriſt's Satisfaction, which as
Prieſt he made for us, is that whereby, or for which we
are juſtified. Now we ſpeak of receiving Chriſt unto
Juſtification, therefore we muſt conſider him as ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for us, and ſo receive him as to that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51647:47"/>
our Juſtification; though (I grant) whole Chriſt, or
Chriſt in reſpect of all his Offices muſt be received; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may we think to have him as a Prieſt to ſatisfie for
us, except we alſo have him as a Prophet to inſtruct us,
and as a King to govern us. So I uſually Preach and
Teach.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">57.</note> 1. When you ſay,<note place="margin">(p. 69.)</note> That I leave the Errour in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but not in his Senſe, your words are ambiguous.
For they may import, That I leave, <hi>i.e.</hi> relinquiſh and
deſert the Error the one way, but not the other. Or
that I leave, <hi>i.e.</hi> let the Error abide and remain in his
Language, but not in his Senſe. This I take to be your
meaning, for elſe you could not ſay (except ironically,
which I do not ſuſpect) that it is a fair Expoſition,
and that you like it. I have no reaſon to ſtrive about
another's words, eſpecially not knowing how they are
brought in: but I think meet to interpret words in the
beſt ſenſe that they will bear: neither do I yet ſee but
thoſe words which you tax as foully erroneous, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that fair interpretation which I made of them.</p>
            <p>2. Where <hi>Ameſ.</hi> hath thoſe words, you do not ſhew: But
ſurely he there ſpeaks <hi>de Fide Juſtificante quà tali.</hi> For
otherwiſe he ſhould neither agree with the Truth, nor with
himſelf in ſaying, <hi>Chriſtus eſt objectum adaequatum Fidei
juſtificantis.</hi> The whole Word of God is the Object of
Juſtifying-Faith, though not of Faith as Juſtifying; and
ſo much is acknowledged by <hi>Ameſius,</hi> as appears by his
words before cited. Neither again doth he ſpeak of Chriſt
in all reſpects, but as Chriſt is the Propitiation for our
ſins, as is clear by that very place which you now take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beſides, I find</hi> Ameſius <hi>to have ſuch words as you
mention, but withall to add ſuch, as plainly to expreſs
what I ſay.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Medul.</note> Chriſtus (inquit) eſt adaequatum objectum

non aliâ ratione juſtificat, niſi quatenus apprehendit
illam juſtitiam, (N. B.) propter quam juſtificamur.</p>
            <p>1. The Text <hi>(1 John 4. 19.)</hi> cannot (I think) be
rightly underſtood but as I interpreted it.<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>&amp; 58.</hi>
               </note> For <hi>v. 10, 11.</hi>
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of God's great love manifeſted unto
us,<note place="margin">(p. 70.)</note> in giving his Son for us. And <hi>v. 19.</hi> he ſhews whence
it is that we love God, <hi>viz.</hi> from hence, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us firſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> we apprehending the Love of God to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51647:47"/>
us, anſwer his love with love again. <hi>Amat non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merito,
qui amatus ſine merito,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaketh.
Yet we muſt firſt find and feel the love of God towards
us, before we can love him for what he hath done for
us.</p>
            <p>2. There is more than a bare aſſenting Act of Faith
going before the Love, of which I ſpeak.</p>
            <p>3. Embracing, which from <hi>Heb. 11. 13.</hi> I note to be
the compleating Act of Juſtifying-Faith, doth include or
preſuppoſe <hi>amorem deſiderii;</hi> we can never ſincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Chriſt, if we do not deſire him: but <hi>amor delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi>
or <hi>complacentiae</hi> doth follow after embracing, <hi>viz.</hi>
when the thing deſired is enjoyed. All that you add, holds
only in reſpect of the former kind, not in reſpect of the
latter.</p>
            <p>1. There are divers kinds of Love, but I ſpeak of that<note place="margin">58.</note>
Love which differs from Deſire; and ſo did you ſeem to
underſtand it, as I noted from your words, <hi>Aphoriſm,</hi>
p. 267.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas you ſay, <hi>[There is no need of Faith to
make it preſent, before it can be accepted and loved];</hi>
you cannot by Faith mean Aſſent, for that, you grant,
doth go before Love and Acceptance. And if by Faith
you mean Acceptance, ſurely there muſt be Acceptance,
before a thing can be accepted, though in time theſe go
together. But perhaps you only mean, That though
Faith as an Aſſent, muſt go before in time, and as an
Acceptance muſt go before in Nature, yet not ſo as to
make a thing preſent. For you add, That God's Offer
doth make it preſent. But though the Offer be preſent,
yet the thing offered is not preſent, ſo as the Object of
the Love of Complacency muſt be: for it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by way of Enjoyment, but the offer of a thing can

it be offered, yet until it be accepted, it is abſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not enjoyed. The thing offered muſt be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
and in that reſpect lovingly accepted; but it muſt
firſt be accepted, and then loved, ſo as to joy and delight

            <p>3. We look at Chriſt as enjoyed, when we love him
with the Love of Complacency and Delight, of which
Love I ſpeak.</p>

            <p>4. As Aſſent muſt go before Acceptance, ſo muſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
go before that Love, of which I ſpeak.</p>
            <p>1. I did not ſay,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or think, that you thought ſo of all
Love, <hi>viz.</hi> that it conſidereth its Object as preſent or
enjoyed; for there is no diſtinguiſhing here of theſe, as
I have ſhewed before; the Object is not preſent, except
it be enjoyed. You grant that <hi>Amor Complacentiae</hi> doth
ſo conſider its Object; and I thought you had meant that
kind of Love, becauſe you did diſtinguiſh Love from
Deſire. Therefore I ſaid, [Love as you take it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
its Object as preſent and enjoyed] <hi>viz.</hi> Love as
diſtinguiſhed from Deſire. I know not (I confeſs) what
to make of Love, but either a Deſire, if the Object be
abſent, or a Delight, if the Object be preſent.</p>
            <p>2. That which you ſay concerning Acceptance, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Conſent, is nothing to me, who do not enquire
whether they be divers acts or no, but only ſhew that they
go before Enjoyment, and ſo differ from Love, as I
take it, <hi>viz.</hi> Love of Complacency, which doth follow
Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">59.</note> I take the Love of Deſire to go before Acceptance, and
the Love of Complacency to follow after it. Although

you in the next Section ſay, <hi>[Deſire is Love, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency

            </p>
            <p>1. I did not doubt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> much leſs deny that there is <hi>Amor
Deſiderii,</hi> as well as <hi>Amor Complacentiae;</hi> only I ſhewed,
that your words there muſt be meant of the former, in
which ſenſe I did not oppoſe you, but as it is taken in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51647:48"/>
other ſenſe; and ſo you ſeemed to take it before, becauſe
you did expreſly diſtinguiſh it from Deſire.</p>
            <p>Neither is your ſecond any thing againſt me.</p>
            <p>3. The Scripture is not ſo much to be interpreted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the moſt comprehenſive ſenſe, as according to the
moſt proper ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that which doth beſt agree with
the Context and other places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Your fourth containeth nothing but a <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> very
unworthily uſed of ſuch a worthy Man as <hi>Calvin</hi> was.</p>
            <p>1. The places,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which you alledg <hi>(John 16. 27.</hi> and
14. 21.) do not prove, that Love, <hi>viz.</hi> our Love is an
antecedent Condition of God's Love, and Chriſt's Love
to us, ſo that we muſt firſt love God and Chriſt, before
we can be reconciled unto God in Chriſt. For becauſe we
are reconciled unto God in Chriſt, therefore we love God
and Chriſt, <hi>1 John 4. 19.</hi> The meaning of thoſe other
places (as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes) is this, That they that love
God, <hi>inſculptum habent in cordibus Paterni ejus amoris
reſtimonium:</hi> To which may be added, That God will
ſtill manifeſt his Love to them more and more.</p>
            <p>2. Not only Love, but Obedience alſo muſt go before
Glorification; but it doth not therefore follow, That
they muſt go before Juſtification, as your ſelf hold that
Obedience doth not as we are at firſt juſtified. That
there is any other Condition of Juſtification at laſt than
at firſt, is more than I can find in Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. What ſome have anſwered,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and what you have read
in others I know not; you cite none whoſe Works are
extant, but only Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> and him at large, <hi>[On the

            <p>[The Covenant of Grace <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> exacteth no other

per charitatem, atque alia bona opera.</p>
            <p>2. I grant, That <hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae</hi> is prerequiſite;
if you will call it ſo, as I ſee not but you may, though
<hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae,</hi> is uſually oppoſed to <hi>Amor Amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
and ſo you ſpeak of it, <hi>p. 58.</hi> And if you ſpeak not
of <hi>Amor Complacentiae,</hi> then neither do I ſpeak againſt
you. For of that do I ſpeak, and had reaſon (I think)
to underſtand you as ſpeaking of it, becauſe you ſpake of
Love as diſtinct from Deſire. Perhaps you ſpeak of it
only in reſpect of its Generical Nature, abſtracting from
the conſideration of either Deſire or Complacency, which
are the Species of it: but ſurely theſe two taking up the
whole nature of Love, that Love which is not the one of
theſe, muſt needs be the other. We accept or chuſe a
thing, becauſe we firſt Love, <hi>i.e.</hi> deſire it, or (as we
uſe to ſay) have a mind to it: and having accepted and
choſen it, we further love it, ſo as to delight in it, except
our Love turn into Hatred, as <hi>Amnon</hi>'s unchaſt Love
did: but the very Accepting or Chuſing of a thing is not
(that I ſee) properly a Loving of it.</p>
            <p>3. I grant, that all Love doth not preſuppoſe Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Conſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Love of Deſire doth not; but
the Love of Complacency doth. This is all that I have
deſired, and ſo much you have yeelded.</p>
            <p>1. The diſtinction of <hi>Fides quae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and <hi>Fides quà,</hi> as it
is frequently uſed by our Learned Writers, ſo it doth hold
good notwithſtanding any thing you have ſaid, or (I
ſuppoſe) can ſay againſt it.</p>

               <hi>(ſaith</hi> Rivet,

magni momenti. Siquis enim dicat, Chriſtus qui
homo eſt infinitus, &amp; Chriſtus quà homo eſt infinitus, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
ſamis exiſtimabit nihil differre has enuntiationes.</p>
            <p>I grant you more than you require, That not only
Chriſt as Lord, but even the whole Word of God is the
Object of Juſtifying Faith; but not therefore of Faith as
Juſtifying. The Hand may receive both Meat and Mony,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51647:49"/>
yet it doth not enrich, as it receiveth Meat, nor feed as it
receiveth Mony.</p>
            <p>2. If Chriſt's Satisfaction be our Righteouſneſs,
(which I think you have ever affirmed, though you would
alſo have another Righteouſneſs of our own, and that
unto Juſtification;) then I ſee not but that I may ſpeak
of Faith laying hold on and apprehending Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
For though the Satisfaction was made unto
God, yet it was made for us; and in that reſpect we are
to lay hold on it, and receive it, and not only to aſſent
to the truth of it.</p>

               <note place="margin">(p. 72)</note> which we muſt <hi>offerre Deo:</hi> but firſt we muſt by

becauſe it is required of us, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 60.</note> and I
think my labour well beſtowed, as being the occaſion of
it. I perceive all that you mean is this, That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
wherein God doth give Chriſt, is not of force to
make Chriſt ours until we believe. This who can queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Chriſt being given to be ours only upon condition of
believing? Yet Chriſt being ſo conditionally given in the
Covenant,<note place="margin">(p. 73<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</note> upon our believing he is made ours by vertue
of the Covenant: ſo that ſtill I ſee not but that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51647:50"/>
doth immediately make Chriſt ours, there being
nothing more to that end required of us, but to believe.
But how will it follow, that God doth juſtifie Men before
they believe, when by his Covenant he doth not juſtifie
but upon condition of Believing? The Grant of a thing
being Conditional, it cannot be actually obtained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Condition be performed, though upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Condition by vertue of the Grant there
be actual enjoyment.</p>

though I deny not but Chriſt may be received at once in
both reſpects: yet if he be, it is the receiving of him as
Prieſt, not as King, that doth juſtifie. I grant that the
receiving of Chriſt in reſpect of any one Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> doth vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
include the receiving of him in reſpect of all his
Offices: and he that doth not ſo receive Chriſt in reſpect
of his Prieſtly Office, as to be ready to receive him alſo
in reſpect of his Kingly Office, when Chriſt ſhall ſo be ſet
forth unto him, doth not at all receive him: ſuch a Faith
is a falſe Faith, and cannot juſtifie. Yet may there be a
receiving of Chriſt as Prieſt without an expreſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
receiving of him as King, though implicitly and by
conſequence he be received as ſuch. Neither is it a falſe
Knowledg, though it be an imperfect Knowledg to know
Chriſt as a Prieſt, and not to know him as a King. And
that Chriſt is ſometimes propounded only as a Prieſt, <hi>i.e.</hi>
with expreſs mention only of his Prieſtly Office, ſeems
clear and undeniable by divers places of Scripture; ſee
<hi>John 1. 29, 36.</hi> and 3. 14, 15. and ſo other places which
ſpeak of Chriſt as ſuffering for us, not mentioning his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
over us, though that is there implied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in other places. And though he be (as ſometimes
he is) expreſly ſet forth at once both as Prieſt and King,
and ſo muſt expreſly be received at once in both reſpects;
yet it hinders not, but that the receiving of Chriſt as
Prieſt, and not the receiving of him as King, is that
which juſtifieth. One may at once receive divers things,
and yet thoſe things not all ſerve for one and the ſame
uſe, but one thing may ſerve for one uſe, and another
thing for another uſe, all being, though in ſeveral reſpects,
uſeful and neceſſary to be received.</p>

            <p>4. <hi>James</hi> might well and ſolidly prove by Works done
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51647:51"/>
many years after, that the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereby
he was juſtified, was a Working-Faith, of a Working
Nature, a Faith fruitful in good Works, his Faith bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth ſuch fruit in due ſeaſon, and ſo ſhewing it ſelf
by Works when occaſion did require. <hi>Abraham</hi> (no
doubt) had many other Works, whereby his Faith did
appear, yet the Apoſtle thought meet to inſtance in that
Work, which was moſt remarkable; and by which his
Faith did manifeſt it ſelf in a more eſpecial manner.</p>

            <p>What your Parentheſis doth mean <hi>(Legal Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
I mean)</hi> I do not well underſtand. But how doth
<hi>James</hi> ſpeak of Juſtification as Continued, and not as
Begun? Is his meaning this, That a Man is indeed at firſt
juſtified by Faith only, but both Faith and Works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do continue his Juſtification? So you underſtand it:
but ſurely <hi>James</hi> doth neither ſpeak, nor mean ſo. For
by Faith alone without Works, in his ſenſe, a Man never
was, never can be juſtified. This is clear by his whole
Diſcourſe, for he calls him a vain Man that relies on
ſuch a Faith, and calls it a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> &amp;c. So that
when a Man is firſt juſtified, it is by a Working Faith:
not that Faith muſt neceſſarily produce Works at the firſt,
but it is (as I ſaid) of a Working Nature, of ſuch a
Nature as to produce Works when they are required;
which is the ſame with what you ſay out of <hi>Grotius:</hi> and
this doth anſwer all that you object againſt the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I ſtand for. Who can doubt but <hi>Abraham</hi>
was juſtified long before he offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Scripture
being expreſs for it? But how then? Therefore this Work
could be no Condition of that Juſtification which was
paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No indeed, that Work was not, nor could be;
but Faith apt to ſhew it ſelf by that Work, or any other,
when required, and conſequently a Working Faith might
be, and was the Condition of that Juſtification. <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
whom you cite, giving you ſuch a hint of it, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that you could not obſerve this. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
may well enough be reconciled, though both of them
ſpeak of Juſtification as Begun. For <hi>James</hi> doth not
require Works otherwiſe than as Fruits of Faith, to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51647:52"/>
brought forth in time convenient: and <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Works in that ſenſe.</p>

affirms that we are juſtified by Faith alone, he conſiders
not Faith as it is a part of our qualification inherent, or

But either there we muſt underſtand a Working-Faith

juſtifies, whether a Working-Faith only, and not a Faith

with the whole current of the Goſpel].</p>
            <p>

are ſo uncouth and incongruous, that I wonder how you
could perſwade your ſelf, much more think to perſwade
others to embrace them. <hi>Paul</hi> cites thoſe words to prove
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified only by believing, and that
Juſtification is by Faith only: And ſhall we admit of ſuch
an interpretation, <hi>[Faith doth juſtifie, but not only?]</hi>

What is this elſe but to make the Scripture a noſe of

            <p>St. <hi>James</hi> doth not ſpeak of Works perfecting Faith
more to the continuing and conſummating of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than to the beginning of it. For (which muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be remembred) he ſpeaks of Faith as <hi>apta nata ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari:</hi>
and ſuch a Faith is requiſite, that we may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as well at firſt as afterward. Otherwiſe Works nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at firſt nor afterward do concur with Faith to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
            <p>[A preparation or promptitude of Heart <hi>(ſaith
Mr.</hi> Ball) to good Works,<note place="margin">Of Faith, Part 1. c. 4. p. 57.</note> is an effect of Faith as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
as Juſtification].</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi>

the Promiſe of Life until we come to enjoy it].</p>
            <p>Yet again you ſay, That Faith is really perfected by
Works, as Works are a part of that neceſſary Matter (not
neceſſary at the firſt moment of Believing, but neceſſary
afterward, when we are called to it) whereby we are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51647:55"/>
juſtified againſt the Charge of non-performance of the
New-Covenants Condition, even againſt the Charge of
being an Unbeliever or an Hypocrite. But all this proves
not that Works give any perfection to Faith, but only
that they ſhew the perfection, <hi>i.e.</hi> the ſincerity, force,
and efficacy of it. Works may manifeſt a Man to be no
Unbeliever or Hypocrite: but it is his Faith, which being
unfained, doth indeed make him to be no Unbeliever or
Hypocrite. All therefore that you have ſaid, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt my interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>Jam. 2. 22.</hi>
[And by Works was Faith made perfect].</p>
            <p>7. Your ſelf deny <hi>neceſſitatem praeſentiae operum</hi> in
reſpect of our being juſtified at firſt. And for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibility
of Works to the effect of Juſtification, <hi>James</hi>
ſpeaketh not of it, but only ſhews, that Juſtifying Faith
is not without Works, <hi>viz.</hi> when God doth call for them.
He ſhews that Juſtifying-Faith is a Working-Faith, a
Faith ready to Work when occaſion doth require: But
that Works do therefore conduce unto Juſtification as
well as Faith, he doth not ſhew, neither doth this any way
follow upon the other. A Working-Faith is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtification, <hi>i.e.</hi> Faith which is of ſuch a nature
as to bring forth the Fruit of good Works in due ſeaſon;
yet are we not therefore juſtified by Works as well as by
Faith. For we are juſtified by Faith only apprehending
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; though the ſame Faith
that doth this, will alſo produce good Works, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Faith did.<note place="margin">Fides ſola juſtificat, quia ipſa eſt unicum inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; unica fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultas, in nobis quâ recipimus juſtitiam, Chriſti.</note> That Works do juſtifie the Faith, but
not the Perſon, though I uſe not to ſpeak ſo, yet I think
may be ſaid without any implication of Contradiction.
It is true, <hi>Juſtificatio cauſae eſt etiam Juſtificatio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae,
non ſimpliciter &amp; abſolutè, ſed quoad iſtam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam:</hi>
but they that uſe that diſtinction mean (I think)
only this, that Works ſhew Faith to be ſound and good,
yet it is Faith and not Works, by which a Man is ſimply
and abſolutely juſtified. Do not (I pray) here lay hold
on the word <hi>[abſolutely];</hi> it is referred to the word
<hi>[juſtified]</hi> not to the word <hi>[Faith].</hi> I do not ſay,
That Faith abſolutely conſidered doth juſtifie: no, it doth
juſtifie as it is conſidered relatively;<note place="margin">Bucan.</note> Faith, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt
apprehended by Faith,<note place="margin">Loc. 31. ad quaſt. 37.</note> is that whereby we are abſolutely
juſtified. Though Works may juſtifie againſt the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of being a final non-performer of the Condition
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51647:55"/>
(ſo I would ſay, not Conditions, in reſpect of the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of which we ſpeak) of the New Covenant; yet do
they not therefore ſimply and abſolutely juſtifie, but only
againſt that Accuſation, ſhewing that a Man did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> believe, and ſo is ſimply and
abſolutely juſtified, not by Works (which do but only
declare him to be ſo) but by Faith, as the Condition or
Inſtrument (for I will uſe the terms promiſcuouſly as
others do) of Juſtification. Faith doth not juſtifie as
Working, <hi>i.e.</hi> as bringing forth the Fruit of good Works;
your ſelf deny this in reſpect of our Juſtification at firſt:
yet Faith doth not juſtifie, except it be of a Working-Nature,
<hi>i.e.</hi> of ſuch a Nature as to work when God
calls for it. More than this cannot be inferred from <hi>Jam.

the Moral Law, which (as I ſaid in the <hi>Animadverſions)</hi>

            <p>The Moral Law may be ſaid to be a part of the New

<hi>Epheſ. 5. 15.</hi> But this is far, and very far too from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Works to have a co-intereſt with Faith in the effect
of juſtifying. For your Reaſons why the Apoſtle doth
not exclude all Works abſolutely from Juſtification, I ſee
no ſtrength in them; and therefore I anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 1.</hi> That which you call Juſtification againſt the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of final Unbelief, is indeed <hi>Juſtification</hi> againſt
the Accuſation of Tranſgreſſing the whole Law. For
that Accuſation being only made void by Faith, where
there is final Unbelief, there that Accuſation hath its full
force. Beſides, though the Accuſation of final Unbelief
may be proved to be falſe by Works, yet Works upon this
account do no otherwiſe juſtifie, than by manifeſting a
Man's Faith, by which Faith indeed, and not by Works
he is juſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 2.</hi> So alſo that Juſtification which <hi>James</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of, is againſt a true Charge, and the ſame with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
of ſins, as well as that which <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeak of.
For can they that have but a dead <hi>Faith,</hi> be juſtified
againſt a true Charge and have their ſins remitted? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it muſt be a Living and a Working <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch as <hi>James</hi>
doth require, can work that Effect. Juſtification againſt
a falſe Accuſation, is but ſuch a Juſtification as the worſt
of Men and the Devils themſelves are capable of.</p>
            <p>Nemo enim iniquus adco,<note place="margin">De Juſtif.c. 3. §. 11.</note>

            <p>Indeed Juſtification aginſt the Accuſation of final
Unbelief, is by conſequence a Juſtification againſt all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51647:56"/>
Accuſations, becauſe <hi>Faith</hi> is the Condition and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Univerſal Juſtification. But hence it follows
that we are juſtified univerſally by <hi>Faith,</hi> and not by
<hi>Works,</hi> which are only an Argument <hi>à poſteriori</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 3.</hi> All Works that have a co-intereſt with <hi>Faith</hi> in
Juſtification, are Competitors with Chriſt, or Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with him; ſo that Juſtification muſt be partly by
the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt through <hi>Faith,</hi> and partly
by <hi>Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 4.</hi> As the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is freely given
or imputed at firſt upon condition of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo is the free
gift and imputation of it ſtill continued upon the ſame
condition of <hi>Faith;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> both when Juſtification
is firſt begun, and when it is continued, muſt be a <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Faith,
i. e.</hi> ready to work as occaſion doth require.
If our Divines affirm, That the Apoſtle ſpeaking againſt
Juſtification by Works, means in point of merit, (as
you ſay you could bring multitudes of them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
ſurely it is, becauſe they know no other Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Works, but that which doth preſuppoſe Works to
be meritorious.</p>

And what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Election, we may well
apply to Juſtification: the ſame medium equally proves
the truth of both; If by Grace, then it is no more of
Works, otherwiſe Grace were no more Grace: But if it

Juſtification in point of merit; as if Juſtification might
be by Works in ſome other reſpect, ſo as that no merit
thereby is preſuppoſed. So far as I obſerve, our Divines
note this as one main Argument, whereby the Apoſtle
doth wholly exclude Works from Juſtification, becauſe
otherwiſe the merit of Works could not be denied, which
yet is to be exploded.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Centuriſts</hi> among many other Arguments,<note place="margin">Cent. 1.</note>

               <hi>Ad 5.</hi> All good Works (as I have ſhewed before)
and conſequently thoſe whereby we perform obedience
to the Redeemer, are works of the Law, it being the
Rule to which they muſt be conformed. But it is <hi>Faith</hi>
in the Redeemer, not Obedience to the Redeemer, by
which we are juſtified, though <hi>Juſtifying-Faith</hi> muſt,
and will ſhew it ſelf by Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 6.</hi> All Works that have an agency in Juſtification,
are meritorious, and ſo make the Reward to be of Debt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51647:57"/>
and not of Grace. Now to your Anſwers to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>oppoſitum</hi> I reply; And for the firſt thus; If
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Goſpel-Works did juſtifie him otherwiſe than
by evidencing his Faith, whereby he was juſtified, if they
be made to have a co-intereſt with Faith in his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then they are ſet in Competition or Copartnerſhip
with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>That no Work of the Goſpel doth juſtifie;<note place="margin">Of Juſtif. §. 2. ch. 2. §. 2.</note> Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>
proveth by this, That every Work of the Goſpel, is a
Work of the Law alſo; and therefore the Apoſtle deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a Man is juſtified by the Works of the Law,<note place="margin">See <hi>Rivet</hi> as cited pag. 145.</note> doth
conſequently deny that he is juſtified by the Works of the
Goſpel. That Works do juſtifie as Conditions under
Chriſt, is repugnant to what your ſelf hold in reſpect of
Juſtification as begun: and I ſee not, that the Scripture
ſhews us any other Condition of Juſtification afterward
than at firſt.</p>
            <p>2. My Concluſion, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified
by Works, but by Faith, is not againſt <hi>Jam. 2. 21.</hi> no
more than <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi> is. For I mean,
as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Works did not concur
with his Faith to his Juſtification: but <hi>James</hi> meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was not ſuch as ſome preſume
of a dead idle Faith, but a living working Faith; and
that his Works did manifeſt his Faith to be ſuch as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was juſtified.</p>

of remiſſion of ſins, becauſe his Works do juſtifie him,

4. Works as Works either juſtifie by way of merit, or
not at all: But <hi>Faith</hi> doth not juſtifie as a Work or Duty
required of us, but as an Inſtrument receiving Chriſt, or
(if you will) a Condition whereby we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

            <p>The Excluſion <hi>(viz.</hi> of VVorks from being concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<note place="margin">64.</note>
with Faith unto Juſtification) is not only Mr. <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>'s,
but generally all Proteſtants, and indeed <hi>Paul</hi>'s and
the Scriptures: and to take in VVorks (in that ſenſe)
is as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> before cited truly ſaith, againſt the whole
current of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>1. To deny the Scripture to mean as you interpret it,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>&amp;</hi> 65.</note> is
not to deny it to mean as it ſpeaketh. Whether the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which I alledged againſt your interpretation of
St. <hi>James</hi> be forced, let others judg.</p>
            <p>2. It avails your cauſe nothing to prove, That <hi>James</hi>
by working doth mean VVorks indeed. I preſume
Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> would not deny that, but his meaning (I
conceive) was, That VVorks are only ſpoken of as Fruits
of Juſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> and are only ſaid to juſtifie, becauſe
they are (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> ſpeaketh) a paſſive qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Subject or Party to be juſtified.</p>
            <p>[Hence <hi>(ſaith he alſo)</hi> is the ſeeming inconvenience
of St. <hi>James</hi> his Cauſal form of Speech (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>All that St. <hi>James</hi> intended is this, That Juſtifying
<hi>Faith</hi> is of a VVorking-Nature, and not ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as

for your Reaſons, I anſwer, <hi>Ad 1.</hi> You ſpeak of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs
of bare <hi>Faith, i. e.</hi> (ſay you) Aſſent.
But <hi>quorſum hoc?</hi> You know that Proteſtants make <hi>Faith</hi>
to juſtifie, not as it is a bare Aſſent, but as it is a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            <p>But to proceed, It is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Faith, i. e.</hi> ſeveral
kinds of <hi>Faith,</hi> which St. <hi>James</hi> oppoſeth one to the
other, <hi>viz. Faith</hi> which is a bare Aſſent, and without
Works, ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as the Devils have, and <hi>Faith</hi> which
is moreover an embracing of Chriſt, and the mercy of
God in Chriſt, and is attended with VVorks as the Fruits
and Effects of it, as the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi>
was. Though therefore he concludes, That <hi>Faith</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſave him that hath not VVorks, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> follows not that
VVorks concur with <hi>Faith</hi> unto Juſtification, but only
that a Juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> will ſhew it ſelf by VVorks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 2.</hi> It is granted, That <hi>Faith</hi> which is no more
than a bare Aſſent, is neither Juſtifying nor Saving: But
what of this? Is there no other <hi>Faith</hi> than Aſſent? Do
not you your ſelf make Acceptance, which is more than
Aſſent, the compleating Act of Juſtifying <hi>Faith?</hi> And
how can you ſay, That there is the ſame force aſcribed
to VVorks as to <hi>Faith,</hi> when you make Juſtification at
firſt to be by <hi>Faith</hi> without VVorks? Indeed VVorks are
requiſite in their place, but not as having the like force
with <hi>Faith</hi> unto Juſtification, (ſhew any Orthodox
VVriter that doth hold ſo) though as neceſſary Fruits of
that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are juſtified. Say not that you
ſpeak of Juſtification as continued, for VVorks, as
St. <hi>James</hi> doth ſpeak of them, are as neceſſary unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
at firſt as afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> a promptitude and
readineſs to do good VVorks: if this be wanting, it is
no Juſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> but (as St. <hi>James</hi> calls it) <hi>a dead
Faith;</hi> altogether vain and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 3.</hi> That <hi>Faith</hi> without VVorks is a hardening of
Unbelievers, I grant: <hi>ſed quid tum poſtea?</hi> Do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
VVorks juſtifie as well as <hi>Faith?</hi> But I do not think
that St. <hi>James</hi> brings in <hi>(chap. 2. 18.)</hi> an Unbeliever
ſo ſpeaking. For how ſhould an Unbeliever (a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51647:60"/>
Unbeliever, we mean; for you uſe to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

<hi>Faith,</hi> ſaying, <hi>[And I will ſhew thee my Faith?]</hi>

even that <hi>Faith</hi> whereby we are juſtified at firſt, as your
ſelf do hold. And you confeſs alſo that <hi>Faith</hi> doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
at firſt without VVorks; yet (ſay I) not except
it be of a VVorking-Nature, <hi>i.e.</hi> ready to VVork,
when VVorks are required: and otherwiſe than as Fruits
of Juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> VVorks do not juſtifie neither at firſt
nor afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 5.</hi> Faith without VVorks is dead, as to the effect
of Juſtification, even altogether unprofitable, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith
<hi>renuens operari,</hi> or which is not <hi>parata operari,</hi> as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jet
an</hi> doth well expreſs it.<note place="margin">In Jac. 2.</note> But this is nothing to prove a
Co-intereſt of VVorks with <hi>Faith</hi> in point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
it only proves, That Juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> is of a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nature. VVhereas you add, <hi>[Still here the oppoſite
part on one ſide is Faith and Works, and on the other ſide
Faith without Works];</hi> this doth nothing hinder, but
that the oppoſition is (as I ſaid) betwixt <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Faith, i. e.</hi> ſeveral kinds of <hi>Faith,</hi> whereof the one is
accompanied with VVorks, and the other not; the one is
operative and fruitful, the other idle &amp; barren. That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was juſtified not only by that <hi>Faith</hi> that did work,
but alſo by VVorks, is more than St. <hi>James</hi> doth ſay,
and is directly contradictory to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is more than you can ſay, without your diſtinction
of Juſtification Begun and Continued; which diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
St. <hi>James</hi> never thought of. For ſurely Juſtification
cannot be at firſt by a dead and unprofitable Faith, as he
affirms that to be, which is without VVorks. That in
<hi>Jam. 2. 22.</hi> cannot be meant that Faith by VVorks is
made perfect, as accompliſhing its ends, but only as thereby
declared and manifeſted to be perfect. The end of Faith is
to juſtifie; and your ſelf ſay, That Faith at firſt doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
without Works: ſo that in your Opinion Faith without
VVorks is perfect, accompliſhing its end in juſtifying at
firſt. But in St. <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe Faith doth not, cannot
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51647:60"/>
at all juſtifie without VVorks, <hi>i. e.</hi> if it be not ready to
work: and in that reſpect VVorks do perfect Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi>
they make the perfection of Faith to appear: but of
that enough before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 6.</hi> And ſo of that alſo in <hi>Jam. 2. 23.</hi> enough hath
been ſaid already. That Faith alone is the Condition of
the Initiation; but Faith and Obedience of the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Continuation, and Conſummation of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you often ſay, but never prove. Sure I am <hi>James</hi>
doth exclude Faith, which is without VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi> when
God doth call for them, from the very Initiation of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For he makes ſuch a Faith as unprofitable as
the Faith of Devils, who ſurely are ſo far from Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that they have not ſo much as the initiation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 7.</hi> You can never make more of that Concluſion
<hi>Jam. 2. 24.</hi> than that a Man is juſtified by a VVorking
Faith, or by a Faith which produceth VVorks, and ſo by
his VVorks appears to be juſtified. The words if taken
without any qualification, are againſt your ſelf, who will

that is not the Juſtifying Faith which our Divines do
ſpeak of, (as I have ſhewed before) who hold that Faith
alone doth juſtifie without VVorks, though withal they
hold that Faith which doth juſtifie is not alone without
VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi> when God doth call for them; and this is
all that St. <hi>James</hi> urgeth. Your own <hi>Analyſis</hi> doth

            <p>To conclude, It is not Faith as working that doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
but Faith as apprehending Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
Yet that Faith which doth apprehend Chriſt and
his Righteouſneſs, and ſo doth juſtifie, is a Working Faith.
Your ſelf grant that VVorks are not neceſſary <hi>quoad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiam,</hi>
in reſpect of Juſtification as begun: and that
they are neceſſary <hi>quoad effectum juſtificationis,</hi> in reſpect
of Juſtification as continued, is more (I preſume) than
ever will be proved.</p>

as you ever did, or more, and make Faith
to juſtifie as a Condition, and<note n="*" place="margin">To make Faith to be a Condition, is not to deny it to be an Inſtrument: Our Divines ſometimes term it the one way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other, as I have before ſhewed.</note> not as

            <p>I think that although Juſtifying-Faith doth receive
Chriſt intirely, yet as Juſtifying it receiveth him only in
reſpect of his Satisfaction, which is the Righteouſneſs by
which we are juſtified. There is no danger in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
ſo long as People are taught withal, that they
muſt not look to have Chriſt as a Prieſt ſatisfying for
them, except they alſo have him as a King reigning over
them. Neither doth it ſeem to me any groſs conceit,
That apprehending or applying of Chriſt's Satisfaction, or
of Chriſt as ſatisfying for us, is that act of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are juſtified. Your Similitude doth not ſuit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Husband cannot be offered to a VVoman in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reſpects, as Chriſt may be unto a Sinner. I do not
conceive Faith to juſtifie <hi>modo Phyſico,</hi> or merely becauſe
it is of that nature to apprehend Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
If it were not for the Promiſe of the Goſpel,
this Act of Faith would not avail. As ſuppoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
ſhould apprehend the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, yet
ſhould they not be juſtified, becauſe the Promiſe of the
Goſpel doth not belong unto them. Yet this apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs being the Phyſical
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51647:62"/>
Act of Faith, and withal made the Condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in that the Goſpel doth promiſe Juſtification unto
thoſe that apprehend Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; I ſee
not but I may well ſay, That Faith doth juſtifie us, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, this being it
which the Goſpel doth require unto Juſtification. Faith
as apprehending Chriſt being the Condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is all one to ſay, Faith doth juſtifie as apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Chriſt, and Faith doth juſtifie as the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
unto Juſtification. Whereas therefore you prove,
That Faith or Acceptance of Chriſt ſimply conſidered in
it ſelf doth not juſtifie; it is nothing to me, who do not
aſcribe any thing to Faith in order to Juſtification as it is
conſidered ſimply in it ſelf, but as it being of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is in that reſpect required of us, to that end that we
may be juſtified. And thus (I think) do others mean,
when they ſay, That Faith doth juſtifie as apprehending
Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs: they do not (I ſuppoſe)
exclude, but include the requiring of Faith in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
as a Condition of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Pemble <hi>having ſaid,</hi> [We are juſtified by Faith, <hi>i.e.</hi>
by the Righteouſneſs of Christ,<note place="margin">Of Juſtif. §. 2. c. 1. p. 27.</note> the benefit whereof unto
our juſtification we are made partakers of by Faith, as
the only Grace which accepts of the Promiſe, and gives
us aſſurance of the Performance]. <hi>He adds a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
[He that looked on Christ believing in him, may
truly be ſaid to be ſaved and juſtified by Faith, not for
the worth, and by the efficacy of that Act of his, but as
it is the Condition of the Promiſe of Grace, that must
neceſſarily go before the Performance of it unto us; upon
our obedience whereunto, God is pleaſed of his free Grace
to juſtifie us].</p>
            <p>But ſtill notwithſtanding all you ſay, my Argument
remains good; <hi>[Works concur not with Faith in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Christ, therefore they concur not with it in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying].</hi>
The Conſequence is good, becauſe Faith as
apprehending Chriſt is made the Condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For this is that which Believing in, or on Chriſt,
doth import, which is put as equivalent to the receiving
of Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 1. 12.</hi> That Repentance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
do concur with Faith in being Conditions of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and Conſummate Juſtification, you only affirm,
but do not prove. Indeed Repentance as taken for an
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51647:63"/>
acknowledgment of, and ſorrow for sin, is requiſite unto
Juſtification at firſt. For how ſhould we ever look unto
Chriſt as ſuffering for our ſins, except we be ſenſible of
them, and humbled for them. Yet it is Faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Chriſt, which in the Covenant is made the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Juſtification, as that whereby we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
It is neither Repentance, nor Obedience, though
Repentance (in the ſence before-mentioned) muſt go
before this Juſtifying-Faith, and ſo before Juſtification;
and obedience muſt follow after.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. You need not trouble your ſelf to prove,<note place="margin">69, &amp;c.</note> That by
VVorks are meant VVorks. For ſurely a working Faith,
or a Faith bringing forth the Fruit of VVorks, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
VVorks. But the Queſtion is, VVhether VVorks
concur with Faith in juſtifying, or only are inſeparable
Attendants, and neceſſary Fruits of that Faith which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.
You hold the former, yet only in reſpect of
continued and conſummate Juſtification: I hold the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in reſpect of Juſtification begun, continued, and
conſummate. VVhether of us hath more ground from
Scripture, let it be judged by what hath been ſaid about
it.</p>
            <p>But 1. whereas you ſay, That VVorks are ſtill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Faith without VVorks, or Faith alone, and not to
this or that ſort of Faith: I have ſhewed before from <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius</hi>
(not to ſpeak of our late VVriters) that there
is one ſort of Faith that is with VVorks, or of a working
Diſpoſition, and ſuch is Faith truly apprehending Chriſt:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51647:63"/>
and another ſort of Faith, that is without VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi>
a bare Aſſent: and that St. <hi>James</hi> doth oppoſe theſe two
ſorts of Faith one to the other, teaching that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by the former, not by the latter.</p>
            <p>2. You ſay, <hi>[It is not only Faith alone without a
working diſpoſition, but Faith alone without Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
when there is opportunity];</hi> yet your ſelf deny not
only the efficacy, but even the preſence of VVorks to be
requiſite, when we are at firſt juſtified: and St. <hi>James</hi>
denies Faith alone (ſo as he doth ſpeak of it) to have
any force at all to juſtifie, as being dead and unprofitable.
Therefore you muſt needs grant, That it is Faith alone,
without a working Diſpoſition of which St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Beſides, if there be a working Diſpoſition, there
will be VVorks themſelves when there is opportunity. But
all this doth only prove, That Juſtifying Faith is of a
working Diſpoſition, and produceth VVorks themſelves
when opportunity is offered: That VVorks do at any
time concur with Faith unto Juſtification, it no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
            <p>3. Surely a diſpoſition to feed the hungry, is accepted
of God, when there is no opportunity to do the thing it
ſelf. And ſo a Diſpoſition to work may be enough to
prove Faith to be of a right ſtamp, though VVorks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
be requiſite when there is opportunity: and ſtill I
muſt put you in mind, that your ſelf requires no more than
a diſpoſition to work, when we are firſt juſtified.</p>
            <p>4. What you can infer from <hi>Jam. 2. 13.</hi> I do not ſee.
He that expects mercy from God, muſt ſhew mercy to
his Neighbour. Doth it therefore follow, that VVorks of
Mercy juſtifie as well as Faith? No, but that Juſtifying
Faith muſt and will ſhew it ſelf by VVorks of Mercy.</p>
            <p>5. A real Faith being but a bare Aſſent, as in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
cannot juſtifie or ſave. Who oppoſeth this? Or
whom doth it oppoſe? So, that the ſame Faith is juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſaving, I think all will yeeld: yet is there more
required unto Salvation, as taken for the accompliſhment
of it, than unto Juſtification.</p>
            <p>6. VVho makes <hi>James</hi> v. 18. to ſpeak ſuch non-ſence
as you tell of? Do they, who ſay his meaning is, That
Faith is pretended in vain, if it do not ſhew it ſelf by
VVorks, as occaſion doth require? And what more can
any gather from <hi>v. 20, 22, 24, 26?</hi> You might ſave your
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51647:64"/>
labour of proving, That by VVorks are meant VVorks;
you ſhould prove that Works are ſpoken of as concurring
with Faith, and as having a co-intereſt with it in the
effect of juſtifying, and not only as Fruits of that Faith
by which we are juſtified. This is that which they mean,
who ſay that <hi>James</hi> doth ſpeak of a working Faith, <hi>i.e.</hi>
a Faith ready to work, and ſo actually working, when
God doth require it, not as if inſtead of [Works] it
were good ſenſe always to put [a working Faith]. Such
ſophiſtry doth not become us.</p>
            <p>7. That <hi>James</hi> doth aſſert the neceſſity of Works, as
fruits of Juſtifying Faith, is ever granted: that he doth
aſſert the neceſſity of them as concurrent with Faith unto
Juſtification, is never proved. Works are therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to prove Faith to be ſuch as God requires unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
            <p>Againſt this firſt you ſay, <hi>James</hi> doth make VVorks
or Working neceſſary to juſtifie; I ſay, he doth not, but
only drives at this, That none muſt think to be juſtified
by Faith, except it be a working Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and
<hi>Rahab</hi>'s was. You ſay, <hi>[The Soul doth not truly ſignifie
the Body to be alive].</hi> But the word <hi>Jam. 2. 26.</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that the meaning of St. <hi>James</hi> is, As the Body without

are as it were the breathing of a lively Faith) is dead].</p>
            <p>But if by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> there be meant the Soul, as <hi>1 Cor. 6. ult.</hi>
I hope you will not ſo underſtand it, as to compare Faith
to the Body, and Works to the Soul, as if Works were
the Soul of Faith, and ſo did give Life unto it: whereas
indeed Faith doth produce Works, and Works do but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
Faith, and the lively power of it.</p>
            <p>[The Apoſtle <hi>(ſaith</hi> Fulk) in this Similitude doth not

            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:51647:64"/>
2. God (you ſay) needs no Signs. Well, but God
(ſay I) requiring ſuch a Faith, whereof Works are
Signs, as Fruits and Effects of it, we muſt look to the
ſigns of our Faith, to find it ſuch as God requires of us
to our Juſtification. <hi>Maccovius</hi> (it ſeems) met with the
Objection;<note place="margin">De Juſtif. Diſp. 10. ubi plura in hanc rem vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re licet.</note> 
               <hi>At Deo non est opus experimento.</hi> Reſp. <hi>Hoc
ſane verum est: at non proinde ſequitur homines non
praebere ſui experimentum Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Faith may be real, and yet not juſtifying. A real
Aſſent, yea and Conſent, if limited, ſo as to exclude
Chriſt's dominion over us, is not that Faith which your
Oppoſers plead for.</p>
            <p>4. The New Teſtament doth make a working Faith,
yet not Faith as working the Condition of Juſtification.
I wonder how you can ſtumble at this, when as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
hold, That we are juſtified at firſt by Faith without
Works: yet ſurely that Faith whereby we are juſtified at
firſt, is a working Faith, <hi>i.e.</hi> of a working Nature, and
will, when there is opportunity, ſhew it ſelf by Works.
That working therefore is together with Faith the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtification, is more than your own Principles
will admit, without that diſtinction of Juſtification In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choated,
and Juſtification Continued, of which though
you make much uſe, yet I ſee little ground for it. Now
for Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi>'s words, which I cited, I think they
are clear enough againſt you.</p>
            <p>For firſt he ſaith, That Faith alone juſtifieth and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Works only Concomitants or Fruits of that Faith by
which we are juſtified. You limit it to Juſtification as
begun, but he ſpeaks of Juſtification ſimply conſidered,
and not as begun only.</p>
            <p>2. He ſpeaks indeed of a double Juſtification, but not
as you do, nor to that intent to bring in a double Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
as requiſite unto Juſtification. All that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
is this, That we are juſtified only by Faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine; yet (as <hi>James</hi> teacheth) our
Faith muſt appear to be a true Juſtifying Faith by VVorks,
otherwiſe it is but a falſe and feigned Faith, as it preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to be Juſtifying, and he that pretendeth it, is a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.
His words without doing violence unto them,
can have no other ſenſe put upon them. VVhen any one
is accuſed of being but a ſeeming Believer, or a mere
Believer without Obedience, take Believing merely as it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51647:65"/>
is the Condition of Juſtification by the Covenant, it is
but (as I have often ſaid) the making good this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
That he is a Tranſgreſſor of the Law, and to be
condemned by the Law for the tranſgreſſion of it, and ſo
much the more in that he neglected the benefit offered in
the New Covenant. So that in this caſe to juſtifie a Man
by his Faith and VVorks, is but indeed to plead that he is
juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed unto him
through Faith, which Faith is proved to be ſound and
good by his VVorks.</p>
            <p>1. I ſee you are very tenacious of your Opinion: but
if you will not forſake your Opinion till you ſee better
Arguments to draw you from it, marvel not if others
will not embrace your Opinion till they ſee better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to draw them to it. But to the Matter; Me-thinks
you might eaſily ſee the meaning of this, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
firſt Juſtification could not be by Faith, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
VVorks, <hi>i.e.</hi> by Faith, which was not of a working
Nature.</p>
            <p>Thus in that very page (52.) I explained my ſelf,
ſaying, [Faith if it be alone without VVorks, <hi>i.e. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuens
operari, &amp;c.</hi> cannot juſtifie].</p>
            <p>2. Do not you ſee that your Anſwer is to no purpoſe in
limiting the words of the Apoſtle to Continued and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
Juſtification, whereas he doth utterly exclude
Faith, which is without VVorks, or which is not of a
working Diſpoſition, from being able to juſtifie, as being
a Faith that is dead and unprofitable?</p>
            <p>That which you ſo ſlight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Jac. 2. 23.</note> as if it were <hi>indignus vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
nodus,</hi> Calvin (a Man as likely to ſee into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
meaning as another) calls <hi>nodum inſolubilem,</hi> as
I have before noted. That more Conditions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto Juſtification afterward than at firſt, is more than
I can find, and more (I am perſwaded) than will ever
be proved. Did <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſpeaketh ſo much of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
by Faith without VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi> as concurring
with Faith unto Juſtification, mean that we are ſo juſtified
indeed to day, but not ſo to morrow, or ſome time after?
All his Arguments ſhew the contrary. Yea, doth he not
prove from <hi>Gen. 15. 6.</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified only
by Believing, when as yet that was not the beginning of
his Juſtification? So when <hi>James</hi> ſaith, That we are not
juſtified by Faith, which is without VVorks, ſuch a Faith
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51647:65"/>
being dead, and no better than the Faith of Devils; was
his meaning this, That hereafter indeed we cannot be ſo
juſtified, but yet at preſent we may? If you be of this
mind, <hi>Non equidem invideo, miror màgis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Of the ſenſe of <hi>James</hi> his Diſcourſe enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And for <hi>v. 17.</hi> I think it might eaſily let you ſee
that he ſpeaketh not (as you ſuppoſe) only of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and Conſummate Juſtification, but of Inchoated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and conſequently that he cannot be interpreted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than thus, That Faith which doth not ſhew it ſelf
by VVorks, is dead, ineffectual, and of no force to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
either at firſt or afterward, as not being that Faith
which is required unto Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> a working
Faith, or Faith which is of a working Nature. I have
noted before what <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (one that was long before
either <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Luther)</hi> ſaith upon that very Verſe, as
alſo how in the judgment of the Syriack Interpreter, and
other Learned Men <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>1. Though Faith may be true and real without Works,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
yet a living Faith it is not; for a living Faith is operative,
ſo that, a working Faith, and a non-working Faith are of
different Natures, this being but a bare and naked Aſſent,
but the other an apprehending of Chriſt, and a receiving
of him. I little doubt but the Faith of Devils, and the
Faith of Men who are juſtified (even at firſt, when you
ſay VVorks are not requiſite in reſpect of their preſence
with Faith, though that Faith (ſay I) is of a working
Diſpoſition), differ much in their very Nature.</p>
            <p>2. If you will be true to your own Principles, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay, That VVorks make Faith alive, or that Faith is
not alive without VVorks as actually preſent, though you
conſider Faith meerly as a Condition of Juſtification,
ſeeing you hold Faith to be alive in that reſpect, when
we are firſt juſtified, though there be no VVorks preſent
with it. And though, as there muſt be a promptitude to
VVorks at firſt, ſo there muſt be VVorks themſelves in
due ſeaſon; yet that VVorks do afterward concur with
Faith unto Juſtification, is more than yet I ſee, or (I
preſume) ever ſhall ſee proved.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore my Argument ſtands good againſt you,
until you can make it appear, That Faith alone without
the Copar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nerſhip of VVorks, is the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51647:66"/>
at firſt, but Faith and VVorks together of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
afterward. I have ſhewed ſome Reaſons againſt
it, but I can ſee none for it. Your Similitude of a
Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no proof. Similitudes may illuſtrate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but they prove nothing.</p>
            <p>1. You ſaid,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>[The Apoſtle ſaith, That Faith did
Work in and with his Works];</hi> whereas the Apoſtle uſing
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> did not ſpeak of working in, but only
of working with.</p>
            <p>2. Of what validity that diſtinction is (of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

you have not yet ſhewed.</p>
            <p>3. VVhat <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion otherwiſe was, is not to
the purpoſe. I only alledged his Expoſition of thoſe
words, <hi>Fides cooperata est operibus ſuis;</hi> and I think his
Expoſition is genuine.</p>

but many others both before and after them, interpret
thoſe words, <hi>[By Works his Faith was made perfect];
i. e.</hi> By VVorks his Faith did appear perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſound
and good. This Expoſition is ſuch that as yet I ſee no
reaſon to diſlike it.</p>
            <p>2. I grant that Faith without VVorks <hi>(viz.</hi> when God
doth require them) is dead as to the effect of Juſtifying;
Yea, and it is alſo dead in it ſelf, being but a dead Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
having no life, no operative vertue in it.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was, is, and ſhall be manifeſted
to be perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſincere by his VVorks, to all that were,
are, and ſhall be able to diſcern the true nature of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Faith. Although there were none then that could
diſcern this, (which yet is not to be ſuppoſed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was
then of age to diſcern it, and ſo other of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Family to whom the thing was known) yet to after-Ages
the perfection of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith is made manifeſt by
his VVorks, eſpecially his offering his Son upon the Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51647:66"/>
And if God did ſay, <hi>[Now I know that thou fearest
me,</hi> &amp;c.] why may it not be ſaid, ſpeaking of God,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that thereby <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and its
Perfection appeared to God himſelf? Certain it is, that
the VVork ſpoken of did proceed from Faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 7.</hi>
And therefore as the Effect doth ſhew the Cauſe to be
perfect, ſo did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s VVorks (eſpecially that of
offering up <hi>Iſaac)</hi> ſhew his Faith to be perfect. To the
Second:</p>
            <p>1. Though Juſtifying Faith include in it three Acts,
mentioned <hi>Heb. 11. 13.</hi> yet there are but two of them
properly and peculiarly Acts of Faith. For Seeing, or
Knowing, the firſt there mentioned, is but preſuppoſed
unto Faith.</p>
            <p>Bellarmine <hi>in this ſaith truly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Juſtif. lib. 1. c. 16.</note>

            <p>The other two Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> Perſwaſion and Embracing,

is this to ſpeak darkneſs, except to a dark Underſtanding,
which (I know) yours is not. But you know what is

VVhat is more vulgar with Divines (and

You darken my words, when you transform them thus,

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the Coven.</hi> c. 6. p. 65.</note> [The Third Expoſition
is, That when Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
not underſtood materially, as though the Dignity, Worth,
and Perfection of Faith made us just; but relatively and
in reſpect of its Object: that is, to us believing, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,

freely given of God. And therefore to ſay, Faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, are phraſes
equivalent. For Faith juſtifieth not by its merit or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but as an Inſtrument, and correlatively, that is,
the merit of Christ apprehended and received by Faith, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth,
not Faith, whereby it is apprehended and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
unleſs it be by an improper ſpeech, whereby the Act
of the Object, by reaſon of the near and ſtrict connexion
betwixt them, is given to the Inſtrument].</p>
            <p>3. What you have ſaid before about Works perfecting
Faith, hath been conſidered. Though Faith may ſave
without manifeſtation, yet not except it be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to manifeſt it ſelf by Works, when God doth
call for them.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>[Works do perfect Faith, ut Medium &amp;
Conditio];</hi> you mean of Juſtification: but that Works
are <hi>Medium &amp; Conditio Juſtificationis,</hi> you do not prove.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51647:67"/>
The Tree and its Fruit are conſidered as diſtinct; <hi>ut
Cauſa &amp; Effectum, non ut Totum &amp; Pars;</hi> and ſo the
perfection of the Tree is only manifeſted by its Fruit. It
is not therefore a good Tree, becauſe it beareth good
Fruit; but it therefore beareth good Fruit, becauſe it is
a good Tree.</p>
            <p>For the Third: If Procreation (as you grant) do
not perfect Marriage in its Eſſence, then it adds only an
accidental perfection unto it.</p>
            <p>4. Your Explication is indeed now more full, ſo that I
can better ſee your meaning, yet ſtill I am unſatisfied.
For I do not conceive that Faith properly is our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but that whereby we embrace God's Covenant.
Though a Covenant differ from a Promiſe, yet it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Promiſe. Now a Promiſe is <hi>de futuro;</hi> ſo that
our reciprocal Promiſe, both of Faith and Obedience, I
take to be our Covenant. Faith is in part the matter of
the Covenant, but not properly the Covenant it ſelf, and
perhaps when you call it our Covenant, you only mean,
that it is the matter of our Covenant.</p>
            <p>I being there the Reſpondent, it was ſufficient for me<note place="margin">73.</note>

            <p>You your ſelf do ſometimes ſay, That Faith hath in it
an aptitude to juſtifie in this reſpect; only you deny,
that this aptitude of Faith is ſufficient, and ſay that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it doth juſtifie, becauſe God in his Covenant hath
made it the Condition of Juſtification. Now I alſo grant,
That if Faith were not ordained to that end of God, its
bare aptitude, or its being that whereby we apprehend
Chriſt, would not juſtifie. Yet (I ſay) it appear by
Scripture, That becauſe Faith alone hath this aptitude to
juſtifie, <hi>viz.</hi> by apprehending Chriſt, therefore God hath
made it alone the Condition of Juſtification. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in that we are ſaid to be juſtified by Believing in, or
on Chriſt, which imports an apprehending and receiving
of him, <hi>Joh. 1. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Repentance doth avail with Faith, yet are we juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
only by Faith, and not by Repentance, and that for
the reaſon even now alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

            <p>3. Though Remiſſion of Sins be ordinarily aſcribed to
Repentance, yet it is no where ſaid, That Repentance is
imputed unto us for Righteouſneſs, as it is ſaid of Faith.
Repentance in ſome ſenſe is precedaneous to Juſtification,
Juſtifying Faith doth preſuppoſe Repentance; yet Faith
and not Repentance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> made the Condition and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Juſtification, as being that which doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>4. That though Faith only be the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
at firſt, yet Obedience alſo is a Condition after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
is often ſaid, but never proved. I take Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both at firſt and afterward to be by the Righteouſneſs
of Chriſt imputed to us; therefore not by Obedience,
but by Faith, by which alone we apprehend the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Chriſt, that ſo it may be ours unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Certainly that was not the beginning of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51647:68"/>
Juſtification, which is mentioned <hi>Gen. 15. 6.</hi> Yet
by that doth the Apoſtle prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was
and, all muſt be, juſtified, not by Obedience, but by Faith
only.</p>
            <p>1. Faith apt to produce good Works,<note place="margin">

<hi>Juſtos ex Injuſtis.</hi> For if it be not ſuch a Faith,
it is dead, and of no force.</p>
            <p>2. I hope you will not deny, but that being juſtified by
Believing, every after Act of Faith doth find us juſtified;
for you are againſt the Amiſſion and Interciſion of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Yet I confeſs, That the continuance of Faith is
neceſſary to the continuance of Juſtification: So it muſt
needs be, ſeeing we are juſtified by Faith; therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>I anſwer therefore, <hi>Ad 1.</hi> How do I contradict it by

What though there be divers Acts of Faith, yet ſtill it is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51647:69"/>
Faith, and Faith without the concurrence of Works, by
which we are juſtified as well afterward as at firſt, which
is all that I aſſert? Becauſe a continued Act of Faith is
requiſite to the Continuation of Juſtification, doth it
therefore follow that Works have a co-intereſt with Faith
in the effect of Juſtifying?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 2.</hi> Do you think<note n="*" place="margin">How Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is requiſite unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and yet doth not juſtifie, was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</note> Repentance only requiſite to the
Continuation of Juſtification, and not alſo to the Incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

            <p>
               <hi>Ad 3.</hi> We are not to meaſure God's Covenant by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Covenants. God's Covenant doth reach further
than to Juſtification; and more may be requiſite for the
enjoyment of thoſe benefits which belong unto Juſtified
Perſons, than is requiſite unto Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">74.</note> Your Similitudes are no Proofs; and you ſtill ſuppoſe
that there is one Condition of Juſtification at firſt, and
another Condition thereof afterwards; that though at
firſt we are juſtified only by Faith, yet afterward by Faith
and Works. But though Works are required of Juſtified
Perſons, as Fruits of that Faith whereby they are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet they do not therefore concur with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
which as it is begun by Faith only, ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
continued. Your ſelf obſerve, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
mentioned <hi>Gen. 15.</hi> was not his firſt Act of Faith.
So then he was juſtified before by Faith, and ſo was be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
afterward, even by Faith only, as the Apoſtle from
that very place doth prove <hi>Rom. 4.</hi> Therefore by Faith
without Works <hi>(viz.</hi> as having a co-partnerſhip with
Faith in Juſtifying), <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified both at firſt
and afterward.</p>
            <p>1. Do you think that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified from the
guilt of thoſe many ſins,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which he committed after his

part I cannot but deteſt ſuch Doctrine. I know no way
whereby he could be juſtified from thoſe ſins, but by Faith
in Chriſt, even as he was at firſt juſtified. Beſides (as I
noted before, and that as acknowledged by your ſelf),
<hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified before he produced that Act of
Faith ſpoken of <hi>Gen. 15.</hi> and in the <hi>interim</hi> no doubt he

            <p>2. You do but ſtill affirm, without any proof at all,
That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Juſtification could not be continued by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51647:69"/>
the ſame means <hi>(viz.</hi> by Faith alone) works not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with it unto Juſtification) as it was begun.</p>
            <p>3. For Sentential Juſtification at the Laſt Judgment,
I have ſaid enough before.</p>
            <p>Bucan <hi>having ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Loc. 31. ad quaest. 39.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>was Juſtified</hi> operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,

            <p>
               <hi>And again;</hi> Fides principium exiſtentiae, facit ut ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

ut cognoſcamur juſti. Ideò Deus in extremo die
proponet principium cognitionis juſtitiae fides, quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curret
in oculos omnium creaturarum.</p>
            <p>4. I think the Argument is good and ſound, [Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs, whereby we are juſtified, is an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Righteouſneſs; therefore our Juſtification is an
everlaſting Juſtification]. This alwayes preſuppoſed,
That this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be apprehended by
Faith; for otherwiſe there is no being juſtified at all
by it.</p>
            <p>1. To be juſt <hi>quoad praeſtationem Conditionis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 75.</note> is but
to be juſt in ſome reſpect; and in ſome reſpect juſt even
the moſt unjuſt may be. Yet it is true, This <hi>praeſtatio
Conditionis</hi> will be of force to procure Univerſal Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
not that it is it ſelf the Righteouſneſs by which
we are juſtified, but only the Means whereby we are
made Partakers of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and ſo
by his Righteouſneſs are univerſally juſtified. And
though this performing of the Condition be required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Juſtification, yet nevertheleſs that remains good which
I ſaid in the <hi>Animadverſions, [If we be fully freed from
the accuſation of the Law, we are fully juſtified].</hi> For
can we be fully freed from the Accuſation of the Law,
except we perform the Condition required in the Goſpel?
And if we be fully freed from the Accuſation of the Law,
will the Goſpel accuſe us? <hi>It is the Law that worketh
Wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. The Goſpel doth free from Wrath,
though not without performing the Condition; for then
it ſuffereth the Law to have its force, and to inflict
Wrath; and that ſo much the more, in that ſo great a
benefit was neglected.</p>
            <p>2. The performing of a Condition, as the Condition
is a Duty, is a Righteouſneſs, but ſuch as cannot juſtifie,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51647:70"/>
as we now ſpeak of Juſtification. But as the Condition
is meerly a Condition, the performing of it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Righteouſneſs, though by it we partake of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which we
are juſtified.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore this is no contradiction, to grant Faith to
be the Condition of Juſtification, and yet to deny it to
be the Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which you think to be moſt clear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, inter Opera <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veti</hi> Diſp. 13. §. 61.</note> Vignerius <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited) thought moſt abſurd.</hi> An poſſibile eſt (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit)
ut ſit Fides Inſtrumentum accipiendae juſtitia,
(ſeu Conditio ad obtinendam juſtitiam requiſita, ſi ita
loqui libeat) &amp; ſimul ſit ipſa, quam quaerimus, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia?</p>
            <p>Indeed you ſeem but to ſtrive about words; for here
immediately you confeſs, That it is but a Subordinate
Righteouſneſs, meaning (I think) that which all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that it is but a means whereby to partake of
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. And you that charge others
with Self-Contradiction, ſeem not to agree with your ſelf.
For here preſently after you ſay, <hi>[This Perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
praeſtitae conditionis N. T. <hi>must be had, before we
can have that which freeth us from the Law];</hi> yet elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
your Expreſſions are ſuch, as if being firſt juſtified
from the Accuſation of the Law, by the Righteouſneſs
of Chriſt, we ſhould after be juſtified from the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Goſpel by Perſonal Righteouſneſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
(as I have ſaid before) this latter Accuſation is
but a further proſecution and confirmation of the former,
by taking away the Plea that ſome might make why the
Accuſation of the Law ſhould not ſtand good, and be of
force to condemn them.</p>
            <p>4. Of what force is Satans Accuſation againſt any, if
be cannot make good his Accuſation, ſo as to procure his
Condemnation? And are not Unbelievers and Rebels
againſt Chriſt condemned by the Law? Is it not for ſin
that they are condemned? And is there any ſin which is
not againſt the Law? The Goſpel indeed may aggravate
Sin, and increaſe Condemnation: and ſo thoſe words
which you cite <hi>[The words which I ſpeak ſhall judg
you,</hi> &amp;c.] may be underſtood; as thoſe are more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the purpoſe <hi>Joh. 15. 22. If I had not come and
ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin, (viz.</hi> in ſo high
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51647:70"/>
degree as it follows) <hi>but now they have no cloak for their
ſin.</hi> But ſtill it is by the Law that all ſinners are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and condemned. As for Righteouſneſs, whereby one
is juſtified from a falſe Accuſation, it is but ſuch as the
Devil himſelf may have, as hath been noted before,
though Faith be of force to take off all Satan's Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whatſoever. And when Satan doth accuſe any of
not performing the Condition of the Goſpel, he doth but
only ſhew that ſuch ſtand guilty by the Law, and ſo are
to be condemned, as having no benefit of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have not performed the Condition of it: So
that ſtill it is the Law, by which Satan doth accuſe and
bring to condemnation.</p>
            <p>But by the way I obſerve, That in this place of your
<hi>Aphor. (p. 308.)</hi> you ſay, That <hi>Rom. 3. 28.</hi> and 4. 2,
3, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth, that neither Faith, nor
Works, is the Righteouſneſs which we muſt plead againſt
the Accuſation of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs which
is by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: Yet before in
this Writing you ſtand upon the very Letter of the Text,
and will have it to prove, That Faith it ſelf properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
is our Righteouſneſs. If you ſay that you mean our
Evangelical Righteouſneſs, yet ſo you agree not with
your ſelf in your <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> where you make <hi>Paul</hi> in
thoſe Texts to ſpeak of our Legal Righteouſneſs.</p>

See <hi>Rivet, Diſp. de Fide Juſtif.</hi> §. 21. the words are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>2. We are juſtified by the New Law, againſt the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation

this Diſtinction, <hi>inter quod opus, &amp; quà opus,</hi> ſerve to
keep in Obedience, as having a joint intereſt with Faith
in Juſtification? What dark Equivocal (I pray) is this,
That Faith doth juſtifie as that whereby we are made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs? Your ſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
an aptitude in Faith to juſtifie in this reſpect; and
in this reſpect (I ſay) Faith is appointed to be the
Condition of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>I take what you grant,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Obedience as concurrent with Faith in our firſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
that he doth imply it as concurrent in our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
afterward, you ſhould prove, and not content
your ſelf with the bare affirming of it. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi>
by that <hi>Gen. 15. [Abraham believed God,</hi> &amp;c.] prove
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Faith without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of Obedience? Yet that was not the firſt time
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51647:71"/>
that <hi>Abraham</hi> either believed, or was juſtified. The
truth therefore is, <hi>Paul</hi> implieth Obedience as the Fruit
of that Faith which juſtifieth both at firſt and laſt, but not
as concurring with Faith unto Juſtification either at firſt
or laſt.</p>
            <p>1. There is a neceſſity of Faith ſhewing it ſelf by
Works,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 76.</note> that ſo it may appear to be ſuch a Faith whereby
Chriſt is truly apprehended and received. But are Works
therefore Copartners with Faith in juſtifying, becauſe
only ſuch a Faith doth juſtifie as doth alſo produce
Works? You exclude Works from having any thing to
do in our Juſtification at firſt, yet ſurely Works muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
as Fruits of that Faith whereby we are at firſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>2. For the Texts alledged, that <hi>Mat. 12. 37. [By
thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified,</hi> &amp;c.] is as plain you ſay
as <hi>[We are juſtified by Faith].</hi> But if it be ſo plain, it
may ſeem wonderful, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould never make
uſe of it, when he labours to prove, That Faith alone
doth not juſtifie; which (ſo far as I obſerve) he doth
not. Nor do the Rhemiſts on the place take any notice
of thoſe words, who yet are ready to catch at every thing
that may but ſeem to make for them. Yet it ſeems ſome
of our Romiſh Adverſaries have laid hold on thoſe
words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But hear how</hi> Calvin <hi>doth cenſure them for it;</hi>

            <p>Certainly all good that we do, may juſtifie <hi>quadante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
ſo far as it is good: But can we therefore be ſimply
and abſolutely, or (if you like thoſe terms better) ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfectly juſtified, either by our Words or Works?
Thoſe places that require forgiving of others, that ſo
God may forgive us, ſhew indeed, that it is no true Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying

            <p>That <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſins were but incompleatly waſhed away
by Faith until he was baptized, your Similitudes (which
are too often your only proofs) do not prove. Yea, a
Kings Coronation, (of which you ſpeak) when the

of what was done before.</p>
            <p>The purifying of the Heart ſpoken of, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 22.</hi> is
(I conceive) to be underſtood as <hi>Jam. 4. 8.</hi> &amp; <hi>Jer. 4. 14.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:51647:72"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> of purifying from the filth of ſin by Sanctification.

to be a means of their Salvation! But what is that
to prove Works to concur with Faith unto Juſtification?</p>
            <p>1. I take what you grant,<note place="margin">76, &amp; 77.</note> That at firſt believing a
Man is juſtified ſo fully, as that he is acquitted from the
guilt of all Sin, and from all Condemnation. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the laſt one can have no fuller Juſtification than this
is. That afterwards he is acquitted from the guilt of
more ſins, is not to the purpoſe, ſeeing he is acquitted
from all at firſt, and but from all at laſt, though this
[all] be more at laſt than at firſt. Otherwiſe the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of one who hath fewer ſins, ſhould not be ſo full
as the Juſtification of him, whoſe ſins are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>2. That there is a further Condition of Juſtification af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
than at firſt, hath been ſaid often, but was never
yet proved.</p>
            <p>3. That which you call Sentential Juſtification, <hi>(viz.</hi>
at the Laſt Judgment) I hold to be only the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Juſtification which was before. That becauſe
Obedience is a Condition of Salvation, heretofore it is
alſo a Condition of Juſtification, I deny (as you ſee) all
along in the <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> and therefore I thought it
enough here to touch that, which you ſay of full Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
eſpecially ſeeing your ſelf hold Obedience to be
no Condition of Juſtification at firſt. You lay the
weight of your <hi>78th</hi> Theſis upon the word [full] which
therefore was enough for me to take hold of.</p>
            <p>For your Queries therefore about Sentential Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            </p>
            <p>When you prove, 1. that Juſtification at Judgment is
a Juſtification diſtinct from Juſtification here, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a manifeſtation of it.</p>
            <p>2. That Juſtification at Judgment hath the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

            <p>1. I think there is not the like right of Salvation and
Juſtification, but that although we muſt be ſaved by
Works, though not by the Merit of them, yet we cannot
be juſtified by Works, except it be by the merit of them.
My reaſon is, Becauſe that whereby we are juſtified, muſt
fully ſatisfie the Law; for it muſt fully acquit us from all
Condemnation, which otherwiſe by the Law will fall upon
us. This Works cannot do, except they be fully conform to
the Law, and ſo be meritorious, as far forth as the Creature
can merit of the Creator. But being juſtified by Faith,
<hi>i.e.</hi> by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt through Faith impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us, and ſo put into a ſtate of Salvation, we muſt
yet ſhew our Faith by our Works; which though they be
imperfect, and ſo not meritorious, yet make way for the
full enjoyment of Salvation. And me-thinks the Scripture
is ſo frequent and clear in diſtinguiſhing betwixt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Salvation, as to the full enjoyment of it, that
it may ſeem ſtrange that you ſhould ſo confound them as
you do, and argue as if there were the ſame reaſon of the
one as of the other.</p>
            <p>2. You might eaſily ſee, that by <hi>[Via Regni]</hi> as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to <hi>[Cauſa Regnandi];</hi> I meant only to exclude
the Merit of Works, not to deny Works to be a Means
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51647:73"/>
and a Condition required of us for the obtaining of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Salvation. Salvation is a Chain conſiſting of many
Links, but ſo is not Juſtification; it is but one Link of
that Chain.</p>
            <p>3. If all the World of Divines be againſt this, That
Juſtification at Judgment is but a Declaration of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
here; I have hitherto (it ſeems) been in ſome
other World. For truly (ſo far as I obſerve) both Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and Divines uſually ſpeak of Juſtification, as we
here partake of it. As for Juſtification at Judgment, it
is but rarely touched, either in Scripture or in other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
Neither (ſo far as I can ſee) will it conſiſt with
either, to make Juſtification at Judgment a compleating
of our Juſtification, as if before we were but imperfectly
juſtified: but rather they ſhew, that our Juſtification is
then fully declared and made manifeſt, and that then we
come to the full enjoyment of that benefit, which we have
right unto by our Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Glorification. <hi>For
whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30.
I have ſpoken enough of this before; but you do ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
repeat the ſame things, that I am forced alſo to
repeat things oftner than I would.</p>
            <p>1. That Juſtification by Sentence,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> at the Laſt
Judgment, and Continued Juſtification, are ſeveral kinds
of Juſtification diſtinct from Juſtification begun, and
have ſeveral Conditions, you continually affirm, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but never prove.</p>
            <p>2. My debate with you was about thoſe words, <hi>[That
which we are juſtified by, we are ſaved by];</hi> and <hi>[the
full poſſeſſion or enjoyment of Salvation].</hi> What your
reply is to the purpoſe, I cannot ſee. And beſides, you
had need to clear thoſe words, <hi>[In juſtifying it is the
ſame thing to give a right to a thing, and to give the
thing it ſelf].</hi> For if you mean, That as ſoon as a
right to a thing is given by Juſtification, the thing it ſelf
alſo is actually given; it appears to me far otherwiſe.
For I think that Juſtification preſently gives a right to
Glorification; For what doth debar from that right, but
ſin? Now the guilt of ſin is done away by Juſtification;
therefore there is a preſent right too to Glorification, yet
no preſent enjoyment of it. How I do yeeld your Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you do not ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:51647:74"/>
Your Repetitions indeed have been troubleſome unto
me.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I grant here more than you deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> That not
only to morrow there will be Condemnation to him that
ſhall not ſincerely obey, but even to day there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to him; his Faith being not prompt and ready
to bring forth the Fruit of Obedience, is not ſuch as doth
juſtifie him at all. But though Faith, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
muſt and will ſhew it ſelf by Works, yet we are
not therefore juſtified by Works as well as by Faith. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth exclud Works, as well from Juſtification afterward
as at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> as concurring with Faith unto the Effect
of Juſtifying: for he ſhews that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified,
not only at firſt, but alſo afterward, by Faith and not by
Works, <hi>Rom. 4. 2, 3.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> doth require Works
as well to Juſtification at firſt as afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> as Fruits
of that Faith whereby we are juſtified. For otherwiſe he
ſaith it is a dead Faith, ineffectual and unprofitable.
Though Works do not preſently appear upon our firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
yet if they do not appear in due ſeaſon, that
Faith doth not juſtifie: Such a Believer doth not ceaſe to
be, but indeed never was in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> as a juſtified
Perſon is in him.</p>
            <p>How is Juſtification at Judgment a declaring of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
in queſtion?<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The Word of God (the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
whereof is unqueſtionable) aſſures us that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are juſtified. And that ſuch and ſuch were true
Believers, God by his Word and Spirit did evidence unto
them before, though then he will make it more fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
unto all! That Satan ſhall publickly accuſe at the
Laſt Judgment, is more than I ſee either Scripture or
Reaſon for. He ſhall then be judged himſelf, and that
in ſome ſort by the Saints, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 3.</hi> He ſhall then
have little courage to accuſe the Saints, though now he
doth it.</p>
            <p>Yet I queſtion alſo whether Satan do at any time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
put up unto God any Accuſations againſt the
Saints. He ſeems to be called <hi>the Accuſer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Apoc. 12. 10.</hi> becauſe by his Inſtruments he is

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51647:74"/>
in <hi>Joh 1.</hi> &amp; 2. ſeems to be parabolically expreſſed. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
knows his Accuſations againſt the Saints to be falſe:
Therefore he knows it is to little purpoſe to accuſe them
unto God. Eſpecially at the Laſt Judgment, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeparating of the Elect from the Reprobate, he will
ſee that it is in vain to bring any Accuſation againſt the
Elect: and therefore how there ſhould then be any ſuch
publick Accuſer, or any queſtion of the Righteouſneſs of
the Saints, I do not ſee: beſides, that excepting thoſe who
will be found alive at Chriſt's coming, all have received
their doom before, though not ſo openly as then they
ſhall. That Obedience is a Condition of Glorification,
not of right unto it, but of poſſeſſion and enjoyment of
it, I here and every-where confeſs.</p>
            <p>1. What mean you by thoſe words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 78.</note> 
               <hi>[Doth Obedience
get Faith?]</hi> Doth any ſuch thing follow, upon that
which I ſay? But you ſay, <hi>[If Obedience only manifeſt
Faith, how then doth it procure Right?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not ſaid, That Obedience doth procure
right, but only thus much is ſignified, That none can
have right without Obedience, as the Fruit of that Faith
by which right is procured. As I ſaid before of Works,
ſo I ſay now of keeping the Commandments, (which
doth comprehend in it all good Works) it is ſpoken of
only as a Fruit of Faith, which Faith indeed doth (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally
and Relatively) procure Right.</p>
            <p>For the words of <hi>James</hi> I have ſaid enough before; I
have neither liſt nor leiſure to repeat the ſame things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon every occaſion. What your multitude of
other Texts is, I do not know; but if they be not more
forced, than by my Opinion the words of <hi>James</hi> are,
there will be little cauſe to complain of the forcing of
them.</p>
            <p>2. That Faith without Obedience doth give right at
firſt, you grant: The ſame right (I hold) is ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
only by Faith; though Faith, if not of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to produce Obedience, can neither give right at
firſt, nor afterward continue it. Though Repentance
muſt go before Juſtification, yet Faith alone may juſtifie,
and ſo give right; which though it be not the ſame
with Juſtifying, yet it is neceſſarily joined with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:51647:75"/>
3. <hi>Jus in re,</hi> I take to be ſuch a Right, as from which
the Poſſeſſion it ſelf is not, nor can be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>4. The Text doth not aſcribe <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but only <hi>Declarativè:</hi> as a Fruit of Faith it
maketh it appear, that there is ſuch a Right which Faith
hath procured.</p>
            <p>5. I do indeed believe, That a Man may have, and hath
<hi>Jus ad Gloriam</hi> without Obedience, even as he is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Obedience. For certainly as ſoon as a Man is
juſtified, he hath <hi>Jus ad Gloriam.</hi> For what doth hinder
but ſin, the guilt of which by Juſtification is done away?
Yet ſtill I ſay, Faith which doth juſtifie, and ſo gives right
to Glory, will ſhew it ſelf by Obedience. Thoſe words
<hi>[If he live to Age]</hi> are needleſs: for we ſpeak conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
of the Juſtification of ſuch as are of Age. But
how can you ſeriouſly ask me this Queſtion, when your
ſelf put it out of all queſtion, holding that a Man (that
is of Age, I preſume) is at firſt juſtified, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
(as I think you will not deny) hath <hi>Jus ad
Gloriam,</hi> by Faith without Obedience?</p>
            <p>6. It is no debaſing of Faith to ſay, That after it, as a
Fruit of it, Obedience is required to give <hi>Jus in re, i.e.</hi>
to bring into the actual poſſeſſion of Glory. How can
you pretend this to be a debaſing of Faith, who debaſe it
much more in making it unſufficient to give <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi>
except there be Obedience concurrent with it? Though
yet herein you do not keep fair correſpondence with your
ſelf, without a diſtinction of <hi>Jus Inchoatum,</hi> and <hi>Jus
Continuatum;</hi> which diſtinction how it will hold good,
I do not ſee.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall think that you have ſaid enough to prove,<note place="margin">78.</note>
That we are juſtified by a Perſonal Righteouſneſs, I ſhall
think that ſuch are ſoon ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>1. When we ſpeak of Juſtification,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> we ſpeak of it as
taking off all Accuſation, and as oppoſed to all Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And what Righteouſneſs is ſufficient for this,
but that which is perfect?</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> hath not the ſame Doctrine on
<hi>Rom. 8. 4.</hi> as you deliver, I have ſufficiently ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
And if he had, I take the Authority of <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Davenant</hi> (whom I cited, and to whom many others
might be added) to be of more force againſt it, than <hi>de
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51647:75"/>
Dieu's</hi> could be for it. That Holineſs and Obedience is
neceſſary unto Salvation, ſo that no Salvation is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
without it, it were pitty (as I ſaid in the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions)</hi>

that's another thing: as Faith alone doth juſtifie, ſo
it alone gives Right to Salvation: Yet becauſe this Faith
is of a working Nature, therefore before the actual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of Salvation, Faith, as occaſion doth require,
will ſhew it ſelf by Obedience; and that is all which the

wrangle about it, neither am I willing to ſtrive about
words. Yet I told you, I thought it might well enough
be uſed as our Divines do uſe it. And I always let you
know, That thô perhaps Faith may more fitly be called a
Condition, yet not ſo as to make it to be merely <hi>Cauſa
ſine quâ non,</hi> but ſo as to aſcribe ſome Cauſality and
Efficiency unto it in reſpect of Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> in
that it apprehendeth and receiveth Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
by which through Faith imputed unto us we are
juſtified.</p>

            <p>This (as you might ſee by many Paſſages) is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reaſon why (I think) the Scripture doth attribute
Juſtification to Faith alone, and not to Works, nor any
other Grace beſides Faith; becauſe only Faith doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. Though therefore I
neither was, nor am willing <gap reason="foreign">

doth condemn, yet it is by the Law, and for the
tranſgreſſing of it that any are condemned; there being
no freedom from Condemnation, but by the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
nor any by it without fulfilling the Condition of
it. Such as do not embrace the New-Covenant, and that
on the terms upon which it is made, are left to the
Condemnation of the Old-Covenant, which will be ſo
much the ſorer, as the Sin in deſpiſing the Mercy offered
is the greater. So that ſtill (as I ſaid in the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions)</hi>
the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it for us, is that by which we are juſtified, though
Faith be required of us, that Chriſt's fulfilling of the
Law may be imputed unto us, and ſo we may be juſtified
by it.</p>
            <p>The Accuſations which you ſpeak of, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Of not
fulfilling the Condition of the New-Covenant. 2. Of
having therefore no part in Chriſt. 3. Of being guilty
moreover of far ſorer puniſhment.</p>
            <p>All theſe Accuſations (as I have often ſaid) are but
a re-inforcing of that Accuſation, That we are guilty of
tranſgreſſing the Law, and ſo to be condemned; and
therefore the more guilty, and the more to be condemned,
becauſe freedom from that Guilt and Condemnation
might have been obtained, and was neglected; ſee <hi>Acts
13. 38, 41. Heb. 2. 3.</hi>

            <p>2. The Goſpel doth not joyn Obedience with Faith as
the Condition of our right unto Salvation, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Obedience as a Fruit of that Faith, whereby we
obtain that Right, and ſo as the way or means whereby
to enter into the actual enjoyment of Salvation.</p>
            <p>3. You might ſee that I do not yeeld the Theſis, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>3. Why do you call that Suppoſition, <hi>[If</hi> Luke <hi>had

more until I ſee more proof of your Opinion about
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 6.</hi> The Qualifications ſpoken of tend to that end,
That we may enjoy Salvation, but not that we may have

            <p>
               <hi>Ad 7.</hi> Of <hi>James</hi> his words enough already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 8.</hi> I wiſh you were more Argumentative, and leſs
Cenſorious, or at leaſt more wary in expreſſing your
cenſure. To ſay <hi>[It is next to non-ſenſe]</hi> is over-broad;
If you had ſaid, That you could ſee no good ſenſe in it,
this had not been ſo much, as truly I cannot in your
words. For may not a thing be ſpoken by way of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and yet by way of Argumentation too? I think,
Yes, when a reaſon is given of the Sentence. But what
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51647:80"/>
ſhould that in <hi>Luke 19. 17.</hi> force me to confeſs? That
Works are more than Fruits of Faith, by which we are
juſtified?</p>
            <p>Why do you ſtand ſo much upon the word <hi>[Becauſe],</hi>
when-as you acknowledg that Works are no proper cauſe?
May i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not be ſaid, [This is a good Tree, becauſe it
bringeth forth good Fruit?] and yet the goodneſs of the
Tree is before the goodneſs of its Fruit; and this is but
only a manifeſtation of the other. So what ſhould I ſee
in <hi>Luk. 19. 27?</hi> That none ſhould be ſaved by Chriſt,
but ſuch as are obedient unto him, that I ſee; but not
that Obedience is that whereby we are (at leaſt in part)
juſtified. Yea, I think it worthy your conſideration,
That the Texts which you alledg and build upon, ſpeaking
only of Works and Obedience, and not of Faith at all,
either muſt be interpreted, That Obedience and Works
are neceſſary Fruits of Juſtifying Faith, or elſe they will
reach further than you would have them, even to make
Obedience and Works the only Condition of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad 9.</hi> Where you performed that, I know not: But
however your Work was not to overthrow any Arguments
for Merits, (for which I am far from urging) but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
my reaſon, which I urged, why thoſe Scriptures
which you alledged, might rather ſeem to make Works
meritorious of Salvation, than to concur with Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they follow Juſtification,
but go before Salvation. I know you will ſay, That they
go before Juſtification as Continued and Conſummate at
Judgment: but for the overthrowing of that, I need ſay
no more till you ſay more in defence of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">81.</note> The Texts which you alledg ſpeak only of Obedience:
and ſo if you will think to prove by them, That Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the Condition of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſtification; you may as
well ſay, That it is the only Condition, and ſo quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Faith, which is not mentioned in thoſe Texts. If
you ſay, It is in other Texts; ſo (ſay I) do other Texts
ſhew that Faith is the only Condition, and that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is not concurrent with Faith unto Juſtification,
though it neceſſarily flow from that Faith by which we
are juſtified. That may be alledged as the reaſon of the
Juſtifying Sentence, which yet is but the Fruit and Effect
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51647:80"/>
of Juſtifying Faith. If <hi>Sententia</hi> be <hi>Praemii Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
then (I think) <hi>Cauſa Sententiae</hi> muſt be alſo <hi>Cauſae
Praemii adjudicati.</hi> The word <hi>[For],</hi> when we ſay
<hi>[Justified for Faith],</hi> muſt note either the formal, or
the meritorious Cauſe: the <hi>ratio Sententiae</hi> may be drawn
from that, which is neither the formal nor the meritorious
Cauſe of Juſtification, nor yet a Condition or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, but only a Fruit and Effect of that which is
ſo.</p>
            <p>3. The Scripture doth not ſay, That Works do juſtifie
us in that ſenſe as you take it, <hi>viz.</hi> as joint Conditions
with Faith of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>4. I think it not ſo proper to ſay, [We muſt be judged,
and receive our Reward by our Works] as [according
to our Works]. And however, to be judged by our
Works, is not as much as to be juſtified by them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as they are Fruits and Effects of Faith, and
ſo manifeſt our Intereſt in Chriſt, by whom all that
believe are juſtified, <hi>Acts 13. 39.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Your <hi>[For]</hi> muſt needs be the ſame with <hi>[Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter].</hi>
When you ſay, <hi>[We are justified for Faith]</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Latin it muſt be <hi>propter Fidem.</hi> Here <hi>[enim]</hi>
will not be ſuitable.</p>
            <p>1. That which I intimated is this,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That in reſpect of
God, ſuch an outward judicial Proceeding needed not, no
more than God doth need a Sign. Whether the Judicial
Proceeding be all upon mere Signs, and the <hi>Ipſa Cauſa
Juſtitiae</hi> not meddled with, is not to the purpoſe. Though
why may not that which is in ſome reſpect <hi>Justitia Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae,</hi>
and ſo <hi>Justitia Perſonae quoad istam Cauſam,</hi> be
<hi>Signum Fidei, &amp; per conſequens Justitiae Christi nobis
per Fidem imputatae, qua ſimpliciter &amp; abſolutè justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. and 3. That which is the Condition of Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is not therefore the Condition of Juſtification, or
of right to Glorification, which doth immediately flow
from Juſtification, or at leaſt is inſeparably joined with
it. No Man can be accuſed to be <hi>Reus Poenae,</hi> and ſo to
have no right to Glorification; but he that is accuſed to
be <hi>Reus Culpae:</hi> and from that Accuſation we are juſtified
by Faith, which is made manifeſt by our Works.</p>
            <p>1. I perceive I did miſtake your meaning,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51647:81"/>
of your words being ſuch, that one might eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>2. Your Affirmation is no Proof; and as well may you
ſay, That becauſe in other places of Scripture the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
are uſually ſpoken of in reſpect of Perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
in oppoſition to the wicked and ungodly, therefore
all thoſe places prove, That Perſonal Righteouſneſs is that
whereby we are juſtified. Becauſe we muſt have a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
inherent in us, as well as a Righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us; are we therefore juſtified as well by the one
as the other? <hi>Appello Evangelium pariter ac torum
Mundum Theologorum Reformatorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Your <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> tend to prove Juſtification by
Works,<note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; 82.</note> to which end you preſs the words of St. <hi>James,</hi>
and reject the Interpretation which our Divines give of
them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed and <hi>James</hi> did not conſider Works in
the ſame ſenſe. For <hi>Paul</hi> conſidered them as concurring
with Faith unto Juſtification, and ſo rejected them: but
<hi>James</hi> looked at them as Fruits of Juſtifying-Faith, and
ſo aſſerted the neceſſity of them. You do not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>Rom. 4. 4.</hi> of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before. He doth not ſpeak abſolutely; for ſo he
ſhould quite aboliſh Works, which in other places he
doth maintain and plead for, as without which we muſt
not think to be ſaved: but he ſpeaks in reference to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and ſo he excludes Works even for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe they cannot juſtifie, except they be merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and ſuch as that the reward of them is of debt, and
not of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> pardoning Grace; for otherwiſe
whatever reward the Creator doth beſtow upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is of Grace. Yet it doth not
therefore follow that Faith is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,<note place="margin">Vbi (inquit) Sunt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, illis debitum praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um expenditur quod datur fidei, gratuitum est. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</hi> Instit. lib. 3. c. 11. §. 18. vide ibid. plura.</note>
becauſe we are juſtified by Faith.
For Faith doth juſtifie Relatively, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which it
apprehendeth, and by which ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
we are juſtified: but ſo Works
cannot juſtifie; they muſt either juſtifie
for their own worth, or not at all, ſave only <hi>Declaratirè,</hi>
by manifeſting our Faith, and ſo our Juſtification. See
Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> of the Coven. <hi>c. 3. p. 19.</hi> &amp; <hi>c. 6. p. 69, 70.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51647:81"/>1. The Scriptures do plainly ſo diſtinguiſh, as to deny<note place="margin">82.</note>
Working, that thereby we may be juſtified, <hi>Rom. 3. 28.</hi>
and 4. 5. Yet to aſſer, Working, that thereby we may
be ſaved, <hi>Phil. 2. 12.</hi> You will ſay, That the former
places ſpeak of Meritorious and Legal Working.</p>
            <p>But, 1. All Working which is good, is Legal, as I
have ſhewed before, <hi>i.e.</hi> according to the Rule and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
of the Law, even Goſpel-Obedience is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Legal. And when the Apoſtle doth exclude the
Deeds of the Law from Juſtification, he doth not mean
(as ſome take it) Deeds done by the Power of the Law,
without Grace, but Deeds which the Law doth preſcribe
however done. For he denies that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Works; yet doubtleſs they were not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Grace.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle taketh it as granted, That all Works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are juſtified, are meritorious: for if there be no
meritoriouſneſs in them, he ſuppoſeth there is no being
juſtified by them. For indeed how can Working juſtifie,
if there be any defect and failing in it? Therefore Faith
it ſelf doth not juſtifie in reſpect of it ſelf, but in reſpect
of Chriſt whom it apprehendeth. See <hi>Calvin Inst. lib. 3
cap. 11. § 7.</hi> the words were before-cited.</p>
            <p>To your Second; I have always denied that there is the
ſame reaſon of Salvation <hi>(viz.</hi> compleat) and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and have always held, That Juſtification at
Judgment is but a manifeſtation of our preſent Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To your Third; None is <hi>Reus Poenae,</hi> except he be
<hi>Reus Culpae;</hi> and there is no <hi>Reatus Culpae,</hi> but by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
the Law, though it may be aggravated, and ſo
the other, by the Goſpel. But properly the not-fulfilling
of the Condition of the Goſpel, taking it merely as a
Condition, and not as a Duty, doth not bring a new
Guilt, but only leaves a Man in the old Guilt, with an
aggravation of it, he having no benefit of the Goſpel to
free him from his Guilt, and being the more deeply guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in that he neglected the Mercy which he might have
obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:51647:82"/>
1. Some of your words (I confeſs) I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
nor can I ſee what reference they have to mine in
the <hi>Animadverſions.</hi> But when you ſpeak of Right to
Juſtification and Salvation, you ſeem to mean Sentential
Juſtification at Judgment. For elſe we have here Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
it ſelf, and not only a right unto it, though we
have only a right to Salvation, and not Salvation it ſelf;
I mean in reſpect of the fulneſs and perfection of it. And
though Juſtification and Salvation flow from the ſame
Covenant, yet there is more required unto Salvation,
than unto Juſtification by that Covenant: and ſo you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
hold in reſpect of your firſt Juſtification.</p>
            <p>2. You trouble your ſelf more than needs with your
Diſtinctions, which (as you do uſe them) do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
the Matter in more obſcurity. Surely my words of
themſelves, [Freedom from all ſin in reſpect of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and from all condemnation for ſin] are far more
perſpicuous, than when you ſo multiply Diſtinctions to
find out (forſooth) the meaning of them. For, 1. Is
not [Freedom] more plain than [Liberation?]
though they both ſignifie the ſame thing. 2. Can there
be an Active Liberation without a Paſſive, or a Paſſive
without an Active? If God free us, are we not freed?
And if we be freed, doth not God free us? What need
then to diſtinguiſh in that manner? If freedom relate to
God, it is Active; if to us, it is Paſſive. And what
difference betwixt Liberation, or Freedom, <hi>(viz.</hi> from
the Imputation of Sin, and Condemnation for Sin) and
Abſolution?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Reprobate are</hi> Condemnati per ſententiam
Judicis, <hi>Joh. 3. 18.</hi> etiamſi ſententiae publica prolatio,
ejùſque plena executio in ultimum uſque diem ſit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata.</p>
            <p>4. Not only right to Abſolution, but Abſolution it
ſelf is perfect to a Believer through Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 8. 1.</hi>
Neither are there any more Conditions of Juſtification
at any time than Faith: though more ſins be every day
committed, and ſo more are to be pardoned, yet ſtill
Faith as well afterward as at firſt doth procure the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of them, without Works, as therein concurrent with
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:51647:82"/>

            <p>5. Actual Abſolution, and Judicial <hi>per ſententiam
Judicis,</hi> is in this life, and that perfect, though there
be not a perfect declaration of it till the Laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>6. When you ſay, <hi>[Condemnation is not perfect, if
any at all, till the Laſt Judgment],</hi> you do in effect
queſtion whether there be any Juſtification till then. For
if no Condemnation, then no Juſtification. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation<note n="*" place="margin">I ſpeak of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor ever ſhall believe.</note>
(I ſay) is perfect here, though the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be not publickly pronounced, and fully executed
till hereafter.</p>
            <p>7. I do not ſpeak of freedom from all ſin as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians
do, as if God did ſee no ſin in his Children, and
they had no ſin to be humbled for: but I ſay, That God
doth not impute ſin unto them, ſo as to condemn them
for it. And ſo much ſurely the Scripture doth ſay, if I
underſtand it, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 8. 1.</hi> For freedom
from future ſins, I have ſaid enough before.</p>
            <p>8. The word [Juſtification] may be uſed <hi>in ſenſu
Judiciario,</hi> (as I have ſhewed before) and yet Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
at Judgment be but a manifeſtation of our preſent
Juſtification. Your Quotations out of the <hi>Civilians</hi>
are not againſt me, for I ſay, <hi>Sententia Judicis jam la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
eſt, etiamſi in extremo demum die plenè publicéque
ſit revelanda.</hi> I ſpeak alſo of an Authoritative Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation;
and therefore your Inſtance of a Woman mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
a Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Obedience as a Fruit of Faith is neceſſary, both <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate</hi>

medii,</hi> ſo that we cannot be ſaved without it.
But if it be a Means, (ſay you) then it is a Condition.
Well, but a Means and a Condition (ſay I) of what?
Of Salvation? It is granted. Of Juſtification? It is
denied, neither doth this follow upon the other.</p>
            <p>Taking Chriſt for Lord is virtually included in taking
him for Prieſt;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſee <hi>Rom. 14. 9.</hi> and <hi>2 Cor. 5. 15.</hi> They
cannot be divided, though they be diſtinguiſhed. That
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51647:83"/>
Faith which receiveth Chriſt as Prieſt, doth alſo receive
him as Lord, either expreſly, if Chriſt be propounded
as Lord, or at leaſt implicitly: yet Faith only, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Chriſt as Prieſt, doth juſtifie, for the reaſon alledged
before, to which I ſee nothing that you have ſaid of force
to refel it. Wicked Men cannot unfeignedly receive
Chriſt as Prieſt, whiles they retain a Heart ſtanding out
in rebellion againſt Chriſt as Lord. Can they indeed
embrace Chriſt as ſatisfying for them, and yet not yeeld
up themſelves in obedience unto him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle (it ſeems) was of another mind;</hi> [The
love of Chriſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> conſtraineth us. For we thus
judg, That if one died for all, then were all dead: And
that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not
henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died
for them, and roſe again]. <hi>2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again,</hi> [I am crucified with Christ, nevertheleſs
I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life
which I now live, I live by Faith in the Son of God, who
loved me, and gave himſelf for me], <hi>Gal. 2. 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the nature of that Faith which doth receive
Chriſt as a Reconciler, to work through Love, <hi>Gal. 5. 6.</hi>
May I not retort upon you, and ſay, When you have taught
wicked Men, that Faith alone doth juſtifie at firſt, and
they are willing to believe, will you perſwade them that
they are unjuſtified again, becauſe Works do not follow
after? For my part, I know no unjuſtifying of thoſe
who are once juſtified. You ſpeak ſometimes of being
juſtified to day by Faith without Works, and of being
unjuſtified to morrow, or the day after, except Works
come in and help to juſtifie. But I ſay, Faith without a
promptitude to Works doth not juſtifie at firſt; ſuch as
do not receive Chriſt as Lord, and do good Works, when
there is opportunity, were never juſtified at all, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had a true Juſtifying-Faith, which is never without
Works, as the ſeaſonable Fruits and Effects of it: Yet
Faith both at firſt and laſt doth juſtifie without Works, as
concurrent with it unto Juſtification. What you ſay of a
willingneſs to receive Chriſt, is nothing. For I ſpeak of
a true actual receiving, which I ſay cannot be of Chriſt
as Prieſt, except it be (either expreſly or implicitly) of
Chriſt as Lord alſo: and yet we are juſtified by receiving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51647:83"/>
him in the one reſpect, and not in the other. None can
have that Faith which juſtifieth, but they ſhall have alſo
other Graces and VVorks of Obedience in their ſeaſon;
Yet do not other Graces therefore, or VVorks juſtifie as
well as Faith.</p>

That the Jews believed neither Chriſt's Kingly nor his

               <hi>And as others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> 
               <hi>ſo Dr.</hi> Prideaux ſpeaks the very ſame
thing, ſaying, Juſtificamur per juſtitiam Chriſti, non
perſonae, quâ ipſe est veſtitus, ſed meriti, quâ ſuos ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit,
nobis imputatam.</p>
            <p>But for the principal thing intended in this Section of
yours, Though wicked Men may be more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt as their Juſtifier, than as their Ruler, (ſo
you expreſs it); yet it follows not, that the receiving of
Chriſt as a Ruler, is that Act of Faith which doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
For the difficulty of a thing is no good Argument
to prove the neceſſity of it, either at all, or to ſuch a
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>2. My ſecond Note was to this purpoſe, quite to take
away the force of your Argument, and ſo (I think) it
doth notwithſtanding your Reply. For have we not
God's means to overcome that averſneſs of nature, if the
receiving of Chriſt as Lord do neceſſarily follow Pardon,
as well as if it be a Condition of Pardon? When I make it
a Fruit of Juſtifying-Faith to take Chriſt for Lord, I do
not ſay but that Chriſt may at once be received both as
Prieſt and as Lord, and ſo muſt, if he be ſo propounded;
I ſpeak of expreſs propounding and receiving: But my
meaning is, That though we be juſtified by receiving
Chriſt as Prieſt, perhaps not yet hearing of him (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly)
as Lord, yet that Juſtifying-Faith will alſo put
forth it ſelf to take Chriſt for Lord, when he is ſo ſet
forth unto us. To be juſtified before we take Chriſt as
Lord, is not to be juſtified before we take Chriſt as
Chriſt. For Chriſt is Chriſt as Prieſt, though not only
as Prieſt. Indeed to receive Chriſt in reſpect of one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſo as to refuſe him in reſpect of another, were not
to receive Chriſt as Chriſt: but that is not the Caſe as
I do put it. And for the moral neceſſity of taking Chriſt
as Lord, which you ask what it is, if it be not a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I ſuppoſe it may be morally neceſſary as a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and yet be no Condition of Juſtification. For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51647:85"/>
can nothing be commanded, and ſo be morally neceſſary,
but it muſt be commanded and be neceſſary to that end,
that thereby we may be juſtified? Works are commanded,
and ſo neceſſary, yet you hold them to be no Condition
of our Juſtification at firſt, neither indeed are they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as that of <hi>Gen. 15. 6.</hi> with <hi>Rom. 4. 2, 3.</hi> doth ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably
prove.</p>
            <p>Your Argument I thus retort, [He that is juſtified, is
in a State of Salvation, and ſhould be ſaved, if he ſo
died. But he that hath Faith without VVorks, is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he is in a State of Salvation, and if he ſo die,
ſhall be ſaved]. Anſwer for your ſelf as you pleaſe: for
my part I ſay, The ſame Faith which receiveth Chriſt as
Prieſt, and ſo juſtifieth, is ready alſo to receive Chriſt as
Lord, when he is ſo propounded; even as that Faith,
which juſtifieth, is ready to produce Works, when they
are required.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">84.</note> 1. You ſhould not only ſuppoſe, but prove, that the
excluding of Obedience from Juſtification (as co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with Faith in juſtifying) is a Scandal given, and an
Error.</p>
            <p>2. If it were not <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſign to advance Faith above
Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in point of Juſtification, what then means his
ſo frequent aſſerting Faith to be that whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
and his never-mentioning Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</p>
            <p>3. Your ſelf acknowledg an aptitude in Faith to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
as apprehending Chriſt, and I acknowledg, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this God hath appointed Faith for that purpoſe, in
reſpect of its aptitude, making choice of it rather than
of any other Grace.</p>
            <p>I have alſo oft enough conſidered what you have ſaid.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Juſtificatio <hi>(ſaith</hi> Davenant) purgat, &amp; abluit à

De Justit. Habit. cap. 23. ad Arg. 4.</p>
            <p>Though Juſtification be perfect, as freeing from all
Condemnation; yet ſo long as there may be Accuſation,
there is need of Juſtification. Whereas you ſpeak of the
Law juſtifying, <hi>&amp;c. It is God that justifieth,</hi> Rom. 8.
33. though according to the Goſpel or New-Covenant,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51647:85"/>
(for that, I preſume, you mean by the Law) and by the
imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. Chriſt as our
Advocate doth plead our Cauſe, and procure our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and at the Laſt Judgment, as God's Vicegerent,
he will publickly pronounce Sentence.</p>
            <p>I ſee nothing againſt me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 85.</note> but that ſtill you run upon
this Suppoſition, That there is the ſame Condition of
Salvation, and of Juſtification at Judgment, whereas I
ſuppoſe that VVorks are a Condition of Salvation, as
full and compleat, but not ſo of Juſtification at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that being but a manifeſtation of our preſent Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and ſo VVorks looked at but as Fruits and
Evidences of Faith, whereby we are juſtified. If <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
his Doctrine were the ſame with this, his fellow-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
(I dare ſay) would not blame him for it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I ſee how <hi>Illyricus</hi> could, or any rational Man
can grant VVorks to be neceſſary Fruits of Faith, and
yet deny them to be means or Conditions of Salvation,
in reſpect of the actual and full enjoyment of it. For
ſurely as Faith it ſelf is required that we may be juſtified,
ſo the Fruits of Faith (to be produced in due ſeaſon)
are required that we may be glorified. But why do you
thus ſtill jumble together Juſtification and Salvation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
[Illyricus <hi>his Error was in denying Works to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Juſtification and Salvation?]</hi> Yet when you
cite <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> as aſſerting the neceſſity of
good VVorks, there is not a ſyllable in them about Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as if VVorks were neceſſary in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bucer</hi> in that Conference at <hi>Ratiſbon,</hi> which you cite,
though he maintain Inherent Righteouſneſs, (as who
doth not?) yet he ſaith, <hi>Hâc juſtitiâ nemo juſtificatur
coram Deo juſtificatione vitae,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Lud. de
Dieu</hi> in <hi>Rom. 8. 4. ubi plura vide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Melancthon</hi> is cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as holding with
other Proteſtants of prime note,<note place="margin">De Juſtif. lib. 1. c. 14.</note> that, <hi>Sola fides juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,

Author) he ſeems to agree with other prime Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;
For he brings in 27 Arguments, whereby the
Apoſtles (he ſaith) prove,</hi>

damnantur à Lege. Ea verà quae per fidem est,

            <p>Here he ſeems indeed to confound Juſtification and
Salvation, as if there were the ſame reaſon of both, and
Works were no more required unto Salvation than unto
Juſtification. But ſurely by Salvation he meant a Right
unto Salvation, which doth neceſſarily go along with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification;
and whatſoever it be that doth juſtifie, the
ſame alſo doth give a right unto Salvation. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he makes Works and new Obedience neceſſary to the
full enjoyment of Salvation.</p>
            <p>For he treats at large <hi>de novâ obedientiâ ſeu bonis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus

               <note place="margin">Ibid. Col. 279, &amp;c.</note> and he goes through the ſeveral
Commandments,<note place="margin">Ibid. Col. 283, &amp;c.</note> and brings in a Catalogue of Good
Works which are required in every Commandment.</p>
            <p>Though he ſometimes only expreſſeth theſe Reaſons,<note place="margin">Ibid. Col. 279.</note>
why new Obedience and good Works muſt be performed,
<hi>ut glorificetur Deus, &amp; inſerviatur proximo, &amp; ſint te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonia

new Obedience and good Works are neceſſary unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

any think to be ſaved, except they have a care to glorifie

               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:51647:86"/>

            <p>This (I think) is ſufficient to ſhew that <hi>Illyricus</hi> (at

               <hi>And preſently he adds;</hi> Nemini ſiquidem pio dubium
eſſe potest, quin per ſolam Dei miſericordiam, propiér<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51647:87"/>

ſancta opera, &amp; germaniſſimos Spiritus fructus,

            <p>1. I am ſorry to ſee you ſo bent to maintain what you<note place="margin">85.</note>
have once done. Is it fair to take hold on a few words
of an Author, and to paſs by that which immediately
followeth, and ſhew that he meant quite contrary to what
is pretended? Is not this to make your ſelf guilty of that
which you accuſe others of, <hi>viz.</hi> to take up ſome ſcraps
againſt the meaning of the whole Book, and even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Page out of which you take them?</p>
            <p>2. I think nothing is more clear, than that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>'s
words following thoſe which you cited, gainſay your
Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> of Works concurring with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
For he expreſly ſaith, That Faith alone juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and that Works do but teſtifie and give proof, that
Faith is lively.</p>
            <p>Is not this the very thing that I ſo much contend for?
And yet you ſtick not to ſay, That he yeeldeth Faith and
Works to be the Condition of Juſtification, as if they
were Copartners in this reſpect, whereas he aſcribeth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
wholly to Faith, and excludeth Works from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any concurrence with it in juſtifying.<note place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 70.</note> A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the place by you cited, he oppoſeth thoſe who make
Faith and Works the Condition, without which Remiſſion
cannot be obtained, and ſaith it is impoſſible to conceive
how Faith and Works ſhould be conjoyned as Con-cauſes
in Juſtification, ſeeing Faith attributes all to Free-Grace,
and Works challenge to themſelves. And a little before
that again he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 69.</note> 
               <hi>[We read of two ways of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by Faith, and by Works, but of a third manner,
by Faith and Works both, as joint Cauſes, or Con-cauſes,
we find nothing in Scripture].</hi> As he makes Faith to be
more than a bare Condition, if by [Condition] be meant
only <hi>Cauſa ſine qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> non,</hi> ſo do I: yet he doth uſe the
words [Condition] and [Inſtrument] promiſcuouſly, and
doth ſometimes call Faith the one way, ſometimes the
other. He ſuppoſeth alſo, That if Works concur with
Faith unto Juſtification, they are Con-cauſes, and not
ſuch Conditions as are only <hi>Cauſae ſine quibus non,</hi> as you
ſeem to take it.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay that you allow of the Explicatory terms,
as I judg them. Why? then you allow of this, [Faith
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51647:88"/>
alone doth juſtifie]; yea, [as it embraceth the promiſe
of free forgiveneſs in Jeſus Chriſt]; for ſo immediately
Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> doth explain himſelf. And for this very reaſon
he denies Works to juſtifie,<note place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 70.</note> becauſe <hi>[Works do not embrace
Christ]:</hi> Your diſtinction of Inchoated and Continued
Juſtification, will here ſtand you in no ſtead. For beſides
that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification ſimply conſidered,
it's certain that Works neither at firſt nor afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concur
with Faith in embracing the promiſe of free-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
in Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore if Faith juſtifie
in this reſpect, (as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> ſaith it<note n="*" place="margin">And <hi>p.</hi> 71. he proves it, becauſe in Scripture every where Faith in Christ, in the Lord Jeſus, or the Blood of Christ, is ſaid to juſtifie, not Faith in other Promiſes, Threatnings, or Commandments.</note> doth,
and you ſeem to give your approbation
of what he ſaith) ſurely both at firſt and
afterward Faith alone doth juſtifie:
though Works appear in their ſeaſon, yet
they do not concur with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
            <p>4. That which you cite out of Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi>
p. 20. doth not reach home to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
To ſay, as he there doth, <hi>[A diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to good Works is neceſſary to Juſtification],</hi> is no
more than to ſay, A lively and working Faith, or a Faith
apt and ready to Work, is neceſſary unto Juſtification.
So when he ſaith, <hi>[Good Works of all ſorts are neceſſary
to our continuance in the ſtate of Juſtification, and ſo
to our final abſolution, if God give opportunity];</hi> he
meaneth only this, that Works are neceſſary Fruits of that
Faith by which we lay hold on the Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 21.</note> and ſo are juſtified and abſolved. <hi>[The Faith
that is lively</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to embrace Mercy, is ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with an unfeigned purpoſe to walk in all well-pleaſing,
and the ſincere performance of all holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as opportunity is offered, doth ever attend that Faith
whereby we continually (N. B.) lay hold on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
once embraced. Actual good Works of all ſorts
(though not perfect in degree) are neceſſary to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Actual Juſtification, becauſe Faith can no
longer lay claim to the Promiſes of Life, than it doth
virtually or actually lead us forward in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven].</hi>
It is clear, that as well afterward as at firſt, he
aſcribes Juſtification only to Faith, as being only that
which doth embrace the Promiſes, though he require a
working Diſpoſition at firſt, and Works themſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51647:88"/>
as opportunity ſerveth, to teſtifie and give proof
that Faith is lively,<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 73.</note> as he expreſly ſpeaketh. The words
which you further add, I have cited before, and they are
directly againſt you, ſhewing that as I and others take
the word [Condition] Faith is the only Condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and Works no part of it. And ſee what Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>
addeth immediately after thoſe words, <hi>[Faith and Works
are oppoſed in the Matter of Juſtification, not that they
cannot ſtand together in the ſame Subject, for they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
united, but becauſe they cannot concur or meet
together in one and the ſame Court, to the Juſtification or
Abſolution of Man].</hi> That which you cite from <hi>p. 21.</hi>
is not to be underſtood (as you ſeem to take it) of actual
walking, but of a diſpoſition to walk, as he ſaid <hi>p. 20.
[A diſpoſition to Works,</hi> &amp;c.] This diſpoſition is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of that Faith, or always conjoined with that
Faith, whereby we are partakers of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
This plainly appears to be his meaning, both by the
words immediately going before, and alſo by the words in
the preceding Page, both which are already cited.</p>
            <p>1. If Perſonal Righteouſneſs be not perfect,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but have
need of pardon for the imperfection of it, then there is no
being juſtified by it. This very reaſon <hi>Luther, Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,
Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> give, why we cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Inherent Righteouſneſs, as I noted before out of
<hi>Wotton de Recon. part 2. lib. 2. cap. 19. num. 4.</hi> And to
this purpoſe I alſo have cited before the words of <hi>Calvin,
Davenant, Ameſius, Rivet</hi> and <hi>Maccovius.</hi> As for the
Metaphyſical Perfection of Being, which you ſpeak of, it
is but ſuch as doth belong to things that are moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And for <hi>Praeſtatio Conditionis N. Legis,</hi> it is not (as
I have ſaid before) properly that Righteouſneſs by which
we are juſtified, though it be required to that end, that
we may be partakers of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and ſo
<hi>(viz.</hi> by that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt) be juſtified. 2. Of
Juſtification <hi>quàm continuationem, &amp; Sententiam Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
(nempe in ultimo Judicio)</hi> enough hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Neither <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any of our famous Divines,
(that I know) nor yet the Scriptures (ſo far as I can find)
do teach, that we are juſtified by Faith alone at firſt, but
by Faith and Works afterward; yea I have ſhewed the
contrary both from the Scriptures, and from our Divines;
yet they both teach, That Faith whereby we are (both at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51647:89"/>
firſt and afterward) juſtified, hath in it at firſt a readineſs to Works,
and afterward doth work, as opportunity is offered. <hi>Quid commerita
est Fides (inquit</hi> Maccovius) <hi>in progreſſu vitae, ut tantum non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
quantum in initio? Ergone ingenium fides mutaverit, &amp;c. De
Juſtif. Diſp. 10.</hi> See <hi>Calvin Inſtit. lib. 3. cap. 14. §. 11.</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> in
<hi>Gen. 15. Exercit. 83. pag. 404. Col. 1.</hi> Whereas you ſay that <hi>Calvin</hi>
maintaineth a true Perſonal Righteouſneſs; What is that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
Who doth not ſo? If that were all that you bade ſee <hi>Calvin</hi>
for, truly you might ſoon cite Authors good ſtore: but (as <hi>Martial</hi>
ſpeaks) <hi>Dic aliquid de tribus capellis.</hi> Shew that either <hi>Calvin,</hi> of
any Judicious Orthodox Divine doth hold ſuch a Perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
as whereby we are juſtified: both <hi>Calvin</hi> and all our emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and approved VVriters (that I know) deny this Perſonal
Righteouſneſs to be available unto Juſtification. Yea, and ſo do
ſome of chief account in the Church of <hi>Rome. Contarenus,</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
to this purpoſe you may find cited by <hi>Ameſius contra Bellar.
Tom. 4. lib. 6. cap. 1. Theſ. 1. Pighius</hi> alſo, a great Romiſh Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is as clear and full for this as may be. <hi>In illo (inquit
ſc. Chriſto) juſtificamur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Fide &amp; Juſt.</note> 
               <hi>non in nobis; non noſtrâ, ſed il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

Propriae juſtitiae inopes, extranos in illo docemur juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
quaerere.</hi> Much more he hath to the ſame purpoſe, and herein
doth ſo fully agree with Proteſtants (though about Faith, as being
that alone whereby the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us, he
diſſents from them); that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> having recited the Opinion of
Proteſtants, ſaith, <hi>(De Juſtif. lib. 2. cap. 1.) In eandem ſententiam,
ſive potius errorem incidit Albertus Pighius;</hi> he adds alſo, <hi>Et Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores
Antididagmatis Colonienſis.</hi> And for <hi>Pighius</hi> he ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Bucerus in libro Concordiae in articulo de Juſtificatione, fatetur
Pighii ſententiam non diſſentire à Lutheranorum ſententiâ, quod
attinet ad cauſam formalem Juſtificationes, ſed ſolùm quantum ad
cauſam apprehenſivum, quam Lutherani ſolam fidem, Pighius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionem
potius quam fidem eſſe definit.</hi> Here by the way obſerve,
That <hi>Bucer</hi> (if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did truly relate his Opinion, though not
his only) made Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to us, the formal
Cauſe of Juſtification, and Faith the only apprehenſive Cauſe: and
that therefore he was far from making us to be juſtified by our Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Righteouſneſs, &amp; from making Works concurrent with Faith unto
Juſtification; but that otherwiſe is evident enough by what hath been
cited before out of him. The truth of my Concluſion (I think I may
well conclude) is firm and clear, <hi>viz.</hi> That according to <hi>Calvin</hi>
(and ſo <hi>Bucer</hi> and all our famous Writers) Perſonal Righteouſneſs is
not that whereby we are juſtified. What colour you can have to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51647:89"/>
except againſt this Concluſion, to ſay it is merely my own, is to me
a wonder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> Repentance and Love to Chriſt are not excluded from our
firſt Juſtification, yet have they no co-intereſt with Faith in Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Faith, not Repentance, or Love being <hi>Cauſa apprehenſiva</hi> (as
<hi>Bucer</hi> and other Proteſtants do ſpeak) that which doth apprehend
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, by which ſo apprehended we are juſtified.
Neither is it denied, that outward Works are requiſite, that we may
continue juſtified here, and be ſententially (ſolemnly and openly) ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
at the laſt Judgment: yet it follows not that Juſtification as
continued and conſummated at Judgment, is by Works, as concurring
with Faith unto Juſtification. It is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Faith, by which we are juſtified from firſt to laſt, only
this Faith being of a working Nature, we cannot continue juſtified,
nor ſhall be <hi>(i. e.</hi> declared to be) juſtified at the laſt Judgment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we have Works to teſtifie and give proof that our Faith is lively,
as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> before cited doth expreſs it: but thus alſo it will follow,
that Works being wholly wanting, we never had a Juſtifying Faith,
nor were at all juſtified.</p>
            <p>86. 1. That the Qualification of Faith is part of the Condition
of Juſtification, ſo that Faith alone, as apprehending Chriſt and his
Righteouſneſs, is not the Condition (or Inſtrumental Cauſe, for I
do not take Condition for <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> but for that which
hath ſome cauſality in it) you have not proved. The Condition of our
Juſtification is that we believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; this preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
a deſire of him, and inferreth a delight in him, and ſubmiſſion
to him; yet it is only believing in him, by which we are juſtified.
2. Though the taking of Chriſt for King be as Eſſential to that Faith
which juſtifieth, as the taking of him for Prieſt, yet not to Faith as it
juſtifieth. Of <hi>Fides quae,</hi> and <hi>Fides quâ juſtificat,</hi> as alſo of taking
Chriſt for King, and taking him for Prieſt, I have ſaid enough before.
3. I mean that Faith only juſtifieth, as it receives Chriſt as Prieſt, thô
that Faith which juſtifieth doth receive Chriſt as King alſo. 4. If it be
(as you grant) Chriſt's Satisfaction, and not his Kingſhip (or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty)
which juſtifieth meritoriouſly, then (as far as I am able to
judg) it is our apprehending of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and not our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to his Sovereignty, by which we are juſtified. The Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
Faith, as Juſtifying (me-thinks) can extend no further than
to that Office of Chriſt, in reſpect of which he juſtifieth; or than as
Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified; Chriſt as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
doth only juſtifie by pleading his Satisfaction for us, and our
intereſt in it, and as Judg, by declaring us to be juſtified by it: and
all this <hi>ſecundum foedus novum,</hi> which is the ground of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51647:90"/>
5. I ſo confeſs Faith to be the Condition of Juſtification,
that nevertheleſs I hold it to juſtifie as apprehending Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
God having in that reſpect required Faith of us, that we may
be juſtified. And herein (as I have ſhewed before) I have Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>
and other Judicious Divines agreeing with me, who call Faith a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Juſtification, and yet make it to juſtifie as it apprehendeth
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> My words clearly ſhew my meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> That Juſtification
as it is begun by Faith alone, ſo it is continued, ſo that Obedience hath
no more influence into our Juſtification afterward than at firſt. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Faith at firſt is Obediential, <hi>i. e.</hi> ready to bring forth the Fruit
of Obedience; and afterward, as there is opportunity, it doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bring forth the ſame; yet both at firſt and afterward it is Faith
and not Obedience by which we are juſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 1. I have alſo oft enough told you, that you bring nothing
of any force to prove Sentential Juſtification at Judgment a diſtinct
kind of Juſtification, or any more than a declaration and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our preſent Juſtification. 2. For the Texts which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
you do not anſwer what I objected. You alledged them to
prove, That we are juſtified compleatly and finally at the Laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by perſeverance in faithful Obedience. I objected, That they
ſpeak of Juſtification, as it is here obtained, and ſo make not for your
purpoſe; to this you ſay juſt nothing, only you ſeem to ſay ſomething
to thoſe words in the end of the <hi>Animad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rſion, [They ſhew who
are justified, not by what they are juſtified];</hi> but that which you ſay,
is of ſmall force. For none can truly ſay as much of the Texts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for Faith's Juſtifying, ſeeing that thoſe Texts expreſly ſay, That
we are juſtified by Faith, and that Faith is imputed unto us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
which the other Texts do not ſay of Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 1. Did you never underſtand my meaning about Faith's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
until now? Nay, you ſeem not yet to underſtand it. Doth
not Faith juſtifie at all, if it only juſtifies Inſtrumentally and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively?
Is this ſo ſtrange unto you, that when we are ſaid to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith, it is meant in reſpect of the Object, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt and his
Righteouſneſs, which is indeed that by which we are juſtified, though
it muſt be apprehended by Faith, that we may be juſtified by it? Where
is now the <hi>totus mund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Theologorum Reformatorum,</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
you ſpake of? My acquaintance in this kind is not ſo great (I
think) as yours, yet I have before alledged many to this purpoſe. I
will here add one more, a Man of note, Dr. <hi>Prideaux, (Lect. 5. de
Juſtif. §. 11, 14, 16.) Juſtificamur (inquit) per juſtitiam Chriſti, &amp;c. Atqui Fides ex parte noſtrâ hanc juſtitiam ſic a Deo imputatam, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendit
ſolummodo &amp; applicat; quia neque Charitati, vel ſpei, vel</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:51647:90"/>
               <hi>alteri habitui hoc munus competat.</hi> And again, <hi>Juſtificat primò
Deus Pater admittendo, &amp; imputando. 2. Deus Filius, Satisfaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,
&amp; advocatum agendo. 3. Spiritus Sanctus revelando &amp; obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando.
4. Fides apprehendendo &amp; applicando. 5. Opera, manifeſtando
&amp; declarando.</hi> And again, <hi>Animadvertere potuit Bertius, nos non
proprtè juſtificationem fidei attribuere, ſed metalepticè, quàtenus
objecti actus propter arctam connexionem inter illum &amp; habitum,
uſitatâ Scripturae phraſi, in habitum transfertur.</hi> 2. For Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs juſtifying formally, or being the formal cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
I have ſhewed in what ſenſe ſome of our Divines do hold
it, and ſome reject it, and that the difference is rather in words, than
in the thing it ſelf. 3. To me it ſeems no obſcurity to ſay, [Faith or
Believing doth juſtifie, becauſe Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, except it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Faith, is not available to Juſtification]. Is not this as
much as Faith doth juſtifie Inſtrumentally, or as apprehending Chriſts
Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified? The reaſon why Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs cannot juſtifie, except it be apprehended by Faith, is
this, That God doth require Faith of us; Faith (I ſay) apprehending
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>[Believe in the Lord Jeſus Christ]</hi> that
ſo we may be juſtified. God's Will is properly the Cauſe, yet there is
a congruity in the thing it ſelf, an aptitude (you grant) in the nature
of Faith: it is of an apprehenſive Nature, and its apprehending of
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs (the Will of God ſtill preſuppoſed) doth make
this Righteouſneſs ours, even as a Gift becomes ours by our receiving
of it. If <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, which I cited, be not againſt you, then
nothing that I can ſay is againſt you. For I cannot expreſs my own
mind, as to that point, more clearly and fully than he doth. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his words again; <hi>(De Juſtit. Habit. cap. 28.) Nihil uſitatius
quàm cauſae applicanti illud tribuere, quod propriè &amp; immediatè per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet
ad rem applicatam. Quia igitur fides apprehendit, &amp; applicat
nobis juſtitiam Chriſti, id fidei ipſi tribuitur, quod reapſe Chriſto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur.</hi>
Is not this againſt you, who ſay, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 120. <hi>[Faith is a
Work and Act of ours; and if Faith juſtifie as an apprehenſion of
Chriſt, it juſtifieth as a Work?]</hi> Do not theſe words of <hi>Devenant</hi>
tell you, that it is not <hi>Cauſa applicans,</hi> but <hi>res applicata;</hi> not <hi>Fides,</hi>
but <hi>Chriſtus fide apprehenſus</hi> that doth juſtifie? Faith then is ſaid to
juſtifie, yet not in reſpect of it ſelf, but in reſpect of its Object: it is
not properly Faith apprehending, or the apprehenſion of Faith, but
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs apprehended, by which we are juſtified.
Much hath been ſaid before to this purpoſe. If this be nothing againſt
you, I know not how in this particular to ſay any thing againſt you:
if it be againſt you, ſurely it is nothing but what that Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſaith in the words cited. And mark (I pray) upon what occaſion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51647:91"/>
he brings in thoſe words. <hi>Bellarmine (De Juſtif. lib. 2. cap. 9.)</hi> ſaith
that <hi>Calvin,</hi> from <hi>Rom. 4. Vbi dicitur fidem Abrahae imputatam
eſſe id juſtitiam,</hi> gathers, <hi>nihil eſſe aliud noſtram juſtitiam (nempe
quâ juſtificamur) quàm fidem in Chriſtum, id eſt, (N. B.) Chriſti
juſtitiam Chriſti fide apprehenſam.</hi> Againſt this he objects, <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
dicit ipſam fidem imputari ad juſtitiam: fides autem non est
juſtitia Chriſti, &amp;c.</hi> To this <hi>Davenant</hi> anſwers, <hi>Sed frivota est haec
objectio. Nam nihil uſitatius quàm cauſae applicanti, &amp;c.</hi> Your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is the very ſame in effect with <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s; ſo that if <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
words be any thing againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> they are as much againſt
you. And truly as you put off the words of <hi>Davenant,</hi> ſo you might
with the ſame eaſe have anſwered all my <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> and ſo you
may all theſe Exceptions, by ſaying, That they are not againſt you.
It is a ſtrange faculty that you ſeem to have, of making any thing for
you, as when you bid ſee <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Luk. 1. 6.</hi> and nothing againſt
you, as here in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> ſpeaketh of Faith Juſtifying as a Relative
Act, his words immediately before (which I alſo cited) ſhew his
meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith juſtifieth in its relation to Chriſt, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
Chriſt: ſo that not every Act relating unto Chriſt, but that
which doth ſo relate unto him as to receive him, is that which juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
but what I ſay of the Act juſtifying, muſt always be underſtood
in the ſenſe before explained. That Faith in reſpect of its apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
nature, is more than <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> to me is clear; it is
<hi>Cauſa applicans,</hi> as <hi>Davenant</hi> in the words even now cited doth call
it. 2. To contend much about Faith's Inſtrumentality, I do not like;
I mean in reſpect of the word <hi>[Inſtrumentality],</hi> ſo that we agree
in the matter, yet as our beſt Divines have uſed the word, I ſee not
but it is convenient to be uſed. 3. I grant that it is a material queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether it be the receiving of Chriſt only as Prieſt that doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie;
for the confounding of Chriſt's Offices, and of the Acts of
Faith (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> before cited ſaith well) is not to be endured. But
I ſee no neceſſary dependance of this queſtion upon the other, <hi>viz.</hi>
Whether Faith juſtifie as an Inſtrument, a ſole-working Inſtrument,
or as an Ordinance, or Relative Action required on our parts;
which Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> ſaid is all to the ſame iſſue and purpoſe, and ſo I
think it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>87. For the diſtinction of God's Will, you might at firſt apprehend
what I meant, though perhaps my Expreſſions were not altogether ſo
clear as afterward; neither indeed do you ſeem to ſpeak ſo clearly of
it in your</hi> Aphoriſms. <hi>2. How pertinent thoſe Teſtimonies which you
ſpeak of are, I cannot tell; but truly as you cited</hi> Calvin <hi>on</hi> Luk. 1. 6.
<hi>it is no hard matter to cite many. 3. What you alledg out of</hi> Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

               <hi>I might evade, by ſaying as you did, That it is not againſt me;
but I will not put you off ſo. I anſwer therefore,</hi> Ad 1. [Bona opera

Ad 2. <hi>That Concluſion is the ſame in effect
with the former. Some internal Works muſt go before Juſtification,

Ad 3. De retinendo ſcilicet, &amp; conſervando Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis

you further refer me, I cannot conſult, my Edition differing from
yours, as you might perceive by ſome places which I cited. But your
Inference is of no force, as having no ground for it,</hi> viz. <hi>That if I
will be of</hi> Davenant<hi>'s mind, I muſt be of yours. I do not ſee that</hi>

they juſtifie, and urge the words of St.</hi> James <hi>for it, whereas</hi> Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>(as I have ſhewed) makes Faith to juſtifie as apprehending
and applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which ſurely
Works cannot do.</hi>

of Juſtification as Inchoated, and as Conſummate at Judgment,

calleth Faith an Inſtrument, he doth ſufficiently ſhew, making Faith
to have a Cauſality in Juſtifying, by apprehending and applying
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified. But do our greateſt
Divines give as much to Works as you do? This you will undertake
(you ſay) to manifeſt. Why? then make it appear, that they hold
Works to juſtifie as well as Faith, or to have a co-intereſt with Faith
in the Effect of Juſtifying. Except you perform this, (which I
preſume you never will) you cannot make good your Undertaking.
So do our greateſt Divines give more to Faith than you. As you
urge the</hi>

               <hi>of St.</hi> James <hi>for being juſtified by Works, ſo you
alſo inſiſt upon the very Letter of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and will have Faith it
ſelf to be properly our Righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified:
This our greateſt Divines do not no more than the other. Yet you
ſtick not to brand them, as making Man his own Juſtifier and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner.</hi>

What profeſſed Adverſary could reproach our greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
more than thus? Whither will not a Man's partiality carry
him, if he be let alone? May you not as well ſay, That Chriſt made
ſome their own Saviours, becauſe he ſaid, That their Faith had ſaved
them? I had thought that all the Glory did belong to the principal
Agent, rather than to the Inſtrument. And to what purpoſe do
you ſay,</hi> [Who can forgive ſins but God only?] <hi>Do they that
make Faith an Inſtrument of Juſtification, deny this any more
than you, who make both Faith and VVorks Conditions of
it?</hi>

no more than this, That you ſeem as guilty this way
your ſelf, as they whom you cenſure, though neither
you nor they (I think) are indeed guilty in this kind.
But why may not Man's Act be an Inſtrument of God's Act? Or
to ſpeak more properly, Man acting be an Inſtrument of God acting?
We are workers together with God, <hi>2 Cor. 6. 1.</hi> Surely not in a way
of Co-ordination, but in a way of Subordination; and ſo Man may
be God's Inſtrument. I am not therefore of your mind, but think,

Chriſt, <hi>appello totum Mundum Theologorum Reformatorum;</hi> I have
given you enough to this purpoſe before. Now to your Reaſons why
this is to ſet up <gap reason="foreign">

Christum, &amp; Credere in Christum,</hi> are all one. And when
it is ſaid, That this doth juſtifie, the meaning is, <hi>Chriſtus fide ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſus
justificat:</hi> ſo that this doth not ſet up <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Credere,</hi> as ſome
do ſet it up, who make it as our Act ſimply conſidered, to be that
Righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified. <hi>Ad 2.</hi> Their meaning is
not obſcure, as you pretend, that you may the better oppoſe it. The
Object of Faith, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs apprehended by Faith, doth
juſtifie: and ſo Faith is ſaid to juſtifie, not as conſidered in it ſelf,
but in reſpect of its Object, which it apprehendeth, becauſe it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
that, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſneſs which doth juſtifie.
<hi>Ad 3.</hi> The formal reaſon why Faith doth juſtifie, is its Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet ſtill that is in reſpect of the thing apprehended, <hi>Cauſae appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canti
illud tribuitur quod immediatè pertinet ad rem applicatam.
Id fidei ipſi tribuitur, quod reapſe Chriſto debetur,</hi> as <hi>Davenant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited doth expreſs it, whoſe words you ſaid were not againſt you,
though none can be more in this Matter.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond Point you are quite miſtaken. For I do not put a
difference betwixt Juſtification and Right to Salvation, but betwixt
Juſtification and Salvation it ſelf, <hi>i.e.</hi> the full enjoyment of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
Glorification. I have frequently expreſſed my ſelf to this effect, That
by Faith alone we are juſtified, and ſo have Right to Salvation;
yet by VVorks and Obedience alſo we muſt come fully to enjoy
Salvation.</p>

In hoc Foedere (ſcil. Evangelico, <hi>ſaith</hi> Davenant, De Juſtit.
Actual. cap. 30. pag. mihi 396.) ad obtinendam reconciliationem,
justificationem, atque aeternam vitam, non alia requiritur Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiò,
quam verae &amp; vivae fidei. <hi>Preſently after he explains himſelf

            <p>By the way you may obſerve how he calls Faith the Condition,
and the only Condition of our Juſtification, and yet he makes it not
to be <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> but <hi>Cauſa Instrumentalis &amp; Cauſa appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
as appears by his words before cited. Your following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not againſt me, you do but fight (as they ſay) with
your own ſhadow. Yea, you having objected againſt your ſelf,
<hi>Rom. 5. 10.</hi> You anſwer directly as I uſe to do, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not diſtinguiſh betwixt Reconciliation and a Right to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but betwixt Reconciliation and actual (and Compleat) Salvation.
You add, That <hi>Paul</hi> makes them both Fruits of Free Grace. And what
Proteſtant (ſay I) doth not ſo? A neceſſity of good Works, as the
way of attaining unto Salvation is aſſerted, yet it is denied that good
VVorks are meritorious of Salvation. That in <hi>Rom. 8. 6.</hi> (whence
you infer, That only Faith is not the Condition) proves not that
Faith alone is not the Condition of Juſtification and Right to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is all that I contend for. VVhat you mean by thoſe
words <hi>[Life as well as Righteouſneſs]</hi> I do not know. Neither do
I ſee what thoſe Verſes, 13, 14, 17. <hi>(viz.</hi> of <hi>Rom. 8.)</hi> are for
your purpoſe. VVhereas by the way you ſay, <hi>[Faith juſtifies, not</hi>
quà Inſtrumentum, vel Apprehenſio proximè ſed quà Conditio

have told you before, That I alſo include a Moral Conſideration, and
do not make Faith to juſtifie merely as it is of ſuch an apprehenſive
Nature, but as being of ſuch a Nature, God therefore in that reſpect
hath been pleaſed to make choice of it for that end, that by it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs <hi>(i.e.</hi> properly by Chriſt
