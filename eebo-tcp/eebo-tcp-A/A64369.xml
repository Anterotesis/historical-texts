            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM Lxxviii. 5, 6.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V. 5.â€”He established a Testimony in Iacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded our Forefathers, That they should make them known to their Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V. 6. That the Generations to come might know Them, even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their Children.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Title of <hi>Benefactor</hi> does principally belong to those who are at present useful, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise oblige Posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98131:4"/>
Such a one was King <hi>David,</hi> who Serv'd his own Generation very Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and having finish'd his Course, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his <hi>Lamp</hi> to the succeeding Age. Of this, as many are convinced, as either read the History of his Life, or peruse his <hi>Psalms</hi> with Application of Mind.</p>
            <p>And it was his care, amongst his other Pious Designs, to continue the <hi>Memory</hi> of God's Wonderful Works from <hi>Age</hi> to <hi>Age;</hi> to the end that the Consideration of his Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness might effectually move them to obey his Laws. Of such Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances they stood in great need, being apt no longer to think upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Divine Mercy, than whilst they saw them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore God himself prescribed this way of teaching his Statutes, <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 9.</note> and rehearsing the History of his Mighty Acts, (and especially those at <hi>Horeb)</hi> to <hi>their Sons</hi> and their <hi>Sons Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98131:4"/>
And that the <hi>Israelites</hi> might not err in the repetition, he caus'd those Statutes and Wonders to be written down; not leaving them to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Oral Tradition, which sometimes either passeth by things of moment, or delivers them down ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfectly; and too often brings it to pass, that the Legends of one Age, become History in those that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God establish'd a Testimony in Iacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded our Fore-fathers, That they should make them known to their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Generations to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Doing Good to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,</hi> being set forth in these words, not by any <hi>General Precept,</hi> but only by the <hi>especial Instance</hi> of propagating
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98131:5"/>
the Knowledge of his Law; I shall use them rather as the <hi>Occasion,</hi> than the <hi>Ground</hi> of this Proposition,
<q>That a Good Man, according to his Talent and Circumstance, does endeavour in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Do good</hi> in <hi>his</hi> time, that the <hi>next</hi> Age also may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reap the benefit of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this kind of <hi>Charity,</hi> I purpose to consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How fit and just a thing it is to put it in Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That, notwithstanding its fitness, there is too general a disuse of It.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whence it comes to pass that there is so Common a failure in so necessary a Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By what means the Exercise of it may be made more regular, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among us; that so the ages to come may have just cause to Bless Almighty God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98131:5"/>
for the advantages derived to them from this Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Now, <hi>First of all,</hi> the <hi>doing of Good to Posterity,</hi> may appear a fit and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Practice;
<list>
                  <item>1. From a common Rule of Good and Evil.</item>
                  <item>2. From the Obligation which man is under, to imitate God.</item>
                  <item>3. From the <hi>Gratitude</hi> we owe to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Ages.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This is a <hi>Common Rule</hi> concerning <hi>Good,</hi> not only that it is to be done, but that we are to do what, <hi>upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> is the <hi>greatest good</hi> which we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing in our Sphere and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now Good is increased as well by the <hi>Duration</hi> of Benefits, as by their <hi>Magnitude</hi> and <hi>Number;</hi> so that if the Good be equal in other respects, he that does the Charity that lasts <hi>but a day,</hi> does well; but he that does the Good that lasts <hi>some years,</hi> does still better. He who out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98131:6"/>
of good will, gives <hi>a cup of cold water</hi> to a thirsty man, performs a Charitable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sice; but that Person is, by much, the greater Benefactor, who opens a <hi>Fountain</hi> which from time to time may give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment to Man and Beast. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Reasons and Proportions of <hi>Good,</hi> a man is requir'd, according to his ability, to look beyond the term of his own few and uncertain days, known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God how few they are.</p>
            <p>He is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Required to <hi>benefit Posterity,</hi> that he may be a Follower of God in true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is the <hi>imitation</hi> of Him whom we worship: And by doing Charities which may last, we are made, in some measure like to Him; for all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations partake of the Goodness of God.</p>
            <p>He so framed the Material World at the beginning, that by the same Order of Nature (the same for the main) it might in its several Ages conveniently subsist; and the same <hi>Sun</hi> that shone on <hi>Adam,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98131:6"/>
God permitted men in the <hi>first</hi> Age of the World, to live very many Years, that by their Experience (especially in the Courses of the Stars, which required length of time for observation) the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> Ages might receive <hi>useful</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>useful,</hi> not only in secular Affairs, but in Religion; the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>more they are understood, declaring the more the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> ordained the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Passover,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lords Supper, not merely for the men of any <hi>one</hi> Age, but as <hi>Memorials</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> of the <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the meritorious <hi>Passion</hi> of our Redeemer, for many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
            <p>He sent his Blessed Son <hi>once</hi> to offer a Sacrifice, whose Virtue might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all true Christians, as long as there should be a Church on Earth.</p>
            <p>He caused Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be written for the good of all following times; and the things which were written of old, were written for our Admonition, upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98131:7"/>
whom the <hi>ends of the world are come.</hi> For instance; we are commanded to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the wife of Lot,</hi> who, so many Years ago, (looking <hi>back towards Sodom)</hi> was turn'd into a Pillar of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 19. 25, 26. S. Luke 17. 32. Deut. 29. 23.</note>, being punish'd in the same extraordinary way with those unclean Sinners who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not a fitter expression of our <hi>gratitude to former Ages,</hi> than a hearty endeavour to procure advantage to those who come after us, as we have received benefit by those who went before us; borrowing Light from their Light, and living upon the Effects of their Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. If nothing had been done for us, in how miserable an Estate should we have come into the World, and lived in it? Much more miserably than <hi>Adam,</hi> who in the state of Innocence, enjoy'd the Earth, without the Curse which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience brought upon it. If all Arts, and Sciences, and Buildings, and other such Helps and Conveniences of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> were to be invented and begun with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98131:7"/>
every Age, how rude, how mean would the condition of it be? How heavily would it be pressed with the burden of Necessity? How much more painful and laborious would this render the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of man, which as it is, with all its advantages, has still its sufficient share of trouble? In what darkness had we sate in reference to the means of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it had not pleased the God of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, through the hands of the Christians of former Centuries, to deliver down to us the Holy Bible?</p>
            <p>It does therefore well become us to have a sense of the Favours of those who died before our times, but still live in their benefits; and gratefully to celebrate their just Praise, and to have a perpetual inclination, when we have not further power, to <hi>go, and to do likewise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>just</hi> as this <hi>Practice</hi> is, there seems to be</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Too general a disuse of it.</hi> Some are careful even to Anxiety, but they show that the solicitude is for <hi>their selves,</hi> by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98131:8"/>
their backwardness in disposing of any thing, so much as by a WILL. Some let <hi>Receits</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi> dye with them, by which great numbers in succeeding Ages might have been profited. Some are not provident for <hi>their selves,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not likely to take due care for Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They will not put a <hi>stone</hi> into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying Building, or drop an <hi>acorn</hi> into the Ground for the sake of those that shall follow them; much less have they a zeal for the supporting of Gods Church in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult times, or the planting of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in places that want the blessing of it: Insomuch that when they give up their wretched lives (as give them up they must, what aversion soever they have to it) they appear as a Place surrendred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and tedious Siege, where little r mains, besides dead Corpses, Rubbish, and Ruins.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind of still a <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sort of men,</hi> who by their <hi>inhumanity,</hi> make such desolations in their times, as late Posterity can scarce repair. Their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98131:8"/>
Talent lies not in promoting <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Holy Worship,</hi> but in forcing Error and Idolatry; not in Building and Planting, but in plucking up and destroying. They are imitators of <hi>Apollyon</hi> the God of this World, whose <hi>Delight</hi> is Mischief; whose Triumphs are Barbarities. Fire and Sword are the Instruments of their <hi>Glory:</hi> They spare neither the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Living, nor the <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Dead. They lay waste in a few Hours, strong and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cities, which were the fruit of the Arts and Labours of former Times. One would think they would anticipate Doomsday it self, if their Force were equal to their Pride and Malice: Though that sort of men, of all others in the World, have the least reason to hasten the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When their Acts shall be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before the <hi>Children that are yet unborn,</hi> they will rise up with just indignation, and call their Memories accursed.</p>
            <p>If (as we have proposed in the <hi>third place),</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98131:9"/>
3. We enquire into the Causes of this Uncharitableness, we shall without much difficulty, find them amongst the <hi>ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and disorderly <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> of unreasonable men. As for example;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Atheistical,</hi> if they follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of their Opinion, terminate their <hi>Designs,</hi> as they imagine they do their humane <hi>Beings,</hi> in <hi>this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who live by <hi>Sense,</hi> whose Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are <hi>present,</hi> have no regard for such as they shall never live to <hi>see;</hi> for such as are not capable of returning them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate thanks, of making them Presents, of pleasing them with flatteries, of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them such services as are most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to flesh and blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>slothful</hi> will not be at the pains to build or to uphold, to manure or culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to catechise a Child, or instruct a Servant, or discreetly to reprove an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Neighbour: They will let their <hi>own Vineyards</hi> be over-run, in their own times, with Briars and Thorns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98131:9"/>
The <hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to think (if thinking be at any time the exercise of such Affectors of Ease) that Peace and Plenty will last for their Days; and that is all the Eternity they care for; though by such neglect, Ruin often comes down upon their Heads before their term of Life is expired. So it commonly happens to the <hi>Prodigal</hi> who inspect not their Affairs, and believe their Fortune to be <hi>sufficient for their Time;</hi> and in that Imagination, say to their Souls, <hi>Take your Ease;</hi> and dream on till they are surpriz'd by Poverty: And, if their loose and swift way of living permits them to number many Years; there remain to them the fewest Supplies in <hi>that Age</hi> which has the most and greatest needs, the Age of <hi>Labour and Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> hate the rest of the World, and are not pleased that the state of it should be bettered by them. Out of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98131:10"/>
the abundance of such an ill Heart came that worst of Sayings pronounced by one of the Brutal Heathens, <hi>When I leave the World, let Earth and Fire mingle;</hi> or, let the Frame of Nature be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dissolv'd. He would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born those wicked Words, if he had but just thought of that more dreadful Fire which Divine Justice has prepared for the Uncharitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> the <hi>Proud</hi> and the <hi>Designing,</hi> who are themselves ignorant, will on purpose deny a liberal Education to those Children who are under their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, lest they grow too wise and sensible for them.</p>
            <p>From the same <hi>Passion</hi> it is, that Wicked Men endeavour to hinder both present and future Good, by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing generous and worthy Persons, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them occasion to complain, with that great Warrier <hi>Belisarius;</hi> "It was not a <hi>"Crime</hi> that hurt us, but <hi>Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98131:10"/>
               <hi>Likewise,</hi> the <hi>Covetous</hi> either stifle the <hi>Wills</hi> of the Charitable, or forbear to fulfill them; converting that to their own use, which was piously intended for others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also,</hi> the <hi>Malicious</hi> study on purpose to leave <hi>That which must go to others,</hi> in a ruinous Condition. It may be, without a House for shelter, or a Tree for shade, or a Field not worn out with perpetual bearing, or a Paper for Direction, and for the determination of Strife; much more without a Prayer for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of those who shall come after them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> of some Men of revengeful Dispositions, it has been said, That on their very <hi>Death-Beds,</hi> [a solemn Time in which nothing should supplant the Love of God and Man; when their abundant Charity should, through Christ, prepare their Way to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, before whom they are suddenly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear]
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98131:11"/>
that, being engaged in vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Suits and Quarrels with others, they have given it in charge to the Heirs of their Families, to keep up the Grudg, and to continue the Controversy from Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Where this Evil Temper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, it entails Trouble and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: For it requires little skill to unfix and embroil, but a great deal to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish. May That (as we hope, and as we pray) be, for the future, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of this Age, to the end that it may flourish in True Religion, in Unity, in Plenty, Peace and Health, and by that means become a Blessing to these <hi>Lands</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>These Evil <hi>Principles, Lusts, Passions,</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> which I have mentioned, are the <hi>Causes of the Decay</hi> of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Charity so beneficial to the Ages to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98131:11"/>
But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us not follow the inordinate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and unreasonable Customs of the Men of this World, but be prevailed with to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>David;</hi> or rather, the God of <hi>David,</hi> who hath a Blessing for every Age: and who, when he rested from the <hi>Work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> did not forbear the Works of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That we may be capable of practising this sort of Charity, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Passions</hi> are to be subdu'd by pious Consideration, by Prayer for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special Grace of God, by firm and stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast Resolution, by Conversation with Christians whose Hearts are enlarged, by reading the holy Scriptures, and in them, the History of God's Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> being thus made capable of doing present and future Good; that we may do it as we ought, the <hi>Good-Will,</hi> the right <hi>Scope,</hi> the <hi>Decence,</hi> the <hi>Iustice</hi> of It, are well to be weighed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98131:12"/>
And, <hi>First, Good-Will</hi> ought to be the Spring which moves Men that benefit those who succeed them; for it is no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to <hi>leave that behind us,</hi> which Death will not permit us to <hi>carry away. Dives laid up Goods for many years,</hi> and he left them to Others, without being to them a Benefactor; for, <hi>he laid them up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> upon a vain and presumptuous sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of long Life; in which he was miserably disappointed, by the surprizing Justice of that Righteous God, who said to Him, <hi>Thou Fool! this Night thy Soul shall be taken from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> This <hi>Good-Will</hi> is to be directed to a <hi>right</hi> and profitable <hi>Scope;</hi> that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may not be blinded by <hi>Superstition,</hi> which hath founded many <hi>Societies,</hi> and left great Revenues, and enriched many <hi>Shrines,</hi> to the <hi>hurt of Posterity,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Honour of false Deities and Saints; and by encouraging a Worship from Age to Age, in which the True God can take no pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98131:12"/>
There is <hi>also</hi> to be observed, in this Practice, a <hi>Decency,</hi> which forbids a Man to be severely <hi>Penurious</hi> all his days, for <hi>the doing a greater Good at the last.</hi> It is true, He is not to be condemned for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off unnecessary Pomps and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in order to so good an End: And he may be bold with himself. But, though there may be a <hi>laudable Frugality,</hi> there must not be a <hi>sordidness</hi> in his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Add to this,</hi> That <hi>Iustice,</hi> as well as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> becomes all Men who piously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to be Benefactors to Posterity. They are not to do Evil that Good may come of it; or, to be unjust, Oppressors, Extortioners in one Age, that they may be bountiful to another. Yet, such is the manner of the Covetous, who love not Mankind, nor their very Off spring as Men, but in the Quality of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-selves: They run the hazard even of Damnation, for the greatning of those, who generally spend with vicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness all that Wealth which, with such
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98131:13"/>
guilt of Conscience they had gathered together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Having found out such <hi>Rules</hi> as these for the governing of our Practice, we may render our selves more fit for the discharge of so Excellent a Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By removing certain Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By attending to some further Motives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Discouragements</hi> are of <hi>Two</hi> Kinds.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Suspicions</hi> of <hi>Ability</hi> to do such good.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Hindrances</hi> of <hi>Willingness</hi> in Those who are able to do it; and in some of them who are not ill inclined.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Men of <hi>inferiour condition</hi> suspect their <hi>Ability;</hi> imagining, that he who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Benefactor, must be arm'd with great Power and Authority, indued with high degrees of Wisdom, and furnished with such heaps of growing Wealth, as may supply Charity, without sensible Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98131:13"/>
whereas there are divers waies by which Persons, in meaner Circumstances, may, in <hi>their Age,</hi> be useful both to <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>next.</hi> A poor Man, as we read in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> did by his prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel deliver a City. And that Place had, probably, the Benefit of his good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice a long Time after; though whilst his Wisdom made him considerable, his Poverty exposed him to the Scorn and Neglect of the Proud and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. There are true Benefactors in the World besides such who have Ability to make <hi>Publick Waies,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair <hi>Breaches</hi> of the Sea, to calm that which is as tumultuous, the Rage of the People; to build Houses for God's Worship, to found Colledges and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals, to subdue public Enemies, and to enact wholsom Laws, which are the Nerves of Society, and by the strength of which we a while (by God's Blessing) subsisted, though Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Superstition did so furiously assault us. Many may communicate to their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98131:14"/>
Neighbours a wholsom <hi>Medicine,</hi> though they cannot erect a House for the Sick, and Wounded, and Impotent. Every Master of a Family in <hi>Israel,</hi> was obliged to shew his Children the Reason of the <hi>Paschal Feast,</hi> and to teach them the Law of God. Those, therefore, were not Performances out of their Power, for then they could not have been their Duty. And to Christians their great Master saith, What excellent things do ye? What do <hi>ye more than others?</hi> Much Good they may do by rehearsing the Holy History of God's Law and his wonderful Works before others, that they may learn it, and transmit it to the next Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Much Good they may do by teaching of necessary Doctrines to Youth, and by forming the Manners of those who are likely to outlive them. They may instil into them betimes such Christian Principles as may grow up with them, and <hi>bring forth Fruit in their Age.</hi> He who hath a small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98131:14"/>
of Silver or Gold, may yet be sometimes capable of leaving behind him a more valuable Legacy: By giving the World a <hi>Book of Piety,</hi> such as that of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> by which the judicious and modest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath done a greater Good to those who lived in and after his Time, than if he had poured forth other Riches upon them in overflowing measure.</p>
            <p>Most are capable of doing a durable Charity by good <hi>Example,</hi> which may operate when they are dead and gone. To how many Generations has the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Patience of afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> administred Courage and Support, whilst they have called it to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in the Time of their Trouble? And there is great need of <hi>virtuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> for the ballancing of that which is <hi>Bad;</hi> the Contagion of which sticks like Leprosie in Families, Churches and Kingdoms. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin [to commit <note place="margin">1 King. 14 16.</note> that great Sin of Idolatry, by worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98131:15"/>
the true God by an Image] both in <hi>his Time,</hi> and after he was gone to answer both for his own and for other Men's Sins. But what Answer could he make for either? Either was a Burthen too heavy for him to bear.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>for the Charity of Prayer,</hi> who is there that cannot call on God for a Blessing on Persons and Families, on Churches and States, after they shall have left this unquiet Stage, and that <hi>Scheme of the World which passeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sum, all <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> as wicked, are hurtful, and all <hi>Good Men,</hi> as good, <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 5, 6. C. 34. 7. Deut. 7. 9.</note> are beneficial both at present and for the future. Blessing and Cursing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue Families very often, according to the Righteousness or Impiety of the first Heads of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are <hi>Discouragements</hi> which hinder Men, who are able to do Good to other Generations, from being <hi>Willing.</hi> That is to say, The
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98131:15"/>
Instance of <hi>Backwardness</hi> in Public Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers to <hi>reward</hi> those who have undone themselves by some <hi>useful Invention,</hi> which generally ruines the first <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,</hi> whilst Posterity reaps the fruit of their Wit, Labour, and Expence. Also the Instances of <hi>Failures</hi> and <hi>Frauds</hi> in <hi>Trust,</hi> of smothered or abused <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> of the converting of that to the use of the Rich, which is bequeathed to the Poor; together with the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>uncertainty of Times,</hi> in which, by Wars and tumultuous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, the Effects of Publick Charity do often perish.</p>
            <p>There is much Truth in this <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but yet not so much as makes it <hi>unanswerable. Useful Inventions</hi> are often greater Charities than could have been done by the Pains and Wealth which they cost. <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Abuses</hi> do not alwaies happen: They do not alwaies come; and <hi>wo to them,</hi> not who are injur'd by them, but <hi>by whom they come.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98131:16"/>
And the Observation of such acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Miscarriages should, indeed, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Caution,</hi> but not prevent the Charity of wealthy Men. It is, also; profitable for us to remember, That whatsoever Hazards <hi>Good Works run,</hi> the Soul that has done them in Christian Manner, shall be safe in the Hands of their Mediator. Christians know in whom they have believed, and how able he is to keep that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>his Trust</hi> to <hi>that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> that's an Objection against do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good in all Ages; for Heaven only is <hi>a Kingdom which cannot be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, laying aside these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, cast in our Way by too great a Degree of Jealousie, let us,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Provoke our selves to Piety and to Good Works, by laying before our Thoughts such further <hi>Motives</hi> as these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98131:16"/>
The <hi>First</hi> may be taken from the <hi>true pleasure</hi> which is found in all <hi>good Acts,</hi> and particularly of those of that kind of which we have been speaking. <hi>Pleasure</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally springs up in the Mind, when we think of any thing we much value, as <hi>continuing</hi> and <hi>prospering.</hi> A great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of happiness consists in <hi>hope,</hi> and in hope cherished by <hi>proceeding.</hi> The Mind is <hi>damp'd</hi> when it is <hi>stinted,</hi> and when it sees an end of any thing in which it took content. And if pleasure is derived to us from the growth and progress even of our humblest <hi>Plants,</hi> much more shall we be pleased by the extent of our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Christian Men, and in the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. It is a blessed and comfortable Thought, that God will vouchsafe to use such frail earthen Vessels, as Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>good;</hi> by Instruction, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by Prayers, by Alms, not only for the Span of our Life, but <hi>for many years to come.</hi> It was a strong Consolation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98131:17"/>
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his Off-spring all the <hi>Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Motive</hi> may be taken from <hi>Honour,</hi> which is <hi>Fame</hi> acquired by doing of <hi>worthy things.</hi> After this Men so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally thirst, that some have affected the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Benefactors</hi> who have <note place="margin">Luke 22. 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c,</note> turn'd their Power into Oppression; for of that number (as <hi>Philo</hi> shews us) was <hi>Caius Caligula.</hi> They understood what was venerable, but they did not pursue it.</p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Charity</hi> which is <hi>transient,</hi> is honourable; and the Woman who with her Spikenard <hi>anointed our Saviour to his burial,</hi> is to this day honourably remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred wheresoever the History of the Gospel is read. And if to <hi>transient good</hi> our Praise is due, certainly to that which is <hi>lasting</hi> it ought not to be denied. Wherefore the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> considering the Salvation of the World by Christ, whose Mother she was become through
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98131:17"/>
God's special favour, believed not her <hi>Magnificat</hi> to be a vain-glorious <hi>Hymn,</hi> but said with humble Joy, <hi>God hath regarded the lowliness of his Hand-maiden; for behold from henceforth all Generations shall call me blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>greatest Motives</hi> of all are, <hi>Conscience,</hi> which requireth us to <hi>do good,</hi> as our Christian Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious Fear,</hi> which sets before the <hi>Unprofitable</hi> (the unprofitable to Men, for God we cannot profit) the <hi>Terrors</hi> of the <hi>great Day.</hi> And, last of all,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious Hope,</hi> which moves us to be useful, in all our Capacities, whilst time lasts, upon the most comfortable prospect of an Eternal Recompence.</p>
