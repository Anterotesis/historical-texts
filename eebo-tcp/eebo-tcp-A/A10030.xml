            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>I Iohn 5. 14.</bibl>
               <q>And this is the assurance which wee have in
him, that if we aske any thing according to
his will, he heareth us.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He scope of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in this chapter, is to set
forth some of those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
priviledges we have by
Iesus Christ. One maine
and principall (which is the
greatest of all the rest) is
that through him we have eternall life; And
therefore (saith he) know this, that when you
have the Sonne once, you have life: in the 12.
ver. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that
hath not the Sonne hath not life.</hi> Therefore (saith
he) have I written this Epistle to you for this
purpose, that you might consider well what
gaine you have by Christ Iesus: <hi>These things
have I written,</hi> (saith hee) in the verses before
this that I have now read unto you, <hi>to you
that beleeve in the Name of the Sonne of God,
that you may know that you have eternall life.</hi>
After this he names another great priviledge,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15587:3"/>
that wee have by Christ; mentioned in this
verse, that I have now read unto you. <hi>This</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is the assurance we have in him, that
whatsoever wee aske according to his will, hee
heareth us.</hi> This is the second great priviledge
we have by Christ, we shall be heard in all our
requests: it is no more but aske and have, put
up what petition you will, if you be in Christ
once, you have this assurance, that hee heareth
you: but he delivers it with this condition, you
must first be in him: <hi>We have this assurance in
him</hi> (saith he) <hi>that if we aske any thing, according
to his will, he heareth vs.</hi> So that you see, here
are two plaine poynts lying evidently before
us.</p>
            <p>1 That except a man be in Christ,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> he must
not, hee ought not to apply to himselfe any of
these spirituall priviledges, that wee have by
him: if we be in Christ, this and all other are
ours; if you be in Christ (saith he) then you
have this assurance, for wee have that assurance
in him. The second point that the verse affords
us, is,</p>
            <p>2 That whosoever is in Christ,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> whatsoever
he askes he shall have it. Now my full intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was, onely to have handled that which is
mainely aimed at in the verse (for the other you
see is but touched by the way) which is this
great priviledge that belongs to all Christians,
that whatsoever they aske in prayer according
to the will of God, they shall bee heard in it:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15587:3"/>
But because I understand you had a <hi>Sacrament</hi>
appointed for this day, I have altered a little
that course; the hearing of that hath somewhat
diverted mee, and caused mee at this time to
pitch upon the other point which I named to
you; <hi>That except a man be in Christ, be ought not
to apply any priviledge to himselfe; if hee be, I say,
all belongs to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you come to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it
is a very great priviledge to meddle with those
holy mysteries, to have those simboles given to
you of the love and favour of God in Christ; but
yet you must remember this, that except you
be in Christ, you have nothing to doe with
him, and therefore it is a fitte and necessary
point for this season. For when the Apostle
would give directions to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> what they
should doe, to prepare themselves to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
that they may be worthy receivers;
hee gives it in this short precept:<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Let every
man</hi> (saith he) <hi>examine himselfe, and so let him
eate this bread and drinke this cup.</hi> Now what is a
man to examine himselfe of? Surely every one
that comes to the Lords Table, is to examine
himselfe concerning these two things.</p>
            <p>1 Whether he bee in Christ, and so whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
he hath any right at all to come neere to him in
that holy ordinance.</p>
            <p>2 Though he be in Christ, yet he must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
himselfe, whether hee bee particularly
prepared, quickned, and fitted; whether his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15587:4"/>
heart bee put into such a trance of grace, or
fashioned so as it ought to bee, when hee comes
to the immediate performance of such a duty as
that is. Now because I handle this point, but
onely for this particular occasion, I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into such a manner of handling of it, as I
was wont to doe at other times, but onely take
up so much of it as may serve for the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
Therefore because I say this to you:
That except a man bee in Christ, hee ought not
to take any priviledge to himselfe: wee will,
First exhort every man to consider whether hee
be in Christ: for this is the present question
which any mans heart would aske, when hee
heares this propounded; Why, if all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
bee suspended upon my being in Christ,
my maine businesse is to examine whether I be
in Christ or no. Now because a man may bee in
Christ and yet be suspended by some interveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sinne, by some indisposition of minde and
heart, that may grow on him, from the actuall
injoying of the present fruit and benefit of that
priviledge which belongs to him Therefore
we will first give you rules to examine your
selves whether you be in Christ or no. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
usefull to all that now are to receive, or at
any other time; its usefull you know too, not
onely upon such an occasion as this, but upon
all occasions; and therefore a point, (though pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
belonging to this time being taken up
for preparation for the Sacrament) which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15587:4"/>
we may the more boldly venture upon, and
you ought to attend it more diligently. I will
give you but these two maine notes or rules by
which you shall try it.</p>
            <p>Whosoever is in Christ, there must passe a
double act: one on our part, another on Christs
part,<note n="b" place="margin">Cant. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> wee take
Christ and Christ takes us; wheresoever you
find these two acts, such a man is in Christ:
There must be an act of our part, something the
heart and mind of a man must doe to take
Christ. Secondly the Lord sends and puts forth
something of his, he doth put forth an act of the
Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby he comprehends and takes
us. Now if thou finde in thy selfe these two
things; First, that thy heart hath exercised that
act of taking the Lord Iesus; Secondly, that he
hath sent forth a vertue and put forth an act of
his to take and to comprehend thee; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
thou art in Christ; and if it be so, all the
priviledges belong to thee; if not, thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with this holy Sacrament. Now for
the cleare discerning of that act which is on
our part, you must consider these things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Whether you make Christ your chiefest
<hi>Excellencie.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 Whether you make him your chiefest
<hi>Treasure.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 Whether you make him you chiefest <hi>Ioy</hi>
and Delight.</item>
               <item>4 Whether hee bee your chiefest <hi>Refuge</hi> to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15587:5"/>
whom your hearts retire on all occasions.</item>
               <item>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5 Whether you set him up in your hearts for
the chiefest <hi>Commander.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>My Beloved, if you finde all this done by
you, then out of doubt, Christ belongs to you;
They are all severall, but they meet in one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and serve together to make up one rule of
triall, to know whether you have tooke Christ
to you or no; and I will handle them all distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as I have named them to you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 Therefore consider whether Christ be thy
chiefest <hi>Excellency;</hi> for it is naturall to every
man to seeke some excellency or other. Indeed
beasts, so they may have that which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the life and service of nature, it is enough
for them; and it may be it is enough for all bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
men, whose soules are buried in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
that are but sepulchers of men, in whom
that spectacle of excellency which is rationall,
belonging to a man, is quenched in sensuality.
These men, it may be, seeke no excellency at all,
but so they may live in pleasures, so they may
have that which belongs to their bodies, and to
this present life, it is enough for them. But a
man who hath any thing of a man in him, as hee
is a man, considered in these higher parts of his
soule, his <hi>mind</hi> and his <hi>will;</hi> hee seekes another
excellency sutable to these parts: hee serves a
higher, a more spirituall immateriall substance,
such as the soule is; and according as mens
mindes are of divers fashions, so they are in a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15587:5"/>
way of seeking severall excellencies for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet according to their different ages.
Children delight in childish things, and so doe
men likewise, from whom this childishnesse is
worne; yet according to their severall fashion
and understanding, so they seeke a severall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.
Some seeke learning, knowledge and
excellency in their profession; this is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
they would have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some seeke great places
of authority and command, and if they had their
wish, that is, the excellency they would have;
Some seeke the favour of the Prince: Some to
have a great estate, that men may say, hee is
worth so much, he hath such Lordships, such
faire houses, &amp; lands belonging to him; if he had
the excellencie he desires, these he would have.
Every man in his owne kinde, according as
mens understandings are stronger or weaker;
according to their different education, as it hath
beene more noble, and ingenious; according to
the severall companyes they keepe, where they
finde such and such things magnified; according
to the severall ages they live in; (As wee say
something is in request is one age, in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
something in another) I say according to
these severall occasions, so every man seekes a
severall excellency to himselfe. Now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what is the excellency thy heart desires, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all thing else, whether it bee Iesus Christ;
to be in him; to excell in grace; to have a new
draught of Gods Image in thy soule; or whether
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15587:6"/>
some such thing as I have named: Consider
what is the proper vertue thou wouldest have
thy soule to excell in, for there are severall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
every thing hath some vertue or other
which is proper to it; as the vertue of a knife
is to cut well; the vertue of a horse to goe well;
the vertue of a souldier to fight well; and the
vertue of a Christian to be a holy man; to bee
holy, gracious, and unblameable in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
Now what is the proper excellency
thy heart aymes at: what is that thou esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy vertue, that if thou wert put to thy
choyse that thou mightest have a wish granted
thee, thou wouldest most desire? whether
wouldest thou desire this; to excell in grace and
holinesse, to have thy sinfull lusts mortifyed, to
have thy heart put into a holy frame of grace?
or whether, (if thou wouldest deale impartially
with thy selfe) is it not some other excellency
that thy heart runnes upon? that thy thoughts
and affections are most set upon? Consider
when thou lookest upon others, what seemes
most gracious in thy sight, by what thou doest
most value the excellency of another man; for
it is likely thou so esteemest thy selfe also: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
therefore I say what thou measurest thy
selfe and others by; A man that is in Christ, sets
so much by himselfe, and by every man as he is
in Gods booke: as you see, men are rated, and
their wealth esteemed according as they are in
the Kings bookes. See what thy heart saith to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15587:6"/>
this, whether thou settest so much by thy selfe
and by every man else, as he is in Gods favour;
as he hath the eminency of grace and holinesse
above others; or whether it bee something else
by which thou ratest thy selfe and others: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what is that outward Badge, that Livery,
that Cognizance thou desirest to weare, which
thou wouldest boast of among men: you shall
see it in <hi>Paul,</hi> (saith he) When I come amongst
you, I doe<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>not regard the excellencie of naturall
wisedome;</hi> I care not to come with that; The
time was when I prized it, as you prize it now;
but now (saith hee) it is another excellency
which I seeke, which I desire to weare (as it
were) When I come amongst you, to preach the
Gospell, (saith hee) I care for nothing else, I
care not to bee thought to know any else, than
<hi>Christ crucifyed:</hi> Consider with thy selfe now
what thou wouldst have most eminent in thee,
in the eyes and eares of men, that which thou
wouldest weare in the view of all the world;
whether it be the Livery of Christ; to professe
the feare of God, to excell in grace and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
though the world disgrace, despise and hate
thee for it; Is this that thy heart desires? If so,
its a signe thou seekest Christ for thy excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Consider likewise what it is that thou
esteemest thy chiefest wisedome; for it is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of men before they bee in Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have experience of the wayes of God,
before they be regenerate, when they look upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15587:7"/>
those wayes in others, they reckon them folly,
<hi>they are</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 14.</note> 
               <hi>foolishnesse to every naturall man:</hi> but
when they are once in Christ, then they are wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
unto them, that is, they reckon him the
wisest man that excels most in these foolish
courses, as before they deemed them. It is the
Lords expression, <hi>Deu.</hi> 4. 6.<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 4, 6.</note> 
               <hi>This shall bee your
wisdome before all people, to keepe my Lawes and
Commandements.</hi> Consider now what is that
thou reckonest thy chiefest wisedome, before
all people; whether that which before thou
thinkedst folly and weaknesse, and hadd'st a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in thy heart to contemne and scorne?
whether now settest thou it at a higher price,
and dost in truth thinke it thy wisedome, and
art willing that all the world should know that
thou thinkest so? By this you shall finde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you make Christ your excellency by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whether your hearts goe this way or no,
to seeke a vertue in the excellencies of Iesus
Christ, and so shew them forth to others; by
examining whether this be thy cheifest wish, that
thou mayest bee a Christian; that thou mayest
bee found in Christ; that thou mayest be able to
say as <hi>Paul</hi> said,<note n="f" place="margin">Phil. 3. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I reckon all other things as
drosse, as base and vile things; onely to bee found in
Christ, to be cloathed in his righteousnesse,</hi> to excell
in the graces of his Spirit; this onely I prize as
most excellent, and most worthy: And this is
the first.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, consider what is thy chiefest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15587:7"/>
               <hi>Treasure,</hi> for you see<note n="g" place="margin">Math. 13. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that had gotten the
field, hee gave all that heehad for it, and went away
rejoycing,</hi> for hee reckoned it his greatest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and worth all the rest. It is certaine,
whosoever hath taken Christ, doth so esteeme
of him, hee reckons him to bee his chiefe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>You will say, How shall I know it?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Why, consider what men do with their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
for it is certaine (as I said before, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
so) every man hath some treasure or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
The poorest man that is, hath a treasure,
something that hee esteemes of, which hee
makes account of. I aske not what thou art pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of, but what thou most esteemest? for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are as they are most esteemed of. As wee
say of jewels, the worth of them is according to
mens fancies, according as they are esteemed, so
it is with every mans treasure; One makes this
thing his treasure, another that. Now (I say)
consider what thou makest thy treasure, and
you shall know what your treasure is, by these
markes.</p>
            <p>1 A man layes up his treasure in the safest
place. Then if Christ be thy treasure, thou wilt
lay him up in the innermost parts of thy heart,
he shall not dwell in thy tongue, he shall bee laid
up in the closer of thy heart; hee shall not dwell
in thy outward man, in thy understanding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but hee shall bee laid up in thy inward part;
(that is) he shall bee pitched upon the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15587:8"/>
of thy heart, and there hee shall rest, there
thou wilt entertaine him.</p>
            <p>2 Againe, what a mans treasure is that hee
keepes with his greatest care, with the greatest
warinesse and solicitude. So wilt thou the Lord
Iesus, when once thou layst him up in thy heart;
thou wilt not be carefull for any thing, so much
as to keepe him safe; that is, to keepe the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his favour safe, to keepe him neere
thee, and thy selfe neere unto him; thy minde
will be more carefull of this, more than of all
things else: Thou wilt then take heede of all
things that may cause a distance betweene thee
and him; thou wilt then take heede of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may loose him, of whatsoever may make
a separation betweene the Lord and thee; thou
wilt be more carefull for this, than any man is
to keepe his wealth, or to keepe whatsoever it is
that he makes his Treasure.</p>
            <p>3 Againe, whatsoever is thy treasure that
thou wilt most esteeme, thou wilt set it at the
highest rate above all things else. Before a man
is in Christ there are many other things, which
in truth, (howsoever hee pretend something
else) hee prizeth at a higher rate than Christ;
Worldly vanities before hee is in Christ, seeme
great things to him; but when he is in him once,
he lookes upon them with another eye. My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
you know there was a time when<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> 
               <hi>God
looked upon the creatures, and they were exceeding
good,</hi> even all that are in the world; those things
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15587:8"/>
that men magnifie so much, I say, there was a
time when they were exceeding good: but
sinne hath blowed upon them, it hath blasted the
beauty and vigour of them, so that now when
the Lord lookes upon them, this is the sentence
that is pronounced of them, you know, in <hi>Eccl.
2. They are all vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
if thou be able to looke on all these things
(even the best things the world hath) as things
being but meere vanity; things wherein the
Lord sowed not mens happinesse, and therefore
thou canst not thinke to reape it there. If you
marke but the expression the wise man useth in
1. <hi>Eccles.</hi> saith he; <hi>All things under the Sun are but
vanity:</hi> now there is a reason conteined in these
words why they are but vanitie, for waters you
know they ascend not higher than the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and they carry not any thing higher than
their owne ascent; so all the creatures that bee
in the world, they <hi>be but under the Sunne,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot ascend to that happinesse
which is above the Sunne, nor carry you to that
condition which is above; for happinesse is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Sunne, laid up in Heaven. Therefore
saith he, all things under the Sunne if they bee
considered to make a man happy, they are but
vanity: Now consider whether thy judgement
be so of them or no, whether it bee conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> whether thou hast this
conceit of all other things, but the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conceit of Iesus Christ; whether thou canst
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15587:9"/>
thinke of him, as of one that is most excellent
and thy chiefest treasure, as one that is farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all these, as one upon whom thy heart is
pitched, as one in whom thy happinesse is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined.</p>
            <p>4 Againe, a mans treasure is that which he
will bee at any cost to get, hee will bee at any
paines to attaine it. It is that, on which his
heart is bestowed, and his affections are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
about. Is it so with thee when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to Christ Iesus? art thou willing to bee at
more cost and paines to get him, than any thing
besides? Is thy heart and affections more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him?<note n="i" place="margin">Math. 6. 21.</note> 
               <hi>For where a mans treasureis,
there his heart is.</hi> I doe not aske whether thou
bestowest more time upon the matters of grace,
than the duties of thy calling; but, whether
thou dost them with more intention, whether
thou bestowest thy time and paynes upon them,
as upon that which thou reckonest thy treasure,
farre exceeding all other?</p>
            <p>5 Fiftly, consider whether thou art willing
to part with any thing rather than with Christ
Iesus: for whatsoever is a mans treasure, you
know a man will part with any thing rather than
it. Is it so with thee? hadst thou rather part
with any thing than with Christ? than to part
with a good conscience; with the graces of the
Spirit, or with any thing that tends to holinesse
to build thee up further in the worke of Gods
grace? I say, consider whether thy heart bee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15587:9"/>
willing to part with any thing rather than with
Christ; for you shall find this, that Sathan and
the world will cheapen Christ, and when they
come to bidding, they will bid well. Consider
whether thy heart can give a peremptory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the world, and say thus; I will not sell
Christ, I will not sell a good conscience for any
thing; yea when Satan and the world bid high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and tell thee as he did Christ,<note n="k" place="margin">Math. 4. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that hee will
give thee all the riches, and all the glory in the
world, if you will part with Christ;</hi> consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy heart be ready to deny whatsoever hee
offers to thee, (as he will bee sure to offer that
which will be most sutable to thy disposition)
whether thy heart hath taken this resolution to
it selfe; Christ is my chiefest treasure, I will
part with all therefore, I will part with liberty,
with life, with goods, with credit, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
with profits, with whatsoever is neere
and deare unto me, rather than I will part with
the Lord Iesus. If this be thy hearts resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and minde, then Christ is thy chiefe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that's the second thing.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, consider what is thy cheife <hi>joy</hi> and
delight, what is thy life; (I put them together,
for that which is a mans chiefe joy indeed, is
his life.) For wee know life is nothing else but
that joy that the heart hath, whereby it is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
and fed as it were; for life is not to have
body and soule joyned together, to bee a living
man, in that sence we usually take life; for if that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15587:10"/>
were life, then those in hell should not bee said
to dye the death, for you know in hell there is a
conjunction of soule and body, and yet men are
not said to live there; for it is death which is the
punishment of sinne; and indeed you shall finde
that there is something a mans heart cleaves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
wherein hee rejoyceth, which is the same
with his life. Therefore looke as the Soule
enlivens the body, so the conjunction of the
present things which he reckons his joy, that is,
his life, enliven his soule, he cannot live without
them. Now if Christ bee thy chiefe joy, thou
wilt finde this, that thou canst not live without
him, as men are wont to say of their delights;
Such a man cannot live without such a thing;
so it is true of every man that hath taken Christ,
he is not able to live without him. This life is
no life, and therefore if there be but a separation
betweene thee and Christ, if a mans conscience
bee as it were clouded for a time, hee findes no
rest, hee doth as the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles;</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Cant. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>She
seekes from one place to another, and gives her selfe
no rest, till she finde him;</hi> and why? because it was
<hi>he whom her soule loved.</hi> So you shall finde, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
whatsoever it is that your soules love,
whatsoever you make your chiefe joy, you will
take no rest, but as farre as you love and enjoy
it. Therefore for the finding of this, whether
Christ be thy life and thy chiefe joy, consider
what it is that thy thoughts feed upon; every
wicked man, every man that is out of Christ,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15587:10"/>
there is something that his thoughts feed upon,
some things there are in contemplation of
which the soule so laceth it selfe; some pleasures
that are past, present, or to come; the very thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of these are the greatest ioy of his heart,
he roules them under his tongue; even as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that hath got some dainty bit out of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
presence, and eates it in a corner, so the
soule of a man hath out of Christ some secret,
some stolen, some unlawfull delights, that it
feeds upon and delights in: Consider therefore
well with thy selfe, what breakfast thy morning
thoughs have (that I may so say) what breake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
they have every morning, what is that <hi>Pabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi>
that food of thy soule, wherewith thy
thoughts and affections are nourished and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
from day to day; whether it be some
carnall pleasure, some reflecting on thy state, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy wealth, upon thy friends, or whether it
be on Christ. See (as <hi>David</hi> exercised it) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be they <hi>thy</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 42. 8.</note> 
               <hi>songs in the night time?</hi> All car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men have something past whereby they
comfort themselves, something present where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they cheare up their hearts, something to
come, something in hope. So every man that
is in Christ, hee hath the comforts of the spirit,
the meditation of the priviledges that he hath in
Christ, the hope of Gods favour; These are his
appointed food, these are the things that his
soule feedes on in secret; yea the very workes
that he doth, that seemes to be the hardest part
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15587:11"/>
of a Christians life, the very workes that hee
doth in serving the Lord from day to day,
even that is his meate and his drinke; that
is, it is as sweet and acceptable to his soule, as
meate and drinke is to the hunger and thirst of
his body: Now consider with thy selfe whether
it be so with thee; whether that which is thy
continuall feast, without which thou canst not
live, bee Christ; or the assurance thou hast, that
he is thine and thou art his; whether it bee the
priviledges thou hast in him; and the things that
belong to the kingdome of God; See whether
these be thy life, the things without which thou
couldst not live; or whether it bee some thing
else, some stollen delights, some unlawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
some thing else that thy soule and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are set upon. This is the next thing by
which thou maiest try thy selfe whether thou
belong to Christ or no, to consider whether he
bee thy chiefe joy, whether thy soule bee most
filled and satisfyed with him. And this is the
third thing.</p>
            <p>4 The fourth is; to know whether he be thy
chiefe <hi>Refuge;</hi> If thou bee one that hath tooke
him and received him, I say, he is thy chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.
For every man hath some refuge, some
castle or other to which his soule retires in all
difficult and doubtfull cases, by reason of that
indigency; that insufficiency to which the nature
of man is subject. There is something that hee
must have to leane vnto, (marke it) for mankinde
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15587:11"/>
is like that generation which the Wiseman
speakes of: You know it is sayd of the
Connyes,<note n="n" place="margin">Prov. 30. 26.</note> 
               <hi>they are a generation not strong,</hi> and
what then, and <hi>therefore they have their burrowes
to hide themselves in.</hi> I say such is the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mankinde, he is a weake creature, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
not strong, therefore there is something
that he must leane to, something out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
some sufficiencie besides himselfe, some
strong hold, some refuge every man hath; I say
every man hath some refuge or other, whither
he thinkes his soule may goe, and there hee may
have succour in cases daungerous and in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Now consider what is thy refuge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy heart runnes in all such cases, to what
wing, to what strong hold: In dangerous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
you see every creature hath some refuge or
other, The Child runnes to his Mother. The
Chickens runne to the henne, The Fox to his
earth, the Connyes to their burrowes; so every
creature to their severall corners and recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
proper to them: I say so it is with every
man, so hath every one of you to whom I
speake, there is somewhat that is a secret refuge
to which your hearts fly. Now consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be Christ or somewhat else. A cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man (or rather a man of this word) he hath
wealth for his strong hold, in which his heart
comforts it selfe; well, saith he, what change of
time soever come, yet I have an estate to hold
me up; and when he is ill spoken of abroad, yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15587:12"/>
hee applaudes himselfe with that hee hath at
home; The Courtiers, they have the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that is their refuge wherein they comfort
themselues; Those that are given to Company
they haue good fellowes, such as they, that are
their companions, and so long as they speake
well of them, they care not who speake ill of
them; Some haue a refuge of this kind, some of
another, every man hath his refuge. If you will
looke into the Scriptures, you shall see <hi>Davids</hi>
refuge, in any distresse, vpon any occasion; At
<note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ziglag he comforteth himselfe in the Lord,</hi> his hart
did fly to him, as the chickens fly to the henne,
there he comforted himselfe, there he shrowded
himselfe, there he encouraged himselfe in the
Lord. When he fled from his sonne <hi>Absolon,</hi> was
not the Lord his refuge? <hi>Yet</hi> (saith hee) <hi>Hee is my
buckler and my strong hold,</hi> Psalm 3, which was
made vpon that occasion. What was <hi>Iacobs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
when he fled from his brother <hi>Esau?</hi> Did
not hee goe to the Lord, and seeke to him by
Prayer?<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 32. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Lord thou hast said thou wilt doe me good,</hi>
now I fly vnto thee, I beseech thee performe thy
promise, thou art my refuge. Consider others
now, what was their refuge: <hi>Iudas,</hi> when hee had
betrayed his Maister Christ, and his conscience
was vpon him for it, hee goes to the high priests
and brings the silver to them, why, saith he, you
set me a worke, you are the authors of it, and I
hope to find some comfort from you; you see he
found little comfort in his mind, yet that was his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15587:12"/>
refuge. The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> when they
were distressed, they fled to <hi>Egypt</hi> and to <hi>Ashur,</hi>
to this or that helpe, which (the Lord said) were
broken reeds to them, but yet that was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:
This is the manner of every man being out
of Christ, of every unregenerate man, that is in
his naturall estate, some refuge he hath; friends,
or wealth, or credit, or the favour of the Prince,
something or other it is: and if he bee destitute
and have no refuge (as sometimes it so falls out)
then his heart is shaken as the leaves of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
Their<note n="q" place="margin">Isaiah 7. 2.</note> 
               <hi>hearts were shaken even for feare of the
king</hi> of <hi>Aram, as the leaves are shaken in the forrest;</hi>
and why? because they knew not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves: they had no refuge to fly to:
So you see it was with <hi>Belshazars</hi> heart; so <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi>
and so <hi>Saul,</hi> when he sees that he must dye
the next day, and that there was no refuge for
him: then I say their hearts sanke and dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them: And now consider how it is with thee,
what is the refuge to which thy heart flyeth,
and which thy heart makes most account of, (for
every man thinkes with himselfe, change of time
may come, and what shall bee my comfort, what
shall be my strong hold at that time.) Dost thou
flye to Iesus Christ? is hee thy succour when
thy heart is dejected at any time and faints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee? from which fountaine dost thou fetch
thy comfort? Dost thou fly to Christ, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thy selfe in him, when thou art in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
case, that concernes thee as much as thy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15587:13"/>
life? whither dost thou goe for counsell and
direction? is it to Christ, to beseech him to
guide thee, and direct thee, when thou art pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hard? whither doth thy heart goe for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and for helpe to keepe thy selfe safe? Is it
to Christ, or to somewhat else? My beloved,
I assure you this, that a carnall man that is not
in Christ, in these times of distresse knowes not
whither to goe, hee dares not goe to Christ, for
he feares that it shall be asked him, vpon what
acquaintance? for he hath been a stranger to the
Lord, he was never acquainted with him: but a
carnall man that is out of Christ, hee goes to
his muses, he goes to his farmes, he goes to his
bushes, as the hunted hare was wont to doe, to
goe to the places that she used when she lived
quiet, thither shee flyes when she knowes not
how to escape: so in that fashion it is with men,
looke what things they were wont, to which
their hearts had recourse in time of prosperitie,
and what their haunts haue beene; to those bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
they fly: But alas! they are but bushes, such
as will not defend them. But now the Christian
on the other side, the muse, the farme as it were
(it is but to expresse it to you) that his soule is
acquainted with, the strong hold that hee was
wont to fly vnto, upon every severall evill, upon
every ordinary doubt, vpon every deiection,
discouragement and fainting of heart; he was
wont to fly to Christ, and there he was wont to
find comfort, and thither hee goes in time of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15587:13"/>
greatest difficulty in the day of death, and there
hee finds comfort. Consider if hee bee thy
chiefe refuge, for if thy heart hath taken him as
he is thy chiefe excellency, thy chiefe joy, thy
chiefe treasure; so he will be thy chiefest refuge,
yea when all things else are taken away, yet
that cover remaines safe: suppose thou be in
prison, suppose thy credit be taken away, (I
meane) thy worldly credit, (for the other credit
cannot be taken away from any man that hath
Christ,) suppose thy life be taken away, suppose
thou bee stript of all that thou hast; yet thou
hast Christ for thy chiefe refuge, and thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
so, and thy heart is satisfyed with it. As
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, when hee was a prisoner, when he
was naked, when he was destitute, when he
was stript of all, yet (saith he<note n="r" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I know whom I haue
trusted;</hi> As if he should say, yet I haue him safe,
yet my cover is over my head, yet I am safe in
my castle, I haue chosen him, I haue him in
death, yea then Christ he is advantage, he is a
cover, a castle, and a refuge.</p>
            <p>5 Last of all: consider whom thou settest up
for thy chiefest <hi>Commaunder,</hi> who it is to whom
thou givest the chiefe command in thine heart.
You will say how shall I know that? Why (my
beloved) he whom a man feareth most,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
most,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that is, he whose friendship above all
others he would least loose, and whose dislike
and separation he doth most feare, certainly he
will bee most obedient to him, he will be most
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15587:14"/>
observant of him. Art thou so to Christ? take
all the things in the world, if thou set vp him, as
him whom thou most fearest and lovest, thou
wilt most obey him: So againe, he whom thou
thinkest can doe thee the greatest good, and the
greatest hurt, him thou wilt most obey; if thou
thinkest in good earnest that Christ is able to
doe it, certainly then thou wilt most obey him.
As for example, if thou looke to any man in the
world, a man that is out of Christ, he thinkes
that the favour or the wealth of the King, can
doe him more good and more hurt, than the
favour, or the losse of the favour of Christ; He
thinkes that wealth, or credit, or something
else, (many things there are that hee thinkes)
can doe him more good and more hurt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee more respects their command, than
the command of Christ; but a man that sets vp
him for his chiefe <hi>Commander,</hi> hee regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else when it comes to crosse it, when it
comes to thwart any command of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee saith thus to himselfe in his heart in
secret: It is the Lord that can do the greatest
good, and the greatest hurt, therefore I care for
no more. So <hi>Naboth</hi> he cared not for <hi>Ahabs</hi>
wrath. So<note n="s" place="margin">Hest. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Mordecay</hi> cared not for <hi>Hamans</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:
so did the Apostles, they cared not for
the High Priests, nor what they could doe, <hi>Acts</hi>
4. So did the 3 children (as you call them) <hi>they</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>cared not for the fiery furnace</hi> of <hi>Nabucadnezar,</hi>
nor for all that hee was able to doe; and why?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15587:14"/>
because they thought that Christ, that God was
able to doe them more hurt, and more good.
Now take any Commander in the world, when
you regard not the punishment, nor the reward
that he is able to inflict or to give you, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is gone; now when you set vp Christ,
and thinke so of Christ, you are ready to obey
him, &amp; obey him rather than any other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider with thy selfe this, and consider
seriously; aske thy heart the question, what is
that thou settest vp to be thy chiefest Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
For there are three great Commanders in
the world, that divide all mankinde betweene
them almost. And that is wealth, and estate;
worldly credit and honour, to liue in esteeme;
pleasures, and delight; Now thinke with thy
selfe when any of these three great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
come with any command, contrary to
that which Christ commands, thinke with thy
selfe what thou wilt doe in such a case, what
wast thou wont to doe, looke to past experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
looke backe to thy former wayes, see
what thou wast wont to doe: thinke with thy
selfe when such a Command comes, what thy
heart reasons vpon; if concupiscence, if a strong
lust, if a strong impetuous desire come, and bid
thee to doe something, which is contrary to
that which Christ would haue thee to do, what
art thou ready to doe in such a case? If thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
the maintenance of thy estate, thy liberty,
thy wealth, thy convenience in this world come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15587:15"/>
and command thee to doe one thing, and thy
conscience (which is Christs vicegerent) come
in his stead, and command thee another thing,
what art thou ready to doe in that case? for
when thy credit, thy honour, and reputation,
thy vaine glory shall come and bid thee doe one
thing, and Christ shall bid thee doe another,
what is thy resolution, what art thou wont to
doe? By this thou shalt know whether thou set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
vp Christ, as the chiefe Commander in thy
heart or no, whether thou givest him thy chiefe
throne, whether thou exaltest him for God
in thy heart; you know when you exalt him
for God, every thing then yeelds, if in truth hee
be set vp for God in thy heart: Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what it is that thy heart sets highest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou exaltest him most, whether (when
any of these threatning, crying commands
come) thou canst give them an absolute deayall,
and say with thy selfe, I will not obey you; and
if they threaten imprisonment, or disgrace, and
losse of life, and if I doe not obey such a lust, I
shall be wrung and pincht for it, I shall lose such
delights: well, I am resolved to beare all this:
on the other side, when they shall come with
faire proffers, you shall haue this honour, and
this advancement, and this convenience. If thy
heart can say now, I will haue none of you, for
I see it is a command contrary to his that is
aboue, whom I haue set vp for my chiefe
Commander, whom I resolue to obey whom I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15587:15"/>
take to be greater than all the friendship in the
world, than all the profits, pleasures, and credits
in the world; I say thus examine the selfe what
thy heart is toward Christ, what it is to his
command; and (let mee touch that by the way)
thou must also shew thy obedience to Christ,
in thy obedience to others; My beloved there
are indifferent things, that are in themselves
not of moment one way or other whether wee
doe them or not do them, and though the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them in themselues be nothing, yet
when it shall be of contempt and neglect of
those that are set in superiour place over you,
in such a case you ought not to doe it: this is a
rule, and a true rule in divinity, that indifferent
things may be omitted except in two cases, in
case of scandall, and in case of neglect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of authority: therefore when there is
neglect, when men shew contempt, for that case
it is to be done, though for the other it is not
to be done. This I touch but by the way, that
you may consider it in your particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Now my beloved, you see these five things,
by which you may know if you have tooke
Christ, or no: yee know when a man comes to
examine himselfe whether he be a fit man, a man
that hath any right to come to the Lords table,
hee must consider whether hee bee in Christ,
otherwise he hath nothing to doe either with
this priviledge, or with any other. Now to bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15587:16"/>
in Christ, there must (as I said) goe a double
act, there must be one on thy owne side, there
must be one act on thy part to take him; and
there must be an act on his part, there goes out
a strength and a vertue from him by which hee
takes thee and comprehends thee: The time is
past, and I cannot proced further, onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this that hath beene said to you, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
your selves by it whether you be in the
truth, whether you make Christ your chiefe
<hi>Excellencie,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Treasure,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Ioy,</hi>
your chiefe <hi>Refuge,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Commander;</hi> if
thou finde that thou hast done this, if thou finde
thy heart wrought to such an act as this, to take
Christ in such a manner, then thou hast Christ,
thou art in him, then thou hast a right in him,
and maist come with comfort: but if thou have
it not, then I must charge every one of you in
the name of Christ Iesus (in whose authority
we come) that you meddle not with such holy
mysteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Beloued you know what I haue
often told you, there is a necessity layd on men
to come to the Sacrament: you know he that
neglected the<note n="v" place="margin">Levit. 23. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Passover was to be cut off from the
people.</hi> It was a very great sinne: so it was to
omit the Sacrament: you haue diverse Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
every Tearme, and if your businesse hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you from one, you may come to another;
yea there is a necessity lyes vpon you to come,
but yet we must giue you a double charge, one
that you omit it not, and another that you come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15587:16"/>
not hither unlesse you be in Christ; what hast
thou to doe that art a profane person, thou hast
nothing to doe with Christ thou that art yet a
stranger to him, that thou shouldest thrust in to
the Lords table; thou ought'st not to doe it, if
thou dost,<note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note> 
               <hi>thou eatest and drinkest thy owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
instead of thy salvation.</p>

         <div n="2" type="sermon">
            <head>The Second Sermon.</head>
            <p>AND so now wee come to the Vse,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and
that is, that there is an Act of Christ to
make an union betwixt vs, that we may be his,
and he ours: there is an act of his, that is, there
is a certaine power or vertue comes from him,
even as there doth from the Load-stone to the
iron, that drawes thee to him; there goes out a
vertue and power from him as to the woman
that touched the hemme of his garment, that
healed her bloody issue, such a power goes out
from Christ to every man, that is in him. And
as you must examine it by your owne act, so in
the second place you are to examine it by this;
consider whether there hath gone out any such
power from Christ to take &amp; comprehend thee:
For you must know this, that when once we are
in Christ, then there goes forth an effectuall
almighty power from him, which doth not
make a little light alteration on the superficies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15587:17"/>
of the heart, but it alters the very frame of it,
it turnes the very rudder of the heart, so that a
mans course is to a quite contrary point of the
compasse; it is such an alteration as doth breed
in vs, not some good conception onely of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and desires which many have, which when
they come to the birth, there is no strength to
bring them forth: but he gives to vs a power
and strength to performe them: That is, hee
doth not put vpon us a washy colour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but hee dyeth us in graine with grace
and holinesse. And therefore consider whether
thou hast found any experience of such a power
going out from Christ to thy heart; This my
beloved, differs from common graces, from the
common forme of godlinesse which is in the
world, as much as the life differs from the
picture, or the substance from the shadow; as a
through performance differs from a proffer, or
an offer: or as that which hath sinewes and
vigour, differs from that which is weake and
powerles. Therfore this power of Christ which
hee puts forth and diffuseth into the heart of
euery man that is in him, is called the <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
And the<note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Kingdome of</hi> Christ <hi>is not in word, but in
power:</hi> That is, when once he rules but as a King,
hee exerciseth a kingdome there, and he saith
not onely to us; I will haue such a thing done,
they are not weake and powerlesse commands
that he giues to the heart of a man that he dwels
in; but saith he, <hi>The Kingdome of God is not in word
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15587:17"/>
but in power;</hi> that is, there goes an efficacie with
those commands, there goes a great strength
with them, that brings every thought, and every
rebellious affection into subiection to it; and
therefore consider I say, if thou wouldest have
these vertues, whether thou be in Christ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any such power hath gone out from Christ
to thy heart.</p>
            <p>But you will say, what is this power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
and in what manner is it infused into the
heart of man, for this seemes to be a narration of
a thing a farre off?</p>
            <p>My beloved, we will explaine it as well as we<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
can to you; even as you see an Artificer working
with his instrument, there goes a certaine vertue
out from that art which is in his minde, and
guides the instrument to make this or that, the
which without it could not be done, when hee
makes any artificiall thing, as a knife, or a sword;
or when the Potter fashions the port, his hand
is set on worke, and there is a certaine invisible
passage, a certaine secret influence of the art that
goes along with his hand, that brings forth such
an artificiall thing; or even as you see the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
move; a man moving his arme, or his hand,
or any part of his body, there goes a certaine
vertue from his will, a certaine secret power,
efficacy, and command that stirres them this
way or that way; the thing we see not, yet we
see it in effect, or as you see it in the creature,
you see the creatures that God hath made, they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15587:18"/>
have all the severall instincts, by which they are
instigated to doe this or that; you see the birds
are instigated to make their nests of such a fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at such a season; so every creature accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his severall kinde. There goes out from
God who is the authour of nature to these
workes of nature, a certaine vertue that puts
them on, and instigates them to this or that:
and as you see an arrow that is shot by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
there goes a vertue together with it, that
directs it just to such a marke, so farre, and no
further. So after this manner there comes a
power from Christ to his members; as soone
as a man is in him, there comes such a secret
divine, unexpressable efficacy that workes vpon
the heart of him in whom he dwells. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the conjunction between him and vs, is
compared to that which is betweene the soule
and the body, that acts and stirres vs to and fro,
according to its will and pleasure: such an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
shalt thou find, if thou belong vnto him,
and therefore consider if there bee such a thing
in thee or no.</p>
            <p>But you will say, to what purpose is this effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
and what doth it in my heart when it
comes there?</p>
            <p>Why, I will tell thee what it doth; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
in plaine termes 2. Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Whosoever
is in Christ is made a new creature;</hi> That is the
worke it effects; it is such a power and efficacy
as makes thee a new creature; That is, It breakes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15587:18"/>
in peeces the old building, it quite takes away
the first print; As when a man comes to make a
new stampe, the first must bee removed. So
that this efficacy that goes out from Christ, it
hath a double vertue in thy soule, to weare out
the old stampe, to breed a death of the old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of the old man, to ruine and breake downe
the old building, and to set vp a new one; and
that the scripture calls a new creature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider with thy selfe, whether thou find
such a vertue as hath put thy heart into such a
new frame, as hath moulded it all together, and
hath put it into another fashion than it was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether all in thee be new.</p>
            <p>You will say, this is strange, must all be new?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>My beloved,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> you know the words they are
cleare;<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>old things are passed away, all things are
becom new.</hi> (In the same place which I quoted
before) that as the command was in the offering
of the Passover, not a jot of old leaven, but we
must part with it; Now this is the nature of
leaven, It is alwayes purging out, and it will be
purging out while we are here, only the efficacy
and strength thereof remaines not; Then thinke
with thy selfe, is all new in me? looke what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
disposition I haue had: looke what naturall
lusts and desires I haue had, see what acts I was
wont to doe, what old haunts and customes I
haue had, looke what old company I kept, what
old courses I tooke, what my tract hath beene;
is all this altered and every thing become new?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15587:19"/>
(for, saith he, it must <hi>be</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>a new creature,</hi> a new
nature:) That is, it is not enough for a man to
haue a new course for a fit, to haue new purposes
and a new change that comes like flashes, I say,
that is not enough; you may haue many new
thinges in you, that may be in old hearts,<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 9. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>like
peeces of new cloath in old garments,</hi> that will doe
thee no good at all; the Lord regards not that:
<hi>like new wine in old vessells,</hi> so it is where there
are some new things, that are good things in
themselves; in a carnall and old heart, they are
not fit for the heart, and therefore they never
stay long there: So saith the text, <hi>Put a new peece
into an old garment, and it makes the rent greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all must be new; I say there must
be a new nature, that these new things may be
there: even as the severall creatures are in their
severall elements, as the elements are in their
owne place, as the plants are in their proper
soyle, as the branches are vpon their own roote.
For then they florish, then they hold out, then
they continue; Therefore see whether this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
this efficacy, this vertue hath gone out
from Christ into thy heart; whether it hath not
only renewed all in thee, but also hath given thee
a new nature; That is, whether it hath wrought
such a change in thee, that all the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
and new obedience, become in a measure
naturall to thee, so that thou canst doe them
cheerefully, even as we heare, and see, and doe
naturall actions, and that thou dost them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15587:19"/>
wearinesse: for you know, things that are
naturall wee are not weary of them; And so
thou wilt doe them constantly, for what is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
stayes and abides by us, that it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growes
and out-wearies what ever is in us beside;
Now hath there a vertue gone out from Christ,
that hath wrought all this in you, that hath made
all new, hath not only done so, but hath made it
naturall to thee? But you will say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> must it needs
be so, cannot Christ take and comprehend mee,
but there must bee this wonderfull change
wrought, who can bee saved then? I haue then
but little hope, when I am vpon my death bed,
and then shall looke vpon my old nature, and
find no such worke as this wrought vpon me.
Beloved, I beseech you consider this,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that there
is a necessity of it: It is so, and it must bee so, and
except you have it, you cannot be saved; you see
the words in the Scriptures are most cleare,
<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever is in Christ is a new creature:</hi> Doe
but consider whether it be so or no, there must
be withall<note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>a new heaven and a new earth;</hi> You
see that was the great promise that was to bee
fulfilled in our times of the <hi>Gospell:</hi> was it not a
new preisthood, was it not a new covenant, hath
not the Lord said, there must bee <hi>a new heauen
and a new earth,</hi> That is, new graces from heaven,
and a new company of men wrought on, and
changed by those graces? Shall old <hi>Adam,</hi> those
that are borne of him, shall they receiue a power
from him, to make them like to him, to carry
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15587:20"/>
his Image, to bee corrupt, and carnall, and sinfull
as hee is: And doe you not thinke that the New
<hi>Adam,</hi> the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> shall haue as much
efficacy in him to make those new creatures, that
are in him, that come to him? Certainly there is
as much power, life, and vigor in the new
<hi>Adam,</hi> to change every man that is in him, that
comes to him, and to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> new creatures, as
in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> to make them like him: Besides,
hath not Christ said plainely, I came not into the
world to saue soules only, that is not my busines
alone (though that was a great part of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and errand for which he came into the
world) but (saith he)<note n="f" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I came to purifie a people to
my selfe, zealous of good workes:</hi> in the 2 <hi>Tit.</hi>
Now if that were the end of Christs comming,
dost thou thinke that hee will loose his end?
And therefore its impossible, that any man
should be saved, or haue part in Christ, and that
he should be in Christ and Christ in him, except
his heart be purified so, as to be zealous of good
workes. If Christ dwell in thy heart, thou mayst
easily know it; for dost thou thinke, that Christ
will dwell in a foule and uncleane place? hath
he not<note n="g" place="margin">Hab. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>pure eyes?</hi> And therefore it is certaine
wheresoever he dwells, that place must be <hi>a fit
Temple for him to dwell in;</hi> Wherefore of necessity
he must cleanse thy heart, he must fashion it,
and keepe it pure, and cleane, and sweet, so as it
may be a fit Temple for him and his Spirit to
dwell and delight in. Besides, doth he not looke
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15587:20"/>
to his glory in all those that belong to him?
hee hath many eyes to looke upon them as it
were, there are<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>many spectators men and Angells,</hi>
to see what they are, and how they behaue
themselues: If hee should haue a company of
men to belong unto him that are carnall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and worldly minded, that haue crooked
wayes like other men, would this bee for his
honour? would it not bee said, Like men, like
Master? would it not reflect upon him? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it would; and therefore the Lord so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it, that those whom he hath redeemed,
<note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>should bee holy in all maner of conversation:</hi> Saith
hee, you <hi>must be as I am,</hi> else it will bee for my
dishonour, <hi>As I am holy, so every one of you must
be holy, in all manner of conversation;</hi> Therefore
let no man deceiue himselfe, to thinke he can
goe away and yet be in Christ, and be saved
through Christ and the mercies of God in
Christ, when there goes out no such vertue
and power from Christ to change him, to
worke on him, to alter him, to make him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature; And therefore I beseech you in
the examining of this, (for its a matter of great
moment) to consider with your selues, if this be
wrought in you or no; whether you finde any
experiment &amp; effect of this mighty power, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
and vertue: and let mee bring you a little
to particulars. Hath there gone out a vertue from
him to enable thee to beleeue? There is a faith
required in the <hi>Deity,</hi> there is a faith required
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15587:21"/>
in the <hi>Deity,</hi> there is a faith required in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi>
of God, there is a faith required in the
<hi>providence</hi> of God, to thinke that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
thing is ordered by it; There is also a faith
in all the <hi>threatnings</hi> of God: Now for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of propounding; when the Scripture comes
to propound any thing, it propounds it thus, and
no more: as you see in <hi>Moses,</hi> he writes nothing,
but<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>In the beginning God made heaven and earth,</hi>
&amp;c. And so the Apostles write; Such a thing
was done,<note n="l" place="margin">Math. 1. Luke 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus Christ was borne of the Virgin
Mary; Thus and thus he did:</hi> Now when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
object is propounded, other writers what
they deliver or write is rationall; They use Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and arguments to convince men of those
things which they deliver; But when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sets downe any propositions of faith, it
doth but barely propound them, for there is the
Majesty of God and authority of God in them,
to confirme them.</p>
            <p>But now here you will demand,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> (the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being but nakedly laid downe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
what will enable a man to beleeve it?</p>
            <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that certainly there is a mighty
power that goes out from God &amp; from Christ,
that enables thee to beleeve with this efficacy,
that where the obiect is set before thee, there
goes out a power from him to worke faith in
thy heart, whereby thou truly beleevest it, and
so it appeares in thy life: we thinke we beleeve
those things, but our lives doe manifest the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15587:21"/>
namely, That there is not a powerfull
faith wrought in us; for all the errours of our
lives (though we observe them not) arise from
hence, that these Principles are not throughly
beleeved: if they were, it could not bee, that
there should bee such inconveniences in the
lives of men; Therefore consider if this faith be
wrought in thee, whether such a power hath
gone out, to worke such a faith, that hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thy whole course, as it will doe, if it bee
once wrought in thee, by the power of Christ:
So also consider, whether there hath a vertue
gone out from him to worke love in thy heart
to the Lord; for otherwise it is certaine that
there is no man in the world that is able to love
God, or to come neere him, for all love riseth
from <hi>Similitude,</hi> there must bee an agreement
and similitude betweene those two that love:
Now every man by nature is as contrary to
Gods pure nature, as fire is to water, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an almighty power to change his nature, and
to worke a particular affection of love in him,
he can never be able to love God: therefore its
the baptisme of the holy Ghost;<note n="m" place="margin">Math. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>I will baptize
you with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, with
the holy Ghost which is fire.<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>I will multiply
thy sorrowes and thy conceptions,</hi> That is, the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of thy conceptions. Now love is as fire
in the heart, and one fire must beget another;
And therefore you have it in the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,
<hi>Love is a thing that cannot be bought with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15587:22"/>
mountaines of gold and silver;</hi> yet if thou bee in
Christ, there goes out a vertue from him, that
stampes upon thy heart this holy affection, that
breedes in thee this holy fire of love, so that thy
heart cleaves to him, thou lovest him with as
true, with as genuine, as naturall, and as sensible
love, as thou lovest any friend; as thou lovest
any creature in the world. Consider if this bee
wrought in thee or no. And so for thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
there is also a power in it, consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any such vertue hath gone out from Christ,
to make the knowledge which thou hast, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>You will say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> what is that?</p>
            <p>That is,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> to bring on these truths which thy
heart assents unto, to bring them with that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and fulnesse of demonstration, that thou
shalt yeeld unto them, and practise them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy knowledge. Beloved, there is much
knowledge among us, but who practiseth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his knowledge?<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>We know God, but wee
glorifie him not as God;</hi> and the reason is, because
there hath not gone a power with that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to make it lively and effectuall, to passe
through all the faculties of the soule, and to
overrule them; for if there were such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it would alwayes draw affection and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
with it. So likewise consider, whether there
hath gone a power from him to mortifie thy
lusts?<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 5. 24</note> 
               <hi>Whosoever is in Christ hath crucified the flesh
with the affections and lusts,</hi> not to lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15587:22"/>
onely, but to mortifie and subdue them.
See likewise whether there hath a power gone
out from Christ, to helpe thee to overcome the
world,<note n="q" place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The lusts of thine eyes, the lusts of the flesh,
and the pride of life;</hi> for whosoever is in Christ
<hi>overcomes the world,</hi> and all that is in the world.
The world hath many things to worke upon us,
and to resist and oppose us: It hath persecutions,
it hath disgraces, it hath slanders and reproches,
which it casts upon holy men, and upon the holy
wayes of God. And the men that are actours in
this, are the divels factours, though they thinke
not so, as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> expresseth it;<note n="r" place="margin">Iames 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Their
tongues are set on fire of hell,</hi> to devise slanders
and false reports, and to fasten them upon holy
men, especially upon the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and so upon all the wayes of God: I say
they are the divels factours, though they thinke
not so: and those that beleeve them are the
devils receivers; the one hath the devill in his
tongue, the other in his eare. But the Lord hath
appointed this. This is one thing whereby the
world fights against the wayes of God, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
men and to hinder them, that they
might be stumbling blockes to them. So it was
with Christ, he<note n="s" place="margin">Luke 2. 34.</note> 
               <hi>was the falling of many in Israel</hi>
by reason of this; so was <hi>Paul,</hi> as a <hi>deceiver, and
yet true,</hi> &amp;c. Consider if thou hast this efficacy
put into thy heart, that thou art able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
this, that thou art able to overcome all
the offences, and persecutions, all the slaunders
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15587:23"/>
and reproaches that are cast upon the wayes of
God; and notwithstanding that, to think well of
them, and to walke in them, and practise them.
Likewise, as it hath these things on the one hand,
so it hath pleasures, preferments, glory, riches,
credit, and all things of that nature on the other;
art thou able to overcome all these? So to shut
up this point &amp; prosecute it no further, thus you
shall know whether you be in Christ: for that is
the point; <hi>We have assurance in him, that if wee
aske any thing, wee shall be heard,</hi> but first we must
be in him; now to know whether we be in him
(as you haue heard) there must be an act of ours,
and secondly an act of his, which is this power
that goes out from him, to change, to take and
comprehend us. So much for the first thing.</p>
            <p>Now for the second; if a man will apply or
take to himselfe the priviledges we haue by
Christ, as this particular priviledge of being
heard in our prayers, of coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any other; know this, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be in Christ only, but there must be a
certaine qualification, a certaine immediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioning,
and preparation of the heart, or else
though thou haue a right to the priviledges,
though they belong to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet thou art suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the use, benefit, and comfort of them.
And this is considered in these Five things. (I
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will but name them very briefely.) First, when a
man comes to receiue the Sacrament, it's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him to be in Christ, no nor when hee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15587:23"/>
is come to do some other duties, but moreover
there must be this also; those graces thou hast,
this change, this new creature that is wrought
in thee, which is but a heape of particular graces,
these must be <hi>acted and stirred up</hi> upon such an
occasion: It is true, no man ought to come except
hee haue the graces of Gods Spirit wrought in
his heart, that they may lye there in the habits,
that they may be in the heart as fire raked in the
ashes. But if a man will come to receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and suffer these habits, these graces he
hath to lie still there, he comes not as a worthy
receiuer; (there are indeed degrees of unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
he comes not as a worthy receiuet except
hee stirre them up, except they be acted at that
very time: As for example; when we come to
receiue the Sacrament, wee ought then to haue
an especiall humiliation and sorrow for our
sinnes; wee ought then to haue an especiall love
to Iesus Christ; we ought then to haue a spciall
reioycing in him, and in all the Priviledges we
haue by him; wee ought then to haue a speciall
loue to our brethern, the men with whom wee
converse, and among whom wee live: now if a
man come and receiue, and do not stirre up and
act these graces, he receiues unworthily, and my
ground for it, is this; you see in the feast of
<hi>Reconciliation,</hi> the Tenth day of the Seventh
moneth, the Lord tels them there, <hi>you shall come,
and you shall keepe it, and you shall not doe worke, &amp;c.</hi>
But is this enough? no, <hi>he that doth not actually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15587:24"/>
afflict his soule</hi> (saith he) <hi>that day, he shal be cut off
from his people, Levit.</hi> 23. 27. That is, though they<note place="margin">Levit. 23. 27, 28, 29, 30.</note>
had a habituall disposition, and their hearts were
prepared to sorrow for their sinnes, and to take
them to heart and bewaile them, this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
(saith hee) at this time you must afflict
your soules, that is, there must be a stirring up
of that sorrow: So likewise you finde this in the
feasts, in more places than one, that when they
come to keepe the feasts, at that time they shall
eate and drinke, and refresh themselues, but in
any case rejoyce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. I will
not stand to repeate the places: That is, it's not
enough for you to haue thankfull hearts, to have
hearts prepared for these thinges in the habit,
but you must then rejoyce, for it is the season
of it, (for every<note n="t" place="margin">Eccles. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>thing is good in it's season</hi>) and
the Lord reqvires it at such a time. Therefore
thus thinke with thy selfe, whensoever thou
comest to receiue the Sacrament, this is the
time that the graces I have, the habituall graces,
must be new pointed as it were, they must be
new whetted, new scowred, that they may be
bright and shining upon such an occasion, when
the Lord calls for it, you must then qvicken
them, and stirre them up, that they may be all
acted in your hearts.</p>
            <p>And this is one thing, that it's not enough for
a man to be in Christ, to take the priviledges
that belong to him, but there is a certaine qva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
reqvired that must be done at that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15587:24"/>
time, when the Covenant is renewed And this
is one, to have the graces thus acted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there must be a new <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
For the Saints, those that are within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
those that are regenerate men, (you must
marke it well, for it's a point of much use) when
they commit sinnes aganst God, the guilt of
their sinnes is retained: though they are within
the covenant, and are not cut off from Christ,
but are in him; yet (I say) when they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the guilt of their sinne continues, and is
continued till they be reconciled and renewed
by faith and repentance; as you see it was with
<hi>David: Nathan</hi> would not have said when he
came to him,<note n="u" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> if there
had not beene a new thing, if there had not
beene a thing done at that time; and therefore it
intimates so much, that before his sinne was not
forgiven: that is, the Lord was angry with him.
You must know therefore this, that when a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man sinnes, there is onely a particular
guilt; the universall guilt of sinnes returnes not,
(for that would cut him quite off, that would put
him absolutely into the state of damnation,) but
it's a particular guilt, for every particular sinne;
that is, even as a father is pleased well with his
son, and knowes him to be his sonne, he is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to him as to his sonne, yet hee hath done
such a particular action that hath offended him,
and for that particular offence, he withdrawes
himselfe from him, hee carries not himselfe to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15587:25"/>
him as he was wont to doe, being offended with
him for such a fault; now till the sonne hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
and humbled himselfe for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
action, though the father have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
gifts to bestow on him, yet hee shall have
none of them, till hee hath reconciled himselfe;
So thinke with thy selfe (if any sinne lye in the
way) when thou commest to partake of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to receive the Sacrament, or when thou
commest to call on God for any particular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or to have any request granted; thinke then
with thy selfe, such a sinne I committed, I must
humble my selfe for it, I must labour to make
reconciliation, labour to have this taken away,
that my Father may bee reconcilied to mee;
then come and take the priviledge, for now it
belongs unto me; therefore there is a necessity
of renewing our repentance and reconciliation
most exactly, and to take a very particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of our wayes when wee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament, or when we draw neere to
God upon such speciall occasions, least our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(though he be a Father to us) have some
particular quarrell against us; for even he whom
we call Father, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17, iudgeth every man</hi>
(even his owne sonnes) <hi>without respect of persons;</hi>
that is, he will not beare any ill in them: thus you
see did he with <hi>Moses,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> and others,
and the like he doth with all the Saints. This is
the second qualification that is required before
you can have any part in any of the priviledges,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15587:25"/>
before you can attaine unto this assurance, to
aske and have; therefore it is not without use,
and that not in the Sacrament onely, but also in
that which we have to deliver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, suppose there be no particular sinne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
suppose the grace you have, be acted, when you
come to receive the Sacrament; yet there is a
third thing required, a third qualification that
must be found in the heart of him that will be a
worthy receiver, and that is, to observe well
<hi>what distance is growne</hi> betweene the Lord and
him ever since the time, that he hath in a more
particular manner beene reconciled to him.
This is another thing than what wee named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to consider what rust hath growne upon his
soule, what soyle his heart hath contracted, by
conversing in the world, and by medling with
worldly and earthly things; for the soule ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
soyle with medling with them, even as the
hands doe; now thou must thinke with thy selfe,
when thou commest to the Lord, and drawest
neere to him in this, or any other duty, thou
must recover that distance againe, and bring thy
heart neerer to the Lord, thou must draw neerer
to him, thou must get thy heart to a more close,
and neere, and inward conjunction with him;
thou must labour to have that hardnesse that
thou hast contracted (as it will be in a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of time) thou must labour I say, to
have that tooke away and remooved; to have
thy heart softened, to have the rust rubbed off;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15587:26"/>
thou must labour to have all these things done;
For thou must know this, That though there be
not a particular sinne committed, yet as we see,
the outward man is subject to a wasting, though
there be no wounds, though there bee no sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
though a man be in perfect health, and all
is well with him, and hee observe all the rules of
dyet, yet (I say) you see the outward man is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to wasting, to fainting, to weakenesse, and
decay; and therefore there must be a renewing
of dyet, and of strength, or else it cannot bee
able to hold out: So it is with the inward man;
though there bee no particular sinne, though a
man did keepe some good course in the wayes
of godlynesse, without running out emenently
or evidently, yet he is subject to a secret decay,
so that sometimes hee must have some speciall
meate, some speciall feast, which the Lord hath
appointed for that purpose, (for he doth nothing
in vaine:) And if this Sacrament could bee spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that a man might keepe the strength of the
inward man without it, the Lord would not
have put you to this trouble; but he seeth it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and therefore he hath appointed it to be
received, and that often, that you might feed
upon the body and blood of Christ, that you
might eate his flesh and drinke his blood, and
gather new strength from it, that when there is
a decay of grace in your hearts, you may goe to
this Fountaine, and fill the Cisternes againe to
recover strength; For when a man comes to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15587:26"/>
Sacrament as hee ought, hee gathers a new
strength, as a man doth from a feast; his heart is
cheered up as it is with Flagons of wine, hee is
refreshed, his hunger and thirst is satisfied; That
is, the desires of his soule that long after Christ,
after righteousnesse, and assurance, are quickned
and refreshed. And this is the third thing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, besides all this; First the stirring up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of the graces, and the acting of the habits; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
making thy peace and reconciliation
with God, and remooving of any particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that is betwixt God and thee; Thirdly,
this scouring off the rust, this remooving the
distance betweene God and thee, the softning of
that hardnesse which thy heart hath contracted;
this recovering the strength that thou hast wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted;
There is besides all these a fourth thing
required, which is, that there be an <hi>Intention, a
particular increase of thy will,</hi> in taking Christ, of
thy desire to Christ, and of every grace that
knits thee and Christ together; For there are
certaine sementing graces, certaine glewing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that joyne Christ and thy soule together, as
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> these are the two maine graces;
there are a great traine of graces that follow
them, but these are the chiefe, and these I say
must bee intended: For what is the end of the
Sacrament? Is it not to knit the knot stronger
betweene Christ and us, to make the union
more full and perfect? is it not to increase our
willingnesse to take and receive Christ? for you
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15587:27"/>
know all the acts of the soule may be intended.
Put the case there be a resolved act in the heart
and soule of any man, whereby he saith thus
with himselfe: I am resolved to take Christ, and
to serve and love him for the time of my life,
yet this resolution of his, though it bee perfect
and sincere, may receive intention; when a man
is willing to doe to a thing truly, there may be
degrees added to that will; when there is light in
a roome (when thou bringest in more candles)
that light may be increased. so it may in this, so
may your faith &amp; love; (by faith I mean nothing,
but the resolution of the heart to take Christ;
I meane not the beleeving part, but the taking
part, the act of the will taking Christ, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him, which is nothing else but the choise of
the will that resolves to take him.) I doe but
touch this by the way, because it is a point I
have handled already at large; the thing I ayme
at is this; I say the glewing graces are these two;
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> whereby you thus take Christ for
your Lord and Saviour; Faith is like the part of
the compasse that goeth about and doth the
worke; and love is that cementing grace whereby
we are more knit unto the Lord; They have both
their office and their place; You know love is an
uniting affection, therefore this is the definition
of it, <hi>It is a desire of union with that it loves;</hi> Now
when thou comest to receive the Sacrament, or
to pray, or put up any speciall request, when thou
comest to have to do with God, to make use of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15587:27"/>
any priviledge thou hast in Christ, thy chiefe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
is to intend this faith &amp; love, at such a time
to draw thee neerer, to make the union perfect.</p>
            <p>You will say, how is this increased and how
is it intended?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Two wayes in the Sacrament, one
way is the very repetition, the very renewing
the covenant, the very doing it over againe, the
resolution of taking him, (for there is a mutuall
covenant, you know betweene Christ and us,) it
is confirmed to us in the Sacrament, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
his, and wee confirme ours, as the freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
betweene <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was increased
by the renewing of the covenant, or else why
was it repeated? They very repetition of the act
intends the habit, the habit is increased by the
repetition of the act, though it were no more;
so the renewing of the covenant exerciseth thy
faith, it sets a worke thy faith and thy loue, when
thou comest to receiue the Sacrament, the very
intention is increased: but this is not all, There
is another thing in the Sacrament that much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
it, and that is a thing I would have you
chiefely to take notice of; That is the very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
it selfe, the elements of bread and wine
delivered to thee, with the very words of the
minister,<note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Take and eate, this is my body, that was
broken for thee; Take and drinke, this is my blood,
that was shed, &amp;c.</hi> For when these words are
spoken to us, if wee did consider well of them,
and thinke thus with our selves; These words
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15587:28"/>
that the Lord him himselfe hath appointed the
Minister to speake (for therein is the force of
them that they are of the Lords own institution)
therefore the strength of every Sacrament lies
in the institution; That is a rule in Dininity; the
Papists themselues, who haue added fiue other
Sacraments, cannot deny, but that every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must haue an immediate institution from
Christ himselfe, even from his owne mouth, or
else there is no strength in it; so that even as it is
with all things that are symbolls of other things,
(as take markes in feilds that stand for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of severall mens rights; take counters that
stand for Thousands and Hundreds, the very
essence of these things stands in the very institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them;) So in the Sacrament, except these
words were from the Lords owne mouth that
delivered it, this very delivering of the bread and
wine, being a signe to you of the forgiuenes of
your sinnes, except the Lord had thus instituted
it, there had beene no force in it. I say consider,
they are words that the Minister speakes not in
an ordinary course, but he is appointed by the
Lord himselfe to speake them; and now when
these words make a new impression upon thy
heart, it addes an intention to thy faith and loue.
For example, (to make it a little more cleare to
you, that you may understand it distinctly.) The
Lord hath said this, he will forgive the sinnes of
all those that come unto him, hee will forgive
them that forsake their sinnes, and take Christ
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15587:28"/>
Iesus, and love and feare him for the time to
come; The Lord might have suffered it to goe
thus in generall, that he hath delivered it unto
you and no more; But hee thought good to goe
further and say thus to mankind: Its true, I have
said it, but I will not content my selfe with that,
but will adde certaine seales and symbolls, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
externall signes, that thou shalt see and
looke on; and I say to thee, this covenant haue I
made with thee, and when thou seest the bread
and wine delivered by the Minister, know this,
that the thing that thou seest is a witnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
thee and me: That as it was said by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
and <hi>Iacob</hi> when they made a covenant,<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 31. 48.</note> 
               <hi>This
stone be witnesse betweene us:</hi> And God said to
<note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 9. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Noah, when I looke upon the rainebowe, it shall bee
a signe that I will destroy the earth no more after this
manner;</hi> when the Lord hath said it and hath
appointed this outward Symboll that thine eyes
looke upon, I remember the covenant, and this
is a signe betweene us, this shall bind mee to it
and him likewise; Now when this is done anew,
(it may be every month) this is a wondrous great
mercy, this is a marvellous great helpe (if it be
rightly understood) to strengthen our faith.
Doth it not helpe us, when we see the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe
which the Lord hath appointed to put
him in mind of his covenant?<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 9. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>I will remember
my covenant, when I looke on the Bowe in the Cloud
it shall confirme me, and I will not breake my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to destroy the world with a flood;</hi> So this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15587:29"/>
of the Sacrament, when the Lord
lookes upon it, hee cannot but remember his
promise and his covenant, of pardoning our
sinnes; And when thou lookest on it, thou art
assured of it, for hee hath said it; it shall bee a
signe and a witnesse betweene us; Now I say that
new impression that these words, (thus contrived
and understood, and delivered by the minister)
make upon the heart, intends our faith and love;
as indeed it is a great matter to haue it spoken
to us by a Minister of the Gospell, sent from
Christ, from his owne mouth;<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Take and eat, this
is my body that was broken for you: and this is my
blood that was shed for you and for many, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes.</hi> This is the fourth qvalification
that is reqvired, that our faith and love bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and our union increased; that the will,
resolution, and purpose of taking Christ for our
Lord, receive more degrees; that so we may be
more fast and firmely united and knit to him;
which I say is done partly by the repetition
on both sides (for the very repetition doth it;)
and partly by a new impression that these words
(<hi>take, eat</hi> &amp;c) make on the soule. Now I adde
the last thing which is required, (still remember
the maine thing wee are upon, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for thee to be in Christ, but if thou wilt
bee a worthy receiver, thou must haue these
foure qualifications in thee, that I have named
already; Thou must reconcile thy selfe anew,
thou must rub off the rust from thy soule which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15587:29"/>
it hath gathered, Thou must recover the distance
that is growne betweene God and thee; Thou
must adde an intending and an increase, Thou
must adde more degrees to thy faith and love,
and after all these.)</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, this is also required (which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is much for our benefit and comfort) namely,
to put up thy request, when thou comest neere
to the Lord in the Sacrament: Now thou must
not only do this, but thou must also make some
use of the covenant, which the Lord hath made
with thee for his part, so that thou mayst thinke
this with thy selfe; When I come to receive the
Sacrament, I have but two workes to doe, one is
to recovenant with the Lord, and to renew my
repentance, and to set all eaven; and the other
is to remember the Lords covenant.</p>
            <p>You will say, what is the Covenant?</p>
            <p>It's a Covenant that consists of these three
things or points; <hi>Iustification,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> 
               <hi>I will forgive thy
sins; Sanctification,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ezech. 36. 26. 1 Cor. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I will make you new hearts, and
new spirits;</hi> and the third, <hi>all things are ours;</hi> that
is, I have made you heires of the world, heires
of all things, you have all the promises belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, that belong to this life, and that which
is to come; this is the Covenant which the Lord
hath made. Now thou art bound when thou
comest to receive the Sacrament, not onely to
remember this Covenant, <hi>Doe this</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in
remembrance of Mee,</hi> and not barely of mee, and
of my being crucified for thee, and of all the love
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15587:30"/>
that I have shewed unto thee, but also in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Covenant, and of those gracious
promises, which are the particulars of which
that Covenant is the summe: and therefore,
thus a man is to do. What? hath the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
mee this favour, that I may come to his
Table, I may come and renew the nuptials and
my covenant with him? Surely, then I will looke
about and consider what I want, what request I
shall put up unto him; for there is nothing that is
wanting, but it is within this Covenant; and thou
art to put up thy request in a speciall manner,
whatsoever it be, be it concerning things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to thy soule, to have a strong lust mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
to have thy hard heart softned, to have
some sin that lyes upon thy conscience forgiven,
and to have that forgivenesse assured to thee: be
it any thing that concernes thy particular estate,
if it be to be delivered from a potent enemy, or
whatsoever it be, put up thy request, and that
largely, open thy mouth wide, that is, make thy
request full, feare it not. Put the case (againe) it
be somewhat that doth not concerne thee, but
that it concerneth the Church abroad, or the
Church at home, it is a case that much concernes
any of these in the Church, put it up to him, and
put it up with confidence. For this is a marriage
day (as it were) it is the time when he reacheth
out his scepter (as you know the things I allude
to) and thou maist come to his presence: you
know, when<note n="e" place="margin">Ester. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Hester</hi> was admitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15587:30"/>
of the King, then said hee, What request
hast thou? when you are admitted to the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
and presence of the Lord, hee lookes for it,
he askes what request you have to put up to him?
and the promises are large enough: <hi>I will give it,
whatsoever it be, if you aske according to my will;</hi>
and therefore, do in this case as <hi>Moses</hi> used to
doe: you shall find when <hi>Moses</hi> drew neere unto
the Lord, when he was admitted into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and saw him face to face (for that was the
great priviledge <hi>Moses</hi> had) when there was any
speciall apparition of the Lord to him, <hi>Moses</hi>
makes this argument: (saith hee) It is a great
mercy that thou wouldest shew mee this, that
such a poore man as I am, should have this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
and give mee leave to make use of it:
<note n="f" place="margin">Exod, 33. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight,</hi> that is,
since thou hast vouchsafed mee such a favour in
thy sight, do thus and thus for mee: you see he
made this request for the whole Church of
God and saved them, or else they had beene
destroyed. If thou hast not any particular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this case, say, If I have found favour in
thy sight, do this: so I say, when thou hast this
promise confirmed, that Christ hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to thee, &amp; the symbol of that promise is the
bread and wine, which he hath given to thee, put
up thy request: O Lord, if thou hast vouchsafed
to give mee Christ,<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
               <hi>wilt thou not with him give
mee all things else?</hi> Lord, if I have found favour
in thy sight, to do so great a thing for mee, deny
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15587:31"/>
mee not this particular request. Thus we ought
to doe, especially when we come to things that
are beyond nature: when we come, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with our selves; Indeed I have a naturall
disposition that carries me strongly to evill, I
shall never be able to overcome it, there are such
duties to doe, I shall never be able to performe
them: In such a case thou must doe it the more
earnestly, thou must sigh &amp; groane to the Lord.
<note n="h" place="margin">2 King. 4. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Elishah</hi> when hee comes to doe a thing so much
above the course of nature, as to raise a dead
child to life, hee sighed unto the Lord, that is, he
prayed earnestly.<note n="i" place="margin">Iam. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Eliah,</hi> when hee would have
Raine, hee cryed, he tooke much paines, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So must thou doe in this case: and know this
for thy comfort, that though thou thinke thou
shalt never be able to doe these things, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such lusts, such hereditary diseases, yet the
Lord is able to helpe thee: though these are past
naturall helpe, yet they are not past the helpe of
grace; though the spirit in us lust after envy; yet
as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith,<note n="k" place="margin">Iam. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The Scriptures offer
more grace,</hi> that is, the Scriptures offer grace and
ability, to doe more than nature can doe; nature
cannot heale a spirit, that lusteth after envy, or
any other thing; a spirit that lusts after credit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mony, after the sinne of uncleanenesse, or
whatsoever is presented: now the Scriptures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that grace, that will overcome any of these
sinnes, bt they never so strong, or so old; Christ
healed hereditary diseases, he healed those that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15587:31"/>
were borne lame and blinde: so though thou be
borne with such lusts, Christ is able to heale
thee; you see a <hi>Prophet</hi> could heale <hi>Naaman</hi> of
his Leprosie, when there was no other that could
doe it; so saith Christ;<note n="m" place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Come unto me all yee, and
I will heale you.</hi> So that you see wee must put up
our requests to God.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="sermon">
            <head>The third Sermon.</head>
            <p>WE have already made some entrance
upon the words: I told you what the
Apostles scope is in them, which is to make
knowne to all Christians to whom he wrote, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
great priviledge, besides that which hee
named before: that is, <hi>That hee that hath the Sonne,
hath life;</hi> this (saith hee) is another priviledge, <hi>that
whatsoever you aske, you shall have;</hi> onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that you have <hi>this assurance in him,</hi> that is, in
Christ Iesus: That point, (what it is to be in him,
that it may be the ground of all the benefits and
priviledges wee injoy) wee handled the last day.
Now we come to the priviledge it selfe, <hi>If wee
aske any thing according to his will be heareth us.</hi>
The words are so plaine, I shall not need to spend
any time in opening of them, but deliver you the
point that lyes so evidently before us: which is
this,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> [<hi>That all the prayers of the Saints made upon
earth, are assuredly heard in heaven</hi>] whatsoever
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15587:32"/>
we aske, (saith he) according to his will hee
heareth us, onely the conditions must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
When you heare such a generall as this, it
must be limited, there are certaine bounds set
to it,<note place="margin">1. Cond.</note> which wee will name unto you: which are
these foure conditions. First, all the prayers
that are made upon earth shall be heard in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
if they be the prayers of a righteous man,
and are faithfull and fervent. The <hi>person</hi> must
be <hi>righteous,</hi> that must first be remembred: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
although the prayer be never so good, yet
except the person be accepted from whom it
comes, the Lord regards it not: you know in the
old Law,<note place="margin">Esay 66. 3.</note> the <hi>blood of Swine</hi> was reckoned an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Sacrifice,</hi> yet if you take the blood of
sheepe, and compare them together, you shall
finde no difference; It may be the Swines blood
is the better: then whats the reason the Swines
blood is not accepted? even because of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, it was the blood of Swine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you see it was put downe, that it was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Sacrifice. So it is with prayer; Take
the prayer of a Saint, and the prayer of a wicked
man; it may be, if you looke upon the petitions,
or whatsoever is in the prayer it selfe, you shall
finde some times the prayer of a godly man
more cold, and lesse fervent: the petitions are
not so well framed as the wicked mans: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this comes from such a person, the Lord
regards it not, you know the condition is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Iames fift: The prayer of the righteous
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15587:32"/>
man availeth much, if it be fervent.</hi> Now as this is
required in the person, so there is somewhat
required in the prayer also, that is, that it be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and faithfull; that it be fervent, you have it
in the same place, <hi>The prayer of a righteous man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
much if it be fervent;</hi> that is, it must be a
prayer made from the sence of the misery that is
in us, and from the mercie of God, when a man
takes a thing to heart, that he prayes for, and
comes with confidence to be heard, for that
makes him fervent. This the Lord will have,
and also he will have it faithfull: <hi>Iames</hi> the first,
when the Apostle exhorts them to prayer,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 5. 6</note> 
               <hi>if any
man want wisdome</hi> (saith he) <hi>let him aske it of God:</hi>
but then marke, he carefully puts in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
see that <hi>He pray in faith,</hi> that is, beleeue that it
shall be done unto him: now this faith includes
repentance, for no man can beleeve that he shall
be heard, except hee make his heart perfect with
God: If he allow any sinne in himselfe, he cannot
beleeve vpon any good ground: therefore when
I say it must be faithfull, that also is included, we
must<note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note> 
               <hi>regard no wickednes in our hearts,</hi> for in such
a case, <hi>the Lord heares not,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 9. 31.</note> 
               <hi>hee heares not sinners.</hi>
So that this you must remember; First, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must be righteous, and the prayer must be
fervent and faithfull.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Cond.</note> the other Condition you shall heare
in the Text, it must be <hi>according to his will;</hi> you
must not thinke, whatsoever you aske, if you
aske it loosely at Gods hands, that it shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15587:33"/>
be graunted you: No (saith hee) it must be
according to his will, if you <hi>aske</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Luke 9. 54, 55.</note> 
               <hi>fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
that is not according to his will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you see, <hi>they that aske it, were denyed it,</hi> with
this reason, <hi>you know not what you aske.</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 20. 21 22.</note> Likewise
<hi>to sit at his right hand, and at his left in heaven,</hi>
which was another request of the Disciples, he
puts them by with this; <hi>You understand not what
you aske of the Father,</hi> and therefore it must be
according to his will. And that is the second.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must aske it in time, <hi>in due season:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Cond.</note>
so the promise is true, <hi>Knock and it shall be opened
to you;</hi> but you know the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> knockt &amp;
it was not opened to them; what was the reason
of it? because they askt when the time was past:
for there is a certaine<note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>acceptable time when the
Lord will be found:</hi> and when that oportunitie is
past, he is found no more. It is true, that this life
is the time of grace, but God in his secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
hath appointed a certaine time to every man,
which is the <hi>acceptable time, the day of grace,</hi>
therefore he saith unto them, <hi>This day if you will
heare:</hi> this day if you will come and seeke unto
mee, if you will pray unto mee, I will heare
you: when it's past, the Lord suffers not the
doores to stand open alwayes, his eares are not
alwayes open: therefore that condition must
be carefully remembered, you must aske in
time; It is a condition that should be carefully
thought on by us. For, for the most part, we fly
to prayer as <hi>Ioab did to the Altar,</hi> hee went not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15587:33"/>
to it for devotion (for then hee would have done
it before) but when <hi>hee was in distresse,</hi> when
hee was in extremity, then he fled to it, and
therefore you know what successe hee had by
it, it saved not his life: So we goe not to prayer
for devotion, that is, out of love to God, to do
him that service; but (for the most part) wee
doe it out of selfe love, when wee are in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
or distresse, we passe the acceptable times
he requires, and we goe to him in a time of our
owne: For there is Gods time, and there is our
owne time; Gods time is to come to him when
we may doe him service, in our youth, in our
strength, in the flower of our graces: Our time
is to goe to him when we need him: Will not
a friend say (when we never come to him, but
when wee have extreame need of him) why
doe you come now? you were not wont to visit
me before, this is not out of love to mee: Even
the very same answer the Lord giveth;<note n="s" place="margin">Iudg. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Goe to
your Idolls</hi> (saith hee) <hi>those that you served in
the time of peace, and see if they can helpe you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and last condition is,<note place="margin">4. Cond.</note> That wee
referre the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>manner,</hi> the <hi>measure of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our petitions to the Lord.</hi> That is, wee must
not thinke to be our owne carvers, to thinke if
it be not granted in such a manner, such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or such a time, presently the Lord hath
rejected our petitions; No,<note n="t" place="margin">Esay 28. 16.</note> 
               <hi>he that beleeves makes
no hast:</hi> That is, he waites upon God, he stayes
himselfe upon God, he is content to have it in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15587:34"/>
that time, in that manner and measure, as best
pleaseth the Lord: For the truth is, we know
not our selves what is meete for us; we are unto
the Lord just as the Patient is to the physitian.
The patient is importunate with him, for such
things to refresh and ease him; But the physitian
knowes what best belongs to him, and when to
give him such things, in what manner, and in
what measure: So the Lord knowes best what
to doe: Many times he doth the same things
that we desire, though he doe it not in the same
manner: Even as the physitian he quencheth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the thirst with <hi>Barberries,</hi> or with such kind
of conserves; what though it be not with drinke,
is it not all one so the thirst bee quenched? Is it
not all one whether a man be hindred from
striking me, or if I have a helmet to defend the
blow? Somtimes the Lord keepes not off the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
but then hee gives us a helmet to keepe
off those blowes, to beare those injuries and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
that are done to us: hee is a wise physitian,
hee knowes what manner, what measure, and
what time is best, therefore that must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him: Now these conditions being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
you must know that this great priviledge
belongs to every Christian, That whatsoever
prayers hee makes on earth, he is sure to be
heard in heaven; It is a wondrous priviledge, that
which wee have all cause to stand amazed at,
that the Lord should so farre regard the sonnes
of men, to grant them such a Charter as this; no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15587:34"/>
more but aske and have, and whatsoever you
pray for, it shall be done to you. But a man is
ready to say secretly in his heart when he heares
it, This is too good to be true, That whatsoever
I aske, I shall have. My Beloved, I confesse, it is
a hard thing to beleeue it as we ought to doe:
and therefore before we come to apply this, we
will spend a little time in endevouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you of the truth of it, that you may not
doubt of it that what prayers you make to the
Lord, he is ready to heare them.</p>
            <p>First, consider that whatsoever prayer you
make, he takes notice of it, he observes every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
there is not one petition that you make to
him at any time, but he lookes upon it, hee sees
what the prayer is. And this thing although you
thinke it common, (and who is there that know
not this) yet (my beloved) to beleeve this, to
thinke that God is present where I make
my prayer to him, to thinke he stands and heares
it, even as I speake to a man that stands and
heares me, and understands what I say to him;
This is a great helpe to us. That this is true, see
in 4. <hi>Eph. 6. Hee is in all, and through all, and over
all,</hi> That is, the Lord is in every man, he passeth
through every thing,<note n="u" place="margin">2. Chron. 16, 9.</note> 
               <hi>his eyes runne through the
earth,</hi> and he is over all, looking what<note n="x" place="margin">Psal 44, 21.</note> 
               <hi>secrets
are in mans heart,</hi> what <hi>thoughts; yea</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 139, 23.</note> 
               <hi>before he
thinkes them he knowes them,</hi> because hee seeth
them in their causes: Hee that is in a man, that
lookes in all the secret corners of the heart, hee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15587:35"/>
must needes see what thoughts he hath, what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
he putteth up secretly, even then when
his mouth speakes not. And lest that should not
be enough, saith hee, <hi>Hee is over all;</hi> you know
one that stands on high, and lookes over all that
is below, hee easily can see whatsoever is done;
So the Lord, hee is in all, he is through all, he is
over all. But this is enough for that, only I would
have you remember, that hee takes notice of all,
hee knowes thy prayers.</p>
            <p>But you will say;<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I doubt not of that, I make
no qvestion but he heares me, and understands
me well enough: But how shall I know that he is
willing to grant the thing I pray for?</p>
            <p>You shall see these 2 Reasons,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> in the 7. <hi>Math.</hi>
where our Saviour urgeth this very point, that
we have now in hand, from the 7. <hi>verse</hi> downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<hi>Aske</hi> (saith he) <hi>and you shall have; seeke, and
you shall finde; knock, and it shall be opened unto you;</hi>
here is the promise, <hi>For</hi> (he backs it with these 2.
Reasons) <hi>Every one that asketh receiveth; and he
that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it
shall be opened unto him:</hi> As if he should say; yee
have this reason for it, why you should beleeve
it, that it is no more but aske and have; for (saith
he) all that ever asked have obtained; all that ever
have sought, have found; all that ever have
knocked, it hath been opened unto them. That is,
looke through the whole booke of God, and see
what prayers ever have beene made to him, and
you shall finde, that there is not a prayer menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15587:35"/>
in all the Scriptures, but it hath beene
heard. Now when wee have such a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
it is a strong reason, when it is said to us
that there were never any prayed but were
heard.</p>
            <p>Why, you will say,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> There were many prayed
that were not heard; Did not <hi>David</hi> pray for his
Childe, and was not heard? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> pray
to be delivered from such a temptation, and was
not heard?</p>
            <p>My Beloved, Its true, they were not heard
for the particular, but yet I dare be bold to say,
that <hi>Dauid</hi> was heard at that time, though (I
say) not in the particular; for though his Childe
was taken away, yet you may see the Lord gaue
him a Childe of the same woman, with much
more advantage; he gaue him a Childe that was
legitimate, which this was not: hee gaue him a
Childe that exceeded for wisedome, <hi>Solomon</hi>
was the Child that he had: So that the Lord did
heare him, and gave him this answer, as if he had
said to him, <hi>David</hi> I have heard thee, I know that
thou art exceeding importunate; thou shalt not
have this, but thou shalt have another Childe
which shall be better. And so hee saith unto <hi>Paule
2. Cor</hi> 12. Christ reveales this to him; <hi>Paule</hi> (saith
he) though I graunt thee not this particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
in the manner that thou wouldest have
me, (<hi>To take away the pricke of the flesh which thou
art troubled with</hi>) thou shalt bee a grater gainer
by it, thou hadst better have it than want it; when
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15587:36"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> understood that it was a medicine, and not
a poyson as he tooke it to be, he was content
and resolved in it; And a man resolveth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he be a gainer. Hee saw that <hi>Gods power was
manifest in his weakenesse,</hi> and he saw himselfe
humbled by it; and when he saw that God gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
glory, and himselfe humiliation by it, he was
content to be denyed in it; So I say whosoever
asketh findeth, you shall never finde any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
but that whosoever sought to the Lord as he
ought, he was certainely heard, or else he had
somewhat that was better graunted to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of it. And this is the first reason that is used
heare. The second reason is this;<note n="z" place="margin">Math 7. 9, 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>what man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, if his Son aske bread, will give him a stone;
or if be aske a fish, will give him a serpent? if you
then that are evill, know how to give good things to
your children, how much more shall your heavenly
Father give good things to them which aske him?</hi>
(saith he) you be not able to perswade your
selves of this truth, because you know not the
Father, for the dwells in light inaccessable, you
are not acquainted with him, saith our Saviour,
I will helpe you out with an argument that you
better understand; even upon earth (saith he) take
but a father here, a father that is ill (but the Lord
is full of goodnes, fathers have but a drop, but a
sparke of mercy in them, whereas the Lord is
full of mercy, as the Lord is full of light, he is
the God of all comfort;) Yet, (saith he) this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(when his sonne comes to aske him bread)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15587:36"/>
he is ready to give it him, he is full of compassion
and tendernes toward him; doe you not thinke
that our heavenly Father is as true a father as he,
that hee loves you as well as he whose compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and pitty is much greater? doe you not
thinke hee is ready to heare his Children when
they call upon him? O this is a strong and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Reason, &amp; this you see is backed in 16
<hi>Iohn,</hi> 27. you see there the love of the Father how
it is expressed to us; <hi>I say not unto you that I will
aske the father</hi> (saith he) <hi>the father himselfe loves
you;</hi> Marke, as if he should have said, let this be
one ground to you to thinke your petitions shall
be graunted, and that they are not only graunted
for my sake, for (saith he) the Father himselfe
loveth you, and hath a great affection to you,
that is in naturall parents, there is a naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to their Children; So if I were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to present your petitions (though that
bee not excluded) yet (saith he) the father hath
such an affection to you, that he cannot choose
but heare you; <hi>I say not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I will aske
the father, for the father himselfe loves you.</hi> So that
this is the second reason which this promise is
there backed with, the love of the father, That
hee cannot find in his heart to deny us, even for
that affection that he beareth to us. We will
adde a third Reason that wee meet here in the
same Chap. 16. <hi>Iohn, 23. In that day you shall aske
in my name: verily, verily, I say unto you, yee shall
aske the father in my name, and he will give it you;</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:15587:37"/>
It is brought in upon this occasion: when our
Saviour Christ was to goe from his Disciples,
they were ready to complaine, as we see in the
verses before, they were ready to say with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
alas, what shall we doe when our Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
shall be tooke from our head? Our Saviour
answers them, you shall do well enough, doubt
you not, for though I be not with you; yet (saith
he) goe to the father in my name, and whatsoever
you aske of him, you shall have it: So that hee
answers that objection, when a man is ready to
say:</p>
            <p>Its true,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I know that a father is exceeding lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to his Children: But it may be, my carriage
hath not beene such, I am full of infirmities, I
haue much in me that may turne the love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of my Father from me.</p>
            <p>Put the case you have,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yet Christ adds this for
your comfort; If (saith he) the Father will not
doe it for your sake, yet doubt you not, if you
aske in my name, he will doe it; doe we not see
it usuall among men, That one that is a meere
stranger to another, if hee get a letter from a
friend, he thinkes to prevaile; and hee doth so,
because though it be not done for his sake (it
may be he is a stranger, one that deserved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at his hands) yet such a friend may deserve
much: And when we goe to God in the name of
Christ, this answers all the objections whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you can say against your selves, it is all satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this: I goe in his name, I am sure he hath
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15587:37"/>
supply, I am sure he is no stranger, I knowe he
hath deserved it, &amp;c. Last of all, as he loves us,
and because we aske in the name of Christ, is
ready to heare us: we will adde this, that he is
ready to heare us for his owne sake, <hi>he is</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 65, 2.</note> 
               <hi>a
God hearing prayer,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, that all flesh
might come to him,</hi> even for this cause he heares,
that men might be encoraged to come and seeke
to him; for if the Lord should not heare, then
no flesh would come unto him; that is, men
would have no encouragement, no helpe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saith, he is a <hi>God hearing prayer,</hi> doubt
ye not, he will doe it for this purpose, that hee
might have men to worship him, that men might
come and seeke unto him. Besides that, he shall
be glorified,<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 50. 15</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt call upon mee in the day of
trouble, I will heare the, and thou shalt glorifie mee;</hi>
now the Lord is desirous of glory; it was the end
for which he made the world: But in not heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our prayer, hee loseth this glory, by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our requests, the more we are heard, the
more glory and praise we render unto him. Like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise
he doth it for the Spectators sake; <hi>Moses</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
presenteth that Reason,<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 32, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Lord doe it, What
will the Heathen say? and left thy name be polluted
among them, they will say thou hast brought out a
people, and wast not able to deliver them.</hi> So <hi>David</hi>
often, there are many instances in that; I say, for
the lookers on sake he is ready to doe it. All this
is enough to perswaide our hearts, that hee is
ready to heare us, that when prayers are made to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15587:38"/>
him on earth, (So the conditions be observed)
they are surely heard in heaven.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> First, if the Lord be so
ready to heare, then this should teach us to be
more servent in this duty of prayer than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
we are; for to what end are such promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as this, but to encourage us to do our duties?
when wee heare that prayer is of so much effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie,
that it prevailes with the Lord for any
thing, shall we suffer it to lay by (as it were) and
not make use of it? If a drug, or a pretious balme
were commended to us, and it were told us,
that if we made use of it, it would heale any
wound, it will heale any sickenes, and this and
this vertue it hath: Will a wise man suffer it to
lay by him, will he not use it, and see what vertue
it hath? And when it is said unto us, that prayer is
thus prevalent with the Lord, that it is thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that it is thus able to prevaile with him for
any thing, shall we not make use of it, when we
are in any distresse, when wee need any thing:
when we have any disease, either of souleor bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to heale? Let us flye to this refuge that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath appointed. If a King of the earth
should say to a man, I will be ready to doe thee
a good turne, make use of me when thou hast
occasion; he would be ready enough to do it.
Now when the Lord of heaven saith, aske what
you will at my hands, and I will doe it; shall wee
not seeke to him, and make use of such a promise
as this? Beloved we are too backward in this; we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15587:38"/>
should be more aboundant in this duty than we
are, we should make more account of it. For
whatsoever the case be if, you doe but seeke to
the Lord, if thou doest but set downe thy resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with thy selfe: Well I see it is a thing (if I
looke upon the creature and the meanes) I have
little hope of, but the Lord is able to doe it; and
therefore I will goe to him, I will weary him,
and I will not give him over, I will not give
him, nor my selfe any rest, till I have obtained it:
I say it is impossible thou shouldest faile in such
a case. Onely remember to be importunate, for
an importunate suiter he cannot deny. You
know the<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 18. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>parable of the unjust Iudge.</hi> You know
also the<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>parable of the man that is in bed with his
children; when the widdow was importunate,</hi> when
shee knockt and would give him no rest, he gives
her redresse; the other riseth and giveth his
friend <hi>as many loves as he will,</hi> saith the Text; yea
<hi>though she were not his friend;</hi> (for this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it:) If, saith he, the Lord had not much
love to you, if he had not such an affection, if
you did not come to him in the name of Christ
whom he loves, in whom he is ready to grant
whatsoever you aske, if hee were not a friend
to you; yet for your very importunity, he is
ready to doe it. As the unjust Iudge (for that is
the scope of the parable) he had no minde to
grant the widdowes request, he had no Iustice
in him to move him, he had no mercy nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
yet for very importunity he graunted it.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15587:39"/>
Remember and observe the condition, for this
is commonly a fault among us; when we goe to
prayer, we thinke that the very putting up of the
prayer will doe it. No, there is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than so. As it is the error of the Country
people, when they heare say, that such an herbe
is good for such a disease, they are ready to
thinke, that (howsoever it be tooke or applyed)
it will heale the disease; no, it must be applyed
in such a manner, it must be used in such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.
So it is with prayer, you must not only
doe the duty (and therefore when we exhort
you to it, not onely to call upon God, for men
are ready enough to do that, especially in the
time of distresse,) but with these conditions I
have named. You knowe<note n="f" place="margin">2 King. 4. 29. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Gehazi</hi> when he had
got the staffe of <hi>Elisha,</hi> he went to the Child,
but it was not the staffe that could raise the child
from death to life, there was something more
required. So in prayer, it is not meere prayer
that will do it, there is something else, there
must be other conditions that must be observed.
For we are wont to do with it, as those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers
were wont to do with the name of Iesus;
they thought if they used the name of Iesus, it
was enough: but yee know what answer the
Spirit gives them,<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 19. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus we know, and Paule wee
know, but who are yee?</hi> so I say, wee are wont to
do in this case, wee thinke it is enough to make
our request, and that is all. No, there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more required, you must make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15587:39"/>
in such a manner as ye ought. Then I adde
this further, that when thou makest them in such
a manner, yet thou must not thinke to be heard
for thy prayers sake: that is another thing we are
apt to faile in. When wee have made fervent
prayers, and have beene importunate with the
Lord, wee thinke now surely we shall not faile.
No, you must know this, the promise is not
made to the prayer, but to the person praying.
You shall not finde throughout the whole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that any promise is made thus, because
wee pray fervently we shall be heard: but it is
made to the person praying, the prayer is but
the instrument: but the meanes by which the
blessing is conveyed to us, is a meanes without
which the Lord will not doe it, for the promise
is made to the party. A cold prayer (so there be
no neglect in it, so a man seeke the Lord, and
pray as well as he can,) it will prevaile some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as well, as a fervent prayer: Who indites
the petition, who makes the prayer fervent?
surely not thy selfe, but the<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Holy Ghost: he makes
request in us,</hi> sometimes he makes thee more
fervent, hee enlargeth the heart more: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
againe the heart is more straitned in the
performance of this duty: but both may come
from the same Spirit. Not but that we have
cause of much comfort, when wee are able to
pray fervently, for this is a ground of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that when we pray fervently, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> dwels in our hearts, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15587:40"/>
that our prayers are dictated by him; it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that our prayers come from a holy fire
within. And therefore fervent prayer may give
us hope of being heard, but yet it is not meerely
the prayer, but because it is an evidence that it
comes from a right principle, that it comes from
the regenerate part, and is made by the assistance
of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> it is not the very fervencie
that prevailes. And therefore when you heare
this, that the Lord is ready to heare, I say make
that use of it, be fervent in this duty, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the conditions: and yet withall know, that
you are not heard for the very prayers sake, but
for Iesus Christ his sake. He makes every
prayer acceptable, he mingles them with his
sweete odours.</p>
            <p>And if you object,<note place="margin">Object.</note> O but I am a man full of
infirmities.</p>
            <p>You know how it is answered in the Fift of<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
               <hi>Iames,</hi> (saith he)<note n="i" place="margin">Iam. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Eliah</hi> when hee was heard, <hi>he
was a man,</hi> and a man <hi>subject to passions,</hi> and to the
<hi>like passions that wee are:</hi> As if he should say, do
not thinke that <hi>Eliah</hi> was therefore heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was an extraordinary <hi>Prophet,</hi> for it
was because the Lord had made a promise to
him, and hee comes and urges that promise to
the Lord, and therefore the Lord heard him.
So (saith he) should every one of you, if you
have the promise, you may goe and urge it, as
well as <hi>Eliah</hi> did: though you be subject to many
infirmities, <hi>Eliah</hi> was even so. You know there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15587:40"/>
are infirmities and passions expressed in the
Scriptures that hee was subject to. And this is
the first use we are to make of it, to be freqvent
and fervent in this duty, since wee have such a
promise.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> if wee have such a promise, then
wee should learne hence (when we have put up
our prayers at any time) to make more account
of them than wee doe: for the truth is, that we
pray for the most part for fashion sake, many a
man saith thus with himselfe: I will seeke the
Lord, if it doe mee no good, it will doe no hurt;
but if wee made that account of our prayers as
we should, we would performe this duty in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner; but wee doe not make that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them as we ought. We thinke not with
our selves that the prayers that wee make are
surely heard: there be many evidences of it; what
is the reason, that when wee seeke the Lord, we
doe it so remisly that we have scarce leasure to
make an end of our prayers: we are so ready to
hasten and goe about other businesse, wee are
ready to turne every stone, to use all meanes to
seeke the creatures with all diligence: but who
prayes to the Lord as hee ought, to worke his
heart to such afervent performance of that duty
as he should? men have scarcely leasure, for it is
usuall with them when they have businesse to
doe, and enterprises to bring to passe, they are
exceeding diligent to use all meanes; and yet are
remisse in the chiefe: what is the reason else, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15587:41"/>
wee see the doores of Princes and great men so
full of suiters, though there be porters set on
purpose to drive them away; but the gates of
heaven are so empty? It is indeed because we
do not beleeve our prayers are heard, wee do
but make our prayers for fashion. What is the
reason likewise, that we use prayer in the time
of distresse (if it will be an effectuall meanes to
helpe us, when all other meanes faile,) why use
we it not before? But that is an argument that
wee trust not to it, seing we use it, onely in the
time of extremity: for if it be not effectuall, why
do we use it then? If it be effectuall, why do not
wee use it till that accident? Therefore this use
we must further make, when wee heate that the
Lord heares our prayers, to make more account
of them than we doe, to thinke that our prayers
when they are put up to the Lord shall be heard.
Say thus with thy selfe, Well, now I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I expect that the thing should be graunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that I have prayed for, when I seeke to the
Lord: It's true, I deny not but wee must use the
meanes too, we must lay the hands upon the
plough, and yet pray; both ought to be done, as
sometimes we use two friends, but we trust one;
wee use two Phisitians, but we put confidence
in one of them: In like manner we must both
pray and use the meanes, but so as wee put our
chiefe trust in prayer, it is not meanes that will
doe it. But the truth is, we doe the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
It may be, we pray and use the meanes,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15587:41"/>
but wee trust the meanes, and not the prayer:
that is a common and a great fault among us, it
is a peece of Atheisme, for men to thinke the
Lord regards their prayers, no more than he
regards the bleating of sheepe or the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of oxen, to thinke he heeds them not. And
its a great part of faith to thinke that the Lord
harkens to them and regards them, as certainely
he doth.</p>
            <p>But you will say, I have prayed,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and am not
heard, and have sought to the Lord and have
found no answere.</p>
            <p>Well,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it may be thou hast not for the present,
but hast thou stayed the Lords leasure? (for that
is to be considered in this case,) sometimes the
Lord comes quickly, he gives a quick answer to
our requests; sometimes he staies longer: But this
is our comfort, that when the returne is longer,
the gaine is the greater. As we se in trades, some
trades have their returne very quicke, it may be
the tradesmens money is returned every weeke,
but then their gaine is so much the lighter; but
when their returne is slower, as is your great
merchants, when it stayes three or foure yeares,
wee see the ships come home laden, bringing so
much the more: So (for the most part) when
our prayers doe stay long, they returne with the
greater blessings, they returne loaden with rich
commodities. Let this be an encoragement to us;
Though I stay, the Lord will grant it; and thinke
not with thy selfe, I made such a prayer long
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15587:42"/>
agoe, I found no fruit of it; for be sure, the Lord
remembreth thy prayer, though thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
it, the prayers that thou madest a good
many yeares agoe, may doe thee good many
yeares hence. May not a man pray to have his
Child sanctified, to have him brought to better
order? It may be hee lives many yeares, and
sees no such thing, yet in the end, the prayer
may be effectuall: So likewise it may be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases, you see there are many examples for it:
<hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, he stayed long; but you see it
was a great blessing that he had, when he prayed
for a Sonne, you know what a Sonne he was,
he was a Sonne of the promise, in whom all the
nations of the earth were blessed. So <hi>David</hi>
when the Lord promised him a kingdome, hee
stayed long for it: Many such examples there are.
Therefore comfort thy selfe with this: though I
stay long, this is my hope, this is my encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that sustaines me, If I seeke the Lord, and
waite upon him, Hee will come with a great
blessing, the gaine shall bee heavier and greater,
though the returne be not so quicke and sudden.</p>
            <p>Last of all, when you heare such a promise as
this,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> That whatsoever you aske you shall be
heard in it; you should hence learne, to spend
some time in the meditation of this great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the Saints have, and none but they;
This I propound to every mans consideration;
that those that are not Christians, that is, those
that are not regenerate, may know what they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15587:42"/>
lose by it; and those that are, may understand
the happines of their condition, that they may
learne to magnify it, and to blesse themselves in
that condition, that they have such a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
as this: It is no more but aske and have,
therefore that which in the third place I exhort
you to, is this, namely to spend time in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of it, to consider what a great advantage
it is: <hi>David</hi> cannot satisfie himselfe enough in
it: In 18. and 116. <hi>Psalmes: Lord I love thee deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
he cannot prayse enough, and why? <hi>I sought
to thee in distresse, and thou heardest me; I called upon
thee, &amp; thou inclinedst thine eare to my prayer.</hi> I say
consider this mercy as you ought to doe, it is
part of the thankes we owe to the Lord for so
an exceeding priviledge, That whatsoever our
case be, it is no more, but put up our requests,
and wee shall bee heard: When there was a
speech among some holy men (as you know
that man that was named in the story:) what
was the best trade, he answered beggerie; It is
the hardest, and it is the richest trade. Now he
understands it not, of common beggery (for
that is the poorest and easiest trade, that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he puts in) but (saith he) I understand it of
a prayer to God, that kind of beggerie I meane;
which as it is the hardest, nothing more hard
than to pray to God as we ought, so withall
there is this comfort in it, it is the richest trade
of all others; there is no way to inrich our selves
so much, with all the promises that belong ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15587:43"/>
to this life, or to that which is to come. Even
as you se among men, a Courtier, a Favorite in
the Court, gets more by one suite, (it may be,)
than a Tradesman, or Merchant, or husbandman
gets with twenty yeares labour, though he takes
much paines; for one request may bring more
profit, may make a Courtier, richer than so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares labour and paines: So in like case a
faithfull prayer, put up to God, may more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailé
with him, we may obtaine more at his
hands by it, than by many yeares labour, or using
many meanes; and therefore it is a rich trade,
and great priviledge, a priviledge that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thinke enough of, that wee cannot esteeme
enough. You have heard of a noble man in this
Kingdome, that had a Ring given him by the
<hi>Queene,</hi> with this promise: that if he sent that
Ring to her, at any time when he was in distresse,
she would remember him and deliver him; This
was a great priviledge from a Prince, and yet
you see, what that was subject unto; he might be
in such a distresse, when neither King nor
Queene could be able to helpe him; or though
they were able, (as she was in that case) yet it
might be sent, and not delivered: Now then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what the Lord doth to vs, Hee hath given
us this priviledge, he hath given us prayer, as it
were this Ring, he hath given us that to use, and
tells us whatsoever our case is, whatsoever wee
are, whatsoever we stand in need of, whatsoever
distresse wee are in, doe but send this up to me,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15587:43"/>
(saith he) do but deliver that message up to me
of prayer, and I will bee sure to relieve you:
Now certainely what case soever we are in,
when we send up this, it is sure to be conveyed,
wheresoever wee are: Againe, whatsoever our
case is, we send it to one that is able to helpe us,
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a Prince many times is not able to do. This
benefit we have by prayer: That whatsoever we
aske at the Lords hands, wee shall have it: Now
consider this great advantage which you have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is expressed 4 <hi>Phil.</hi> in these words, <hi>Be in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
carefull</hi> (saith the Apostle:) And that you
may see wee have ground for this generality, <hi>In
nothing bee carefull, but in all things make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
knowne unto God.</hi> That is, whatsoever your
case bee, I make no exception at all, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you stand in neede of, whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
your soules or your bodies, your name or
your estate; yet be in nothing carefull. This is a
great matter: There is none amongst you that
heares me now, but sometime or other he is
carefull for something or other, for which he is
solicitous: Now when a man heares such avoyce
from heaven, that the Lord himselfe saith to us,
Bee carefull for nothing, doe no more but make
your request knowne, it is well enough, I will
surely heare in heaven and grant it; It is a great
comfort. Beloved, comfort your selves with
these words, and thinke this with your selves,
that this is that Charter, and great Grant that the
Lord hath given you, and to none but you, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15587:44"/>
what prayers you make to him, hee heareth
you.</p>
            <p>But it will bee objected,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> why is this said so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally?
That we must in nothing be carefull,
but in all thinges make our request knowne? For
then if a man were but a poore man, it is but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lord, and asking riches, and hee shall
have them; If a man were sick of an incurable
disease, it were no more but going to the Lord,
and hee should be sure to be recovered; If a man
hath an enterprise to bring to passe, it is no more
but goe to him, and it shall be done: what is the
reason then, that godly and holy men have not
these things graunted to them?</p>
            <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> you must understand it with
this condition, even as it is with a Father (I will
prove it to you by that,) suppose he should say
to his sonne, I will deny thee nothing, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I have, I wil deny thee nothing but thou shalt
have part in it; Though he say no more, yet we
understand it with these conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that if his Childe shall aske him for that,
that is not good for him, or if the child should
refuse to have that done, or pray his Father and
say, I beseech you do it not, when the Father
knowes it is good: here the Father is not bound
hee thinkes: as for example, if a Father sees his
childe needes Physick, it may be, the child finds
it bitter, and therefore is exceeding loath to take
it, it makes him sicke, and is irkesome unto him,
so that hee earnestly desires his Father that hee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15587:44"/>
may be excused, that hee might be freed from it;
In this Case, the father will not heare him, for
hee knowes the Child is but mistaken: On the
other side; if the Child aske something that is
very hurtfull, if he aske for wine in a feaver, the
Father denyes it him; No, (saith he) you are
mistaken, I know your desire is that you might
have health and recover, and this I know will
hurt you, though you know it not; This the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
understands, and therefore he puts in that
condition: So when the Lord saith, <hi>In nothing
be carefull, but in all things make your requests
knowne:</hi> If you mistake the matter at any time,
and your prayer shall not bee the dictate of the
Spirit, (so that yee alway make request accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his will) but the dictate of your owne
hearts, and shall be the expression of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Spirit, and not the Lords Spirit: In this
case there is no promise of being heard, and yet
the Lord makes his word good; Bee in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
carefull, but in all things make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
knowne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a Father when hee saith to his
Child, I will deny you nothing, but you shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
have part in all that I have, yet the Childe may
carry himselfe so, that the Father, upon such an
occasion may deny him, and be ready to say unto
him; Well, if you had followed your Booke, if
you had not runne into such disorders, if you
had not bin negligent to doe what I gave you in
charge, I would have done it: In this case, the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15587:45"/>
Father withholds the blessing that hee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon his Child; not because he is unwilling
to bestow it, but because he would thus nurture
his Child, hee useth it as a meanes to bring him
to order: So the Lord saith to<note n="k" place="margin">Numb 20 12.</note> 
               <hi>Moses,</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had spoken unadvisedly, because he had
not honoured him before the people,<note place="margin">Psal. 106. 32, 33.</note> at those
waters, <hi>the waters of strife,</hi> therefore the Lord
tells him by the Prophet, <hi>he should not goe into the
good land:</hi> And so he tells<note n="l" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>David,</hi> that because <hi>he
had sinned against him, he would not give him the
life of the Child:</hi> So the Lord saith to us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
I will not graunt you this request; for
though I be willing to graunt it, yet this is one
part of the discipline and nurture that I use to my
Children, That such a particular request, I will
deny you for such an offence; as <hi>worshipping of
Idolls</hi> &amp;c. Beloved this is not a generall denyall,
and this is not for our disadvantage, but it is a
helpe to us, it makes us better, that sometime
we should be denyed; knowing hereby that it
is denyed to us for our sinne, that we may learne
to come to the Lord, and renew our repentance,
and to take that away, that we may come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
in our prayers with him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when a Father is willing to graunt it,
yet he will thus say to his Child, Though I bee
willing to doe what you aske at my hands, yet
I will not have you aske it rudely, I will have
you aske it in a good manner, and a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
(For when wee come to call upon God,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15587:45"/>
and come in an unreverent manner, in such a case
the Lord heares not.) Or againe, hee will say
to his child; I am ready to heare you, but you
must not aske in a negligent manner, as if you
cared not whether you had it or no: So the Lord
saith to us; I will have you to pray fervently, you
shall aske it, as that which you prize. Againe he
will say to his child: I am willing to bestow this
upon you, but I do not give you this mony, to
spend it amisse, to play it away, to spend it in
trifles, and geugawes, that will do you no good:
So saith the Lord, I am willing to give you
riches,<note n="m" place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but not to bestow upon your lusts.</hi> Thus
speakes the father to his child, when he comes
to aske, hee tels him hee must come in such a
manner as becomes a child, he must speake to
him as to a Father, he must speake with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to receive it: So also the Lord tels us,<note n="n" place="margin">Iam 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>we
must come in faith;</hi> So that (in a word) this is to be
remembred; That though the Lord promise,
that he will give whatsoever we aske, and bids
us, in nothing be carefull, but make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
knowne; yet notwithstanding this, he
would have us to understand that our requests
be made in such a manner as they ought to be.
Last of all, it may be the Father is willing to do
it; but hee makes a little pause, he will not give
it presently, and suddenly to his child, though
he purpose to bestow it upon him, that he may
come by it with difficultie: So the Lord useth to
with-hold his blessings many times, that his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15587:46"/>
childe might be exercised in prayer, and seeke
him the more, and likewise that he might come
the hardlier by the blessing, that so hee might
learne to prize it more; or else he will be ready
to do as young heirs: As it is with some when
they never know the getting of it, they spend it
easily; but he that hath known what it is, he takes
more care to his estate, he looks more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to it: so it would be with us in any blessing,
if we had it with such facility as we would, we
would not make much account of it; but when
it comes with some hardnesse, with some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
it teacheth us to set a higher price on it,
and so it makes us more thankefull, it teacheth
us to give more praise and glory to the Lord.
There are many that have had a sicknesse long,
and have obtained health with much prayer,
and much contention, and therefore they learne
to prize it more, than another that obtaines it
easily. And thus it is in every like case. So when
you heare this great priviledge: that it is no
more, but, <hi>aske and have:</hi> and, <hi>be in nothing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but in every thing make your requests knowne:</hi>
yet (I say) these conditions must needs be inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
these are such as must be included. But
these considered, remember this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
rejoyce in it, let the Lord
have the praise of it, that
<hi>Whatsoeuer we aske ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will,
he heareth vs.</hi>
