         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As longe as he hade no money, somwhat I coulde rule hym, but as soone as he had gotten hym

            <p>Neuerthelesse, I suffred all thynges tyll that was ended whiche I could not do alone without one both to wryte and to helpe me to compare the textes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whan that was ended, I toke my leaue and bad hym farewel for oure two lyues, and as men say a daye longer, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we were departed he wente, and gat him new frendes whiche thynge to dooe he passeth all that euer I yet knewe. And there when he had stored hym of money he gote hym to Argentyne where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth wonderful faculties and maketh bost of no smal thinges. A yere after that and now. xii. Monethes before the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of this worke, came one Ierome a brother of Grene whiche also, throughe Wormes to Argentyne, saiynge: that he entended to be Christes disciple another whyle &amp; to kepe (as nye as God woulde geue him grace) the profession of his bap tysme, and to get hys lyuynge with his handes, and to lyue no lenger ydely and of the sweate and laboure of those cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyues whiche they had taught, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christ: but in cut showes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sset coetes. Whiche Ierom with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I warned of Royes boldnesse and exhorted hym to be ware of hym and to walke quiyetly and with all pacience and longe sufferynge accordinge as wee haue Christ and his Apostles for an ensample,
<pb facs="tcp:5130:3"/>
whiche thynge he also promysed me.

How can ye speake well whyle ye youre selues are euill? So lykewyse is this true and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge

               <p>This confirmth S. Peter in the xv. chapter of the actes, sayng that God tho row fayth doth purifie the hertes For of what nature soeuer the word of God is, of the same nature muste the hertes be whiche beleue theron and cleue ther vnto.</p>

               <p>Thus meaneth Iames in his Epystle where he sayth, fayth without workes is dead that is, yf workes folow not, it is a sure and an euidente sygne, that ther is no fayth in the hert but a dead ymagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and drea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e which they falsly cal faith.</p>
               <p>Of the same wyse is thys sayinge of Christe to bee vnderstande. Make you frendes of the vnryghtuous Mammon, that is shewe youre fayth openly &amp; what

And by the workes is the faith knoweth, that it was ryght and perfecte. For the outwarde workes can neuer please God nor make frende, excepte they springe of fayth.

Yet make they no frendes wyth their workes, while their hertes are false and vnpure and theyr eye double. Now without fayth is no herte true or eye sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel: so that wee are conpelled to confesse that the workes make not a man ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or good but that the herte muste fyrst be ryghteous and good before any good worke procede thence.</p>

The cause is, for as much as faith iustifieth and putteth awaye sinne in the syght of God, bryngeth, lyfe, health and the fauoure of God, maketh vs the hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of God powreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our soules and fylleth vs with al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes in Christe, it were to great a shame, rebuke, and wronge vnto the fayth, yea to Christes bloude yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would worke any thynge to purchase that, wherwith fayth hath endued him already, and God hath geuen hym surely.

               <p>For they ymagen that it is in the kyng dome of Christe, as it is in the worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge men, that they must deserue heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with theyr good workes. How be it their thoughtes are but dreams and false ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacions. Of these men speaketh Mala.

Euen so naturally doth eternall lyfe folowe fayth and good lyuing, with out sekynge for, and is impossible that it should not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, thought no man thought there on. Yet is it rehearsed in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, alleged, and promysed to knowe the difference betwene a false beleuer and a true beleuer, and that euery man maye knowe what foloweth good lyuinge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and of it selfe wythout takynge thought for it. Take agrosse ensampel. Hel, that is euerlastinge death is threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened vnto synners, and yet foloweth it synne naturalli without sekyng for.

Yet the one folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the other naturally, and thought no man tolde or warned hym of it, yet should the synner fynde it, and fele it. Ne uerthelesse it is therfore threatened, that men maye knowe what foloweth euyll lyuynge.

Yet testifieth the scripture, and it is true, that we are by enheritaunce heires of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacion, and that before we be borne we are vessels of the wrath of God and full of that poyson whence naturally all synnes sprynge, and where with we can not but synne, whyche thynge the dedes that folowe (when we behold our selues in the glasse of the lawe of God) do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and vtter, kyll our consciences, and shewe vs what we were and wist not of it, and certifie vs that wee are heyres of damnacion.

               <p>Now when Christe sayeth. Make you frendes of vnryghtuous Mammon Ga ther you treasure together in heauen and such lyke.

               <p>Thrydly many haue busyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfes<note place="margin">Who is the steward</note> in studyenge what or who thys vnrygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous steward is, because that Christe so praiseth hym. But shortely and playnely thys is the answere. That Christe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not the vnryghteous stuard, nether setteth hym forth to vs to counterfet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his vnrighteousnes but because of his wisdome only in that he with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right so wisely prouldid for him selfe. As if I woulde prouoke another to praye or studie saiyng. The theues watche all nighte to robbe and stele: why canst not thou watche to praye and to studie? Here prayse not I the thefe and murderer for there euil doinge, but for ther wysdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they so wisely and diligently waite on ther vnrighteousnes.

               <p>Of this wise Paule also Roma. v. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Adam and Christ together, sayenge that Adam was a fygure of Christe, And yet of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we but pure synne, and

               <p>So that as Adam is father of all synne, so is Christe father of all rightuousnes. And as all synnes springe of Adam: euen so all rightuous men and women springe of Christe. After the same maner is here the vnrightuous stuarde an ensample vn to vs in hys wisdome and diligence only, in that he prouided so wysely for hym selfe, that we with rightuousnes shoulde be as diligent to prouyde for our soules, as he with vnrightuousnes prouided for his body Lyke wyse mayste thou soyle all other texes whiche sounde as though it were betwene vs and God as it is in the worlde where the rewarde is more lo ked vpon, then the laboure: yea wher me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hate the laboure and worke falsly with the bodye, and not with the herte and no longer than they are loked vpon, that the laboure maye appere outwarde only.</p>
