         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN eſſence the Father of Spirits, this is the Word of the Lord unto
you people called Quakers: I would that you remember when I firſt
called you forth in ſimplicity of heart, to bear my teſtimony of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in you, againſt the groſs darkneſs and filthineſs in the People; for
which Teſtimony you have ſuffered ſtripes and impriſonments, burnings,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufferings, and what not; and in all this you fainted not, but ſtill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that it was by my hand and power that you were upheld: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would, that you would keep in, out of Self, and behold Wiſdoms
Work with a ſingle eye: See how I have taken the Children of Darkneſs,
and made them a Rod in my Hand, to perſecute and try you, that both you
and they might have advantage thereby, that they may be wounded by
your ſtripes; and that you may be purified by their violence; that I
might make you a Body, or a Woman, having conceived by my power,
might be made fit to bring forth my Child, that I might be made manifeſt to
the Out-parts of the Earth: Therefore make not Self your Midwife, nor
call upon the Children of Darkneſs to deliver you, or to proſecute your
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: for unleſs you turn back again, they can yield your fleſh no comfort,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your form or beloved which you have ſet up according to my order;
for although I gave you order to ſet up a Form or a Beloved, exceeding all
Beloveds, it was not that you ſhould ſtick there: nor as yet intended that
you ſhould be Supream Judge over all, onely you are to judge all that are
below you in the Truth. Therefore, know this O Woman, the Child thou
ſhouldeſt a brought forth, ſticks in the birth, becauſe Self has taken up his
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ode in that beautiful Beloved, and is willing to ſit down there, and to
contain the Child in its Limits and Bounds: But even I the Lord, when
this Beloved has done her work, I ſhall disfigure her Form, and rend her
Bonds like a ſtrong Lion, rending the prey; ſo that all that I find faithful
in this Beloved, I ſhall fill up their meaſures, and make them run over with
ſuch Floatings and Rivers of Life, that the Powers of the Earth ſhall not
be able to impropriate, or meaſure it one to another; for all Beloveds, and
all Forms ſhall paſs away, and be brought to nothing; and then will I
(ſight) even I the Lord, when all is come to nothing, create a New Heaven,
and a New Earth, where no impure thing can be, where no Righteouſneſs,
nor Unrighteouſneſs can enter; where one ſhall be all, and all one. This
this was, and now is, and ſhall be again, to thoſe that ſaid before it was; to
thoſe that ſee it now it is, to thoſe that ſhall ſee it, it is to come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
know this my Beloved One, that ſee Wiſdoms Steps, Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
the Serpents Wiſdome is my Servant, for I created it; without me
it could not be, the Serpent could not make it, but onely to the Children
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65993:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Darkneſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Therefore turn in, turn in, my Beloved One, look with a ſingle
Eye which pierceth through all Forms and Beloveds, and there ſhalt thou
ſee that there is but one Power over all, though Darkneſs doth imagine
many; for one other Beloved have I yet to ſet up, which far exceeds all
Beloveds that ever yet were in form: To all that behold him afar off he
is terrible; he appears pale, and black as Hell: but if once they come to
behold his Face, they will be raviſhed with his Beauty: For this Beloved is
like a City with three Gates, and a Guard of Watch-men at each Gate:
the Watch at the firſt Gate examines and tries all Paſſengers and Spirits
that would enter; And if they cannot loſe the pleaſure of the outward
Senſe, the pleaſing of the Pallat, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of the
Eye, they will not admit, nor ſuffer them to enter. The ſecond Gate, and
the Watch there tries the ſecrets of the Heart, and the Righteouſneſs and
Idols ſet up therein, they will ſuffer nothing but good to enter, which feeds
onely of the Tree of Life. The third Gate none can enter, that feeds of
the Tree of Knowledge, of Good and Evil, or that have any Sin or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
left, or any Earth-thing that bears either Name or Term diſtinct
from other; neither Joy nor Sorrow, Good nor Evil, for all tears muſt be
there wiped away, and all brought down to nothing, that Wiſdom onely
may be all in all in ſight of the Enterer: Therefore, look about you, o
ye wiſe men of the Earth, for danger is coming forth to the Spirits that
lives in the Fleſh; for even I wiſdom have prepared a Fool, and cloathed
him in White Sheeps Cloathing, and ſent him back again through the
three Gates, to deceive you of your Black Sheeps Cloathing, and of the
Pride that you have therein, and all your Artificial Colours invented by the
Serpents Wiſdom onely and alone to pleaſe the pride of the Eye; and he
will alſo deceive you, or ſome of you, in drawing you from the pleaſurable
Bits to the Pallat, and from your Idols of Gold and Silver, and the Glory
of your Buildings, and from all corruptable pleaſures, and ſo forth: Evil
to him that evil thinks; let Envie increaſe in the Envious, and Fury in the
furious, I will fill up their Cups, that it may break them to pieces with ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings
and torments, that they may be conſumed and brought to nothing:
Even ſo it ſhall be, for I am the Lord.</p>
