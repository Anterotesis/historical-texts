            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Do deſire thee impartially to peruſe theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars, and then let the Witneſs of God in thy Conſcience judge, whether theſe Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are agreeable to Righteouſneſs, Law and true Juſtice. Should we have ſet out all the Matter and Manner of Proceedings in the full Extent of it, it would have ſwelled into too big a Volumn, and haply have multiply'd the Sorrow of many tender and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to hear of ſuch Actions acted by profeſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one againſt another; and it may make the <hi>Heathen</hi> to queſtion the <hi>Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when they hear of thoſe Rending, Tearing and Devouring Dealings amongſt the Profeſſors thereof. Certainly the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may Laugh at the great Victory they have gotten by their under-hand accompliſhing ſuch a Law, as ſets one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> againſt another, In ſuch a Day as this; and that for no other Reaſon, but for their Sincerity to God-ward; not for any Vice, but for Virtue; when they themſelves ſee it Policy to maintain Unity, though differing in ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a thing practiſed in all Ages: But if thou caſt thy Eyes, thou wilt ſee the great Promoters and Encouragers of this Stratagem, are ſuch as would be

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thereby to Warn all Magiſtrates in and about <hi>Fakenham,</hi> to take heed for the future; our Cauſe is committed to the Lord, who hath pleaded it, and in this day rewarded our Service of Love, and given us that Treaſure in our Earthen Veſſels, which is of more Value than all our outward Subſtance loſt, if ſumm'd up all together; from the Senſe of which we can truly ſay the Scripture is fulfilled, <hi>A Little that the Righteous hath, is of more value than great Riches:</hi> and though you have taken our Goods, yet our Peace continues; and as our Sufferings abound, even ſo our Conſolation hath much more abounded; ſo that now in the Lord have we cauſe to rejoyce, and be glad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and forever.</p>

               <p>ANd now, after all this Violence uſed, and Spoil made upon this People, I deſire the Reader honeſtly and conſcienciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to weigh and conſider, What Evil has theſe Sufferers done, or what Law of God have they broke, or juſt Laws of men have they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48885:44"/>
tranſgreſſed? which is the principal matter to weigh and conſi-that ſo thou may'ſt not in thy haſte give a wrong Judgment, and from that draw a falſe Concluſion, and run with the Multitude, who deny the Truth, &amp; perſecute them that live in it, and ſay, <hi>That they ought to ſuffer becauſe they have broke the Law:</hi> Now to ſay ſo, without diſtinction, is to draw a wrong concluſion, without well conſidering what the Law is, and what ſort of people it lays hold upon; for the Law of God does not nor will not puniſh a righteous man, as the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Law was not made for a Righteous man, but for the Lawleſs and Diſobedient, &amp;c.</hi> So alſo the juſt Laws of men, that are inſtituted &amp; made according to that equal and reaſonable Principle which God has plac'd a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of in every man, which would, if it be adhered unto, teach &amp; guide people <hi>to do unto others even as they would be done unto;</hi> ſuch Laws preſerve men in their Liberties and Properties, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; that every man has an equal ſhare, according to his place and degree of Preſervation by them, or ought to have, that is honeſt; but thoſe Laws that are or have been made to deprive men of their juſt Liberties, which God allows them, and requires them to uſe to his Glory, and afflict their Bodies, and ſpoil their Goods, &amp; ruin them becauſe they take that Liberty that the Lord allows them, which is, <hi>to worſhip him in that Way as he is pleaſed to reveal and make known himſelf unto them;</hi> that Law is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of God; and it is under ſuch Laws, or the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good Laws, that the Righteous in Ages paſt &amp; alſo now do ſuffer; and them are the Laws that envious people boaſt of, as ſaid the <hi>envious Jews</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.7. <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye;</hi> and ſo ſaid <hi>bloody Bonner</hi> and the reſt of his perſecuting Brethren to the faithful Martyrs of Jeſus in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, who put ſo many to death becauſe they could not bow to the <hi>Popiſh Superſtition,</hi> who upbraided thoſe worthy men and women becauſe they were not ſubject to the Queen's Laws, which if they had, <hi>they muſt have defiled their Conſciences, who thoſe rather to loſe all and obey Chriſt, than to ſin againſt the Lord, and thereby bring deſtruction upon their own Souls:</hi> And we would have all people take notice, that this is and has been our caſe, that are concerned in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48885:44"/>
this Relation of Sufferings, ſo far as the Lord has been pleaſed to ſuffer our Perſecutors to proceed; for their Words and Actions have been of the ſame nature; for ſay they, <hi>We have a Law</hi> (as ſay <hi>Chr. Calthorp</hi> and others of them) <hi>and we are Sworn to put it in execution:</hi> but I hope he is not ſworn to exceed it in Cruelty, as it appears in this Relation he has ſometimes done egregiouſly. Alſo the Informers they ſay to the Sufferers, <hi>You break the Law, and therefore your Sufferings are juſt upon you;</hi> as it was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Will. Watt</hi> the old Informer uſed very much, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taunting &amp; unſavoury Speeches unto the Sufferers, on whom the Lord laid an heavy Judgment long before he dyed, which might have been as a Warning unto the reſt of them that had an hand in this evil work of <hi>perſecuting their honeſt Neighbours; but,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we have a Law;</hi> but if the Law-makers did really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that none ſhould ſuffer by this Law, but ſuch perſons as they ſay were the cauſe for which they made this Law, then <hi>Chriſtoph. Calthorp,</hi> and the reſt of his Brethren, have very much exceeded their bounds in what they have done againſt their innocent and peaceable Neighbours. And <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> who is ſaid to be the <hi>Oracle of the Engliſh Law,</hi> in his firſt part, cap. 2. §. 3. Book 11. <hi>Ever the general words are to be intended of a lawful Act, and ſuch interpretation muſt be made of all Statutes, that the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or he in whom there is no Guilt, may not be damnified.</hi> For the Preamble of the Act, which expreſſes the Reaſon or ſole Cauſe why this Law was made (if we may believe the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) is thus expreſt, <hi>An Act to ſuppreſs Seditious Conventicles, &amp; Diſloyal Perſons, who at their Meetings Plot and Contrive Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as late experience has taught, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, whether or no any thing of that kind can be proved againſt <hi>Joſeph Harriſon,</hi> and the reſt of theſe Sufferers? and whether any of theſe Informers did ever ſwear, that they found <hi>Joſeph Harriſon</hi> and his Friends at their Meetings plotting or contriving Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for the preventing and puniſhing of which Perſons the Law was made? No, there were never, nor could be ſuch things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt them; for the Principle which they have received, &amp; do obey, which is the Grace of God, teaches them better things,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48885:45"/>
which is, <hi>to obey Chriſt's Doctrine, to do unto others as they would have others do unto them,</hi> which is but equal. And although they have made uſe of thoſe words in the Act, of <hi>Five and upwards meeting together beſides the Family, under pretence of Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, in other manner than is allowed by the Liturgy,</hi> to inflict the Penalties of Breach of that Law upon us, yet the Five and above the number muſt have Relation to ſuch as be ſeditious and contrive Inſurrections, and are Meeters but in Pretence of Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, &amp;c. But our Meetings are really to worſhip God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Truth, and the contrary has not been proved againſt them, neither can he; and therefore the Law in that caſe that is made and provided does not lay hold on them; for the Reaſon why this Act was made we are wholly clean of, both in the ſight of God and all men; for neither in our Meetings nor out of them, we never did, or is it in our hearts to do, to contrive any thing that is or may be hurtful either to Prince or People; but we do ſay, that our Meetings are for no other End or Cauſe, but to wait upon God, and to call upon his Name for his Power to keep us and to preſerve us, and for his Grace to teach us and inſtruct us, that ſo we may alwayes worſhip him in his own Way, which is in Spirit and Truth, which all Plotters and Contrivers of Inſurrection are out of. And if the <hi>Liturgy</hi> does allow, that God ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit and Truth, then the Informers have Forſworn themſelves, who ſwore, <hi>[That our Exerciſe of Religion is in other manner than the Liturgy allows.]</hi> And I am ready to believe, that the Leading-men of the <hi>Church of England</hi> will acknowledge, that they are to worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth; which if ſo, why ſhould it be accounted a Crime for us to confeſs the ſame, and ſo great a Crime, as if for it there was neither Mercy nor Pity, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity nor Juſtice to be extended towards us, as appears by this fore-going Relation, in which <hi>Chr. Calthorp,</hi> with the reſt of his Brethren, the perſecuting Magiſtrates and Informers, have ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly perſecuted their honeſt Neighbours; as if God had made them, their Wives and Children to be made a Prey upon, and to be oppreſſed; as if it were Religion enough to Ruin and Undo others, and to take the Bread from the Poor, and Clothes from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48885:45"/>
the Needy, whilſt theſe Magiſtrates themſelves live in Fulneſs of Bread, who (like <hi>Dives</hi>) fare deliciouſly, and clothed with Rich Attire (like the Rich Man ſpoken of by Chriſt) have not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and neglected to relieve the Poor, but have been Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, by encouraging theſe evil-minded Informers to take away poor peoples Clothes they wore, and their Beds they lay upon, and their Bedding, and expoſe them to the Cold, without either Mercy or Pity to old or young, or ſick; for when the Officers went to <hi>Chr. Bedingfield,</hi> one of theſe Magiſtrates, and told him, that there was nothing to be had of one <hi>Mary Larder</hi> for her fine, but her Bed on which ſhe lay at that time ſick, &amp; more like to dye than to live, the ſaid <hi>Chr. Bedingfield</hi> bad them <hi>Go and take the Bed from under her;</hi> which ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> dyed that Night: Oh great Cruelty! and if this be not to over-paſs the Deeds of many of the Wicked, I know not what is; for Chriſt does not render <hi>Dives</hi> himſelf ſo bad. And now I queſtion not but both Magiſtrates &amp; the Officers and Informers, who have done theſe things, would judge it hard dealings if any ſhould do by them as you have done by theſe your honeſt Neighbours, and for no other Cauſe than for their Obedience to the Lord; then out of your own Mouthes you are judged, and that you have not done by them as you would be done unto; and therefore you have no cauſe to blame me and other ſober men that hear of your Actions although we do ſay, that the Informers, Officers and Juſtices, that encourage ſuch Proceedings as theſe are, are to blame, and the Sufferers have juſt Cauſe to complain of the great Oppreſſion that ſo long has lain upon them, and to give the World an account of your unmerciful dealing with them and behaviour towards them, who have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed your Cruelty upon them theſe many years, by ſpoiling their Goods from time to time of them that are alive; and yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that all this Cruelty does not ſatisfie your unreaſonable Minds, that you have done to the Living, but you have ſhewn your Cruelty to the Dead, in that ſome of you in the Town of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenham</hi> have pulled the D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad out of the Grave in an inhumane manner, more like Beaſts of Prey then People that fear God, after the Body was decently buried, whereby you diſcover your ſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48885:46"/>
to be far worſe and more Cruel than thoſe accounted <hi>Heathen,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived among, who offered him a piece of Ground to bury his Dead in; but your Envy is ſo great againſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that you will not let them live at quiet amongſt you whilſt they live, nor let the Body lie quietly in the Grave when it was dead. And now I having viewed your Works, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your Actions, which are ſcarcely to be parallel'd for Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in this Nation, conſidering the long continuance of your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for which you have a large Account to give to the Lord, from the higheſt of you to the loweſt, that have had any hand in perſecuting your innocent Neighbours, without any juſt Cauſe by them given you.</p>
               <p>And now it is upon me from the Lord, to Warn you all that have had any hand in this Work, to Repent of this your Cruelty, and Abuſes offered and done unto his People, before it is too late, and the Day of your Viſitation paſſes over, and you be ſhut up in utter Darkneſs, and the Lord ceaſes to ſtrive with you, as he did with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, in whoſe ſteps you have walked in oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Children, and evil-entreating his Servants and Meſſengers that he has ſent amongſt you, to exhort you to turn from the Evil of your Ways, and the Violence that is in your Hands &amp; Hearts; but inſtead of receiving them and their Teſtimony, you have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to ſuffer; and them that did receive them and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, you have from time to time evilly required them, ſo that you would not receive them your ſelves, nor ſuffer them that would, if by all the Violence you could uſe hinder them. The Lord give you Repentance before it be too late and you be cut off, is the Deſire of him that chooſes rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to live in the Pleaſures of this World.</p>
