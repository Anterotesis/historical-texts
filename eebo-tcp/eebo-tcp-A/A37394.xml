            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am favoured with Yours of the 20th <hi>ult.</hi> whereby I perceive your pleaſure is, That I ſhould give you my Sentiments concerning Mrs. <hi>Sarah Stout</hi>'s Death, the Trial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In anſwer, I am very ſenſible of my own weakneſs, and how unfit I am to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Controverſie, wherein ſo many Doctors have been worried already: Nevertheleſs, in obedience to your reiterated Commands, though in doing it I may expoſe my own Ignorance, I ſhall give you my thoughts concerning the Natural Cauſe of Drowning, Floating of Dead Bodies afterwards, the various Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Doctors, the manner of her Death, the Letters produced in Court, her Melancholineſs, why no mention was made of the Money, and laſtly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning two publick Experiments, whereof one was made here, and the other in the River of <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a common Obſervation of moſt People, not uſed to dive, that upon their Plunging themſelves in the Water, whether it be <hi>voluntarily or involuntarily</hi> they find a great Confuſion of their Spirits; ſo that it is morally impoſſible for them to regulate their Actions in this Surprize, by the Dictates of Reaſon; in this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30262:3"/>
Conſternation they lay hold on any thing that comes in their way, not conſidering whether it may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their Sinking or Swiming.</p>
            <p>In this hurry of the Spirits, occaſioned partly from the noiſe their fall makes in the Water, and partly from its running into their Ears, Noſtrills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole Animal Oeconomy is brought into Diſorder; in this Confuſion it is no ways Supriſing, that Water, wherein they are immerſed, ſhould inſinuate it ſelf into ſome Vacuities, no ways adapted for its reception; and it being obvious to all, That no Man doth or can live without Reſpiration, whatever Element ſoever he is in; if in the Air, he ſucks that in which naturally flows into the Lungs; if in Water, what comes into the Mouth, as long as his Senſes continue, he ſwallows that down the Gullet; as long as he doth not Breath, there is little danger of Drowning; but on the firſt Inſpiration, if he is at the ſurface of the Water, 'tis much if he doth not ſwallow down the Wind-pipe, with the Air, ſome ſmall quantity of Water; but if he is totally immerſed in it, 'tis not improbable, that upon Inſpiration, a far greater quantity of Water than Air will enter into the Cavity of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>In every Expulſion of Air out of the Lungs, the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glottis</hi> is lifted up, if the Mouth at the ſame time ſhould be full of Water, 'tis impoſſible but ſome of it will paſs down the Wind-pipe, as is obſervable in thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally Laugh while they are a drinking, if a drop falls into the <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> it will cauſe a Coughing, which is a Convulſive Motion of the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Nature doth commonly throw up any thing that doth caſually fall upon them; by this ſtrugling of Nature, to expel the Water already ſlip'd down, the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> is lifted up, and inſtead of ejecting the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30262:3"/>
juſt ſwallowed, the Mouth being full of it, a great deal more forceth it ſelf down, by its natural gravity, which gravitates the more, by reaſon of the Cylinder or Cone of the Air, that continually preſſeth on its Superficies; as ſoon the Senſes are gone, the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> is kept open by the force of the Stream that runs into the Wind-pipe, till the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> and all their Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, are filled; as long as the Senſes continue, they ſwallow moſt of the Water that comes into their Mouths, into their Stomachs; but when they are near ſuffocated, the Water runs into thoſe Ducts, where it meets with the leaſt reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>So long as Life continues, there is a Convulſive Strugling of Nature, to expel out of the Lungs all thoſe things that are noxious to them, eſpecially Water, being never uſed to be Receptacles for any thing but Air, they uſe their utmoſt Efforts to eject it by a violent Contracting their Lobes nearer together; by theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Contractions, the Water contained in the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications of the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> &amp;c. are ſometimes forced in to the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> either by dilating the Pores of the thin Membrane that inveſts the Lungs, as Quick-Silver is forced by the preſſure of a Hand thro' a piece of Leather, or by the rupture of their Tunicle, or by ſome minute Veſſels, not yet deſcribed by <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> If any Practitioner in Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall aſſert, that <hi>Anatomy</hi> is brought to a <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> and that all Ducts, through which the Juices of Animals are ſtrained, are detected. I would deſire them to tell me through what Veſſels the <hi>Pus</hi> in an <hi>Empyema,</hi> where the matter lies on the Midriff, when there is no Ulcer of the Lungs, is expectorated, or through what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, when 'tis carried off by Urine, 'tis conveyed into the Kidneys, or how bitter Injections caſt into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30262:4"/>
               <hi>Thorax,</hi> can affect the Mouth with its taſte, as the Obſervations of Phyſicians do demonſtrate; or let them read a Treatiſe of <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> called, <hi>New Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Phyſico-Mechanical,</hi> touching the Spring of the Air; where, amongſt many curious Obſervations about the Lungs, he aſſerts, <hi>That the diligent</hi> Wallaeus <hi>relates, that he divers times obſerved in the Diſſection of Live Bodies, that the Membrane that inveſts the Lungs had Pores in it as big as the longer ſort of Peas.</hi> p. 343.</p>
            <p>Water is as frequently found in the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> as of the <hi>Thorax</hi>; but by what Ducts or Paſſages, when there is no viſible Rupture of the Coates of the Stomach nor Guts, they are carried there, I leave it to the Microſcoptical Anatomiſt to determine: I conceive it enough for me at preſent to tell you, that it is Fact. I am conſcious you are not ignorant, that there are many things that happen in the Animal Oeconomy, that cannot be proved <hi>a Priori</hi>; yet when they are <hi>a Poſteriori,</hi> they are admitted by the Schools, as undeniable Arguments; if any are ſo Sceptical as to deny what is not capable to be proved <hi>a Priori,</hi> they would be put to it to prove the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood, Motion of the Animal Spirits, or where or how the Chile is Tranſcolated through the Coats of the Guts.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Lungs, Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are full of Water, the Body naturally ſinks, and riſes no more till there is a Putrefaction in the inward parts, which in cold Countries is longer than in hotter Regions; but the ſooner Putrifaction is begun, the ſooner the Corps float, whereof no certain Calculation can be made, the time of their riſing differing, with reſpect to the Region, and in the ſame Climates with reſpect
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30262:4"/>
to the Seaſons of the Year; in theſe parts, according to the common reckoning, they float in Nine or Ten Days.</p>
            <p>The common Cauſe aſſigned for Floating of Bodies drown'd, is, the breaking of the Gall, which you know is a vulgar Error; ſo that I need ſay nothing in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it; The cauſe aſſigned by the Moderns, is Putrifaction, but how this Putrifaction renders the Body more boyant than 'twas before, is not obvious to every Eye, therefore I ſhall give you my thoughts concerning its <hi>Modus agendi,</hi> Putrifaction is a ſpecies of Fermentation; by Fermentation the Air contained in the Cavity of the Breaſt, Body, Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' ſeemingly full of Water, yet they contain, great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Air, which is rarified with the other Juices, proportionable to the Degrees of Putrifaction; and this inſenſible dilatation of the Body increaſes gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, till the Corruption hath made a paſſage through the Skin; ſo that a Perſon that is not above 20 Inches in Circuit when firſt drowned, after he hath lain ſome Weeks in the Water, will be at leaſt 30 or 40 Inches in Circumference; this gradual dilatation of the Body, I conceive is the ſole cauſe of its riſing to the Surface of the Water, after ſome certain time, and alſo of its more or leſs boyantneſs afterwards.</p>
            <p>Having given you my thoughts concerning the cauſe of drowning, of the Floating of their Corps afterwards; I ſhall now acquaint you with my Notions why Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies thrown Dead into the Water do not ſink, and why ſome are more boyant than others.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that Humane Bodies after Death admit no Water, eſpecially Suffocated, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment made ſome Weeks ſince, doth evidently Demonſtrate; becauſe, as ſoon as Death ſeizes a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30262:5"/>
Man, the Sphincter Muſcles in all parts do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contract themſelves, for which reaſon, it is not ſo eaſie to inject any Liquids into the parts that have them, as before; by this Secluſion of Water, the Vacuities (which in drowned Creatures are full of Water) are in thoſe that come by their Death ſome other way, full of Air, which by natural Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is proved to be as Thouſand Times lighter than Water; and by the ſame ſort of Experiments, ſolid Fleſh is obſerved to be but a little heavier than Water; if you grant this, which is eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, it will be no hard matter for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man to believe that Fleſh (which hath many large Cavities in it, filled with Air) may Float: If you doubt the immediate Floating of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies, thrown Dead into the Water, you may, for your Satisfaction, conſult the Opinion of Sea-men, who have been the laſt War in ſeveral Ingagements with the <hi>French,</hi> or thoſe that have been a <hi>Guiny</hi> Voyage; where, when they throw the Dead <hi>Negroes</hi> over-Board, they never lay any weight to their Feet to ſink them, as they do to white Men; it is certain that all thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> do immediatly Float, I have ſpoken with ſeveral, lately come from thence, that if occaſion were, would atteſt it with an Oath.</p>
            <p>Bodies are more or leſs boyant, either in reſpect to themſelves. or in reſpect to the <hi>Medium</hi> wherein they Float.</p>
            <p>If the Perſon Died in the very act of Inſpiration, the Lungs will be full of Air, by which the Breaſt will be ſenſibly dilated; that the filling of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> with Air, may be a cauſe of Floating, is evident from thoſe that can lye on their Backs without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30262:5"/>
hand or foot, it being obſervable that thoſe do fill themſelves as full of Air as they can, and that as long as they can hold their Breath they Float, but on the very inſtant of Breathing they Sink: If they have a large Cheſt, or are very Lean, they will Float the loftier.</p>
            <p>If they are caſt into Salt Water, they will be more boyant than in freſh, it being experimented that Ships will Sink ſome Inches lower under Water in the <hi>Thames,</hi> than when they were at Sea; if into deep Water, all Men obſerving they can Swim more eaſily in deep than in ſhallow Water.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if the Perſon died in Expiration had a ſmall Cheſt, was Fat and Fleſhy, or was thrown into freſh or ſhallow Waters, he will Swim the more under Water.</p>
            <p>I do not perceive ſo great a diſcordancy between the Doctors that were Evidences for the King, and their Oppoſites, as ſome ſeem to inſinuate. The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the King depoſed, That it was their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that no Perſon ever was, or poſibly could be drowned, that had no Water in their Lungs, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that as far as they had made any obſervations on drowned Perſons, they always found great quantities of Water in the inward parts of drowned Perſons; part thereof, uſually in lifting them out of the Water, runs out of their Noſe or Mouth, that upon their diſſection, they had found conſiderable quantities of it in the Cavities of their Bodies; and that it was their Judgment, that the inward parts of drowned Perſons would putrifie in leſs than ſix Weeks time: Whether theſe are not undeniable Truths, I leave it to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſelf, and all unbiaſſed People that have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30262:6"/>
made any real (not notional) Obſervations on drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Learned Antagoniſts, whoſe ſole endeavour and buſineſs, as far as I could perceive, was to render it a mute Caſe, by their ſtrenuouſly urging, <hi>That</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>Ounces of Water was ſufficient to Drown a Perſon,</hi> not from any Obſervations on Humane Bodies, but from a private Experiment on a Dog or two that was half hanged, as I am told, and I am apt to think there was ſome Artifice uſed, ſeeing the Experiment did not ſucceed, when made publickly in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> by the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Sloane</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Caſes of this kind are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common (viz.</hi> for Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> to be drowned without any Water in her) <hi>and none of them have fallen directly under my Knowledge</hi>; nor as I verily believe, under any other Perſons, ſince the Creation of Man: Then he tells you that <hi>Water ſwallowed by the Gullet, into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, will not drown the Perſon</hi> (Who ſaid the contrary?) <hi>But it is that which goes into the Wind-pipe and Lungs that Suffocates</hi>; and confirms it with an Obſervation, ſaying, I have obſerv'd <hi>Some Spoonfuls (if it went the wrong way) to have choaked or ſuffocated the Perſon.</hi> Note, he doth not ſay drowned, neither do I think any Perſon can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be drowned, that hath not ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 2 or 3 Ounces of Water, but rather ſuch are (as the Doctor ſaith) choaked or ſuffocated; in the ſame Paragraph he tells you, that <hi>Whether a Perſon comes Dead or a-live into the Water, he believes ſome quantity will go into the Wind-pipe</hi>: Then Water in the Wind-pipe is no certain Sign of a drowned Perſon, I am of another Opinion, which our Experiment doth ſeem undeniably to prove.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30262:6"/>Being asked by the Judge, Whether the parts would not putrifie in leſs than ſix Weeks, if there had been Water? His Anſwer was, <hi>My Lord, I am apt to think it would have putrified the Stomach leſs than the Lungs:</hi> How direct and ſatisfactory this anſwer was to the Queſtion, you may determine. I obſerve a general Queſtion, for what intention I cannot Divine; which was, Whether any Water would go into the Thorax? If it did, or did not, I cannot conceive what benefit or prejudice it would be to this Caſe, though I am apt to think the Membrane that inveſts the Lungs, may eaſily be torn by violent Coughing, which is obſerved in all Perſons when any thing falls into the Wind-pipe.</p>
            <p>Near the foot of his Diſcourſe, he ſaith, <hi>I am apt to think if there was any quantity</hi> (of Water) <hi>in the Lungs, the Spongineſs of the part would ſuck up ſome part of it</hi>; Who ſaid the contrary? But Doctor, If they had ſuck'd up any part, would not her Lungs have been moiſter, than if they had ſuck'd up none; but Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi>'s were rather dryer than uſually they are in dead Perſons; therefore — <hi>As to the Stomach I have not know it tryed,</hi> Have you known it tryed as to the Lungs? If not, we are as much in the dark as before, unleſs we take your <hi>I am apt to think</hi> for Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>This Doctor cloſes his Sentiments with <hi>If there was a great Fermentation, a great deal of it</hi> (Water) <hi>would riſe up in Vapours or Steams, and go off that way:</hi> Here he terminates all with an <hi>If:</hi> Suppoſe I ſhould grant him there was a great Fermentation, to be as true, as I am confident 'tis falſe; his inference I doubt would not follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>a great deal of it would riſe up in Vapours or Steams, and go off that way</hi>; if it ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30262:7"/>
riſe into Vapours in the Stomach, I am ſubject to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the coldneſs of the parts through which they muſt paſs, would condence them again, before they could get out of the Body; what way he means by <hi>That Way,</hi> I cannot imagine; if 'tis through the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the contraction of the Mouth of the Stomach, Gullet (which is as Dr. <hi>Gath</hi> ſays) contracted or purſed up by a Muſcle in the nature of a Sphincter, and the cloſure of the Lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would either keep them in the Stomach, or elſe the coldneſs of the part through which they muſt of neceſſity paſs, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe them in their paſſage out of the Body; if through the Guts, the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> the coldneſs of the Guts or the <hi>Sphincterani,</hi> would obſtruct their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if it could be imagined that the Subtleneſs of theſe Vapours could get throw the <hi>Coats</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; I conceive the coldneſs of the <hi>Omentum Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> and the thickneſs of the <hi>Muſcles, Fat,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> would impede their <hi>Exit</hi> out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: In fine, it ſeems very probable to me, that if there had been any fumes raiſed in the Stomach, by Fermentation, that they could never get an <hi>Exit</hi> through ſo many impediments.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Gath</hi> tells you, that <hi>It is impoſſible that the Body</hi> (of Mrs. <hi>Stout) ſhould have Floated, unleſs it had reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or been intangled amongſt the Stakes:</hi> This is a certain Truth, if ſhe had been drowned, but if ſhe was thrown in Dead, there is nothing more common than for it to Float; and this my Aſſertion, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to the Univerſal Experience of thoſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that uſe the <hi>Negro</hi>-Trade; for when any of their Slaves dye, they throw them over-Board, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any weight to their Feet, and theſe Float im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30262:7"/>That ſhe was found Sideling in the Water, is a mighty Argument with this Doctor that ſhe did not Float; but grant ſhe was intangled (which is denied by ſeveral) between the Stakes, as 'tis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, I think it no greater wonder, than for a Deal Board 12 Inches broad (which ſhould accidentally get edgwiſe between two Stakes not above 9 Inches diſtant one from the other) to Float edgeling, as long as 'tis intangled between them: Nay, on the contrary, I think it morally impoſſible for any Body that is much broader, than 'tis thick, if it caſually gets edgewiſe between to Stakes, whoſe diſtance will not let it lye flat, but it muſt continue more or leſs edgeling, till 'tis diſ-intangled.</p>
            <p>I obſerve the Judge asked this Gentleman, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water in the Body would putrifie it? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I ſay not, for in ſome places they keep Fleſh-Meat from corrupting, by preſerving it in Water:</hi> If he means Water in a deep Well will keep it a day or two in hot Countries, I may admit it; but that it will keep it ſix Weeks or more, I utterly deny it; if it will not keep Fleſh from Putrifaction 46 Days, it hath little Analogy with the Caſe under Debate.</p>
            <p>This Doctor tells you, <hi>He muſt differ from him</hi> (Mr. <hi>Coatſworth) where he infers, She was murthered, becauſe he found no great quantity of Water in her:</hi> This is a Miſtake, for neither he, nor any of the other Doctors, or Surgeons, that were preſent at her Diſſection, inferr'd ſhe was murdered, becauſe ſhe had no great quantity of Water in her; but, becauſe ſhe had none at all in her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30262:8"/>Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Theſe which ſeem to be the Queſtions of greateſt Moment, are, Whether there was a neceſſity for this Body (if drowned) to have a great quantity of Water in it; and whether Bodies thrown Dead into the Water Float? To the firſt I anſwer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, That there is no abſolute neceſſity that ſhe ſhould have a great quantity of Water in her:</hi> With ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Doctor, pray tell which of your Oppoſites ſaid there was an abſolute neceſſity for Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> to have a great quantity of Water in her; they ſaid, they could not conceive that ſhe was drowned, that had not one drop of Water in her; if you would have contradicted them, you ſhould have demonſtrated to the Jury, either by Reaſon or Experiments, how a Perſon might be drowned without any Water in them; if you could have done this, you had anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queſtion of greateſt Moment.</p>
            <p>This Doctors difference between Perſons drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Accident or Deſign, I would flatter my ſelf, was rather a <hi>lapſus linguae,</hi> than his real Judgment; for it is certain, with whatſomever deſign a Man may go into the Water, before he is half Dead he is deprived of his Senſes, and how he governs himſelf then, you may Judge: To <hi>The</hi> 2<hi>d Queſtion,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I think if Bodies new killed Float, 'tis by Accident:</hi> It is as accidental for Bodies new killed, when thrown into the Water, to Sink, as 'tis for Perſons juſt drowned to Swim.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Woolaſton</hi> being asked his Opinion, <hi>If a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be drowned, Whether it can be diſcovered ſix Weeks after?</hi> His anſwer was, <hi>I think it impoſſible to be known:</hi> I am apt to be of his Opinion, that 'tis impoſſible preciſely to determine what, and how many Injuries her <hi>Viſcera</hi> had received, or what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30262:8"/>
had happened unto them 46 days after any Perſon is drowned; for naturally they would have been putrified in half that time; and when the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are reduced into a <hi>Putrilaginous Mucilage,</hi> who can give a rational judgment concerning their former Figure, Poſition, or how they had been affected? This is what naturally happens to a drowned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but there was nothing of this in Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> which is no ſmall Argument with me, that ſhe was not drowned; I ſhall take little notice how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his Brothers, by his affirming, <hi>That in drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons, the Water lyes only in the Stomach and Guts:</hi> As to his Experience, I doubt he is not can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did; for I believe I have heard the ſame Story, which was thus, Two Man quarrelling in a <hi>Wherry,</hi> one of them took up the Stretcher, and knock'd the other down; in his falling, he accidentally caught hold of his Adverſary, and they both fell into the Water together; he that was knock'd down was not ſwell'd, but the other was exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> affirms, <hi>That it is not reaſonable</hi> (in Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> though drowned) <hi>to expect any thing but Froath:</hi> What, will all the Water turn to Froath, that a dying Perſon receives before he is drowned? 'Tis a Paradox to me: How contrary this Surgeon's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are to the Univerſal Experience of the Learned and Unlearned part of Mankind, let the unbiaſſ'd judge? If he had conſulted <hi>Ambroſe Parey,</hi> and had thought him a reaſonable Man, doubtleſs he would have been of another Opinion, who ſaith, <hi>The Belly of him that was thrown in a-live, will be ſwollen or puffed up by reaſon of the Water that is contained therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:30262:9"/>The whole ſtreſs of this Gentleman's Arguments ſeem to depend on a ſuppoſed difference, that there is between Perſons that Drown themſelves, and thoſe that are caſually ſuffocated by Water; whereas I am apt to think there is little more difference, than between one that puts the Halter about his own Neck, and one that the Hang-man forceth it on; here is a parity of cauſes, why the effects in the ſame Species ſhould extremely differ, is more than my weak intellect can comprehend; in both I conceive that in leſs than a Minute, their Rational Faculty is ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly diſtorted, that nothing is done regularly or by its dictates.</p>
            <p>The verity of his private Experiments I doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he made a publick one, it infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted his Clandeſtine ones; there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in drowning a Creature in a Tub, and in a River, in ſinking him with a weight tied to him, and permitting him to Sink by his own gravity; I am not of Opinion that 'tis ridiculous to expect Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> tho' the Lungs had not ſuffered an Impoſtumation, or the like, for Reaſons formerly aſſigned.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Crell</hi> ſaith, He ſhall only <hi>inſiſt upon what</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Parey <hi>relates in his Chapter of Renunciations— He tells us, That the certain Sign of a Man's being drowned is an appearance of Froth about his Noſtrills and Mouth, which could not be, as he declares, if the Perſon had been ſtrangled, or otherwiſe killed before.</hi> For the Confirmation, or Confutation, of theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſertions of this Learned Doctor, I ſhall give you the <hi>Verbal</hi> Expreſſions of <hi>Ambroſe Parey, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is found Dead in the Waters, you ſhall know whether they were thrown into the Water
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30262:9"/>
alive or dead, for all the Belly of him that was thrown in alive will be ſwell'd and puff'd up, by reaſon of the Water that is contained therein; certain clammy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements come out of his Mouth and Noſtrils.</hi> In the foregoing Paragraph he gives you the Signs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one is hanged Dead or Alive; his formal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are, <hi>If he was hang'd alive, there will be a Foam about his Mouth, and a Foamy and Filthy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hanging out of his Noſtrils.</hi> Obſerve this Author, whereon he <hi>only</hi> inſiſts ſaith, There is a Foam and Filthy Matter about the Mouth and Noſtrils of them that are hanged Alive. Now whether Froath at the Mouth and Noſtrils is a certain Sign of a Man's being Drowned, or whether it is not incident to Perſons that die of other Diſeaſes, any Phyſitian can eaſily determine. If you will be pleaſed to read <hi>Paulus Zachaeus</hi>'s <hi>Queſtiones Medico-Legales,</hi> on the ſame Subject, you may find that he agrees with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Parey,</hi> That an appearance of Foam about the Noſtrils and Mouth, is no certain Sign of Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By ſuch poſitive Aſſertions of the Learned, how eaſily may the Ignorant be impoſed on? By this you may evidently ſee the difference between a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on his <hi>Parole,</hi> as this Gentleman was, and one upon his Oath, as the King's were.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Herriot</hi> being asked by Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> What Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations he had made concerning this Matter? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, When I was a Surgeon in <hi>the Fleet, I made it always my Obſervation, when we threw Men over-board that were killed, ſome of them Swam and ſome Sunk.</hi> Then being Interogated by the Judge, when a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is thrown over-board, doth it Sink or Swim? His anſwer was, <hi>I always obſerved that it did ſink.</hi> What Incoherence is here! Firſt, I made it always
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30262:10"/>
my Obſervation, when we threw Men over-board, that were killed, ſome of them Swam, and ſome Sunk: And almoſt in the ſame Breath ſaith, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved, That it (a Dead Body, thrown over-board) did Sink. I am apt to be of Mr. <hi>Herriot</hi>'s Mind; as to his firſt Aſſertion, That Men killed in a Fight being thrown over-board, ſome of them Sunk, others Swam; thoſe whoſe Breaſt and Belly are no ways injured Float, but thoſe whoſe Breaſt and Belly are perforated, ſo that Water gets into their <hi>Cavities,</hi> through the Wound, I doubt not but they will Sink.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bartlett</hi> tells you, He never <hi>ſaw any Body float, tho' he had been in ſeveral Engagements.</hi> It is very probable, he kept himſelf all that time in the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and it may be long after dreſſing the wounded Perſons. The fitteſt Perſons in this caſe to give their Obſervation, are Officers and Sea-Men, who are always upon Deck, and often obliged to look out, and not Surgeons, who are all the time of Engagements, ſecured in the Hold of the Ship.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camlin</hi> ſaith, <hi>There were more and greater Signs of the Stagnation of Blood on the Body of this Child, than on the Body of Mrs.</hi> Stout. But on what parts theſe <hi>more and greater Signs</hi> were, whether on the Breaſt, Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not one word. The Mother of the Child aſſerts, there was not the leaſt Sign of any Stagnation of Blood on any part of her Child: She having lately had the Small-Pox, her Face where the Small-Pox had fluxed, was ſomewhat diſcoloured; but it was no more diſcoloured, after her Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than it uſed to be (when ſhe was cold) before her Death; the Soil of the Water doth generally alter the Faces of People: So Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30262:10"/>
not known by her Neigbours, till that was wiped off. The Settlements of Blood on Mrs. <hi>Stout</hi> were diſperſedly on her Ear, both ſides of her Neck, Breaſt, Arm, but on what part of the Child's Body theſe <hi>more and greater Signs of Stagnation were,</hi> he doth not ſpecifie, becauſe had he aſſigned any particular place, there were ſeveral preſent that would have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted him: General Terms are the fitteſt covers for Falſhood.</p>
            <p>If this Gentlewoman was not Drowned, as the Doctors and Surgeons for the Priſoners ſeem to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, the <hi>Query</hi> then will be, How ſhe came to her End? With ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, I ſhall here offer my private Sentiments concerning it: I am induced to believe, ſhe was knocked down with a Blow on her left Ear, from the large Settlement of Blood there, which, as Mrs. <hi>Kimpſon</hi> Swears, was as much as her Hand could cover, and more; after ſhe was fell'd to the Ground by the Blow, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, with the Gripe of a ſtrong Hand, ſhe was Throtled; from the Stagnation of Blood on both ſides of her Neck, under her Ears, which Mr. <hi>John Dimſdall,</hi> Jun. Swears there was; and from the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Blood on her Breaſt, I am inclined to believe, That the Perſon that Throtled her, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Hand, that he might Gripe the ſtronger, reſted his Arm on her Breaſt, which occaſioned the Stagnation there.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances that induce me to think ſhe was not acceſſary to her own Death, are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Her being found without her Gown (which probably was torn in the Scuffle) and Nightrail; her Gown could not be found, though the River was diligently raked ſeveral times, till about a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30262:11"/>
the Trial, it was found hanging on a Stake, which the Miller had cleanſed from the Traſh that hung on it about half one hour before, and he will depoſe that it was not there then; it was torn to Raggs, without one of its Sleeves, ſome parts of it were as rotten as dirt, others firm; you might tear it (which was made of a ſort of <hi>Norwich</hi>-Stuff) and the Lining (which was a Silk Damask) with your Fingers, as I did: <hi>Query,</hi> Whether Stuff or Silk will naturally Rot ſo ſoon under Water? Here is no news of her Nightrail yet. 2. From her Floating; whereof I make no doubt, becauſe it is Sworn by ſeveral Witneſſes. 3. Becauſe her Belly was not ſwollen. 4. Becauſe no Water came out of her when lifted out of the River, nor purged out of her afterwards. 5. Becauſe her inward parts were not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, though her outward, that had been injured, were; which I ſuppoſe was impoſſible they ſhould have continued ſo 46 days after her Death, had there been any Water in them. 6. From the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtinct Setlings of Blood, which is unuſual in Drowned Perſons; if it had been occaſioned (as ſome may think) from a Blow, which ſhe received when ſhe threw her ſelf in, I am ſubject to believe, that the coldneſs of the Water, in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> would have hindered its Settlement in the Cutaneous parts of the Body, as it is generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to do; for what is more common than to dip a Linnen Rag, or a piece of Brown Paper, in cold Water, and apply it to a bruiſed part, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Blood from ſetling there? 7. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diſturbance that Mrs. <hi>Gurrey</hi> was under, both in Mind and Body: Nevertheleſs ſhe would not diſcover it till ſhe was almoſt frighted out of her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30262:11"/>
Senſes, by the Voice, as ſhe thought of Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> which uttered theſe words, <hi>Divulge, Conceal Nothing.</hi> 8. From what is Sworn by the <hi>Gurrey</hi>'s againſt their Lodgers at the Trial, <hi>viz. Mr.</hi> Marſon <hi>was hot, and put by his Wigg; I ſee his Head was wet — they came in about</hi> 11 <hi>and</hi> 12 <hi>a Clock — ſhe turned me off, but a Friend of mine will be even with her by this time — Her buſineſs was done — He would paſs his Word, Mrs.</hi> Sarah Stout<hi>'s Courting-Days were over—The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe-Money is paid to Night — You have Forty or Fifty Pounds for your ſhare — Asked him, Whether the buſineſs was done? And he anſwered, He believed it was; but if it was not done, it would be done to Night— Pulled a Handful of Money out of his Pocket, and Swore, he would ſpend it all for Joy, the buſineſs was done.</hi> 9. From the Sentiments of the <hi>Grand-Jury,</hi> who, after a nice Examination, were of an Opinion, That ſhe was Murdered; as were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of, the <hi>Petty-Jury,</hi> but by whom they did not know—</p>
            <p>As to the Letters produced in Court, my thoughts are, they are not of a Legitimate, but of a Spurious Production. 1. Becauſe the Stile doth no way ſuit her Character. 2. Becauſe her Mother doth affirm, The Letter ſhown her in Court was of a ſmaller Character than ever ſhe obſerved her Daugher to Write; neither doth her Brother think them to be <hi>genuine.</hi> 3. Becauſe there was no mention made of theſe Letters, till the common Report of her being with Child (which had been induſtriouſly ſpread abroad by ſeveral, but by none more Zealouſly, than by a <hi>Nominal Quaker,</hi> her <hi>Quondam Admirer</hi>) was proved to be utterly Falſe, by the Oath of ſeveral
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30262:12"/>
Doctors and Surgeons that had opened her <hi>Body.</hi> 4. Becauſe Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> on the Trial, Sware (and ſeveral of the <hi>Coroners-Inqueſt</hi> were ready to Swear) That Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> before the <hi>Coroners-Inqueſt,</hi> being on his Oath, depoſed, <hi>That Mrs.</hi> Stout <hi>was a modeſt Perſon, that he did not know of any thing that was the cauſe of it (viz.</hi> her Death) <hi>That he did not know any Perſon ſhe was in Love with, but of one, whoſe name was</hi> Marſhall; <hi>and Mr.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>told him, That he was always Repulſed by her.</hi> Whether this Oath is not Diametrically Oppoſite to his Pleadings on the Trial, you may determine. 4. Becauſe they did not inſiſt on theſe Letters, when Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid, <hi>Indeed they have produced ſome Letters without a Name; but if they inſiſt upon any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Reputation, we muſt call our Witneſſes.</hi> If the Witneſſes then preſent in Court (who were ſome of the moſt reputable in that Town) had been called, to ſpeak to her Reputation, a great deal of that Dirt, that is now caſt upon her, would have been wiped off. I cannot but take notice here how ſeemingly unwilling he was to expoſe the weakneſs of this Gentlewoman, or to meddle with her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, had he not <hi>thoſe Innocent Gentlemen to defend</hi>; when before her Death he had ſhewn them to Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> a Repulſed Lover, and his Brother, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Trial, the Printers, who at the Trial did not take them in Short-hand, were favoured with them to be expoſed to the whole World.</p>
            <p>What concerns her Melancholly, I am induced to believe, that ſhe was no more than is incident to all People that are Sickly, or much troubled with the Head-ach; from what her Maid Swears, <hi>That ſhe was ill ſometimes, and I imputed it</hi> (Melancholly)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30262:12"/>
               <hi>to her Illneſs; and I know no other cauſe.</hi> And Mrs. <hi>Walker</hi> doth aſſert, That Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> told the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners-Inqueſt,</hi> That he did not obſerve her any ways Melancholly, that he ſhould have taken notice of, had not ſuch an accident happened; only now he remembers, That ſhe was not ſo free in Diſcourſe at Dinner as ſometimes ſhe uſed to be; and that the Diſcourſe then was chiefly between him and her Mother. Her Mother and Brother do affirm they never obſerved her Melancholly, and all her intimate Companions do aſſert the ſame: It is much that none but this Gentleman's Siſter, and Two or Three others, devoted to a Party, ſhould obſerve any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> his Wife, and ſeveral others that were in her Company, with Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> do affirm, that ſhe did not ſay her Head-cloths would ſerve her time, or any thing like it, and that they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſcourſe with her pure <hi>Banter</hi>; that ſhe was in her Night-dreſs, and preſently went home and put on clean Linnen: I am apt to think there are many Relations and Friends, bigotted to a Party, that will not boggle to tell a Lie, to ſave a Friend, or near Relation from —</p>
            <p>The afternoon before her Death, ſhe was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſtand, to ſee the Judges make their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, with her Friends, as Brisk and Airy as any there; about 4 hours before her Death, as <note place="margin">☜</note> I am told, ſhe was in Company with a Knight of that County, and ſeveral others, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her to be as Merry and Pleaſant as any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: At nine at Night, ſhe earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned a young Gentlewoman of that Town, to tarry and lye with her that Night, as ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30262:13"/>
done ſeveral times; which ſhe refuſed then, for ſome particular Reaſons: When Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſhe would not tarry all Night, ſhe invited her to Dinner next day, and told her what ſhe had provided, and that ſhe ſhould be glad of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; not intending to go out of Doors the next day.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think that if ſhe had been ſuch a furious Lover as is pretended, or had any Intention that Night to deſtroy her ſelf, that ſhe would not have fallen out with any Body about the payment of Money; much leſs have refuſed to Sign a Receit for ſix Pounds, which her D—ſt had prepared when he paid her the Intereſt-Money; what was the true cauſe why ſhe refuſed to Sign this Receit, is a Riddle to moſt.</p>
            <p>If ſhe had had ſo great a kindneſs for ſome Years for this <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as is inſinuated, certainly his Wife would have obſerved ſomething of it; and then ſhe would not be importuning her every Month, by her Letters, to come to <hi>London,</hi> that ſhe might injoy her ſweet Company: Neither would ſhe in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability (if ſhe had been ſo deſperately in love with him) have lived here ſeveral Months together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Company, even when importuned by his Wife; but would, as we may reaſonably conjecture, have reſided in your City, where ſhe might the oftner, and more privately have injoyed his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And, as for her going out at the Window, it is morally impoſſible, the Bars being ſo cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that a Child of a Year old cannot get out between them; neither was there any occaſion for it, the Keys being always left in the Doors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:30262:13"/>Becauſe there is no mention made on the Trial, of the miſſing of any of her Money; ſeveral are apt to report that her Relations want none of it, which is a grand Miſtake; for they want, as they compute it, at leaſt a Thouſand Pounds of her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Fortune, beſides the Improvements ſhe had made thereon, which were conſiderable; they made little mention of it there (that was taken notice of) becauſe their Evidences that could ſpeak mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially to that point, were <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will not be taken in Criminal Caſes.</p>
            <p>The laſt Aſſizes, here was a Man hanged, after he was Dead, was cut down, and buried without a Coffin, the Grave filled up, and the Earth well trod down; in the Evening he was digg'd up again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed almoſt flat by the weight of the Earth, was privately caſt into the River, and when it was obſerved that the Corps would Sink, it was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to publick view, and an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> of it was printed in the <hi>Poſt-Man</hi> 25th of <hi>July</hi> laſt, with a great ſhew of Exaltation, by their ſaying, <hi>Many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds having ſeen this Experiment with their own Eyes, the Opinions of the Surgeons produced on the part of the King, is thereby deſtroyed and exploded, and all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons convinced of the contrary:</hi> What influence this Experiment may have on you, I know not; but when all the Circumſtances attending it are duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I am of Opinion, it will make more againſt them, than their Oppoſites: If they had been certain of Succeſs, what need of ſo much Art; Why did they not inſert in their <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> how the Body had been managed before 'twas thrown into the Water, how they opened it afterwards, and how they made a ſtrict Scrutiny after Water, yet could
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30262:14"/>
not find a drop in it? Not one word of this. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this partial Relation is calculated on purpoſe to magnifie their own Evidences, and put a ſlur on the King's.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the ingenious Contrivers of this Experiment did not only expect it would Sink, but that it would have ſome Water in it alſo; I am apt to think it reaſonable, to expect that the weight of the Earth would have driven out the Wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the Breaſt through the Wind-pipe, which is impoſſible to be done without lifting up of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which continually cloſes the Mouth of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> but in Expiration, this being once forcibly removed out of its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scituation, 'twas very likely that it would not cover it again ſo nicely, but that ſome ſmall quantity of Water might inſinuate it ſelf through the ſmall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which the violent forcing out of the Air had made; if this had ſucceeded, What a Triumph there would have been, you may eaſily determine?</p>
            <p>Some Weeks ſince, a Surgeon, that had been an Evidence at the Trial at <hi>Hertford,</hi> going into a <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller</hi>'s Shop, meeting ſome acquaintance there, he fell into Diſcourſe about Mrs. <hi>Stout,</hi> and aſſerted there, what he had affirmed at the Trial, <hi>viz. That Two or Three Ounces of Water will Drown a Dog:</hi> One of the Company told him he <hi>could not conceive that ſo ſmall a quantity would do the buſineſs:</hi> He replyed, <hi>Sir, I will lay a Guinea, that I will Drown a Dog in the River of</hi> Thames, <hi>and he ſhall not have above Three Ounces of</hi> Water <hi>in him:</hi> The proffer was no ſooner made, than accepted, Time appointed, Dog brought, and with a weight tyed to his hinder Feet, flung into the River, ſometime after was taken out,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30262:14"/>
and diſſected; where inſtead of <hi>Three Ounces,</hi> there was about <hi>Thirty Three</hi>; whereby he not only loſt his Wager, but in a great meaſure his Reputation, as to what he had ſo confidently aſſerted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary on the Trial.</p>
            <p>Having in ſome meaſure anſwered your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, tho' by it, I have, I am afraid, a little too much treſpaſſed on your Patience, ſhall take little notice now, what Omiſſions and Alterations there are in the Printed Trial; how Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> was taken with a ſtrange ſort of a Fit, (juſt after the Petty-Jury went out) which diſturbed the whole Court; or how a <hi>Wine-Cooper</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> (who came down as an Evidence for the Priſoners) fell into a ſort of Diſtraction; and all the time of the Trial was mightily diſcompoſed in his Mind, ſo that he was fain to be tyed in Bed, yet would often ask how the Trial went, and whether they were like to be cleared, and would often tell the People about him, that he had done a very bad thing, but would not confeſs what, though often urged to it: But ſhall conclude, deſiring that the Authors of this Horrid Murder may be detected, and brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment; but that the Innocent may be cleared from all Aſperſions thrown undeſervedly on them, which I doubt not, but that the Great <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> in his own time, will bring to paſs: And that it may be ſo, ſhall be the dayly Prayers of</p>
