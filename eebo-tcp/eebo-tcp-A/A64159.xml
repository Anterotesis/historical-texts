            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ereticks, Schismaticks, Novellists, Seperatists, have beene in all ages, and long before the Gospel was preached: there were amongst the Jewes a Sect who called themselves <hi>Abel<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sts, of Abel</hi> the Proto-Martyr of the world, who required such chastity in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that they would admit of no congresse, or mutuall consocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt man and wife: but it was an Heresie suddenly set up, and as soone suppressed. The <hi>Essees,</hi> or <hi>Esseans,</hi> retired themselves to solitude, and separated themselves from the Congregations, who were abstemious in their diet, and strict and austere in all their deportments, harmelesse to others, onely rigid to themselves, in so much that it is observed, that our Saviour was silent concerning them, when he so severely reproved the Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, and Sadduces. The Pharisees strived to come neere to the Law, and were a strict and exact Sect, but corrupt both in their doctrine, demeanour, and conversations. The Sadduces were but few, but those great and rich men, who were of a more obtuse and stupid apprehension, denying the resurrection.</p>
            <p>To come to our owne home, almost in every domesticke Diocesian Parish, we have Novellists, some <hi>Thraskites,</hi> or <hi>Sabbaterians, Banisterians, Brownists,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> which puts mee in mind of a young Lubber of that Sect, who being brought as a witnesse to take his oath in Court, and the Judge by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent asking of what age hee was? who answered him, that he was 3 yeares old. Three yeares old (replyed the Judge) and no more? how can that possibly be, seeing thou art of that full growth and bignesse? Who answered him gain Uerily I reckon mine age but from the time since I was last baptized. Then we have your <hi>Familists:</hi> but of all the rest which is of greatest remark, there is sprung up a new Sect of <hi>Adamists,</hi> who take their denomination from our first father <hi>Adam,</hi> and these with men and women promiscuously mingled, have their private meetings, where they will not heare the Word preached, nor have the Sacrament administred unto them, but naked, not so much as fig-leave breeches upon them, thinking thereby to imitate our first Parents in their innocency. Some of these Separatists have their Conventions within the wals of the City. Others have made their assembly in the fields, some in woods, and upon <hi>Hye-gate and Hamsted</hi> hils, and such like places. In some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93624:2"/>
families the women catechize and preach, making the back side of her gro<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chaire the Pulpit, their prayers being unpremeditate and without president; for nothing can passe muster, which proceeds from their mouths, which is not extravagant <hi>ex tempore.</hi> Nay, some most prophanely, I may say blasphemously, have beene heard to say, that they could make a better prayer than that which our Saviour himselfe taught to his Disciples.</p>
            <p>Further, these our Sectaries will endure no degrees in Schooles, all learning must be layd by, Academyes are to them abhominable, thereby co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering with the grand Adversary of our Christian saith the Turk, who will suffer no University thorow his whole Deminions: All his Creatures must be Souldiers, no Schollers, nor suffred to meddle with the <hi>Alcaron,</hi> but the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and those idolatrous <hi>Flamins</hi> belonging to the Order: nay, herein they punctually comply with the Papists, whose doctrine they pretend utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abhor; who hold that Ignorance is the mother of Devotion. And of these opinions was <hi>How,</hi> the notorious Predicant Cobler, whose body was buried in the high way by <hi>Dame Agnes á Cleere,</hi> and his Funerall Sermon preached by one of his Sect in a Brewers Cart. Such an Anti-Bishop was <hi>Eaton,</hi> the famous Button-maker in Saint Martins, and a Shooe-maker that dwelt betwixt <hi>Pauls Chaine</hi> and <hi>Old Fish-street,</hi> whose name I remember not, and now the onely famous seeming Predicants are one <hi>Greene</hi> a Felt-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, and a fellow who was once a Serving-man. To rip up all the whole rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would take up too great time, and blot too much paper.</p>
            <p>Hence come those violent outrages, and sacrilegious disorders committed in the Church, even in the time of Divine Service, and hubbub, and strange tumults raised, where nothing but reverent silence ought to be used, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent hands upon the Minister, rending his Master of Arts hood from his neck, and tearing the Surplice to filters upon his back, he hardly scaping from being torne peece meale in his owne person, and this even when the Psalme was singing, and the Preacher ready to goe up to deliver his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as like wise rending the railes from before the Communion Table, and then chopping them in peeces, and burning them in the Church-yard, and this to be ryotously done wit<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>out authority, commission, or order. But when any man shall take upon him a further power than peaceable Justice requireth, he perisheth from the Church; and whilst he proudly lifts up himselfe, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his owne arrogant presumption, he is bereft of the light of the truth.</p>
            <p>And now of late lest these supermysticall Sectists should be wanting in the Land, there is lately come over from <hi>New England,</hi> as from a <hi>New Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> one <hi>Samuel Eaton</hi> a Minister, who preached at <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> Church in <hi>Chester,</hi> that the very names of Parsons and Uicars were Antichristian, that Pastours and Teachers of particular Congregations, must be chosen by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93624:3"/>
the people, that all humane inventions, in which he comprehends the Booke of Common Prayer, &amp;c. are to God unsavoury and loathsome, that all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall censures of Excommunication, and the like, ought to bee exercized by particular Congregations within themselves: Hee further denyes all Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesian Churches, &amp;c. And further, at <hi>Knuts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a Market Towne in the same Countie, that every particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an absolute Church, and it is to have all Ordinances and Officers within it selfe, that the members thereof must be only Saints, who must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into covenant amongst themselves, and no covenant no Church, and that it was a grievous sin to be present where Prayers were read out of any book whatsoever, either by the Minister or any other, &amp;c. Two or three houres did our learned Felt-maker preach, and declare himselfe to his deare brethren and good sisters, which expressions took very well. And these are they that prate, not preach, like men raptur'd with their owne spirituall non-sense. I cannot stand upon the miserable inconveniences depending upon this fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall doctrine, of which I could wish there were not so many simple seduced Disciples.</p>
            <p>Now all these Innovators in generall, are Arch-enemies to Lent, Saints Eves, Ember weeks, Fast dayes, and Good Fridayes. Imagine their Exercise is done, and high time to goe to refresh themselves; this holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which preached this and the like sort of Doctrine, was envited to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brothers house to dinner, which was there present, and being come and meat set upon the table, and all the Saints set at boord, hee began to say Grace, which is to this effect, having first surveyed every dish, and in what order it was placed at the boord, he began his thanksgiving as followeth.</p>

These are boyl'd Chickens (I take it) let this dish of Chickens put us in mind of our Saviour, who would have gathered <hi>Hierusalem</hi> together as an Hen gathereth her chickens, but she would not: but let us praise God for these chickens, which are set before us, being six in number. Let this leg of Mutton call us to remembrance, that King <hi>David</hi> was once a Shepherd; and so was <hi>Christ</hi> the son of <hi>David.</hi> that good Shepherd, who having an hundred sheep, and losing one, to find that left ninetie and nine in the wildernesse. Here is an excellent Loyne of Ueale, let that prompts us to remember the Parable of the Prodigall child, whom to welcome home, the Father caused the fat calfe to be killed, which I thinke could not yeeld a better rump and kidney than is now visible before our eyes. And by this cramm'd and well fed capon, let us be mindfull of the cock, which

crowed three times, when <hi>Peter</hi> had as often denyed his Master, for which he went out and wept bitterly. These Rabbets re collect us to think (having worne fur upon their backs) of the two wicked Elders, that lay in wait to betray the chastity of <hi>Susanna:</hi> but I feare I have too much over-shot my selfe in alleaging any example out of the prophane Apocrypha. What see I there? a Potato pye, and a Sallad of Sparagus, these are stirring meats, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to procreation, by which good God, wee desire thee that according to thy blessings to our first parents in Paradise, we may increase and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. And when that Gamond of <hi>Westphalia</hi> Bacon comes to be cut up, let us think of that herd of Swine, into which by the permission of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the Devils entered, and from an high rock hurried them headlong into the sea. And as for these thy good blessings that are from the land, so likewise make us thankfull for this thy bounty sent us from the sea, and first for this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And though these Lobsters seeme to be in red coats like Cardinals, having clawes like Usurers, and more hornes than the Beast of Rome, which is the Whore of Babylon; yet having taken off their Papisticall copes and cases, let us freely feed upon what is within; for God regardeth not the outside, but the inside of man. I conclude with the fruit, which may it by thy grace so fructifie in our hearts, that these Pippins may put vs in mind of the Apple of the forbidden Tree, which our Grand mother <hi>Eve</hi> (by the temptation of the Serpent) tasted in the middle of the Garden. For had she not, vild wretch, eaten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forbidden apple, all our Crabs had bin very good Pippins, and all our Thistles had beene very good Harti-choaks. And these Carawayes call to our remembrance that Manna which was like Coriander seed, by which the children of Israel were fed forty yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the wildernesse. Thus as briefly as I can, I have gone thorow every dish on the boord, for every sundry dish ought to have a severall blessing. And now let us fall too, and feed exceedingly, that after our full repast, wee may the bettor prophesie.</p>

who forsoking, and utterly renouncing all the prophane and Papisticall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies here at home, have left the Land, to professe the more pure and sincere truth and doctrine abroad; as also for the seperated Saints here amongst us, the Elders and Deacons of our Cougregations wheresoever assembled, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any private houses within the city, or in any Cow-house, Barne, or Stable without the wals or whether in the fields, woods, or groves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the holy Assembly is convented and gathered. As for the prophane Churches, in which Idols have been formerly worshipped, and Copes and Surplices (the garments of the great Babylonish Whore) are still worne, we utterly abhor them: Neither let us forget that holy and good mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, who never spake unto us but with a great measure of the Spirit, I meane Master <hi>How</hi> the Cobler; nor those Christian admonitions which were broken unto us by the breath of Master <hi>Eaton,</hi> the Button-maker in <hi>Saint Martins:</hi> nor those godly instructions which issued from the mouth of Master <hi>Greene</hi> the Felt-maker, with all the rest of their sanctified Society: As also for all our she fellow-Labourers in this our holy and good work, I meane those blessed and fruit-bearing women, who are not only able to talk on any Text, but search into the deep sense of the Scripture, and preach both in their owns families and else where. Whom though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forbade to preach in the Church, yet he left them liberty to preach in the chambers: nay, we all therefore, both brethren and sisters, so use our Talents together, that the brethren may be daily regenerate and new borne, and the sisters so labour in their severall vocations, that it may be the encrease and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these thy Saints, Amen.</p>

            <p>After which they prepared for their after-noons Exercise. You have heard what doctrine hath beene preached by Master <hi>Samuel Eaton</hi> and others in the countrey, now you shall heare part of a Sermon preached, which was by one of the Elders, who was pickt out for that dayes Exercise, who took his Text the 12. <hi>of the Revelation,</hi> the 7 verse: <hi>And there was a battell in heaven, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fought against the Dragon, &amp;c.</hi> Grace &amp; peace be multiplied. This Text dearly beloved brethren, and most dearly beloved sisters, may not unproperly be applyed to these present times, and to acts late in agitation, here is a combat spoken of betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: now my deare brethren and sisters; first, to enquire who is persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and who pointed at in the Dragon and his Angels. To save you men your looking, and you women your longing, I will tell you both, and that briefly thus. By this <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels in my Text, is meant one particular Church, and peculiar Church: and you deare Saints of both sexes have bin sensible, you know many yeares we have most miserably suffered in all servitude and slavery: Now by the Dragon, the holy Ghost labours to delineate unto the great Dragon and Devill of Lambeth. I say unto you againe brethren, wicked Angels are the Bishops Deanes, Arch Deacons, Prebends, non residents, which

live without the care and charge of soules; I could have expressed it in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, but I hold it to bee the language of the beast of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as a Heathenish language: besides his other Procters, Prosectors, Pursuivants, Pariters, and all other his Ecclesiasticall Ministers and Officers. I had almost forgot his Advocates, Surrogates, with the Judges of his spirituall and Prerogative Courts, all which (brethren) are abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination in the eyes of the Lord &amp; their very names stink in his nostrils: The Bishops function, deare brethren, is an Anti-christian calling; &amp; the Deanes &amp; prebends are the frogs &amp; the locusts mention'd in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> There is none of these <hi>Bishops</hi> but hath a pope in their bellies: I will tell you, deare brethren, they be papists in grain; they are all of them unleavin'd soules, &amp; now, I say, we have turned them over to be buffeted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vgly fin Satan. What then shall we say of all his toyes and popish trincats? his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and innovations? Or what shall we think of their Altars, Images, unhallowed hoods, Surpleces and Coaps, with their unchristian cornerd Caps: their Palls, Albs, Rochets, Crosiers, Miters, Crosses, with all their traditions, Ceremonies, and unsanctified Superstitions? What my brethren (my sisters not forgotten) are but as the very rags dropt from the whore of Babylons rotten garments: nay, their cleanest washt Surpleses are at the best but like Po<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they passe by it: then there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother crosse, which is our eare-sore, as well as our eye-sore, deare brethren, that is, those pipes, or Organs, as the reverend Scots Ministers call them; which makes more noyse with their roaring, than all the Bulls of <hi>Bason</hi> did, when <hi>Og</hi> their King passed by them in triumph.</p>
            <p>What further may we liken that dogmaticall Dragon to: this litigious Arch Priest of Lambeth, than to a tyrannicall <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a politick <hi>Achitophel</hi> a wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> a cunning <hi>Caiphas,</hi> a iugling <hi>Pilot,</hi> a bloudy minded <hi>Herod,</hi> a persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> and though he were a Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, yet for a long time bore him as proudly as that Apocallypticall Beast of <hi>Rome</hi> with seven heads of impietie and ten hornes of iniquity: for how hath he persecuted this little flock of ours? and when he would not be seene in it himselfe, be imployed his apostaticall agents to disturbe us in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, and debar us the libertie of our Consciences: and my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren &amp; beloved sisters, was not this the very device ofan old <hi>D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

bee called the <hi>Michaelists,</hi> or <hi>Michaelitains,</hi> have in this great battatle late fought since the time of the Parliament, have subdued and overcome the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels, so that their Court is no longer to be found at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>: so it is (according to my Text) no more to be found in Heaven.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Dragon,</hi> I say deare brethren, and beloved sisters, is that <hi>Nimrod</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the great hunter, who with his bloud-hounds hunted and chaced us from one place to another. This was that proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who would have us deliver up to the task masters the full tale of Brick, and yet would not allow us straw nor stubble to burne it. This is that politick <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi> who having mist of his designes, would saddle his Asse (if hee had it) and ride home to his house at <hi>Lambeth</hi> and hang himselfe. This is that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Haman,</hi> that would make havock of all us poore <hi>Mordecais,</hi> and the whole Nation of us distressed Jewes: (for I know there be some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Sabaterians amongst us) but as he hath Idolatriz'd in the high places, wee hope to see him, like that <hi>Haman,</hi> mounted upon something fiftie Cubits high. This is that cruell <hi>Herod,</hi> but more bloudy hearted: he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slew the Babes and Sucklings but this <hi>Dragon</hi> woul<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

This is that <hi>Caiphas,</hi> that would couzen us of our lives. That Pilot that would give partiall sentence against us; &amp; that Saul before he was <hi>Paul</hi>) that would bring persecution amongst us, who are taken for the Olive-branches of the House of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now where is their Starre-parlour, for Star-chamber I cannot call it: Chambers (as we all know) were made for rest and pleasure; but this was onely for rigour and punishment: and where is now their High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Courts, by which the Saints hearts could not rest quiet in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor their eares safe upon their heads? But some of his servants report that he was cleare of all these; but deare brethren, and best beloved sisters, I will tell you of what he was cleare: cleare from all sinceritie, vertue, and piety; cleare from all charitie, veritie, and honestie: but he, with all the rest of the Archiepiscopacy, much contaminated with gormundizing and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie: But where are his full and surfeting Tables, where hee safe plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feeding, with his Chaplins, gaping one at another: some gaping after fat bits, others after fat Benefices, they aspiring to the highest degrees af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prelacy, and he alike ambitious after the Papacy.</p>
            <p>But what is now (my deare brothers, and sweet sisters) become of their vehement Orations, their demonicall disputations? their syllogisticall examinations? their Logicall Interpretations? their erronious Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations? their mentall Reservations? and their iniust Condemnations of us that are the flock of the faithfull, and the onely reserved to eternall Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what I say, but that this great Dragon, and his <hi>Angels</hi> shall be precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to perdition, be hurryed to the inferiour parts of the earth, which is also called Hell, and <hi>Gehimon,</hi> and the tormenting <hi>Tophet,</hi> to which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so leave them, with all their <hi>Prelaticall</hi> trash and popish trumperles.</p>
