         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

houres, thou
canst spare any for
the perusal of this
discourse, and dost
looke to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in it which may serve for thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and benefit: let me then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
thee to come unto it with an equall
minde, not swayed by prejudice, but
indifferently resolved to assent unto
that truth which upon deliberation
shall seeme most probable unto thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then I doubt not, but either
thou wilt agree with mee in this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or at least not think it to be as
farre from truth, as it is from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20652:4"/>
Two cautions there are which I
would willingly admonish thee of in the
beginning.</p>
                  <p>1. That thou shouldst not here looke to
find any exact, accurate Treatise,
since this discourse was but the
fruit of some lighter studies, and
those too hudled up in a short time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first thought of and finished in
the space of some few weekes, and
therefore you cannot in reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that it should be so polished, as
perhaps, the subject would require,
or the leisure of the Author might
have done it.</p>
                  <p>2. To remember that I promise only
probable arguments for the proofe
of this opinion, and therefore you
must not looke that every conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
should be of an undeniable
dependance, or that the truth of
each argument should bee measured
<pb facs="tcp:20652:4"/>
by its necessity. I grant that some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomical
appearances may possibly
be solved otherwise than here they
are. But the thing I aime at is this,
that probably they may so be solved, as
I have here set them downe: Which,
if it be granted (as I think it must)
then I doubt not, but the indifferent
Reader will find some satisfaction in
the maine thing that is to be proved.</p>
                  <p>Many ancient Philosophers of the
better note, have formerly defended
this assertion, which I have here laid
downe; and it were to be wished, that
some of us would more apply our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
unto the examination of these
old opinions, which though they have
for a long time lien neglected by others,
yet in them may you find many truths
well worthy your paines and observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Tis a false conceit for us to thinke,
that amongst the ancient varietie and
<pb facs="tcp:20652:5"/>
search of opinions, the best hath still
prevailed. Time (saith the learned
<hi>Verulam)</hi> seemes to be of the nature
of a river or streame, which carrieth
down to us that which is light or blown
up, but sinketh that which is weighty
and solid.</p>
                  <p>It is my desire that by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this discourse, I may raise up
some more active spirit to a search
after other hidden and unknowne
truths. Since it must needes be a great
impediment unto the growth of sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
for men still so to plod on upon
beaten principles, as to be afraid of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
any thing that may seeme to
contradict them. An unwillingnesse to
take such things into examination, is
one of those errours of learning in
these times observed by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<hi>Verulam.</hi> Questionlesse,
there are many secret truths, which
<pb facs="tcp:20652:5"/>
the ancients have passed over, that are
yet left to make some of our age fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for their discovery.</p>
                  <p>If by this occasion I may provoke
any Reader to an attempt of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I shall think my selfe happy, and
this worke successefull.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is an earnestnesse
and hungering after
noveltie, which doth
still adhere unto all
our natures, and it is
part of that primitive
image, that wide extent and infinite
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20652:7"/>
capacity at first created in the heart
of man. For this, since its depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in <hi>Adam,</hi> perceiving it felfe
altogether emptied of any good,
doth now catch after every new
thing, conceiving that possibly it
may finde satisfaction among some
of its fellow creatures. But our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
the devill (who strives still to
pervert our gifts, and beat us with
our owne weapons) hath so contriv'd
it, that any truth doth now seeme
distastefull for that very reason, for
which errour is entertain'd.. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.
For let but some upstart here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
be set abroach, and presently
there are some out of a curious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
others, as if they watched an
occasion of singularity, will take it
up for canonicall, and make it part of
their creede and profession; whereas
solitary truth cannot any where find
so ready entertainment; but the same
Novelty which is esteemed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of errour, and makes that
acceptable, is counted the fault of
truth, and causes that to be rejected.</p>
                     <p>How did the incredulous World
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20652:7"/>
gaze at <hi>Columbus,</hi> when hee promised
to discover another part of the earth,
and he could not for a long time, by
his confidence, or arguments, induce
any of the Christian Princes, either to
assent unto his opinion, or goe to the
charges of an experiment? Now if he,
who had such good grounds for his
assertion, could finde no better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
among the wiser sort, and
upper end of the World; 'tis not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then that this opinion which I now
deliver, shall receive any thing from
the men of these dayes, especially our
vulgar wits, but misbeliefe or derision.</p>
                     <p>It hath alwayes beene the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of new truths in Philosophy, to
be derided by those that are ignorant
of the causes of things, and rejected by
others, whose perversenesse ties them
to the contrary opinion, men whose
envious pride will not allow any new
thing for truth, which they themselves
were not the first inventors of. So that
I may justly expect to be accused of a
pragmaticall ignorance, &amp; bold osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
especially since for this opinion
<hi>Xenophanes,</hi> a man whose authority was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20652:8"/>
able to adde some credit to his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
could not escape the like censure
from others. For <hi>Natales Comes</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Philosopher,<note place="margin">Mytholog. lib. 3 c. 17.</note> and this his
opinion, saith thus, <hi>Nonulli ne nihil

Philosophiam introducunt, ut alicujus rei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventores
fuisse appareant.</hi> 
                        <q>Some there
are who lest they might seeme to
know nothing, will bring up mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
absurdities in Philosophy,
that so afterward they may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for the invention of somewhat.</q>
The same Author doth also in another
place accuse <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> of folly for
the same opinion.<note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Est enim non ignobilis

                     </p>
                     <p>If these men were thus censur'd, I
may justly then expect to be derided
by most, and to be beleeved by few or
none; especially since this opinion
seemes to carry in it so much strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and contradiction to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20652:8"/>
consent of others. But how ever,
I am resolved that this shall not be
any discouragement, since I know that
it is not common opinion that can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adde or detract from the truth.
For,</p>
                     <p>1. Other truths have beene formerly
esteemed altogether as ridiculous as
this can be.</p>
                     <p>2. Grosse absurdities have beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by generall opinion.</p>
                     <p>I shall give an instance of each, that so
I may the better prepare the Reader
to consider things without a prejudice,
when hee shall see that the common
opposition against this which I affirme,
cannot any way derogate from its
truth.</p>
                     <p>1. Other truths have beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
accounted as ridiculous as this.
I shall specifie that of the Antipodes,
which have beene denied, and laught
at by many wise men and great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,<note place="margin">Vid. loseph. Acosta. de nat. novi orbis lib. 1. cap. 1.</note>
such as were <hi>Herodotus, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
Austine, Lactantius,</hi> the venerable
<hi>Bede, Lucretius</hi> the Poet, <hi>Procopius,</hi> and
the voluminous <hi>Abulensis,</hi> together
with all those Fathers or other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20652:9"/>
who denied the roundnesse of
the heavens. <hi>Herodotus</hi> counted it so
horrible an absurdity, that hee could
not forbeare laughing to think of it.

<q>I cannot choose but laugh, (saith he)
to see so many men venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the earths compasse, relating
those things that are without all
sense, as that the Sea flowes about
the World, and that the earth it selfe
is round as an Orbe.</q> But this great
ignorance is not so much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired

are round, and not rather as a tent.
Thus likewise S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austine,</hi> who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

are they that think there are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,
such as walk with their feet
against ours? doe they speake any
likelihood? or is there any one so
foolish as to beleeve that there are
men whose heeles are higher than
their heads? that things which with
us doe lie on the ground, doe hang
there? that the Plants and Trees
grow downwards, that the haile, and

Orchards amongst the seven
wonders, whereas here the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
have made the Field and
Seas, the Cities &amp; mountains hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</q>
What shall we think (saith hee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20652:10"/>
in <hi>Plutarch)</hi> that men doe cling to that
place like wormes, or hang by their
clawes as Cats? or if we suppose a man
a little beyond the Center, to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with a spade, is it likely (as it
must be according to this opinion) that
the earth which hee loosened, should
of it selfe ascend upwards? or else
suppose two men with their middles
about the Center, the feet of the one
being placed where the head of the
other is, and so two other men crosse
them, yet all these men thus situated
according to this opinion should stand
upright, and many other such grosse
consequences would follow (saith he)
which a false imagination is not able
to fancie as possible. Vpon which
considerations, <hi>Bede</hi> also denies the
being of any Antipodes,<note place="margin">De ratione temporum, Cap. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>Neque enim

                        <q>Nor should we
any longer assent to the Fable of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes.</q>
So also <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet
speaking of the same subject, sayes,
<q>Sed vanus stolidis haec omnia finxerit
error.<note place="margin">De nat. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Lib. 1.</note>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That some idle fancie faigned these
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20652:10"/>
for fooles to beleeve. Of this opinion
was <hi>Procopius Gazaeus,</hi> but hee was
perswaded to it by another kinde of
reason;<note place="margin">Comen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ìn 1. Cap. Gen.</note> for hee thought that all the
earth under us was sunk in the water,
according to the saying of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 2.</note>
He hath founded the earth upon the
Seas; and therefore hee accounted it
not inhabited by any. Nay, <hi>Tostatus</hi>
a man of later yeares and generall
learning, doth also confidently deny
that there are any such Antipodes,
though the reason which hee urges
for it, be not so absurd as the former;
For the Apostles,<note place="margin">Comment. in 1. Genes.</note> saith hee, travelled
through the whole habitable world,
but they never passed the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
and if you answer that they are
said to goe through all the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they went through all the
knowne world; he replies, that this is
not sufficient,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4</note> since Christ would have
all men to be saved, and come to the
knowledge of his truth, and therefore
'tis requisite that they should have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
thither also, if there had beene
any Inhabitants; especially since hee
did expresly command them to goe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20652:11"/>
and teach <hi>all nations,</hi> and preach the
Gospell through the <hi>whole world,</hi> and
therefore hee thinks that as there are
no men,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19</note> so neither are there seas, or
rivers, or any other conveniencie for
habitation. 'Tis commonly related of
one <hi>Virgilius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aventinus Annal. Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum. lib. 3.</note> that hee was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
and condemned for a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
by <hi>Zachary</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee was not of the same opinion.
But <hi>Baronius</hi> sayes,<note place="margin">Annal. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. A. D. 748.</note> it was because hee
thought there was another habitable
world within ours. How ever, you
may well enough discerne in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
how confident many of these
great Schollars were in so grosse an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
how unlikely, what an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing it seemed to them, that there
should be any Antipodes; and yet
now this truth is as certaine and plain,
as sense or demonstration can make
it. This then which I now deliver, is
not to be rejected, though it may
seeme to contradict the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>2. Grosse absurdities have beene
entertained by generall consent. I
might instance in many remarkable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20652:11"/>
examples, but I will onely speake of
the supposed labour of the Moone in
her eclipses, because this is neerest to
the chiefe matter in hand, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as a common opinion amongst
many of the Ancients, In so much that
from hence they stiled eclipses by the
name of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>passions,</hi> or in the phrase
of the Poets,
<q>Solis lunae<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> labores.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaking of a
Lunary eclipse, relates, that at such
times 'twas a custome amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
(the most civill and learned
people in the world) to sound brasse
Instruments,<note place="margin">In vita Paul. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

toward the heaven. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
For by this meanes they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Moone was much eased in
her labours; and therefore <hi>Ovid</hi> calls
such loud Instruments the auxiliaries
or helps of the Moone,<note place="margin">Metam. Lib. 4.</note>
                        <q>Cum frustra resonant aera auxiliaria Lunae.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore the Satyrist too, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a loud Scold, sayes, She was able
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20652:12"/>
to make noise enough to deliver the
labouring Moone.</p>
                     <q>Vna laboranti poterit succurrere Lunae.<note place="margin">Iuven. Sat. 6.</note>
                     </q>
                     <p>Now the reason of all this their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie,
was, because they feared the
world would fall asleepe, when one
of its eyes began to wink, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would doe what they could
by loud sounds to rouse it from its
drowsinesse, and keepe it awake: by
bright torches, to bestow that light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it which it began to lose.</p>
                     <p>Some of them thought hereby to
keepe the Moone in her orbe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwise shee would have fallen
downe upon the earth, and the world
would have lost one of its lights; for
the credulous people beleeved, that
Inchanters and Witches could bring
the Moone downe, which made <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
say,
<q>Cantus &amp; è coelo possunt deducere Lunam.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And those Wizards knowing the
times of her eclipses, would then
threaten to shew their skill, by pulling
her out of her orbe. So that when the
silly multitude saw that shee began to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20652:12"/>
looke red, they presently feared they
should lose the benefit of her light, and
therefore made a great noise that shee
might not heare the sound of those
Charmes, which would otherwise
bring her downe; and this is rendred
for a reason of this custome by <hi>Pliny</hi>
and <hi>Propertius:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nat. Hist. Lib. 2. c. 12.</note>
                        <q>
                           <l>Cantus &amp; è curru lunam deducere tentant,</l>
                           <l>Et facerent, si non aera repulsa sonent.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives another reason of it,
and he sayes, 'tis because they would
hasten the Moone out of the dark
shade wherein she was involv'd, that
so shee might bring away the soules
of those Saints that inhabit within
her, which cry out by reason they are
then deprived of their wonted happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and cannot heare the Musick of
the Spheares, but are forced to behold
the torments, and wailing of those
damned soules which are represented
to them as they are tortured in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the ayre. But whether this or
what ever else was the meaning of
this superstition, yet certainly 'twas a
very ridiculous custome, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great ignorance of those ancient
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20652:13"/>
times; especially since it was not only
received by the vulgar, such as were
men of lesse note and learning, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
also by the more famous and
wiser sort, such as were those great
Poets, <hi>Stesichorus</hi> and <hi>Pindar.</hi> And not
onely amongst the more sottish Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who might account that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to be one of their gods; but the
Primitive Christians also were in this
kind guilty, which made Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
so tartly to rebuke those of his
time, when he said, <hi>Tum turbatur car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus
Globus Lunae, quando calicibus
turbantur &amp; oculì.</hi> 
                        <q>When your heads
are troubled with cups, then you
think the Moone to be troubled with
charmes.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for this reason also did <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
a Bishop, write a Homily against it,
wherein hee shewed the absurdity of
that foolish superstition.<note place="margin">Turinens. Episc.</note> I remember
that <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> relates a more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
story of a people that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
an Asse for drinking up the
Moone, whose image appearing in the
water, was covered with a cloud as
the Asse was drinking, for which the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20652:13"/>
poore beast was afterward brought to
the barre to receive a sentence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his deserts, where the grave
Senate being set to examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
one of the Counsell (perhaps
wiser than the rest) rises up, and out
of his deepe judgement thinks it not
fit that their Towne should lose its
Moone, but that rather the Asse should
be cut up and that taken out of him;
which sentence being approved by
the rest of those Politicians, as the
subtillest way for the conclusion of
the matter, was accordingly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But whether this tale were true
or no, I will not question; however,
there is absurdity enough in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
custome of the Ancients, that may
confirme the truth to be proved, and
plainely declare the insufficiencie of
common opinion to adde true worth
or estimation unto any thing. So that
from that which I have said may be
gathered thus much.</p>
                     <p>1. That a new truth may seeme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and impossible not onely to
the vulgar, but to those also who
are otherwise wise men and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20652:14"/>
Schollars; and hence it will
follow that every new thing which
seemes to oppose common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
is not presently to be rejected,
but rather to be pry'd into with a
diligent enquiry, since there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which are yet hid from
us, and reserv'd for future disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie.</p>
                     <p>2. That it is not the commonnesse of
an opinion that can priviledge it for
a truth; the wrong way is sometime
a well beaten path, whereas the
right way (especially to hidden
truths) may be lesse trodden and
more obscure.</p>
                     <p>True indeed, the strangenesse of this
opinion will detract much from its
credit; but yet wee should know that
nothing is in it selfe strange, since eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
naturall effect has an equall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon its cause, and with the like
necessity doth follow from it; so that
'tis our ignorance which makes things
appeare so; and hence it comes to passe
that many more evident truths seeme
incredible to such who know not the
causes of things: you may as soone
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20652:14"/>
perswade some Country Peasants that
the Moone is made of greene Cheese
(as wee say) as that 'tis bigger than
his Cart-wheele, since both seeme
equally to contradict his sight, and he
has not reason enough to leade him
farther than his senses. Nay suppose
(saith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> a Philosopher should
be educated in such a secret place,
where hee might not see either Sea or
River, and afterwards should be
brought out where one might shew
him the great Ocean, telling him the
quality of that water, that it is brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
salt and not potable, and yet there
were many vast creatures of all forms
living in it, which make use of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as wee doe of the ayre, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
hee would laugh at all this as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
monstrous lies, and fables, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any colour of truth. Just so will
this truth which I now deliver, appeare
unto others; because we never dreamt
of any such matter as a World in the
Moone; because the state of that place
hath as yet beene vailed from our
knowledge, therefore we can scarcely
assent to any such matter. Things are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20652:15"/>
very hardly received which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
strange to our thoughts and our
senses. The soule may with lesse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
be brought to beleeve any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
when as it has formerly beene
acquainted with some colours and
probabilities for it; but when a new,
and an unheard of truth shall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, though it have good grounds
and reasons, yet the understanding is
afraid of it as a stranger, and dares not
admit it into his beleefe, without a
great deale of reluctancie and triall.
And besides, things that are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to the senses, are not assented
unto without some labour of minde,
some travaile and discourse of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and many lazie soules
had rather quietly repose themselves
in an easie errour, than take paines to
search out the truth. The strangenesse
then of this opinion which I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
will be a great hinderance to its
beliefe, but this is not to be respected
by reason it cannot be helped. I have
stood the longer in the Preface, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that prejudice which the meere
title of the booke may beget, cannot
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20652:15"/>
easily be removed without a great
deale of preparation, and I could not
tell otherwise how to rectifie the
thoughts of the Reader for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
survey of the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                     <p>I must needs confesse, though I had
often thought with my selfe that it
was possible there might be a world
in the Moone, yet it seemed such an
uncouth opinion that I never durst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it, for feare of being counted
singular, and ridiculous; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
having read <hi>Plutarch, Galileus, Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,</hi>
with some others, and finding
many of mine owne thoughts confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by such strong authority, I then
concluded that it was not onely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
there might be, but probable that
there was another habitable world in
that Planet. In the prosecuting of this
assertion, I shall first endeavour to
cleare the way from such doubts as
may hinder the speed or ease of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
progresse; and because the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
imply'd in this opinion, may
seeme to contradict the principles of
reason or faith, it will be requisite that

I first remove this scruple,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> shewing the

proceede to confirme such Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which doe more directly belong

because there was nothing
proved in them, but matters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
as if they would rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
than perswade beliefe. And 'tis
observed that hee sets downe nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20652:16"/>
himselfe, but hee confirmes it by the
strongest reasons that may be found,
there being scarce an argument of
force for any subject in Philosophy,
which may not be picked out of his
Writings; and therefore 'tis likely if
there were in reason a necessity of one
onely world, that hee would have
found out some such necessary proofe
as might confirme it: Especially since
hee labours for it so much in two
whole Chapters. But now all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which hee himselfe urges in
this subject,<note place="margin">De Coelo l. 1. c. 8. 9.</note> are very weake, and farre
enough from having in them any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
power. Therefore 'tis likely
that a plurality of worlds doth not
contradict any principle of reason.
However, I will set downe the two
chiefe of his arguments from his owne
works, and from them you may guesse
the force of the other.</p>
                     <p>The first is this,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> since every heavie
body doth naturally tend downwards,
and every light body upwards, what
a hudling and confusion must there be
if there were two places for gravity,
and two places for lightnesse: for it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20652:17"/>
is probable that the earth of that other
world would fall down to this Center,
and so mutually the ayre and fire here
ascend to those Regions in the other,
which must needs much derogate
from the providence of nature, and
cause a great disorder in his works.
But <hi>ratio haec est minimè firma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Dei. part. 2. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> (saith
<hi>Zanchy)</hi> And if you well consider the
nature of gravity, you will plainely
see there is no ground to feare any
such confusion; for heavinesse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but such a quality as causes
a propension in its subject to tend
downwards towards its owne Center;
so that for some of that earth to come
hither, would not be said a fall but an
ascension, since it moved from its own
place, and this would be impossible
(saith <hi>Ruvio)</hi> because against nature,
and therefore no more to be feared
than the falling of the Heavens.<note place="margin">De Coelo l. 1. c. 9. q. 1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you reply that then according to
this, there must be more Centers of
gravity than one; I answer. 'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probable there are, nor can we well
conceive, what any piece of the Moon
would doe being severed from the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20652:17"/>
rest in the free and open ayre, but only
returne unto it againe.</p>
                     <p>Another argument hee had from
his Master <hi>Plato,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Metaphys. l. 12. c. 8.</note> that there is but one
world,<note place="margin">Diog. Laert. lib. 3.</note> because there is but one first
mover, God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Infirma etiam est haec ratio</hi> (saith <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy)</hi>
and we may justly deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
since a plurality of worlds
doth not take away the unity of the
first mover. <hi>Vt enim forma substantialis,
sic primum efficiens apparentem solummodo
multiplicitatem induìt per signatam mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>
(saith a Country-man of ours.)<note place="margin">Nic. Hill. de Philosop. Epic. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic 379.</note>
As the substantiall forme, so the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cause hath only an appearing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
from its particular matter.
You may see this point more largely
handled, and these Arguments more
fully answered by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his
booke (why Oracles are silent) and
<hi>Iacob Carpentarius</hi> in his comment on
<hi>Alcinous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our opposites the Interpreters
themselves, (who too often doe <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
in verba magistri)</hi> will grant that
there is not any strength in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
and certainly then such
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20652:18"/>
weake arguments could not covince
that wise Philosopher, who in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinions was wont to be swayed
by the strength and power of reason:
wherefore I should rather think that
he had some by-respect, which made
him first assent to this opinion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
strive to prove it. Perhaps
it was because hee feared to displease
his scholler <hi>Alexander,</hi> of whom 'tis
related that he wept to heare a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of another world,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de tranq. anim.</note> since he had
not then attained the Monarchy of
this; his restlesse wide heart would
have esteemed this Globe of Earth
not big enough for him, if there had
beene another, which made the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
say of him,
<q>Aestuat infoelix angusto limite mundi.<note place="margin">Iuvenal.</note>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That he did vex himselfe and sweat
in his desires, as being pend up in a
narrow roome, when hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
but to one world.</q> Before, he
thought to seat himselfe next the
Gods; but now, when hee had done
his best, hee must be content with
some equall, or perhaps superiour
Kings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:20652:18"/>
It may be, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to this opinion, that hee might
thereby take from <hi>Alexander</hi> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this feare and discontent; or
else, perhaps, <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe was
as loth to hold the possibility of a
world which he could not discover, as
<hi>Alexander</hi> was to heare of one which
he could not conquer. 'Tis likely that
some such by-respect moved him to
this opinion, since the arguments hee
urges for it, are confest by his zealous
followers and commentators, to be
very fleight and frivolous, and they
themselves grant, what I am now to
prove, that there is not any evidence
in the light of naturall reason, which
can sufficiently manifest that there is
but one world.</p>
                     <p>But however some may object,
would it not be inconvenient and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to admit of such opinions that
doe destroy those principles of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
which all the world hath so long
followed?</p>
                     <p>This question is much controverted
by some of the <hi>Romish</hi> Divines;<note place="margin">Apologia pro Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeo.</note> 
                        <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi>
hath writ a Treatise in defence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20652:19"/>
of it, in whom you may see many
things worth the reading and notice.</p>
                     <p>To it I answer, that this position in
Philosophy, doth not bring any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to the rest, since 'tis not
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> but truth that should be the
rule of our opinions, and if they be not
both found together, we may say to
him, as hee said to his Master <hi>Plato,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 1. c. 6.</note>
                        <q>Though <hi>Plato</hi> were his friend, yet
hee would rather adhere to truth
than him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I must needs grant, that wee are all
much beholden to the industry of the
ancient Philosophers, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for the greater part
of our learning; but yet 'tis not ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to speak against him, when hee
opposeth truth; for then many of the
Fathers would be very guilty, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Iustin,</hi> who hath writ a Treatise
purposely against him.</p>
                     <p>But suppose this opinion were false,
yet 'tis not against the faith, and so it
may serve for the better confirmation
of that which is true; the sparks of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
being forc'd out by opposition,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20652:19"/>
as the sparks of fire by the striking of
the flint and steele. But suppose too
that it were hereticall, and against the
faith, yet may it be admitted with the
same priviledge as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> from
whom many more dangerous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have proceeded: as that the
world is eternall, that God cannot
have while to looke after these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
things, that after death there is no
reward or punishment, and such like
blasphemies, which strike directly at
the fundamentals of our Religion.</p>
                     <p>So that it is justly to be wondred
why some should be so superstitious
in these dayes, as to stick closer unto
him, than unto Scripture, as if his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
were the onely foundation of
all divine truths.</p>
                     <p>Vpon these grounds both <hi>St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi>
and <hi>Serafinus de firmo</hi> (as I have
seene them quoted) think that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
was the violl of Gods wrath, which
was powred out upon the waters of
wisedom by the third Angel;<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 4.</note> But
for my part, I think the world is much
beholden to him for all its sciences.
But yet 'twere a shame for these later
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20652:20"/>
ages to rest our selves meerely upon
the labours of our Fore-fathers, as if
they had informed us of all things to
be knowne; and when we are set upon
their shoulders, not to see further than
they themselves did. 'Twere a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
a lazie opinion to think
<hi>Aristotles</hi> works the bounds and limits
of all humane invention, beyond
which there could be no possibility of
reaching. Certainly there are yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things left to discovery, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be any inconvenience for us, to
maintaine a new truth, or rectifie an
ancient errour.</p>
                     <p>But the position (say some) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against Scripture, for</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Moses</hi> tels us but of one world,
and his History of the Creation had
been very imperfect, if God had made
another.</p>
                     <p>2. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking of Gods
works, says hee made the world, in
the singular number, and therefore
there is but one: 'tis the argument of
<hi>Aquinas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Part 1. Q. 47. Art. 3.</note> and he thinks that none will
oppose it, but such who with <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>
esteeme some blinde chance, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20652:20"/>
not any wise providence to be the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of all things.</p>
                     <p>3. The opinion of more worlds
has in ancient times beene accounted
a heresie, and <hi>Baronius</hi> affirmes that for
this very reason <hi>Virgilius</hi> was cast out
of his Bishoprick, and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Church.<note place="margin">Annal. Eccl. A. D. 748.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. A fourth argument there is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by <hi>Aquinas;</hi> if there be more
worlds than one, then they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be of the same, or of a diverse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but they are not of the same
kinde;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for this were needlesse, and
would argue an improvidence, since
one would have no more perfection
than the other; not of divers kindes,
for then one of them could not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the world or universe, since it did
not containe universall perfection. I
have cited this argument, because it is
so much stood upon by <hi>Iulius Caesar la
Galla,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Phaenom in orbe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</note> one that has purposely writ a
Treatise against this opinion which I
now deliver; but the Dilemma is so
blunt that it cannot cut on either side,
and the consequences so weake that I
dare trust them without an answer;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20652:21"/>
And (by the way) you may see this
later Author in that place, where hee
endeavours to prove a necessity of
one world, doth leave the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand, and take much needlesse
paines to dispute against <hi>Democritus,</hi>
who thought that the world was made
by the casuall concourse of <hi>atoms</hi> in a
great <hi>vacuum.</hi> It should seeme that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his cause or his skill was weake,
or else he would have ventured upon
a stronger adversary. These argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which I have set downe, are the
chiefest which I have met with against
this subject, and yet the best of these
hath not force enough to endanger the
truth that I have delivered.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the two first it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the negative authority of
Scripture is not prevalent in those
things which are not the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion.</p>
                     <p>But you'le reply, though it doe not
necessarily conclude, yet 'tis probable
if there had beene another world, wee
should have had some notice of it in
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>I answer, 'tis as probable that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20652:21"/>
Scripture should have informed us of
the planets, they being very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
parts of the Creation; and yet
neither <hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Iob,</hi> nor the <hi>Psalmes</hi>
(the places most frequent in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
observations) nor any other
Scripture mention any of them but
the Sunne and Moone. Because the
difference betwixt them and the other
starres, was knowne onely to those
who were learned men, and had skill
in <hi>Astronomie.</hi> As for that expression
in <hi>Iob</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>the starres of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 38 7.</note>
it is in the plurall number, and
therefore cannot properly be applied
to <hi>Venus.</hi> And for that in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
'tis confessed to be a word of obscure
interpretation,<note place="margin">Isai. 14. 12.</note> and therefore is but by
guesse translated in that sence. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a true and common rule,<note place="margin">Fromond. Vesta. t. 3. cap. 2.</note> that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei
reisideralis minime curiosi coelestium
nominum penuriâ laborant.</hi> The Jewes
being but little skilled in Astronomie,<note place="margin">So 2 Reg. 23. 5.</note>
their language dos want proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
for the heavenly bodies,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Which is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both for the planets &amp; for the 12 signes.</note>
and therefore they are faine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to attribute the same name unto
divers constellations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:20652:22"/>
Now if the Holy Ghost had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to reveale unto us any naturall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
certainly hee would never have
omitted the mention of the planets,
<hi>Quorum motu nihilest quod de Conditoris
sapientiâ testatur evidentius apud eos qui
capiunt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Keplar. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduct. in Mart.</note> Which doe so evidently set
forth the wisedome of the Creator.
And therefore you must know that
'tis besides the scope of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
or the new, to discover any
thing unto us concerning the secrets
of Philosophy; 'tis not his intent in
the new Testament, since wee cannot
conceive how it might any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
either to the Historical, exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
or propheticall parts of it: nor is
it his intent in the old Testament, as is
well observed by our Countrey-man
Master WRIGHT.<note place="margin">In Epist. ad Gilbert.</note> 
                        <hi>Non Mosis aut Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetarum

                        <q>'Tis
not the endeavour of <hi>Moses</hi> or the
Prophets to discover any Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
or Philosophicall subtilties,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20652:22"/>
but rather to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to vulgar capacities, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
speech, as nurses are wont to
use their Infants.</q> True indeed, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
is there to handle the History of
the Creation. But 'tis certaine (saith
<hi>Calvin)</hi> that his purpose is to treat only
of the visible forme of the world,<note place="margin">Calvin in 1 Gen.</note> and
those parts of it which might be most
easily understood by the ignorant and
ruder sort of people, and therefore we
are not thence to expect the discovery
of any naturall secret. <hi>Artes reconditas
aliunde discat qui volet; hic spiritus Dei
omnes simul sine exceptione docere voluit.</hi>
As for more hidden Arts, they must be
looked for else-where; the Holy
Ghost did here intend to instruct all
without exception. And therefore 'tis
observed, that <hi>Moses</hi> does not any
where meddle with such matters as
were very hard to be conceived; for
being to informe the common people
as well as others, he does it after a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
way, as it is commonly noted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the originall chiefely of those
things which are obvious to the sense,
and being silent of other things which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20652:23"/>
then could not well be apprehended.
And therefore <hi>Pererius</hi> proposing the
question,<note place="margin">Com. in 1 Gen. 11.</note> why the Creation of plants
&amp; herbs is mentioned, but not of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
and mineralls?</p>
                     <p>Answers. <hi>Quia istarum rerum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio
est vulgo occulta &amp; ignota.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these things are not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
knowne as the other; and
hee adds, <hi>Moses non omnia, sed manifesta
omnibus enarranda suscepit. Moses</hi> did
not intend to relate unto us the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of all things, but those onely
which were most evident unto all
men.<note place="margin">Part 1. Q. 68. Art. 3.</note> And therefore too, <hi>Aquinas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
that hee writes nothing of the
ayre, because that being invisible,
the people knew not whether there
were any such body or no. And for
this very reason, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ierom</hi> also thinks
that there is nothing exprest concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Creation of Angels,<note place="margin">Epist. 139. ad Cypri.</note> because
the rude and ignorant vulgar were not
so capable of apprehending their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.<note place="margin">So Pererius in 2 Gen.</note>
And yet notwithstanding, these
are as remarkable parts of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as fit to be knowne as another
world. And therefore the Holy Ghost
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20652:23"/>
too uses such vulgar expressions,
which set things forth rather as they
appeare, than as they are, as when he
calls the Moone <hi>one of the greater lights,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 16.</note>
whereas 'tis the least that wee can see
in the whole heavens. So afterwards
speaking of the great raine which
drowned the world;<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> hee sayes,<note place="margin">Mala. 3. 10.</note> The
windowes of heaven were opened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it seemed to come with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Rawly c. 7. sect. 6.</note>
as if it were poured out from
windowes in the Firmament.</p>
                     <p>And in reference to this, a drowth is
described in sundry other<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 11. 17.</note> places by
<hi>the heavens being shut up.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Reg. 3. 35</note> So that the
phrases which the Holy Ghost uses
concerning these things,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 25.</note> are not to be
understood in a literall sense; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as vulgar expressions; and this
rule is set down by Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">l. 2. in Gen. Psal. 136. 6</note> where
speaking concerning that in the Psalm,
<hi>who stretched the earth upon the waters,</hi> he
notes that when the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shall seeme to contradict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense or experience, there are
they to be understood in a qualified
sence, and not according to the letter.
And 'tis observed, that for want of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20652:24"/>
this rule, some of the Ancients have
fastned strange absurdities upon the
words of the Scripture.<note place="margin">Hexamer. lib. 2.</note> So Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
esteemed it a heresie to think that
the Sunne and Starres were not very
hot,<note place="margin">Item. Basil. Hom. 3. in Genes.</note> as being against the words of
Scripture,<note place="margin">Wisd. 2. 4. 17. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Psalm.</hi> 19. 6. where the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
sayes,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 43. 3. 4.</note> that there is nothing that is
hid from the heat of the Sunne. So
others there are that would prove the
heavens not to be round, out of that
place, <hi>Psal. 104. 2. Hee stretched out the
heavens like a curtaine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Com. in c. 1. Gen.</note> So <hi>Procopius</hi> also
was of opinion, that the earth was
founded upon the waters; nay, hee
made it part of his faith, proving it out
of <hi>Psal. 24. 2. He hath founded the earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the seas, and established it upon the floods.</hi>
These and such like absurdities have
followed, when men looke for the
grounds of Philosophy in the words
of Scripture. So that, from what hath
beene said, I may conclude that the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Scripture concerning any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, is not sufficient argument
to prove that there is none. Thus for
the two first arguments.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the third, I may answer, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20652:24"/>
this very example is quoted by others,
to shew the ignorance of those primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, who did sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
what they did not understand,
and have often censur'd the lawfull
and undoubted parts of Mathematicks
for hereticall, because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
could not perceive a reason of
it. And therefore their practise in this
particular, is no sufficient testimonie
against us.</p>
                     <p>But lastly, I answer to all the above
named objections, that the terme
<hi>(World)</hi> may be taken in a double
sense, more generally for the whole
Vniuerse, as it implies in it the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
and aethereall bodies, the starres
and the earth. Secondly, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
for an inferiour World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of elements.</p>
                     <p>Now the maine drift of all these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
is to confute a plurality of
Worlds in the first sense, and if there
were any such, it might, perhaps, seem
strange, that <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iohn</hi> should
either not know, or not mention its
creation. And <hi>Virgilius</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for this opinion, because hee held
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20652:25"/>
                        <hi>quòd sit alius mundus sub terrâ, aliusque
Sol &amp; Luna,</hi> (as <hi>Baronius)</hi> that within
our globe of earth, there was another
world, another Sunne and Moone,
and so he might seeme to exclude this
from the number of the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>But now there is no such danger in
this opinion, which is here delivered,
since this World is said to be in the
Moone, whose creation is particularly
exprest.</p>
                     <p>So that in the first sense I yeeld, that
there is but one world, which is all
that the arguments doe prove; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it in the second sense, and so
I affirme there may be more, nor doe
any of the above named objections
prove the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Neither can this opinion derogate
from the divine Wisedom (as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
thinks) but rather advance it, shewing
a <hi>compendium</hi> of providence, that could
make the same body a world, and a
Moone; a world for habitation, and a
Moone for the use of others, and the
ornament of the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For as the members of the body
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20652:25"/>
serve not onely for the preservation of
themselves, but for the use and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of the whole,<note place="margin">Cusanus dc doct. ignor. l. 2. c. 12.</note> as the hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
the head as well as saves it selfe;
so is it in the parts of the Vniverse,
where each one may serve as well for
the conservation of that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, as the help of others without it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mersennus</hi> a late Jesuite,<note place="margin">Comment. in Gen. Qu. 19. Art. 2.</note> proposing
the question whether or no the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of more worlds than one, be hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and against the faith? He answers
it negatively, because it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
any expresse place of Scripture,
or determination of the Church. And
though (saith he) it seemes to be a rash
opinion, as being against the consent
of the Fathers; yet if this controversie
be chiefly Philosophicall, then their
authorities are not of such weight.
Vnto this it may be added, that the
consent of the Fathers is prevalent
onely in such points as were first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
amongst them, and then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
decided one way, and not in
such other particulars as never fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their examination and dispute.</p>
                     <p>I have now in some measure, shewed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20652:26"/>
that a plurality of worlds does not
contradict any principle of reason or
place of Scripture,<note place="margin">LIB. I. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</note> and so cleared the
first part of that supposition which is
implied in the opinion.</p>
                     <p>It may next be enquired, whether
'tis possible there may be a globe of
elements in that which wee call the
aethereall parts of the Vniverse; for if
this (as it is according to the common
opinion) be priviledged from any
change or corruption, it will be in vain
then to imagine any element there;
and if we will have another world, we
must then seeke out some other place
for its situation. The third Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therefore shall be this.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That the heavens doe not consist of any such
pure matter, which can priviledge them
from the like change and corruption, as
these inferiour bodies are liable unto.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT hath beene often questioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the ancient Fathers &amp; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
what kinde of matter that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20652:26"/>
should be of which the heavens are
framed. Some think that they consist
of a fifth substance distinct from the
foure elements,<note place="margin">De Coelo li. 1. cap. 2.</note> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> holds, and
with him some of the late Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whose subtill braines could not
be content to attribute to those vast
glorious bodies but commonmateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
and therefore they themselves
had rather take pains to preferre them
to some extraordinary nature; whereas
notwithstanding, all the arguments
they could invent, were not able to
convince a necessity of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as is confest by their owne<note n="*" place="margin">Colleg. Connimb. de coeto. l. 1. c. 2. q. 6. art. 3.</note> side.
It were much to be desired, that these
men had not in other cases, as well as
this, multiplied things without neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and as if there had not beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be knowne in the secrets of
nature, have spunne out new subjects
from their own braines, to finde more
work for future ages; I shall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their arguments, since 'tis already
confest, that they are none of them of
any necessary consequence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
you may see them set downe in

But it is the generall consent of the
Fathers, and the opinion of <hi>Lombard,</hi>
that the heavens consist of the same
matter with these sublunary bodies.
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is so confident of it,<note place="margin">In Hexam. lib. 4.</note> that he

that they are all framed of some ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <hi>aquae.</hi> Because they
are framed out of these elements. But
concerning this, you may see sundry
discourses more at large in <hi>Ludovicus

divers others.<note place="margin">In opere 6. dierum. disput. 5.</note> The venerable <hi>Bede</hi>
thought the Planets to consist of all

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20652:27"/>
the other parts are of an aereous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as will be shewed afterward;
however,<note place="margin">In lib. de Mundi constit.</note> I cannot now stand to recite
the arguments for either; I have onely
urged these Authorities to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the Schoolemen,
and the better to make way for a
proofe of their corruptibility.</p>
                     <p>The next thing then to be enquired
after,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 12</note> is, whether they be of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
nature, not whether they can be
destroyed by God; for this, Scripture
puts out of doubt.</p>
                     <p>Nor whether or no in a long time
they would weare away and grow
worse; for from any such feare they
have beene lately priviledged.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>By Doctor</hi> Hakewill. Ap. l. lib. 2.</note> But
whether they are capable of such
changes and vicissitudes, as this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

                     <p>The two chief opinions concerning
this, have both erred in some extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the one side going so farre from
the other, that they have both gone
beyond the right, whilst <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath
opposed the truth, as well as the
Stoicks.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Ancients have thought,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20652:28"/>
that the heavenly bodies have stood in
need of nourishment from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they were continually
fed, &amp; so had divers alterations by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their food; this is fathered on <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Plutarch. de plac. philos. l. 2. c. 17.</note>
followed by that great Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
<hi>Pliny,</hi> &amp; in generall attributed to all
the Stoicks. You may see <hi>Seneca</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

                        <hi>Ex illâ alimenta omnibus animalibus, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

ut in opere, ita in pastu.</hi> Speaking of the
earth, he sayes, from thence it is that
nourishment is divided to all the living
creatures, the Plants and the Starres;
hence were sustained so many constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
so laborious, so greedy, both
day and night, as well in their feeding
as working. Thus also <hi>Lucan</hi> sings,

                     </p>
                     <p>Vnto these <hi>Ptolomie</hi> also that learned
Egyptian seemed to agree,<note place="margin">1. Apostcl.</note> when hee
affirmes that the body of the Moone
is moister, and cooler than any of the
other Planets, by reason of the earthly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20652:28"/>
vapours that are exhaled unto it. You
see these Ancients thought the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
to be so farre from this imagined
incorruptibility, that rather like the
weakest bodies they stood in need of
some continuall nourishment, without
which they could not subsist.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers were
so farre from this,<note place="margin">De caelo. l. 1. c. 3.</note> that they thought
those glorious bodies could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
within them any such principles
as might make them lyable to the least
change or corruption; and their chiefe
reason was, because we could not in
so long a space discerne any alteration
amongst them; But unto this I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. Supposing wee could not, yet
would it not hence follow that there
were none, as hee himselfe in effect
doth confesse in another place; for
speaking concerning our knowledge
of the Heavens,<note place="margin">De coelo. l. 2 cap. 3.</note> he sayes, 'tis very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and difficult, by reason of the
vast distance of those bodies from us,
and because the changes which may
happen unto them, are not either bigge
enough, or frequent enough to fall
within the apprehension and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20652:29"/>
of our senses; no wonder then if
he himselfe be deceived in his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning these particulars. But
yet, in this hee implies, that if a man
were nearer to these heavenly bodies,
hee would be a fitter Judge to decide
this controversie than himselfe. Now
its our advantage, that by the help of
<hi>Galileus</hi> his glasse, wee are advanced
nearer unto them, and the heavens are
made more present to us than they
were before. However, as it is with us
where there be many vicissitudes and
successions of things, though <hi>the earth
abideth for ever:</hi> So likewise may it be
amongst the planets, in which though
there should be divers alterations, yet
they themselves may still continue of
the same quantity and light.</p>
                     <p>2. Though wee could not by our
senses see such alterations, yet our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might perhaps sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of them. Nor can wee well
conceive how the Sunne should reflect
against the Moone, and yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some alteration of heat. <hi>Diogenes</hi>
the Philosopher was hence perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that those scorching heats had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20652:29"/>
burnt the Moone into the forme of a
Pumice-stone.</p>
                     <p>3. I answer, that there have beene
some alterations observed there; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
those comets which have beene
seene above the Moone. As also those
spots or clouds that encompasse the
body of the Sun, amongst which, there
is a frequent succession by a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the old, and a generation of new.
So that though <hi>Aristotles</hi> consequence
were sufficient, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he proved that the
heavens were not corruptible, because
there have not any changes beene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in them; yet this by the same
reason must be as prevalent, that the
Heavens are corruptible, because there
have beene so many alterations obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there; But of these, together with
a farther confirmation of this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall have occasion to speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
In the meane space, I will
referre the Reader to that work of
<hi>Sheiner,</hi> a late Jesuite which he titles his
<hi>Rosa Vrsina,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 4. par. 2 cap 24. 35.</note> where hee may see this
point concerning the corruptibility of
the Heavens largely handled, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
confirmed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:20652:30"/>
There are some other things, on
which I might here take an occasion
to enlarge my selfe; but because they
are directly handled by many others,
and doe not immediatly belong to the
chiefe matter in hand, I shall therefore
referre the Reader to their Authors,
and omit any large proofe of them my
selfe, as desiring all possible brevity.</p>
                     <p>1. The first is this: That there are
no solid Orbes. If there be a habitable
world in the Moone (which I now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme)
it must follow, that her Orbe is
not solid as <hi>Aristotle</hi> supposed; and if
not hers, why any of the other. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think that they are all of a fluid
(perhaps aereous) substance. Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 51. 6.</note>
and Saint <hi>Basil</hi> did endeavour to
prove this out of that place in <hi>I say,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ant. lect. l. 1. c. 4.</note>
where they are compared to smoak, as
they are both quoted by <hi>Rhodiginus.
Eusebius Nicembergius</hi> doth likewise
from that place confute the solidity
and incorruptibility of the Heavens,<note place="margin">Hist. nat. l. 2. c. 11. 13.</note>
and cites for the same interpretation
the authority of <hi>Eustachius</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi>
and Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> I am sure, in one place
seemes to assent unto this opinion,<note place="margin">In lib sup. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

though hee does often in his other

                     <p>If you esteeme the <hi>testimony</hi> of the

force or consequence in a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

purpose in <hi>Sixtus Senensis lib. 5. Biblioth.
annot.</hi> 14. The chiefe <hi>reasons,</hi> that are
commonly urged for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, are briefly these three.</p>
                     <p>1 From the altitude of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
which have beene observed to
be above the planets, thorough whose
Orbs (if they had beene solid) there
would not have beene any passage. To
these may be added those lesser pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
lately discovered about <hi>Iupiter</hi>
and <hi>Saturne,</hi> for which Astronomers
have not yet framed any Orbs.</p>
                     <p>2 From that uncertainty of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomicall
observations, which will
follow upon the supposition of such
solid spheres. For then we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
discerne any Starre but by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of refractions, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
wee could not possibly finde
their true situations either in respect of
us, or in regard of one another: Since

what ever the eye discernes by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
beame, it apprehends to be in
some other place than wherein it is.
But now this would be such an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
as would quite subvert the
grounds &amp; whole Art of Astronomy,
and therefore is by no meanes to be
admitted.</p>
                     <p>Vnto this it is commonly answered,
that all those Orbs are equally dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous,
though nor of a continued
quantity. Wee reply, that supposing
they were, yet this cannot hinder them
from being the causes of refraction,
which is produced as well by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of superficies, as the different
perspicuity of bodies. Two glasses put
together, will cause a divers refraction
from another single one that is but of
equall thicknesse and perspicuity.</p>
                     <p>3 From the different height of the
same planet at severall times. For if
according to the usuall <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> there
should be such distinct, solid Orbs,
then it would be impossible that the
planets should intrench upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Orbs, or that two of them at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times should be above one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20652:31"/>
which notwithstanding hath bin
proved to be so by later experience.
<hi>Tycho</hi> hath observed, that <hi>Venus</hi> is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
nearer to us than the Sunne or
<hi>Mercury,</hi> and somtimes farther off than
both; which appearances <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

also some authenticall Epistles
of <hi>Fredericus Caesius Lynceus,</hi> a Noble
Prince, written to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divers reasons to the same purpose.
You may also see the same truth set
downe by <hi>Iohannes Pena,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to <hi>Euclids Opticks,</hi> and <hi>Christoph.
Rothmannus,</hi> both who thought the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
to be onely ayre:<note place="margin">De stella l. 15. 72. l. 1. c. 9.</note> and though
the noble <hi>Tycho</hi> doe dispute against

quàm Aristotelica vulgariter approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
quae coelum pluribus realibus atque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perviis
orbibus citra rem replevit.</hi> 
                        <q>That
this opinion comes neerer to the
truth, than that common one of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
which hath to no purpose filled
the Heavens with such reall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious
Orbs.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. There is no element of fire,
which must be held with this opinion
here delivered; for if wee suppose a
world in the Moone, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the sphere of fire, either is
not there where 'tis usually placed in
the concavity of his Orbe, or else that
there is no such thing at all, which is
most probable, since there are not any
such solid Orbs, that by their swift
motion might heat and enkindle the
adjoyning ayre, which is imagined to
be the reason of that element. The
arguments that are commonly urged
to this purpose, are these.</p>
                     <p>1 That which was before alledged
concerning the refractions which will
be caused by a different medium. For
if the matter of the heavens be of one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20652:32"/>
thicknesse, and the element of fire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the upper Region of ayre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from both these, and the lower
Region severall from all the rest, there
will then be such a multiplicity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions,
as must necessarily destroy
the certainty of all Astronomicall
observations. All which inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
might be avoyded by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
(as wee doe) that there is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one Orbe of vaporous ayre which
encompasses our earth, all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Aethereall</hi> and of the same perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</p>
                     <p>2 The situation of this element does
no way agree with <hi>Aristotles</hi> own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or that common providence of
nature, which wee may discerne in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
matters. For if the heavens be
without all elementary qualities, as is
usually supposed, then it would be a
very incongruous thing for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fire to be placed immediatly
next unto it: Since the heat of this is
the most powerfull and vigorous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that is amongst all the rest; And
Nature in her other works, does not
joyne extreames, but by something of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20652:33"/>
a middle disposition. So in the very
frame of our bodies, the bones which
are of a hard substance, and the flesh of
a soft, are not joyned together but by
the intercession of membranes and
grissels, such as being of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may fitly come betwixt.</p>
                     <p>3 'Tis not conceiveable for what
use or benefit there should be any such
element in that place, and certaine it
is that Nature does not doe any thing
in vaine.</p>
                     <p>4 Betwixt two extreams there can
be but one Medium, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
those two opposite elements
of earth and water, it may seeme more
convenient to place onely the ayre,
which shall partake of middle quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
different from both.</p>
                     <p>5 Fire does not seeme so properly
and directly to be opposed to any
thing as Ice, and if the one be not an
element, why should the other?</p>
                     <p>If you object that the fire which we
commonly use, does alwayes tend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
I answer, This cannot prove
that there is a naturall place for such
an element, since our adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20652:33"/>
doe grant that <hi>culinary</hi> and <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi>
fire are of different kinds. The
one does burne, shine, and corrupt its
subject; the other disagrees from it in
all these respects. And therefore from
the ascent of the one, wee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
inferre the being or situation of
the other.</p>
                     <p>But for your farther satisfaction
herein, you may peruse <hi>Cardan, Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Pena</hi> that learned Frenchman, the
noble <hi>Tycho,</hi> with divers others who
have purposely handled this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                     <p>3. I might adde a third, <hi>viz.</hi> that
there is no Musick of the spheares; for
if they be not solid, how can their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cause any such sound as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
I doe the rather meddle with
this, because <hi>Plutarch</hi> speakes as if a
man might very conveniently heare
that harmony, if he were an inhabitant
in the Moone. But I guesse that hee
said this out of incogitancy, and did
not well consider those necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
which depended upon his
opinion. However, the world would
have no great losse in being deprived
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20652:34"/>
of this Musick, unlesse at somtimes we
had the priviledge to heare it: Then
indeed <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew thinks it would
save us the charges of dyet,<note place="margin">De somniis.</note> and wee
might live at an easie rate by feeding
at the eare only, and receiving no other
nourishment; and for this very reason
(sayes he) was <hi>Moses</hi> enabled to tarry
forty dayes and forty nights in the
Mount without eating any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee there heard the melody of
the Heavens.—<hi>Risum teneatis.</hi> I know
this Musick hath had great Patrons,
both sacred &amp; prophane Authors, such
as <hi>Ambrose, Bede, Boetius, Anselme, Plato,
Cicero,</hi> and others; but because it is not
now, I think, affirmed by any, I shall
not therefore bestow either paines or
time in arguing against it.</p>
                     <p>It may suffice that I have onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
these three last, and for the two
more necessary, have referred the
Reader to others for satisfaction. I
shall in the next place proceed to the
nature of the Moones body, to know
whether that be capable of any such
conditions, as may make it possible to
be inhabited, and what those qualities
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20652:34"/>
are wherein it more neerely agrees
with our earth.<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note>

                        <p>That the Moone is a solid, compacted, opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall not need to stand long in the

is a truth already agreed on by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

Philosophers.</p>
                     <p>1 It is solid, in opposition to fluid,
as is the ayre; for how otherwise could
it beat back the light which it receives
from the Sunne?</p>
                     <p>But here it may be questioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the Moone bestow her light
upon us by the reflection of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames
from the superficies of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or else by her owne illumination?
Some there are who affirme this latter
part. So<note n="a" place="margin">De coelo. l. 2. com. 49</note> 
                        <hi>Averroes,</hi>

                        <hi>Iulius Caesar, &amp;c.</hi> And their reason is,
because this light is discerned in many
places, whereas those bodies which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20652:35"/>
give light by reflexion, can there only
be perceived where the angle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
is equall to the angle of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and this is only in one place; as
in a looking-glasse, those beams which
are reflected from it, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in every place where you may
see the glasse, but onely there where
your eye is placed on the same line
whereon the beames are reflected.</p>
                     <p>But to this I answer, That the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not hold of such bodies
whose superficies is full of unequall
parts and gibbosities as the Moone is.
Wherfore it is as wel the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the more common opinion, that
her light proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
from reflexion &amp; illumination; nor
doth it herein differ from our earth,
since that also hath some light by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:
for how otherwise would
the parts about us in a Sunne-shine day
appeare so bright, when as the rayes
of reflexion cannot enter into our eye?</p>
                     <p>For the better illustration of this, we
may consider the several wayes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
divers bodies are enlightned. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as water by admitting the beams
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20652:35"/>
into its substance; or as ayre and thin
clouds, by transmitting the rayes quite
thorow their bodies; or as those things
that are of an opacous nature and
smooth superficies, which reflect the
light only in one place; or else as those
things which are of an opacous nature
and rugged superficies, which by a
kind of circumfluous reflexion, are at
the same time discernable in many
places, as our Earth and the Moone.</p>

                        <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus,</hi>
and some others, who held the
Moone to be of the same kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as a Pumice stone; &amp; this, say they,
is the reason why in the Suns eclipses
there appeares within her a duskish
ruddy colour, because the Sun beames
being refracted in passing through
the pores of her body, must necessarily
be represented under such a colour.</p>
                     <p>But I reply, if this be the cause of
her rednesse, then why doth shee not
appeare under the same forme when
shee is about a Sextile Aspect, and the
darkned part of her body is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20652:36"/>
for then also doe the same rayes
passe through her, and therefore in all
likelyhood should produce the same
effect; and notwithstanding those
beames are then diverted from us, that
they cannot enter into our eyes by a
straight line, yet must the colour still
remaine visible in her body. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
according to this opinion, the
spots would not alwayes be the same,
but divers as the various distance of
the Sunne requires.<note place="margin">Scaliger Exercit. 80 sect. 13.</note> Againe, if the Sun
beames did passe through her, why
then hath she not a taile (saith <hi>Scaliger)</hi>
as the Comets? why doth she appeare
in such an exact round? and not rather
attended with a long flame, since it is
meerely this penetration of the Sunne
beames, that is usually attributed to be
the cause of beards in blazing starres.</p>
                     <p>3. It is opacous, transparent
or diaphanous like Crystall or glasse,
as <hi>Empedocles</hi> thought,<note place="margin">Plut. de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Lunae.</note> who held the
Moon to be a globe of pure congealed
ayre, like haile inclosed in a spheare
of fire; for then,</p>
                     <p>1. Why does shee not alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the full? since the light is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20652:36"/>
dispersed through all her body?</p>
                     <p>2. How can the interposition of
her body so darken the Sunne,<note place="margin">Thucid. Livij.</note> or cause
such great eclipses as have turned day
into night,<note place="margin">Plut. de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Lunae.</note> that have discovered the
starres, and frighted the birds with
such a suddaine darknesse, that they
fell downe upon the earth, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in divers Histories. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Herodotus</hi> telling of an eclipse
which fell in <hi>Xerxes</hi> time, describes it
thus:<note place="margin">Herodot. l. 7 c 37.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.
The Sun leaving his wonted seat in the
heavens, vanished away: all which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
such a great darknesse, as could
not have beene, if her body had beene
perspicuous. Yet some there are who
interpret all these relations to be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berbolicall
expressions; and the noble
<hi>Tycho</hi> thinks it naturally impossible
that any eclipse should cause such
darknesse, because the body of the
Moone can never totally cover the
Sunne. However, in this he is singular,
all other Astronomers (if I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<hi>Keplar)</hi> being on the contrarie
opinion, by reason the Diameter of
the Moone does for the most part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20652:37"/>
bigger to us than the Diameter
of the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>But here <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> once more,<note place="margin">De phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. Lunae. c. 11.</note>
puts in to hinder our passage. The
Moone (saith he) is not altogether opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,
because 'tis still of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the heavens which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of totall opacity: and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because perspicuity is an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
accident of those purer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and this hee thinks must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be granted; for he stops there, and
proves no further; but to this I shall
deferre an answer, till hee hath made
up his argument.</p>
                     <p>Wee may frequently see, that her
body does so eclipse the Sunne, as our
Earth doth the Moone. And besides,
the mountains that are observed there,
doe cast a dark shadow behind them,<note place="margin">Prop. 9.</note>
as shall be shewed afterwards. Since
then the like interposition of them
both, doth produce the like effect, they
must necessarily be of the like natures,
that is, alike opacous, which is the
thing to be shewed; and this was the
reason (as the Interpreters guesse) why
<hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmed the Moone to be of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20652:37"/>
the Earths nature,<note place="margin">In lib. de animalib.</note> because of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in opacity,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note> whereas all the
other elements save that, are in some
measure perspicuous.</p>
                     <p>But, the greatest difference which
may seeme to make our Earth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unlike the Moone, is, because the
one is a bright body, and hath light of
its owne, and the other a grosse dark
body which cannot shine at all. 'Tis
requisite therefore that in the next
place I cleare this doubt, and shew that
the Moone hath no more light of her
owne than our Earth.</p>

<hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tostatus in 1 Gen.</note> that the Moone was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a contracted Sunne,<note place="margin">Hyeron. de Sancta fide. Hebraeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast. l. 2. c. 4</note> and
that both those planets at their first
creation, were equall both in light and
quantity. For, because God did then
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20652:38"/>
call them both great lights, therefore
they inferred that they must be both
equall in bignesse. But a while after
(as the tradition goes) the ambitious
Moone put up her complaint to God
against the Sunne, shewing that it was
not fit there should be two such great
lights in the heavens; a Monarchie
would best become the place of order
and harmony. Vpon this, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to contract her selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a narrower compasse; but shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much discontented hereat, replies,
What! because I have spoken that
which is reason and equity, must I
therefore be diminished? This sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
could not chuse but much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her; and for this reason was shee
in great distresse and griefe for a long
space; but that her sorrow might be
some way pacified, God bid her be of
good cheere, because her priviledges
and Charter should be greater than the
Sunnes; he should appeare in the day
time onely, shee both in the day and
night; but her melancholy being not
satisfied with this, shee replied againe,
That, that alas was no benefit; for in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20652:38"/>
the day time shee should be either not
seene, or not noted. Wherefore, God
to comfort her up, promised, that his
people the Israelites should celebrate
all their feasts and holy dayes by a
computation of her moneths; but this
being not able to content her, shee has
looked very melancholy ever since;
however, she hath still reserved much
light of her owne.</p>
                     <p>Others there were, that did think
the Moone to be a round globe; the
one halfe of whose body was of a
bright substance, the other halfe being
dark; and the divers conversions of
those sides towards our eyes, caused
the variety of her appearances: of this
opinion was <hi>Berosus,</hi> as hee is cited by
<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 9. Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturae.</note> 
                        <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">Narratio Psalmorum. item. ep. 119.</note>
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> thought it
was probable enough. But this fancie
is almost equally absurd with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and both of them sound rather
like fables, than Philosophicall truths.
You may commonly see how this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
does contradict frequent and easie
experience; for 'tis observed, that that
spot which is perceived about her
middle when shee is in the encrease,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20652:39"/>
may be discern'd in the same place
when she is in the full: whence it must
follow, that the same part which was
before darkned, is after inlightened,
and that the one part is not alwayes
dark, and the other light of it selfe. But
enough of this, I would be loth to
make an enemy, that I may afterwards
overcome him, or bestow time in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that which is already granted; I
suppose now, that neither of them
hath any patrons, and therefore need
no confutation.</p>
                     <p>'Tis agreed upon by all sides, that
this Planet receives most of her light
from the Sunne; but the cheife con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
is, whether or no shee hath
any of her owne? The greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
affirme this. <hi>Cardan</hi> amongst the
rest,<note place="margin">De Subtil. lib. 3.</note> is very confident of it, and hee
thinks that if any of us were in the
Moone at the time of her greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
<hi>Lunam aspiceremus non secus ac in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeris
cereis splendidissimis accensis, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
in eas oculis defixis caecutiremus;</hi>
                        <q>Wee should perceive so great a
brightnesse of her owne, that would
blinde us with the meere sight, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20652:39"/>
when she is enlightened by the Sun,
then no Eagles eye (if there were
any there) is able to look upon her.</q>
This <hi>Cardan</hi> sayes, and hee doth but
say it, without bringing any proofe for
its confirmation. However, I will set
downe the arguments that are usually
urged for this opinion, and they are
taken either from Scripture, or reason;
from Scripture is urged that place,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where it is said, <hi>There is one
glory of the Sunne, and another glory of the
Moone. Vlysses Albergettus</hi> urges that in
<hi>Math.</hi> 24. 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>The Moon shall not give her light:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(sayes he) shee hath some of her
owne.</p>
                     <p>But to these we may easily answer,
that the glory and light there spoken
of, may be said to be hers, though it
be derived, as you may see in many
other instances.</p>
                     <p>The arguments from reason are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
either.</p>
                     <p>1. From that light which is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in her, when there is a totall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
of her owne body, or of the
Sunne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:20652:40"/>
2. From the light which is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the darker part of her body,
when shee is but a little distant from
the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>1. For when there are any totall
eclipses, there appeares in her body a
great rednesse, and many times light
enough to cause a remarkable shade,
as common experience doth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifest: but this cannot come
from the Sun, since at such times ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the earth or her own body shades
her from the Sun-beames; therfore it
must proceed from her owne light.</p>
                     <p>2. Two or three dayes after the
new Moone, we may perceive light in
her whole body, whereas the rayes of
the Sun reflect but upon a small part
of that which is visible; therefore 'tis
likely that there is some light of her
owne.</p>
                     <p>In answering to these objections, I
shall first shew, that this light cannot
be her owne, and then declare that
which is the true reason of it.</p>
                     <p>That it is not her owne, appeares.</p>
                     <p>1 Because then she would alwayes
retaine it, but shee has beene some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20652:40"/>
altogether invisible, when as
notwithwanding some of the fixed
Starres of the fourth or fifth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
might easily have been discerned
close by her,<note place="margin">Keplar. epit. Astron. cop. l. 6. p. 5. sect. 2.</note> As it was in the yeare
1620.</p>
                     <p>2 This may appeare likewise from
the variety of it at divers times; for
'tis commonly observed that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis of a brighter, sometimes of
a darker appearance, now redder, and
at another time of a more duskish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
The observation of this variety
in divers eclipses, you may see set
downe by <hi>Keplar</hi> and many others.<note place="margin">Opt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stron. c. 7. num. 3.</note> But
now this could not be, if that light
were her owne, that being constantly
the same, and without any reason of
such an alteration: So that thus I may
argue.</p>
                     <p>If there were any light proper to
the Moone, then would that Planet
appeare brightest when she is eclipsed
in her Perige being neerest to the
earth, and so consequently more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and duskish when shee is in her
Apoge or farthest from it; the reason
is, because the neerer any enlightned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20652:41"/>
body comes to the sight, by so much
the more strong are the species and the
better perceived. This sequell is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some of our adversaries,<note place="margin">De nova stella. lib. 1. c. 10.</note> and
they are the very words of noble <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,

Moone had any light of her own, then
would she not lose it in the earths sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
but rather shine more clearely;
since every light appeares greater in
the dark, when it is not hindered by a
more perspicuous brightnesse.</p>
                     <p>But now the event falls out cleane
contrary,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reinhold</hi> Comment. in Purb. Theor pag. 164.</note> (as observation doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and our opposites themselves doe
grant) the Moone appearing with a
more reddish and cleare light when
she is eclipsed, being in her Apoge or
farthest distance, and a more blackish
iron colour when shee is in her Perige
or nearest to us, therefore she hath not
any light of her owne. Nor may wee
think that the earths shadow can cloud
the proper light of the Moone from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20652:41"/>
appearing, or take away any thing
from her inherent brightnesse; for this
were to think a shadow to be a body,
an opinion altogether misbecomming
a Philosopher, as <hi>Tycho</hi> grants in the
fore-cited place, <hi>Nec umbra terrae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreum
quid est, aut densa aliqua substantia,
ut Lunae lumen obtenebrare possit, atque id

any corporall thing, or thick sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that it can cloud the Moones
brightnesse, or take it away from our
sight; but it is a meere privation of the
Sunnes light by reason of the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the earths opacous body.</p>
                     <p>3 If she had any light of her owne,
then that would in it selfe be either
such a ruddy brightnesse as appeares
in the eclipses, or else such a leaden
duskish light as wee see in the darker
parts of her body, when shee is a little
past the conjunction. (That it must be
one of these may follow from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
arguments) but it is neither of
these, therefore shee hath none of her
owne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:20652:42"/>
1 'Tis not such a ruddy light as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in eclipses; for then why can
we not see the like rednesse, when wee
may discerne the obscurer parts of the
Moone?</p>
                     <p>You will say, perhaps, that then the
neerenesse of that greater light takes
away that appearance.</p>
                     <p>I reply, this cannot be; for then why
does <hi>Mars</hi> shine with his wonted red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when hee is neere the Moone?
or why cannot her greater brightnesse
make him appeare white as the other
Planets? nor can there be any reason
given why that greater light should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
her body under a false colour.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis not such a duskish leaden
light, as we see in the darker part of
her body, when shee is about a sextile
Aspect distant from the Sunne; for
then why does shee appeare red in the
eclipses, since meere shade cannot
cause such variety? for 'tis the nature
of darknesse by its opposition, rather
to make things appeare of a more
white and cleare brightnesse than they
are in themselves. Or if it be the shade,
yet those parts of the Moone are then
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20652:42"/>
in the shade of her body, and therefore
in reason should have the like rednesse.
Since then neither of these lights are
hers, it followes that she hath none of
her owne. Nor is this a singular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but it hath had many learned
Patrons;<note place="margin">Somn. Scip. l. 1. c. 20.</note> such was <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>But enough of this. I have now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
shewed what at the first I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,<note place="margin">Item Plinie lib. 2. ca. 6.</note> that this light is not proper to
the Moone.<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore.</note> It remaines in the next
place, that I tell you the true reason of
it.<note place="margin">Annot. in Gen. 6.</note> And here, I think 'tis probable
that the light which appeares in the
Moone at the eclipses, is nothing else
but the second species of the Sunnes
rayes which passe through the shadow
unto her body: and from a mixture of
this second light with the shadow, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that rednesse which at such times
appeares unto us. I may call it <hi>Lumen
crepusculinum,</hi> the <hi>Aurora</hi> of the Moon,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20652:43"/>
or such a kinde of blushing light, that
the Sunne causes when he is neere his
rising, when he bestowes some small
light upon the thicker vapours. Thus
we see commonly the Sunne being in
the Horizon, and the reflexion grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weak, how his beames make the
waters appeare very red.</p>

when they rose early in the morning,
and beheld the waters afarre off, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stooke
them for blood. <hi>Et causa hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
est quia radius solaris in Aurora con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahit
quandam rubedinem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Quaest. in hoc cap.</note> 
                        <hi>propter vapores

locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aquarum, in quo est repercussio,
esse rubrum,</hi> saith <hi>Tostatus.</hi> The reason
is, because of his rayes, which being
in the lower vapours, those doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay
an imperfect mixed light upon the
waters. Thus the Moone being in the
earths shadow, and the Sunne beames
which are round about it, not being
able to come directly unto her body,
yet some second rayes there are, which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20652:44"/>
passing through the shadow, make her
appeare in that ruddy colour: So that
shee must appeare brightest when shee
is eclipsed, being in her Apoge or
greatest distance from us, because then
the cone of the earths shadow is lesse,
and the refraction is made through a
narrower medium. So on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
shee must be represented under a
more dark and obscure forme when
she is eclipsed, being in her Perige or
neerest to the earth, because then shee
is involved in a greater shadow, or
bigger part of the cone, and so the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction
passing through a greater me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
the light must needs be weaker
which doth proceed from it. If you
ask now, what the reason may be of
that light which wee discerne in the
darker part of the new Moone? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
'tis reflected from our earth,
which returnes as great a brightnesse
to that Planet, as it receives from it.
This I shall have occasion to prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>

as he is cited for it by <hi>Lactantius;</hi>
though that Father (perhaps) did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
his meaning whilst hee relates it
thus <hi>Dixit Xenophanes, intra concavum
Lunae esse aliam terram, &amp; ibi aliud genus

terra, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee had conceived the
Moone to be a great hollow body, in
the midst of whose concavity, there
should be another globe of sea and
land, inhabited by men, as our earth is.
Whereas it seemes to be more likely
by the relation of others, that this
Philosophers opinion is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the same sence, as it is here to
be proved. True indeed, the Father
condemnes this assertion as an equall
absurdity to that of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> who
affirmed the snow to be black: but no
wonder, for in the very next Chapter
it is that hee does so much deride the
opinion of those who thought there
were <hi>Antipodes.</hi> So that his ignorance
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20652:45"/>
in that particular may perhaps disable
him from being a competent Judge in
any other the like point of Philosophy.
Vnto these agreed <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who
thought that our earth was but one of
the Planets which moved round about
the Sun,<note place="margin">De Coelo. l. 2. cap. 13.</note> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> relates it of him)
and the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> in generall did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that the Moone also was terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall,
&amp; that she was inhabited as this
lower world; That those living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and plants which are in her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
any of the like kind with us in the
same proportion, as their dayes are
longer than ours: <hi>viz.</hi> by 15 times.
This <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was esteemed by all,<note place="margin">Plut. ibid. cap. 30.</note>
of a most divine wit, as appeares espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by his valuation amongst the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who being commanded by
the Oracle to erect a statue to the
wisest <hi>Graecian,</hi> the Senate determined
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> to be meant,<note place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 34. cap. 6.</note> preferring him
in their judgements before the divine
<hi>Socrates,</hi> whom their Gods pronounc'd
the wisest. Some think him a <hi>Iew</hi> by
birth; but most agree that hee was
much conversant amongst the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder
sort and Priests of that Nation,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20652:46"/>
by whom hee was informed of many
secrets, and (perhaps) this opinion
which he vented afterwards in <hi>Greece,</hi>
where he was much opposed by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
in some worded disputations, but
never confuted by any solid reason.</p>
                     <p>To this opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did
<hi>Plato</hi> also assent, when he considered
that there was the like eclipse made
by the earth; and this, that it had no
light of its owne, that it was so full of
spots.<note place="margin">Plat. de conviviis.</note> And therefore wee may often
reade in him and his followers, of an

but afterwards this was mixed with
many ridiculous fancies: For some of
them considering the mysteries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the number 3, concluded that
there must necessarily be a Trinity of
worlds, whereof the first is this of
ours; the second in the Moon, whose
element of water is represented by the

end in earth as it began, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
it, that <hi>Mars</hi> shall be a spheare
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20652:46"/>
of the fire, <hi>Iupiter</hi> of ayre, <hi>Saturne</hi> of
water; and above all these, the Elysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
fields, spacious and pleasant places
appointed for the habitation of those
unspotted soules, that either never
were imprisoned in, or else now have
freed themselves from any commerce
with the body.<note place="margin">Exercit. 62.</note>

However, for the first part of this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was assented unto by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and by reason of the grosnesse
and inequality of this planet, 'twas
frequently called <hi>quasi terra coelestis,</hi> as
being esteemed the sediment and more
imperfect part of those purer bodies;<note place="margin">De facie Lunae.</note>
you may see this proved by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
in that delightfull work which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

                     <p>Thus <hi>Lucian</hi> also in his discourse of
a journey to the Moon, where though
hee does speake many things out of
mirth &amp; in a jesting manner: yet in the

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20652:47"/>
it did contain some serious truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the real frame of the Vniverse.</p>

each of them late Writers, and famous

<hi>Keplar</hi> calls this World by the
name of <hi>Levania</hi> from the Hebrew
word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which signifies the Moon,<note place="margin">Somn. Astr.</note>
and our earth by the name of <hi>Volva à

its diurnall revolution appeare unto
them constantly to turne round, and
therefore hee stiles those who live in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20652:47"/>
that Hemisphere which is towards us,
by the title of <hi>Subvolvani,</hi> because they
enjoy the sight of this earth; and the
others <hi>Privolvani, quia sunt privati con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu
volvae,</hi> because they are deprived
of this priviledge. But <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
whom I have above quoted, speaking
of their testimony whom I cite for
this opinion, <hi>viz. Keplar</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
affirmes that to his knowledge they
did but jest in those things which they
write concerning this,<note place="margin">Dephaenom. lunae. c. 4.</note> and as for any
such world, he assuredly knowes they
never so much as dreamt of it. But I
had rather beleeve their owne words,
than his pretended knowledge.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, in some things they
doe but trifle, but for the maine scope
of those discourses, 'tis as manifest
they seriously meant it, as any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader may easily discerne; As
for <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> 'tis evident that hee did
set downe his owne judgement and
opinion in these things; otherwise sure
<hi>Campanella</hi> (a man as well acquainted
with his opinion, and perhaps his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as <hi>Caesar</hi> was) would never have
writ an Apologie for him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20652:48"/>
'tis very likely if it had beene but
a jest, <hi>Galilaeus</hi> would never have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so much for it as report saith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he did.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Keplar,</hi> I will onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the Reader to his owne words as
they are set downe in the Preface to
the fourth book of his <hi>Epitome,</hi> where
his purpose is to make an Apologie
for the strangenesse of those truths
that he was there to deliver, amongst
which there are divers things to this
purpose concerning the nature of the
Moone. Hee professes that he did not
publish them either out of a humor of
contradiction, or a desire of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
or in a jesting way, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or others merry, but after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
and solemne manner for the
discovery of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the knowledge which
<hi>Caesar</hi> pretends to the contrary, you
may guesse what it was by his strange
confidence in other assertions,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> and his
boldnesse in them may well derogate
from his credit in this. For speaking
of <hi>Ptolome's Hypothesis,</hi> hee pronounces
this verdict, <hi>Impossibile est excentricorum
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20652:48"/>
&amp; epicyclorum positio, nec aliquis est ex
Mathematicis adeo stultus qui veram illam
existimet.</hi> 
                        <q>The position of <hi>Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes</hi>
and <hi>Epicycles</hi> is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
nor is there any Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
such a foole as to think it true.</q>
I should guesse hee could not have
knowledge enough to maintaine any
other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> who was so ignorant
in Mathematicks as to deny that any
good Author held this. For I would
faine know whether there were never
any that thought the Heavens to be
solid bodies, and that there were such
kindes of motion as is by those fained
Orbs supplied; if so, <hi>Caesar la Galla</hi> was
much mistaken. I think his assertions
are equally true, that <hi>Galilaeus</hi> and <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi>
did not hold this, and that there
were none which ever held that other.
Thus much for the testimony of those
who were directly of this opinion.</p>
                     <p>But, in my following discourse I
shall most insist on the observation of
<hi>Galilaeus,</hi> the inventor of that famous
Perspective, whereby we may discern
the Heavens hard by us; whereby
those things which others have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20652:49"/>
guest at, are manifested to the
eye, and plainely discovered beyond
exception or doubt; of which admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
invention, these latter Ages of
the world may justly boast, and for
this expect to be celebrated by poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
'Tis related of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> that hee
wished himselfe burnt with <hi>Phaeton,</hi>
so hee might stand over the Sunne to
contemplate its nature; had hee lived
in these dayes, he might have enjoyed
his wish at an easier rate, and scaling
the heavens by this glasse, might
plainely have discerned what hee so
much desired. <hi>Keplar</hi> considering those
strange discoveries which this Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
had made, could not choose but
cry out in a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and rapture of
admiration, <hi>O multiscium &amp; quovis scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
pretiosius perspicillum! an qui te dextrâ
tenet, ille non dominus constituatur operum
Dei?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De macula in sole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</note> And <hi>Iohannes Fabricius</hi> an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Writer, speaking of the same
glasse, and for this invention prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our age before those former times
of greater ignorance, sayes thus; <hi>Adeo
sumus superiores veteribus, ut quam illi
carminis magici pronunciatu demissam
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20652:49"/>
representâsse putantur, nos non tantum inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center
demittamus, sed etiam familiari quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
intuitu ejus quasi conditionem intue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amur.</hi>
                        <q>So much are wee above the
Ancients, that whereas they were
faine by their Magicall charmes to
represent the Moones approach, we
cannot onely bring her lower with a
greater innocence, but may also
with a more familiar view behold
her condition.</q> And because you
shall have no occasion to question the
truth of those experiments, which I
shall afterwards urge from it; I will
therefore set downe the testimony of
an enemie, and such a witnesse hath
alwayes beene accounted prevalent:
you may see it in the above-named
<hi>Caesar la Galla,</hi> whose words are these:
<hi>Mercurium caduceum gestantem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. cap. 1.</note>

carrying a rod in his hand to relate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20652:50"/>
newes from Heaven, and call back
the soules of the dead; but it hath
beene the happinesse of our industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Age to see and admire <hi>Galilaeus</hi>
the new Embassadour of the Gods
furnished with his Perspective to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the nature of the Starres, and
awaken the ghosts of the ancient
Philosophers.</q> So worthily &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did these men esteeme of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
invention.</p>
                     <p>Now, if you would know what
might be done by this glasse, in the
sight of such things as were neerer at
hand, the same Author will tell you,
when he sayes,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 6.</note> that by it those things
which could scarce at all be discerned
by the eye at the distance of a mile and
a half, might plainly and distinctly be
perceived for 16 <hi>Italian</hi> miles, &amp; that
as they were really in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any transposition or falsifying at
all. So that what the ancient Poets
were faine to put in a Fable, our more
happy Age hath found out in a truth,
and wee may discerne as farre with
these eyes which <hi>Galilaeus</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us, as <hi>Lynceus</hi> could with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20652:50"/>
those which the Poets attributed unto
him. But if you yet doubt whether all
these observations were true, the same
Author may confirme you, when hee
sayes they were shewed <hi>Non uni aut

                        <note place="margin">Apologia pro Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeo.</note>
Very many others, both English and
French, all who affirmed our Earth to
be one of the Planets, and the Sunne
to be the Center of all, about which
the heavenly bodies did move. And
how horrid soever this may seeme at
the first, yet is it likely enough to be
true, nor is there any maxime or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in Opticks (saith <hi>Pena)</hi> that
can disprove it.</p>
                     <p>Now if our earth were one of the

the Reader, what method I shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the proving of this chiefe asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there is a World in the

                     <p>The order by which I shall be

uses in his book <hi>De mundo</hi> (if that book

                        </gap> of those chiefe
parts which are in it; not the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and aethereall (as hee doth there)
since this doth not belong to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Land, &amp;c. Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, of

                     <head>Proposition 7.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>That those spots and brighter parts which
by our sight may be distinguished in the
Moone, doe shew the difference betwixt
the Sea and Land in that other World.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the cleare proofe of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
I shall first reckon up
and refute the opinions of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter and forme of those
spots, and then shew the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of this present assertion, and
how agreeable it is to that truth,
which is most commonly received;
As for the opinions of other concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these, they have beene very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
I will only reckon up those which
are common and remarkable.</p>
                     <p>Some there are that think those
spots doe not arise from any deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the parts, but a deceit of the eye,
which cannot at such a distance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
an equall light in that Planet;
but these doe but only say it, and shew
not any reason for the proofe of their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20652:52"/>
opinion: Others think that there are
some bodies betwixt the Sunne and
Moone,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>So</hi> Bede <hi>in</hi> l. de Mund. constit.</note> which keeping off the light in
some parts, doe by their shadow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these spots which we there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</p>
                     <p>Others would have them to be the
figure of the seas or mountaines here
below, represented there as in a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glasse.
But none of those fancies
can be true, because the spots are still
the same, and not varied according to
the difference of places; and besides,
<hi>Cardan</hi> thinks it is impossible that any
image should be conveyed so farre as
there to be represented unto us at such
a distance.<note place="margin">De subtil. lib. 3.</note> But 'tis commonly related
of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he by writing what
he pleased in a glasse, by the reflexion
of the same species, would make those
letters to appeare in the circle of the
Moone, where they should be legible
by any other, who might at that time
be some miles distant from him.<note n="a" place="margin">Occulta. Philos. l. 1. cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
affirmes this to be possible, and
the way of performing it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to himselfe, with some others
in his time. It may be, that Bishop
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20652:53"/>
                        <hi>Godwine</hi> did by the like meanes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
those strange conclusions, which
he professes in his <hi>Nuncius inanimatus,</hi>
where he pretends, that he can inform
his friends of what he pleases, though
they be an hundred miles distant, <hi>forte
etiam, vel milliare millesimum,</hi> (they are
his owne words) and, perhaps, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and all this in a little space,
quicker than the Sunne can move.</p>
                     <p>Now, what conveyance there
should be, for so speedy a passage, I
cannot conceive, unlesse it be carried
with the light, than which wee know
not any thing quicker; But of this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the way; however, whether
those images can be represented so or
not, yet certaine it is, those spots are
not such representations. Some think
that when God had at first created too
much earth to make a perfect globe,
not knowing well where to bestow
the rest, hee placed it in the Moone,
which ever since hath so darkned it in
some parts; but the impiety of this
is sufficient confutation, since it so
much detracts from the divine power
and wisedome.</p>

                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:20652:53"/>
The<note n="a" place="margin">Plut. de placit. phil. l. 2. c. 25.</note> Stoicks held that Planet to
be mixed of fire and ayre, and in their
opinion, the variety of its compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
caused her spots: Being not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to stile the same body a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,

                     <p>—But this Planet cannot consist of fire
(saith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> because there is not any
fewell to maintaine it. And the Poets
have therefore fained <hi>Vulcan</hi> to be

                        <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> thought all the starres
to be of an earthly nature, mixed with
some fire; and as for the Sunne, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it to be nothing else but a fiery
stone; for which later opinion, the
<hi>Athenians</hi> sentenc'd him to death;<note place="margin">Iosephus l. 2. con.</note>

stone,<note place="margin">App. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei. l 18. c 41.</note> whereas notwithstanding, they
were so senslesse in their adoration of
Idols, as to make a stone their God.
This <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> affirmed the Moone
to be more terrestriall than the other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20652:54"/>
Planets, but of a greater purity than
anything here below, and the spots he
thought were nothing else, but some
cloudy parts, intermingled with the
light w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> belonged to that Planet; but I
have above destroyed the supposition
on which this fancy is grounded.<note place="margin">Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
thinks they arise from some dros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
stuffe, mixed with that moysture
which the Moone attracts unto her
selfe; but he was of their opinion who
thought the starres were nourished by
some earthly vapours, which you may

to be the thicker parts of the Moone,<note place="margin">Opt. lib. 9. Comment. in Purb. pag. 164.</note>
into which the Sunne cannot infuse
much light; and this (say they) is the
reason why in the Sunnes eclipses
the spots and brighter parts are still
in som measure distinguished, because
the Sun beames are not able so well
to penetrate through those thicker, as
they may through the thinner parts
of that Planet. Of this opinion also
was <hi>Caesar la Galla,</hi> whose words are
these; <q>The Moone doth there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20652:54"/>
clearest, where she is transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
not onely through the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,<note place="margin">Ex qua parte luna est transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cua non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum secundum superficiem, sed etiam secundum substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, eatenus clara, ex qua autem parte opaca est, eatenus obscura vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur. De Phaenom. cap. 11.</note>
but the substance also, and
there shee seemes spotted, where
her body is most opacous.</q> The
ground of this his assertion was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee thought the Moone did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and bestow her light by illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
onely, and not at all by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
but this, together with the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
penetration of the Sun-beames,
and the perspicuity of the Moones bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
I have above answered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
                     <p>The more common and generall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is, that the spots are the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
parts of the Moone,<note place="margin">Albert. mag. de Coaevis. Q. 4. Art. 21.</note> which are
lesse able to reflect the beames that
they receive from the Sunne, and this
is most aggreeable to reason; for if the
starres are therefore brightest,<note place="margin">Colleg. Con.</note> because
they are thicker and more solid than
their orbes, then it will follow, that
those parts of the Moone which have
lesse light, have also lesse thicknesse.
It was the providence of nature (say
some) that so contrived that planet
to have these spots within it, for since
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20652:55"/>
that is neerest to those lower bodies
which are so full of deformity, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that it should in some measure
agree with them, and as in this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
world, the higher bodies are the
most compleat, so also in the heavens
perfection is ascended unto by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and the Moone being the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,<note place="margin">De Somniis</note>
must be the least pure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Philo</hi> the Jew interpreting <hi>Iacobs</hi>
dreame concerning the ladder, doth
in an allegory shew, how that in the
fabricke of the world, all things grow
perfecter as they grow higher, and this
is the reason (saith he) why the Moone
doth not consist of any pure simple
matter, but is mixed with aire, which
shewes so darkely within her body.</p>
                     <p>But this cannot be a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for though it were true that nature
did frame every thing perfecter as it
was higher, yet is it as true that nature
frames every thing fully perfect for
that office to which shee intends it.
Now, had she intended the Moone
meerely to reflect the Sunne-beames
and give light, the spots then had not
so much argued her providence, as her
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20652:55"/>
unskilfulnesse and oversight, as if in
the haste of her worke shee could not
tell how to make that body exactly fit
for that office to which shee intended
it.<note place="margin">Scalig. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. 62.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tis likely then that she had some
other end which moved her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this variety, and this in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
was her intent to make it a fit
body for habitation with the same
conveniences of sea and land, as this
inferiour world doth partake of. For
since the Moone is such a vast, such a
solid and opacous body, like our earth
(as was above proved) why may it
not be probable, that those thinner
and thicker parts appearing in her, doe
shew the difference betwixt the sea
and land in that other world? and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus</hi>
doubts not, but that if our earth
were visible at the same distance, there
would be the like appearance of it.</p>
                     <p>If wee consider the Moone as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
habitable earth, then the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of it will be altogether exact,
and beautifull, and may argue unto us
that it is fully accomplished for all
those ends to which Providence did
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20652:56"/>
appoint it. But consider it barely as a
starre or light, and then there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in it much imperfection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie,
as being of an impure darke
substance, and so unfit for the office of
that nature.</p>
                     <p>As for the forme of those spots,
some of the vulgar thinke they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
a man, and the Poëts guesse tis the
boy <hi>Endymion,</hi> whose company shee
loves so well, that shee carries him
with her, others will have it onely to
be the face of a man as the Moone is
usually pictured, but <hi>Albertus</hi> thinkes
rather, that it represents a Lyon with
his taile towards the East, and his head
the West, and<note n="*" place="margin">Eusebius Nicremb. Hist. Nat. l. 8. c. 15.</note> some others have
thought it to be very much like a Fox,
and certainly 'tis, as much like a Lyon
as that in the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> or as <hi>Vrsa major</hi>
is like a Beare.</p>
                     <p>I should guesse that it represents one
of these as well as another, and any
thing else as well as any of these, since
'tis but a strong imagination, which
fancies such images as schoole-boyes
usually doe in the markes of a wall,
whereas there is not any such simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20652:56"/>
in the spots themselves,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</note> which
rather like our Sea, in respect of the
land, appeares under a rugged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
figure, and doth not represent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
distinct image, so that both in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the matter, and the forme it
may be probable enough, that those
spots and brighter parts may shew the
the distinction betwixt the Sea and
Land in that other world.</p>

                     <p>WHen I first compared the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our earth and water
with those appearances in the Moone;
I concluded contrary to the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the brighter parts represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the water, and the spots the land;
of this opinion likewise was <hi>Keplar</hi> at
the first.<note place="margin">Opt. Astro. c. 6 num 9 D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

                           </gap>t cum nuncio Gal.</note> But my second thoughts, and
the reading of others, have now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me (as after he was) of the
truth of that proposition which I have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20652:57"/>
now set downe. Before I come to the
confirmation of it, I shall mention
those scruples which at first made mee
doubt the truth of this opinion.</p>
                     <p>1. It may be objected, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
if there bee any such sea and
land as ours, that it beares some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and similitude with ours: but
now this proposition takes away all
likenesse betwixt them. For whereas
the superficies of our earth is but the
third part of the whole surface in the
globe,<note place="margin">Exercit. 38</note> two parts being overspread
with the water (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes)
yet here, according to this opinion, the
Sea should be lesse than the land, since
there is not so much of the bespotted,
as there is of the enlightened parts,
wherefore 'tis probable, that there is
no such thing at all, or else that the
brighter parts are the Sea.</p>
                     <p>2. The water, by reason of the
smoothnesse of its superficies, seemes
better able to reflect the Sun-beames
than the earth, which in most places is
so full of ruggednesse of grasse and
trees, and such like impediments of
reflexion; and besides, common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20652:57"/>
shewes, that the water shines
with a greater &amp; more glorious bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
than the earth; therfore it should
seeme that the spots are the earth, and
the brighter parts the water. But to
the first it may be answered.</p>
                     <p>1. There is no great probability in
this consequence, that because 'tis so
with us, therefore it must be so with
the parts of the Moone, for since there
is such a difference betwixt them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other respects, they may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
agree in this.</p>
                     <p>2. That assertion of <hi>Scaliger</hi> is not
by all granted for a truth.<note place="margin">De Metco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris l. 5. c. 1. Art. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Fromondus</hi>
with others thinke that the superficies
of the Sea and Land in so much of the
world as is already discovered, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
and of the same extension.</p>
                     <p>3. The Orbe of thicke and vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
aire which inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passes the Moone,
makes the brighter parts of that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
appeare bigger than in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they are; as I shall shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>To the second it may be answered,
that, that though the water be of a
smooth superficies, and so may seeme
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20652:58"/>
most fit to reverberate the light, yet
because 'tis of a perspicuous nature,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6</note>
therefore the beames must sinke into
it, and cannot so strongly and clearely
be reflected. <hi>Sicut in speculo ubi plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum
abrasum fuerit,</hi> (saith <hi>Cardan)</hi> as
in Looking-glasses where part of the
lead is razed off, and nothing left
behind to reverberate the image, the
species must there passe through and
not back againe; so it is where the
beames penetrate and sinke into the
substance of the body, there cannot
be such an immediate and strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
as when they are beate back
from the superficies, and therefore the
Sunne causes a greater heate by farre
upon the Land than upon the water.
Now as for that experiment where it
is sayd, that the waters have a greater
brightnesse than the Land: I answer,
'tis true onely there where they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the image of the Sunne or some
bright cloud, and not in other places,
especially if wee looke upon them at
any great distance, as is very plaine by
common observation.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis certaine that from any high
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20652:58"/>
mountaine the land dos appeare a
great deale brighter than any lake or
river.<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may yet be farther illustrated
by the similitude of a looking glasse
hanging upon a wall in the Sun-shine,
where, if the eye be not placed in the
just line of reflexion from the glasse,
tis manifest that the wall will bee of a
brighter appearance than the glasse.
True indeed in the line of reflexion,
the light of the glasse is equall almost
unto that which comes immediately
from the Sunne it selfe; but now this
is onely in one particular place and so
is not like that brightnesse which wee
discerne in the Moone, because this
dos appeare equally in severall situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
like that of the wall which doe
seeme bright as well from every place
as from any one. And therefore the
ruffnesse of the wall, or (as it is in the
objection) the ruggednesse of our
earth is so farre from being an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of such a reflexion as there is
from the Moone, that it is rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as a necessary condition unto it.
We may conceive that in every rough
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20652:59"/>
body there are, as it were innumerable
superficies, disposed unto an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diversitie of inclinations. <hi>Ita ut
nullus sit locus,</hi>

                        <hi>ad quem non pertingant

                        <q>So
that there is not any place unto
which there are not some beams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
from these diverse superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
in the severall parts of such a
rugged body.</q> But yet (as I said
before) the earth dos receive a great
part of its light by illumination, as wel
as by reflexion.</p>
                     <p>So that notwithstanding those
doubts, yet this proposition may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
true, that the spots may be the
Sea, and the brighter parts the Land.
Of this opinion was <hi>Plutarch:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De facio lun.</note> unto him
assented <hi>Keplar</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dissertatio. Nunc. Syd.</note> whose
words are these, <hi>Si quis veterum Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreorum
sententiam exuscitare velit,
lunam scilicet esse quasi tellurem alteram,
ejus pars lucidior terrenam superficiem,
obscurior verò aqueam magis congruè re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praesentet.
Mihi autem dubium fuit nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20652:59"/>
a radiis solaribus perfusi, terream
superficiem clariorem, obscuriorem vero a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queam
sese in conspectum daturam.</hi> 
                        <q>If
any man have a mind to renue the
opinion of the <hi>Phythagoreans,</hi> that the
Moone is another earth, then her
brighter parts may fitly represent
the earths superficies, and the darker
part the water: and for my part, I
never doubted but that our earthly
globe being shined upon by the
Sunne, and beheld at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Land would appeare
brightest, and the Sea more obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>
The reasons may be.</p>
                     <p>1. That which I urged about the
foregoing chapter, because the water
is the thinner part, and therefore must
give lesse light.</p>
                     <p>Since the Starres and Planets, by
reason of their brightnesse, are usually
concluded to bee the thicker parts of
their orbe.</p>
                     <p>2. Water is in it selfe of a blacker
colour (saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> and therefore
more remote from light than the earth.<note place="margin">In lib. de coloribus.</note>
Any parts of the ground being moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with raine, dos looke much more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20652:60"/>
darkely than when it is dry.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis observed that the seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
light of the Moone (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
is proved to proceede from our
earth) is sensibly brighter unto us, for
two or three dayes before the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
in the morning when she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
Eastward, than about the same
time after the conjunction, when shee
is seene in the West. The reason of
which must be this, because that part
of the earth which is opposite to the
Moone in the East, has more land in it
than Sea. Whereas on the contrary,
the Moone when she is in the West, is
shined upon by that part of our earth
where there is more Sea than Land,
from whence it will follow with good
probabilitie that the earth dos cast a
greater light than the water.</p>
                     <p>4. Because observation tels us, that
the spotted parts are alwayes smooth
and equall, having every where an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of light when once they are
enlightned by the Sunne, whereas the
brighter parts are full of rugged gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosities
and mountaines, having many
shades in them, as I shall shew more at
large afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:20652:60"/>
That in this Planet there must bee
Seas, <hi>Campanella</hi> indeavours to prove
out of Scripture interpreting <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
above the Firmament</hi> spoken in
<hi>Genesis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apologia pro Galilaeo.</note> to bee meant of the Sea in this
world. For (saith he) 'tis not likely
that there are any such waters above
the Orbes to moderate that heate
which they receive from their swift
motion (as some of the Fathers think.)
Nor did <hi>Moses</hi> meane the Angels
which may be called spirituall waters,
as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> would have it,<note place="margin">Vide Ieron. epist. ad Pammachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> for
both these are rejected by the generall
consent: Nor could he meane any
waters in the second region,<note place="margin">Confession. l. 13. c. 32. Retracted. lib. 2. Retr. cap. 6.</note> as most
Commentators interpret it. For first
there is nothing but vapours, which
though they are afterwards turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
water, yet while they remayne
there, they are onely the matter of
that element, which may as well bee
fire or earth or ayre. 2 Those vapours
are not above the expansum but in it.
So that hee thinkes there is no other
way to salve all, but by making the
Planets severall worlds with Sea and
Land, with such Rivers &amp; Springs as we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20652:61"/>
have here below: Especially since
<hi>Esdras</hi> speakes of the springs above
the Firmament.<note place="margin">2 Esdr 4. 7.</note> But I cannot agree
with him in this, nor doe I thinke that
any such thing can bee proved out of
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceede to the next posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall first answer some doubts
which might be made against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie
of this truth, whereby it may
seeme impossible that there should be
either Sea or Land in the Moone; for
since she moves so swiftly as Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
observe, why then does there
nothing fall from her, or why doth
she not shake something out by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
of her revolution? I answer, you
must know that the inclination of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heavy body to its proper Center,
doth sufficiently tie it unto its place; so
that suppose any thing were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet must it necessarily returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
And there is no more danger
of their falling into our world than
there is feare of our falling into the
Moone.</p>
                     <p>But yet there are many fabulous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of such things as have dropped
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20652:61"/>
thence. There is a tale of the Nemean
Lyon that <hi>Hercules</hi> slew, which first
rushing among the heards out of his
unknowne den in the Mountaine of
<hi>Cytheron</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vide Guli: Nubrigens. de rebus Anglica: lib. 1.</note> the credulous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thought hee was sent from their
Goddesse the Moone. And if a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
did chance to snatch any thing
up, and afterwards raine it downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the ignorant multitude were apt
to believe that it dropt from Heaven.
Thus <hi>Avicenna</hi> relates the story of a
Calfe which fell downe in a storme,
the beholders thinking it a Moone-calfe,
and that it fell thence. So <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
travelling upon the Apennine Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
a sudden blast tooke off his hat,
which if it had been carryed farre, he
thinks the peasants who had perceived
it to fall, would have sworne it had
rained hats. After some such manner,
many of our prodigies come to passe,
and the people are willing to believe
any thing, which they may relate to
others as a very strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
event. I doubt not but the Trojan
<hi>Palladium,</hi> the Romane <hi>Minerva,</hi> and
our Ladies Church at <hi>Loretto,</hi> with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20652:62"/>
many sacred reliques preserved by the
Papists might drop from the Moone as
well as any of these.</p>
                     <p>But it may be againe objected, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there were a bullet shot up in that
world, would not the Moone runne
away from it, before it could fall
downe, since the motion of her body
(being every day round our earth) is
farre swifter than the other, and so
the bullet must be left behind, and at
length fall downe to us? To this I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</p>
                     <p>1. If a bullet could bee shot so far
till it came to the circumference of
those things which belong to our cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then it would fall downe to us.</p>
                     <p>2. Though there were some heavie
body a great height in that ayre, yet
would the motion of its center belong
by an attractive vertue still hold it
within its convenient distance, so that
whether their earth moved or stood
still, yet would the same violence cast
a body from it equally far. That I may
the plainer expresse my meaning, I will
set downe this Diagramme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:20652:62"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose this earth were A, which
was to move in the circle C D. and
let the bullet be supposed at B. within
its proper verge; I say, whether this
earth did stand still or move swiftly
towards D, yet the bullet would still
keepe at the same distance by reason
of that Magnetick vertue of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(if I may so speake) whereby all
things within its spheare are attracted
with it. So that the violence to the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20652:63"/>
bullet,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</note> being nothing else but that
whereby 'tis removed from its center,
therefore an equall violence can carry
a body from its proper place, but at
an equall distance, whether or no this
earth where its center is, dos stand still
or move.</p>
                     <p>The impartiall Reader may finde
sufficient satisfaction for this and such
other arguments as may be urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the motion of that earth, in the

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20652:63"/>
bee found as much to conduce to the

them for many excellent uses:<note place="margin">Nat. hist. l. 36. c. 1.</note> partly
to tame the violence of greater Rivers;
to strengthen certaine joynts within
the veines and bowels of the earth, to
break the force of the Seas inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for the safety of the earths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
whether beasts or men. That
they make much for the protection of
beasts, the Psalmist testifies,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. v. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>The highest
hils are a refuge for the wild goates, and

had likewise learned the safety of

he also was faine to make a mountaine

<hi>Saul,</hi> who persecuted him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</p>
                     <p>True indeed, such places as these
keepe their neighbours poore, as being

them safe, as being most strong; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
our unconquered <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
whose greatest protection hath
beene the naturall strength of their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20652:64"/>
Countrey, so fortified with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
that these have alwayes beene
unto them sure retraites from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and oppression of others. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a good Author doth rightly call
them natures bulwarks, cast up at God
Almighties owne charges, the scornes
and curbes of victorious armies; which
made the Barbarians in <hi>Curtius</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of their owne safety, when they
were once retired to an inaccessible
mountaine, that when <hi>Alexanders</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
had brought them to a parley, and
perswading them to yeeld, told them
of his masters victories, what Seas and
Wildernesses he had passed; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that all that might be, but could
<hi>Alexander</hi> fly too? Over the Seas hee
might have ships, and over the land
horses, but hee must have wings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee could get up thither. Such
safety did those barbarous nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in the mountaines whereunto
they were retired. Certainly then such
usefull parts were not the effect of
mans sin, or produced by the Worlds
curse, the Flood, but rather at the first
created by the goodnesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20652:64"/>
of the Almightie.</p>
                     <p>This truth is usually concluded
from these and the like arguments.</p>
                     <p>1. Because the Scripture it selfe, in
the description of that generall deluge,
tells us, it overflowed the highest
mountaines.</p>
                     <p>2. Because <hi>Moses</hi> who writ long
after the Flood, dos yet give the same
description of places and rivers, as they
had before; which could not well have
been if this had made so strange an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis evident that the trees did
stand as before. For otherwise <hi>Noah</hi>
could not so well have concluded, that
the waters were abated, from this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because the Dove brought an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
leafe in her mouth, when she was
sent forth the second time: whereas
had the trees been rooted up, she might
have taken it the first time, from one
of them as it was floating on the top of
the waters. Now if the motion of
the water was not so violent as to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the trees, much lesse was it able to
cast up such vast heapes as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:20652:65"/>
4. When the Scripture doth set
forth unto us the power and immensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of God by the varietie or useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the creatures which hee hath
made, amongst the rest it doth often
mention the mountaines. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 8.
item. 148. 9. <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. 12. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis probable they were created at
the first. Unto this I might adde that
in other places Divine Wisdome in
shewing of its owne antiquitie,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 25.</note> saith
that he was <hi>From the beginning, before
the earth or the mountains were brought
forth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 90. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. If we may trust the relations of
Antiquitie,<note place="margin">Ioseph. Ant. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>. c. 3.</note> there were many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
left undefaced after the Flood.</p>
                     <p>So that if I intend to prove that the
Moone is such a habitable world as
this is; 'tis requisite that I shew it to
have the same conveniences of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this hath; and here if some Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
or Chymick were to handle the
point, they would first prove it out of
Scripture, from that place in <hi>Moses</hi>
his blessing, where hee speakes of the
ancient mountaines and lasting hills,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20652:65"/>
having immediately before mentioned
those blessings which should happen
unto <hi>Ioseph</hi> by the influence of the
Moone, he does presently exegetically
iterate them in blessing him with the
chiefe things of the ancient moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and lasting hills; you may also
see the same expression used in <hi>Iacobs</hi>
blessing of <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But however we may deale <hi>pro</hi> or
<hi>con</hi> in Philosophy, yet we must not
bee too bold with divine truths, or
bring Scripture to patronize any fancy
of our owne, though, perhaps, it be a
truth. I am not of their mind who
think it a good course to confirme Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall
secrets from the letter of
the Scripture, or by abusing some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
text in it. Mee thinks it savors
too much of that Melancholly humor
of the Chymicks, who, aiming in all
their studies at the making of gold,
doe perswade themselves, that the
most learned and subtile of the antient
Authors, in all their obscure places
doe meane some such sence as may
make to their purpose. And hence it is
that they derive such strange mysteries
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20652:66"/>
from the fables of the Poëts, and can
tell you what great secret it was that
antiquitie did hide under the fiction of
<hi>Iupiter</hi> being turned into a shower of
gold: of <hi>Mercuries</hi> being made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> gods: of the <hi>Moones</hi>
descending to the earth for the love
of <hi>Endymion:</hi> with such ridiculous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of these and the like
fables, which any reasonable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
man cannot conceive to proceed
from any but such as are distracted.
No lesse fantasticall in this kind are
the Jewish Rabbies, amongst whom
is not any opinion, whether in nature
or policy, whether true or false, but
some of them, by a Cabalisticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
can father it upon a darke
place of Scripture, or (if need bee)
upon a text that is cleane contrary.
There being not any absurditie so
grosse and incredible, for which these
abusers of the text, will not find out
an argument. Whereas, 'tis the more
naturall way, and should be observed
in all controversies, to apply unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, the proper proofes of it; and
when wee deale with Philosophicall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20652:66"/>
truths, to keepe our selves within the
bounds of humane reason and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>But this by the way. For the better
proofe of this proposition, I might
here cite the testimony of <hi>Diodorus,</hi>
who thought the Moone to bee full of
rugged places, <hi>velut terrestribus tumulis
superciliosam;</hi> but hee erred much in
some circumstances of this opinion,
especially where he sayes, there is an
Iland amongst the <hi>Hyperboreans,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those hills may to the eye bee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered; and for this reason<note n="*" place="margin">Lect. aut. l. 1. c. 15.</note>
                        <hi>Caelius</hi> calls him a fabulous Writer. But
you may see more expresse authority
for the proofe of this in the opinions
of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Plut. de plac. l. 2. c. 25.</note> who
held that this Planet was full of cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
grounds, mountains and vallies.
And this seemed likewise probable
unto <hi>Augustinus Nifus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Coelo. l. 2. part. 49.</note> whose words
are these: <hi>Forsitan non est remotum dicere
lunae partes esse diversas, veluti sunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
terrae, quarum aliae sunt vallosae, aliae
montosae, ex quarum differentia effici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

nam luna est corpus imperfectè Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20652:67"/>
cum sit corpus ab ultimo coelo elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum,
ut supra dixit Aristoteles.</hi> 
                        <q>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
it would not be amisse to say
that the parts of the Moone were
divers, as the parts of this earth,
whereof some are vallies, and some
mountaines, from the difference of
which, some spots in the Moone
may proceed; nor is this against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for that Planet cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecty
sphericall, since 'tis so remote
a body from the first orbe, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
had said before.</q> You may see
this truth assented unto by <hi>Blancanus</hi>
the Jesuit,<note place="margin">De Mundi fab. pars 3. c. 4.</note> and by him confirmed with
divers reasons. <hi>Keplar</hi> hath observed
in the Moones eclipses,<note place="margin">Astron. Opt. c. 6. num. 9.</note> that the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her inlightned part from the
shaded, was made by a crooked une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
line, of which there cannot bee
any probable cause conceived, unlesse
it did arise from the ruggednes of that
Planet; for it cannot at all be produc'd
from the shade of any mountaines here
upon earth, because these would bee
so lessened before they could reach so
high in a conicall shadow, that they
would not be at all sensible unto us (as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20652:67"/>
might easily bee demonstrated) nor
can it be conceived what reason of this
difference there should be in the Sun.
Wherefore there being no other body
that hath any thing to doe in eclipses,
we must necessarily conclude, that it
is caused by a variety of parts in the
Moone it selfe, and what can these
be but its gibbosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ties? Now if you
should aske a reason why there should
bee such a multitude of these in that
Planet, the same <hi>Keplar</hi> shall jest you
out an answer. Supposing (saith hee)
that those inhabitants are bigger than
any of us in the same proportion, as
their dayes are longer than ours, viz.
by fifteen times it may be, for want
of stones to erect such vast houses as
were requisite for their bodies, they
are faine to digge great and round hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in the earth, where they may
both procure water for their thirst, and
turning about with the shade,<note place="margin">Kep append. Selenogra.</note> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
those great heats which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would be liable unto; or if
you will give <hi>Caesar la Galla</hi> leave to
guesse in the same manner, he would
rather thinke that those thirsty nations
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20652:68"/>
cast up so many and so great heaps of
earth in digging of their wine cellars;
but this onely by the way.</p>
                     <p>I shall next produce the eye-witnesse
of <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nuncius Sydereus.</note> on which I most of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
for the proofe of this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he beheld the new Moone
through his perspective, it appeared to
him under a rugged and spotted figure,
seeming to have the darker and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
parts divided by a tortuous
line, having some parcels of light at a
good distance from the other; and this
difference is so remarkable, that you
may easily perceive it through one of
those ordinary perspectives, which are
commonly sold amongst us; but for
your better apprehending of what I
deliver, I will set downe the Figure as
I find it in <hi>Galilaeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:20652:68"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose A B C D to represent the
appearance of the Moones body being
in a sextile, you may see some brighter
parts separated at a pretty distance
from the other, which can be nothing
else but a reflexion of the Sun beames
upon some parts that are higher than
the rest, and those obscure gibbosities
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20652:69"/>
which stand out towards the enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
parts, must be such hollow and
deepe places whereto the rayes cannot
reach. But when the Moone is got
farther off from the Sunne, and come
to that fulnesse as this line B D
doth represent her under, then doe
these parts also receive an equall light,
excepting onely that difference which
doth appeare betwixt their sea &amp; land.
And if you doe consider how any rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
body would appeare being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
you would easily conceive
that it must necessarily seeme under
some such gibbous unequall forme, as
the Moone is here represented. Now
for the infallibility of these appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
I shall referre the reader to that
which hath been said in the sixth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Caesar la Galla</hi> affirmes, that all
these appearances may consist with a
plaine superficies, if wee suppose the
parts of the body to be some of them
<hi>Diaphanous,</hi> and some <hi>Opacous;</hi> and if
you object that the light which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayd
to any diaphanous part in a plaine
superficies, must bee by a continued
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20652:69"/>
line, whereas here there appeare many
brighter parts among the obscure at
some distance from the rest. To this
he answers, it may arise from some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
conveyances and channels within
her body, that doe consist of a more
diaphanous matter, which being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with an opacous superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
the light passing through them
may break out a great way off; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other parts betwixt, may still
remaine darke. Just as the River <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusa</hi>
in <hi>Sicily</hi> which runnes under
ground for a great way, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
breaks out againe. But because
this is one of the chiefest fancies,
whereby hee thinks hee hath fully
answered the argument of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I will therefore set downe his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in his owne words, least the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
might suspect more in them than I
have expressed.<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Non est impossibile coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos

sed opacâ superficie protendi, usque in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanam
aliquam ex profundo in superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
emergentem partem, per quos ductus
lume nlongo postmodum interstitio erum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat,
&amp;c.</hi> But I reply, if the superficies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20652:70"/>
betwixt these two enlightened parts
remaine darke because of its opacity,
then would it alwayes be darke, and
the Sunne could not make it partake
of light more than it could of perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity:
But this contradicts all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as you may see in <hi>Galilaeus,</hi> who
affirmes that when the Sunne comes
neerer to his opposition, then, that
which is betwixt them both, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
as well as either. Nay, this
opposes his owne eye-witnesse, for he
confesses himselfe that he saw this by
the glasse. Hee had said before, that
he came to see those strange sights dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by <hi>Galilaeus</hi> his glasse, with
an intent of contradiction, and you
may reade that confirmed in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this answer, which rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes
an obstinate, than a perswaded
will; for otherwise sure he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have undertooke to have destroyed
such certaine proofes with so ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a fancy.</p>
                     <p>That instance of <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Syst. mundi coll. 1.</note> would
have beene a better evasion had this
Author been acquainted with it; who
might then have compared the Moone
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20652:70"/>
to that which wee call mother of
pearle, which though it bee most
exactly polished in the superficies of
it; yet will seeme unto the eye as if
there were divers swellings and risings
in its severall parts. But yet, this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not well have shifted the
experiment of the perspective. For
these rugged parts doe not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
upon one side of the Moone, but
as the Sunne dos turne about in divers
places, so doe they also cast their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
When the Moone is in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
then doe they cast their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
to the East. When she is in the
decrease, and the Sunne on the other
side of her, then likewise may we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
these brighter parts casting their
shadowes Westward. Whereas in the
full Moone there are none of all these
to be seene.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, that 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that in the Moone there should
bee any mountaines so high, as those
observations make them. For doe but
suppose according to the common
principles, that the Moones diameter
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20652:71"/>
unto the Earths, is very neere to the
proportion of 2 to 7. Suppose withall
that the Earths diameter containes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
7000. Italian miles, and the
Moones 2000 (as is commonly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)
Now <hi>Galilaeus</hi> hath observed, that
some parts have beene enlightned,
when they were the twentieth part of
the diameter distant from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
terme of illumination. From
whence, it must necessarily follow
that there may bee some Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
in the Moone, so high, that they
are able to cast a shadow a 100 miles
off. An opinion that sounds like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie
or a fiction; wherefore 'tis likely
that either those appearances are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by somewhat else besides moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
or else those are fallible obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
from whence may follow
such improbable, inconceiveable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</p>
                     <p>But to this I answer:</p>
                     <p>1. You must consider the height
of the Mountaines is but very little, if
you compare them to the length of
their shadowes.<note place="margin">Hist. l. 1. c. 7. sect. 11.</note> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>
observes that the Mount <hi>Athos</hi> now
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20652:71"/>
called <hi>Lacas,</hi> cast its shadow 300 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,
which is above 37 miles; and
yet that Mount is none of the highest.
Nay <hi>Solinus</hi> (whom I should rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in this kinde) affirmes that this
Mountaine gives his shadow quite over
the Sea,<note place="margin">Poly. histor. c. 21.</note> from <hi>Macedon</hi> to the Ile of
<hi>Lemnos,</hi> which is 700 furlongs or 84
miles, and yet according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reckoning it doth scarce reach 4
miles upwards, in its perpendicular
height.</p>
                     <p>2. I affirme that there are very high
Mountaines in the Moone. <hi>Keplar</hi> and
<hi>Galilaeus</hi> thinke that they are higher
than any which are upon our earth.
But I am not of their opinion in this;
because I suppose they goe upon a
false ground, whilst they conceive that
the highest mountaine upon the earth
is not above a mile perpendicular.</p>
                     <p>Whereas 'tis the common opinion
and found true enough by observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Olympus, Atlus, Tauras</hi> and
<hi>Emus,</hi> with many others, are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
this height. <hi>Tenariffa</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ilands, is commonly related to
bee above 8 miles perpendicular, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20652:72"/>
bout this height (say some) is the
mount <hi>Perjacaca</hi> in <hi>America.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. l. 1. c. 7. sect. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Sir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Rawleigh</hi> seemes to thinke, that the
highest of these is neere 30 miles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
nay,<note place="margin">Meteor. l. 1. c. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaking of <hi>Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in <hi>Asia,</hi> affirmes it to bee visible for
560 miles, as some interpreters finde
by computation; from which it will
follow, that it was 78 miles perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
high,<note place="margin">Comparatio Arist. cum. Platone. Sect. 3. c. 5.</note> as you may see con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Iacobus Mazonius,</hi> and out
of him in <hi>Blancanus</hi> the Jesuite. But
this deviates from the truth more in
excesse,<note place="margin">Expost. in loc. Math. Arlis loc. 148.</note> than the other doth in defect.
However, though these in the Moone
are not so high as some amongst us;
yet certaine it is they are of a great
height, and some of them at the least
foure miles perpendicular. This I shall
prove from the observation of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi>
whose glasse can shew to the
senses a proofe beyond exception; and
certainly that man must needs be of a
most timerous faith who dares not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his own eye.</p>
                     <p>By that perspective you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerne some enlightned parts
(which are the mountaines) to bee
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20652:72"/>
distant from the other about the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
part of the diameter. From
whence it will follow, that those
mountaines must necessarily be at the
least foure Italian miles in height.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>For let B D E F be the body of
the Moone, A B C will be a ray or
beame of the Sunne, which enlightens
a mountaine at A, and B is the point of
contingency; the distance betwixt A
and B, must bee supposed to bee the
twentieth part of the diameter, which
is an 100 miles, for so far are some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20652:73"/>
parts severed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
terme of illumination. Now the
aggregate of the quadrate from A B
a hundred, and B G a 1000 will be
1010000; unto which the quadrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from A G must be equall; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the 47 proposition in the
first booke of elements. Therfore the
whole line A G is somewhat more
than 104, and the distance betwixt
H A must be above 4 miles, which
was the thing to be proved.</p>
                     <p>But it may be againe objected, if
there be such rugged parts, and so high
mountaines, why then cannot we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
them at this distance? why doth
the Moone appeare unto us so exactly
round, and not rather as a wheele with
teeth?</p>
                     <p>I answer, by reason of too great a
distance; for if the whole body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to our eye so little, then those
parts which beare so small a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the whole, will not at all bee
sensible.</p>
                     <p>But it may be replied, if there were
any such remarkeable hils, why does
not the limbe of the Moone appeare
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20652:73"/>
like a wheele with teeth, to those who
looke upon it through the great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,
on whose witnesse you so
much depend? or what reason is there
that shee appeares as exactly round
through it, as shee doth to the bare
eye? certainely then, either there is
no such thing as you imagine, or else
the glasse failes much in this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>To this I shall answer out of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. You must know that there is
not meerely one ranke of mountaines,
about the edge of the Moone, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
orders, one mountaine behind an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and so there is somewhat to
hinder those void spaces which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
perhaps, might appeare.</p>
                     <p>Now, where there be many hils, the
ground seemes even to a man that can
see the tops of all. Thus when the sea
rages, and many vast waves are lifted
up, yet all may appeare plaine enough
to one that stands at the shore. So
where there are so many hils, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
will bee lesse remarkable, if it
be discerned at a distance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:20652:74"/>
2. Though there be mountains in
that part which apeares unto us to be
the limbe of the Moone, as well as in
any other place, yet the bright vapors
hide their appearance: for there is an
orbe of thicke vaporous aire that doth
immediatly compasse the body of the
Moone; which though it have not so
great opacity, as to terminate the sight,
yet being once enlightened by the
Sunne, it doth represent the body of
the Moone under a greater forme, and
hinders our sight, from a distinct view
of her true circumference. But of this
in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Keplar</hi> hath observed,<note place="margin">Somn. Astr. not. 207.</note> that in
the solary Eclipses, when the rays may
passe thorough this vaporous ayre,
there are some gibbosities to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the limbe of the Moone.</p>
                     <p>I have now sufficiently proved, that
there are hills in the Moone, and hence
it may seeme likely that there is also a
world; for since providence hath some
speciall end in all its works, certainly
then these mountaines were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in vaine; and what more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meaning can wee conceive there
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20652:74"/>
should be,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.</note> than to make that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

body of the Moone.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS that part of our aire which is

'tis alwayes mixed with some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
which are continually exhaled
into it. So is it equally requisite, that
if there be a world in the Moone, that
the aire about that, should be alike
qualified with ours. Now, that there
is such an orbe of grosse aire, was first
of all (for ought I can reade) observed
by <hi>Meslin,</hi> afterwards assented unto
by <hi>Keplar</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vide Euseb. Nicrem. de Nat.</note> and since by

                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:20652:75"/>
1. 'Tis not improbable that there
should be a sphere of grosser aire about
the Moone; because 'tis observed, that
there are such kind of evaporations
which proceed from the Sun it selfe.
For there are discovered divers move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
spots, like clouds, that doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
his body: which those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
who have been most frequently
versed in these kind of experiments
and studies, doe conclude to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but evaporations from it.
The probabilitie and truth of which
observations may also bee inferred
from some other appearances. As,</p>
                     <p>1. It hath been observed that the
Sunne hath sometimes for the space of
foure days together,<note place="margin">So. A. D. 1547. April 24. to the 28.</note> appeared as dull
and ruddy almost as the Moone in her
Ecclipses; In so much that the Starrs
have been seene at midday. Nay, he
hath been constantly darkned for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a whole yeare, and never shined,
but with a kind of heavy and duskish
light, so that there was scarse heate
enough to ripen the fruits. As it was
about the time when <hi>Caesar</hi> was killed.
Which was recorded by some of the

                     </p>
                     <p>Now these appearances could not
arise from any lower vapor. For then
1. They would not have been so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
as they were, being seene
through all Europe; or else 2. that
vapor must have covered the starres as
well as the Sunne, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20652:76"/>
were then plainly discerned
in the day time. You may see this
argument illustrated in another the like
case. Chap. 12. Hence then it will
follow, that this fuliginous matter,
which did thus obscure the Sunne,
must needs bee very neere his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and if so, then, what can we
more probably guesse it to be, than
evaporations from it?</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis observed, that in the Suns
totall Ecclipses, when there is no
part of his body discernable, yet there
dos not always follow so great a
darknesse, as might bee expected
from his totall absence. Now 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the reason is, because
these thicker vapors, being enlightned
by his beames, doe convey some light
unto us, notwithstanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Moone betwixt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and our earth.</p>
                     <p>3. This likewise is by some guest
to be the reason of the <hi>crepusculum</hi> or
that light which wee have before the
Suns rising.</p>
                     <p>Now, if there be such evaporations
from the Sunne, much more then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20652:76"/>
from the moone, which does consist
of a more grosse and impure substance.
The other arguments are taken from
severall observations in the Moon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and doe more directly tend to
the proofe of this proposition.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis observed, that so much of
the Moone as is enlightned, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
part of a bigger circle, than
that which is darker. The frequent
experience of others hath proved this,
and an easie observation may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirme it. But now this cannot
proceede from any other cause so
probable, as from this orbe of aire;
especially when we consider how that
Planet shining with a borrowed light,
doth not send forth any such rayes as
may make her appearance bigger than
her body.</p>
                     <p>3. When the Moone being halfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
begins to cover any Starre, if
the Starre bee towards the obscurer
part, then may it by the perspective
be discerned, to bee neerer unto the
center of the moone, than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
circumference of the enlightned
part. But the moone being in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20652:77"/>
full; then dos it seeme to receive these
starres, within its limbe.</p>
                     <p>4. Though the Moone doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
appeare the first day of her change
when so much as appeares enlightned,
cannot be above the 80 part of her
diameter, yet then will the hornes
seeme at least to be of a fingers breadth
in extension. Which could not bee,
unlesse the ayre about it were illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
                     <p>5. 'Tis observed in the Solary ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses,
that there is sometimes a great
trepidation about the body of the
Moone, from which wee may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
argue an Atmo-sphaera, since we
cannot well conceive what so proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a cause there should be of such an
appearance as this, <hi>Quod radii Solares à

                        <note place="margin">Scheiner. Ros. Vis. l. 4. pars 2. c. 27.</note>
that the Sunne-beames were
broken and refracted by the vapours
that encompassed the Moone.</p>
                     <p>6. I may adde the like argument
taken from another observation which
will be easily tried and granted. When
the Sunne is eclipsed, we discerne the
Moone as shee is in her owne naturall
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20652:77"/>
bignesse; but then she appeares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lesse than when she is in the full,
though she be in the same place of her
supposed excentrick and epicycle; and
therfore <hi>Tycho</hi> hath calculated a Table
for the Diameter of the divers new
Moones. But now there is no reason
so probable, to salve this appearance,
as to place an orbe of thicker aire,
neere the body of that Planet, which
may bee enlightned by the reflected
beames, and through which the direct
rayes may easily penetrate.</p>
                     <p>But some may object, that this will
not consist with that which was before
delivered, where I said, that the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
parts had least light.</p>
                     <p>If this were true, how comes it to
passe then, that this aire should bee as
right as any of the others parts, when
as tis the thinnest of all?</p>
                     <p>I answer, if the light be received
by reflection only, then the thickest
body hath most, because it is best able
to beate backe the rayes; but if the
light be received by illumination (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if there be an opacous body
behinde, which may double the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20652:78"/>
beames by reflexion) as it is here,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.</note>
then I deny not but a thinne body
may retaine much light; and perhaps,
some of those appearances, which wee
take for fiery comets, are nothing else
but a bright cloud enlightned; So that
probable it is, there may be such aire
without the Moone; &amp; hence it comes
to passe, that the greater spots are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible towards her middle parts,
and none neere the circumference; not
but that there are some as well in
those parts as elsewhere, but they are
not there perceiveable, by reason of
those brighter vapours which hide
them.</p>

                     <p>Now that in this Planet there is
some similitude of Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
is affirmed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">De gen ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. l. 4. 12.</note>
since there is one hemispheare that
hath alwayes heate and light, and the
other that hath darknesse and cold.
True indeed, their dayes and yeares
are always of one and the same length
(unlesse we make one of their yeares
to be 19 of ours,<note place="margin">Golden Number.</note> in which space all the
Starres doe arise after the same order.)
But tis so with us also under the Poles,
and therefore that great difference is
not sufficient to make it altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ours; nor can we expect that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing there should be in the same
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20652:79"/>
manner as it is here below, as if nature
had no way but one to bring about her
purposes. We have no reason then to
thinke it necessary that both these
worlds should be altogether alike, but
it may suffice if they be correspondent
in something only. However, it may
bee questioned whether it doth not
seeme to bee against the wisedome of
Providence, to make the night of so
great a length, when they have such a
long time unfit for worke? I answer,
no; since tis so, and more with us also
under the poles; and besides, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
length of their night is somewhat
abated in the bignesse of their Moone
which is our earth. For this returnes
as great a light unto that Planet, as it
receives from it. But for the better
proofe of this, I shall first free the way
from such opinions as might otherwise
hinder the speed of a clearer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> one of the chiefe patrons
of this world in the Moone,<note place="margin">Plut. de fac. lunae.</note> doth dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
contradict this proposition; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that those who live there, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
our world, as the dreggs and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20652:79"/>
sediment of all other creatures, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to them through clouds and
foggy mists, and that altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of light, being base and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
so that they might well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the darke place of damnation to
bee here situate, and that they onely
were the inhabiters of the world, as
being in the midst betwixt Heaven and
Hell.</p>
                     <p>To this I may answer, 'tis probable
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> spake this inconsiderately,
and without a reason; which makes him
likewise fall into another absurditie,
when hee says our earth would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
immoveable; whereas question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
though it did not, yet would it
seeme to move, and theirs to stand still,
as the Land doth to a man in a Shippe;

                        <q>The earth is by the Sunne-beames
made bright, but not able
to enlighten any thing so farre.</q> And
his reason is, because this being of a
thick and grosse matter, the light is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in its superficies, and cannot
penetrate into the substance; whereas
the Moone doth therefore seeme so
bright to us, because it receives the
beames within it selfe. But the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this assertion, may bee easily
manifest by a common experience; for
polished steele (whose opacity will not
give any admittance to the rayes) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
a stronger heate than glasse, and
so consequently a greater light.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis the generall consent of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
that the reflection of the
Sunne-beames from the earth doth not
reach much above halfe a mile high,
where they terminate the first region,
so that to affirme they might ascend to
the Moone, were to say, there were
but one region of aire, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the proved and received opinion.</p>

Unto this it may be answered:</p>
                     <p>That it is indeed the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that the reflexion of the Sunne-beames

                        <q>I believe
that this globe of earth and water
would appeare like some great Star
to any one, who should looke upon
it from the Moone.</q> Now this could
not bee, nor could it shine so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
unlesse the beames of light were
reflected from it. And therefore the
same <hi>Fromondus</hi> expresly holds, that
the first region of ayre is there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
where the heate caused by
reflexion begins to languish, whereas
the beames themselves doe passe a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20652:81"/>
great way further. The chiefe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which doth most plainely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
this truth, is taken from a common
observation which may bee easily
tryed.</p>
                     <p>If you behold the Moone a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after the conjunction, when she
is in a sextile with the Sunne, you may
discerne not onely the part which is
enlightned, but the rest also to have in
it a kind of a duskish light; but if you
chuse out such a situation, where some
house or chimney (being some 70 or
80 paces distant from you) may hide
from your eye the enlightned hornes,
you may then discerne a greater and
more remarkable shining in those parts
unto which the Sunne beames cannot
reach; nay there is so great a light, that
by the helpe of a good perspective you
may discerne its spots. In so much
that <hi>Blancanus</hi> the Jesuite speaking of
it, sayes,<note place="margin">De mundi fab. p. 3. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Haec experientia ita me aliquando

                        <q>This experiment did once
so deceive mee, that happening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20652:82"/>
the sight of this brightnesse upon
a sudden, I thought that by some
new miracle the Moone had beene
got into her full a little after her
change.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now this light is not proper to
the Moone; it doth not proceed from
the rayes of the Sunne which doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
her body, nor is it caused by
any other of the Planets and Starres.
Therefore it must necessarily follow,
that it comes from the earth. The two
first of these I have already proved,
and as for the last, it is confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Caelius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ant. Lect. l. 20. c. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Quod si in disquisitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

                        <q>If any should
aske whether the other Planets lend
any light to the Moone? I answer,
they doe not.</q> True indeed, the noble
<hi>Tycho</hi> discussing the reason of this light
attributes it to the Planet <hi>Venus;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Progym. 1.</note> and I
grant that this may convey some light
to the Moone; but that it is not the
cause of this whereof wee now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
is of it selfe sufficiently plaine,
because <hi>Venus</hi> is sometimes over the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20652:82"/>
Moone, when as shee cannot convey
any light to that part which is turned
from her.</p>
                     <p>It doth not proceed from the fixed
starres; for then it would retaine the
same light in ecclipses, whereas the
light at such times is more ruddy and
dull. Then also the light of the Moone
would not be greater or lesser, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its distance from the edge of the
earths shadow, since it did at all times
equally participate this light of the
starres.</p>
                     <p>In briefe, this is neither proper to
the Moone, nor does it proceed from
any penetration of the Suns rays, or the
shining of <hi>Venus,</hi> or the other Planets,
or the fixed starrs. Now because there
is no other body in the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
save the earth, it remaines that
this light must necessarily be caused by
that, which with a just gratitude repaies
to the Moone such illumination as it
receives from her.</p>
                     <p>And as loving friends equally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of the same joy and griefe, so
doe these mutually partake of the same
light from the Sunne, and the same
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20652:83"/>
darkenesse from the eclipses, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
severally helped by one another in
their greatest wants: For when the
Moone is in conjunction with the Sun,
&amp; her upper part receives all the light,
then her lower Hemispheare (which
would otherwise be altogether darke)
is enlightened by the reflexion of the
Sunne-beames from the earth. When
these two Planets are in opposition,
then that part of the earth which could
not receive any light from the Sunne-beames,
is most enlightened by the
Moone, being then in her full; and as
shee doth most illuminate the earth
when the Sunne-beames cannot, so the
gratefull earth returnes to her as great
(nay greater) light when shee most
wants it; so that alwayes that visible
part of the Moone which receives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from the Sunne, is enlightened
by the earth, as is proved by <hi>Galilaeus,</hi>
with many more arguments, in that
Treatise which he calls <hi>Systema mundi.</hi>
True indeed, when the Moone comes
to a quartile, then you can neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
this light, nor yet the darker part
of her body, and that for a double rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:20652:83"/>
1. Because the neerer it comes to the
full, the lesse light dos it receive from
the earth, whose illumination dos al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
decrease in the same proportion
as the Moone dos increase.</p>
                     <p>2. Because of the exuperancy of
the light in the other parts. <hi>Quippe
illustratum medium speciem recipit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiorem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Scal. exerc. 62.</note>
the clearer brightnesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
the weaker, it being with the
species of sight, as it is with those of
sound; and as the greater noise drowns
the lesse, so the brighter object hides
that which is more obscure. But as
they do always in their mutuall vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
participate of one anothers light;
so also doe they partake of the same
defects and darknings; for when our
Moone is eclipsed, then is their Sunne
darkned; and when our Sun is eclipsed,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is their Moon deprived of its light,
as you may see affirmed by <hi>Meslin.

of theirs. The manner of this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

you may plainly discerne in this Figure

Where A represents the Sunne, B
the Earth, and C the Moone; Now
suppose the Moone C to be in a sextile
of increase, when there is onely one
small part of her body enlightened,
then the earth B will have such a part
of its visible Hemispheare darkned,
as is proportionable to that part of the
Moone which is enlightened; and as
for so much of the Moone, as the Sun-beames
cannot reach unto, it receives
light from a proportionall part of the
earth which shines upon it, as you may
plainly perceive by the Figure.</p>
                     <p>You see then that agreement and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
which there is betwixt our
earth and the Moone. Now the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
difference which makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
is this, that the Moone enlightens
our earth round about, whereas our
earth gives light onely to that Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheare
of the Moone which is visible
unto us, as may be certainly gathered
from the constant appearance of the
same spots, which could not thus come
to passe, if the Moone had such a diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion about its owne axis as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
our earth hath. And though some
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20652:85"/>
suppose her to move in an epicycle, yet
this doth not so turne her body round,
that wee may discerne both Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheares;
for according to that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
(say they) the motion of her ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick
doth turne her face towards
us, as much as the other doth from
us.</p>
                     <p>But now, if any question what they
doe for a Moone who live in the upper
part of her body? I answer, the solving
of this, is the most uncertaine and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
thing that I know of, concerning
this whole matter. But yet unto mee
this seemes a probable conjecture.</p>
                     <p>That the upper Hemispheare of the
Moone doth receive a sufficient light
from those Planets about it; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these, <hi>Venus</hi> (it may bee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
a more especiall brightnesse,
since <hi>Galilaeus</hi> hath plainly discerned
that she suffers the same increases and
decreases; as the Moone hath, and 'tis
probable that this may bee perceived
there, without the help of a glasse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are farre neerer it than wee.
When <hi>Venus</hi> (saith <hi>Keplar)</hi> lies downe
in the Perige or lower part of her sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20652:86"/>
Epicycle, then is she in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with her husband the Sunne,
from whom after shee hath departed
for the space of ten moneths, shee gets
<hi>plenum uterum,</hi> and is in the full.</p>
                     <p>But you'll reply, though <hi>Venus</hi> may
bestow some light when she is over
the Moone, and in conjunction, yet
being in opposition, she is not visible
to them, and what shall they then doe
for light?</p>
                     <p>I answer, then they have none; nor
doth this make so great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those two Hemispheares, as
there is with us, betwixt the places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the poles, and the line. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
'tis considerable, that there are
two kinde of Planets.</p>
                     <p>1. Primarie, such whose proper cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
doe encompasse the body of the
Sunne, whereof there are six. <hi>Saturne,
Iupiter, Mars, Ceres</hi> or the <hi>Earth, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Mercury.</hi> As in the Frontispice.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondary, such whose proper
circles are not about the Sunne, but
some of the other primarie Planets.
Thus are there two about <hi>Saturne,</hi>
foure about <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and thus likewise
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20652:86"/>
dos the Moone encompasse our earth.
Now tis probable that these lesser, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Planets, are not so accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
with all conveniences of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as the others that are more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</p>
                     <p>But it may seeme a very difficult
thing to conceive, how so grosse and
darke a body as our earth, should yeeld
such a cleere light as proceeds from
the Moone; and therefore the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>de Cusa</hi> (who thinks every Starre
to be a severall wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld) is of opinion
that the light of the Sunne is not able
to make them appeare so bright;<note place="margin">De doct. ig. l. 2. c. 12.</note> but
the reason of their shining is, because
wee behold them at a great distance
through their regions of fire which
doe set a shining lustre upon those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that of themselves are darke. <hi>Vnde
si quis esset extra regionem ignis, terra ista
in circumferentia suae regionis per medium
ignis lucida stella appareret.</hi> 
                        <q>So that if
a man were beyond the region of
fire, this earth would appeare
through that,</q> as a bright Starre. But
if this were the onely reason, then
would the Moone be freed from such
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20652:87"/>
increases and decreases as shee is now
lyable unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keplar</hi> thinks that our earth receives
that light whereby it shines, from the
Sunne, but this (saith he) is not such an
intended cleare brightnes as the Moon
is capable of, and therefore he guesses,
that the earth there, is of a more chokie
soyle, like the Ile of <hi>Crete,</hi> and so is
better able to reflect a stronger light,
whereas our earth must supply this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
with the quantity of its body.
But this I conceive to bee a needlesse
conjecture, since our earth, if all things
were well considered, will bee found
able enough to reflect as great a light.
For</p>
                     <p>1. Consider its opacity; if you marke
these sublunary things, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that amongst them, those that are
most perspicuous, are not so well able
to reverberate the Sunne-beames, as
the thicker bodies. The rayes passe
singly through a diaphanous matter,
but in an opacous substance they are
doubled in their returne, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by reflexion. Now if the moone
and the other Planets can shine so
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20652:87"/>
cleerely by beating backe the Sunne-beames,
why may not the earth also
shine as well, which agrees with them
in the cause of this brightnesse their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity?</p>
                     <p>2. Consider what a cleare light we
may discerne reflected from the earth
in the middest of Summer, and withall
conceive how much greater that must
bee which is under the line, where the
rayes are more directly and strongly
reverberated.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis considerable that though
the Moon dos in the night time seeme
to be of so cleere a brightnesse, yet
when wee looke upon it in the day, it
appeares like some little whitish cloud:
Not but that at both times, she is of an
equall light in her selfe. The reason of
this difference is, because in the night
wee looke upon it through a darke and
obscure <hi>medium,</hi> there being no other
enlightned body, whose brightnesse
may abate from this: Whereas in the
day time, the whole heavens round
about it, are of an equall clearenesse,
and so make it to appeare with a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
light. Now because wee cannot see
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20652:88"/>
how the enlightned parts of our earth
doe looke in the night, therefore in
comparing it with the Moone, wee
must not consider her, as she is beheld
through the advantage of a darke <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
but as she seemes in the day-time:
Now, in any cleere Sun-shine-day, our
earth does appeare as bright as the
Moone, which at the same time does
seeme like some duskish cloud (as any
little observation may easily manifest.)
Therefore we need not doubt but that
the earth is as well able to give light,
as the Moone. To this, it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that those very clouds, which in
the day-time seeme to be of an equall
light to the moone, doe in the evening
become as darke as our earth; and as
for those of them, which are looked
upon at any great distance, they are
often mistaken for the mountaines.</p>
                     <p>4. Tis considerable, that though
the moone seeme to bee of so great a
brightnesse in the night, by reason of
its neerenesse unto those severall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
which it casts, yet is it of it selfe
weaker than that part of twilight,
which usually wee have for halfe an
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20652:88"/>
houre after Sunne-set, because wee
cannot till after that time discerne any
shadow to be made by it.</p>
                     <p>5. Consider the great distance at
which we behold the Planets, for this
must needs adde much to their shining;
and therefore <hi>Cusanus</hi> (in the above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
place) thinks that if a man were in
the Sunne, that Planet would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
so bright to him, as now it doth
to us, because then his eye could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
but little, whereas here, we may
comprehend the beames as they are
contracted in a narrow body. <hi>Keplar</hi>
beholding the earth from a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
when it was enlightned by the
Sunne, confesses that it appeared unto
him of an incredible brightnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
then he could onely see some small
parts of it; but how much brighter
would it have appeared if hee might in
a direct line behold the whole globe
of earth and these rayes gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
So that if we consider that great
light which the earth receives from
the Sunne in the Summer, and then
suppose wee were in the Moone, where
wee might see the whole earth hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20652:89"/>
in those vast spaces, where there is
nothing to terminate the sight, but
those beames which are there contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into a little compasse; I say, if we
doe well consider this, wee may easily
conceive that our earth appeares as
bright to those other inhabitants in the
Moone, as theirs doth to us.</p>
                     <p>But here it may bee objected, that
with us, for many days in the yeare, the
heavens are so overclowded, that wee
cannot see the Sunne at all, and for the
most part, in our brightest dayes, there
are many scattered clouds which shade
the earth in sundry places; so that in
this respect, it must needs be unlike the
Moon and will not be able to yeeld so
cleare, unintermitted a light, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from that planet.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer.</p>
                     <p>1. As for those lesser brighter clouds
which for the most part are scattered
up and down in the clearest days, these
can be no reason why our earth should
be of a darker appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, because these
clouds being neere unto the earth, and
so not distinguishable at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from it, and likewise being illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20652:89"/>
on their back parts by the
Sunne that shines upon them,<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note> must
seeme as bright to those in the Moone,
as if the beames were immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
from our earth.</p>
                     <p>2. When these clouds that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed,
are of any large extension or
great opacity, as it is in extraordinary
lasting and great rains, then there must
be some discernable alteration in the
light of our earth; But yet this dos not
make it to differ from the Moone: since
it is so also with that Planet, as is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the later part of the next chapter.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That tis probable there may be such Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
belonging to that world in the

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PLutarch</hi> discussing this point, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
that it is not necessary there
should be the same meanes of growth
and fructifying in both these worlds,
since nature might in her policy finde
out more wayes than one how to bring
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20652:90"/>
about the same effect. But however, he
thinks it is probable that the Moone
her selfe sendeth forth warme winds,
and by the swiftnesse of her motion
there should breathe out a sweet and
comfortable ayre, pleasant dewes, and
gentle moisture, which might serve for
refreshing and nourishment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
and plants in that other
world.</p>
                     <p>But since they have all things alike
with us, as sea and land, and vaporous
ayre encompassing both, I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therefore thinke that nature there
should use the same way of producing
meteors as shee doth with us (and not
by a motion as <hi>Plutarch</hi> supposes:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee doth not love to vary from
her usuall operations without some
extraordinary impediment, but still
keepes her beaten path unlesse shee bee
driven thence.</p>
                     <p>One argument whereby I shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
this truth, may bee taken from
those new Stars which have appeared
in divers ages of the world, and by
their paralax have been discerned to
have been above the Moone, such as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20652:90"/>
was that in <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> that in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi>
with many others betwixt the Planets.
<hi>Hipparchus</hi> in his time tooke especiall
notice of such as these,<note place="margin">Plin. nat. hist. l. 2. c. 26.</note> and therefore
fancied out such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stellations in which
to place the Starrs, shewing how many
there were in every asterisme, that so
afterwards, posterity might know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any new Starre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
or any old one missing. Now
the nature of these Comets may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
manifest, that in this other
world there are other meteors also;
for these in all likelyhood are nothing
else but such evaporations caused by
the Sunne from the bodies of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
I shall prove this by shewing the
improbabilities and inconveniences of
any other opinion.</p>
                     <p>For the better pursuite of this 'tis in
the first place requisite, that I deale
with our chiefe adversary, <hi>Caesar la Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
who doth most directly oppose that
truth which is here to be proved. Hee
endeavouring to confirme the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility
of the Heavens, and being
there to satisfie the argument which is
taken from these Comets, He answers
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20652:91"/>
it thus: <hi>Aut argumentum desumptum
ex paralaxi, non est efficax, aut si est ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficax,
eorum instrumentorum usum deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere,
vel ratione astri, vel medii, vel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae,
aut ergo erat in suprema parte
aeris, aut si in coelo, tum forsan factum
erat ex reflectione radiorum Saturni &amp;
Iovis, qui tunc in conjunctione fuerant.</hi>
                        <q>Either the argument from the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax
is not efficacious, or if it bee,
yet the use of the instruments might
deceive, either in regard of the star,
or the <hi>medium,</hi> or the distance, and
so this comet might be in the upper
regions of the ayre; or if it were in
the heavens, there it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the reflexion of the rayes
from <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who were
then in conjunction.</q> You see what
shifts hee is driven to, how he runnes
up and downe to many starting holes,
that he may find some shelter, and in
stead of the strength of reason, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
with a multitude of words,
thinking (as the Proverbe is) that hee
may use haile, when hee hath no thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<hi>Nihil turpius</hi> (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 95.</note> Seneca) <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio
&amp; incerto, pedem modo referente, modo
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20652:91"/>
producente.</hi> 
                        <q>What can there be more
unseemely in one that should bee a
faire disputant, than to be now here,
now there, and so uncertaine, that
one cannot tell where to find him?</q>
Hee thinks that there are not Comets
in the heavens, because there may bee
many other reasons of such appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but what he knowes not; perhaps
(hee sayes) that argument from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralax
is not sufficient,<note place="margin">Vide Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeum. Syst. mundi. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loq 3.</note> or if it be, then
there may bee some deceit in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
To this I may safely say,
that he may justly bee accounted a
weake Mathematician who mistrusts
the strength of this argument; nor can
hee know much in Astronomy, who
understands not the paralax, which is
a foundation of that Science; and I am
sure that hee is a timerous man, who
dares not believe the frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his senses, or trust to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
                     <p>True indeed, I grant 'tis possible,
that the eye, the <hi>medium,</hi> and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
may all deceive the beholder;
but I would have him shew which of
all these was likely to cause an error in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20652:92"/>
this observation? Meerely to say they
might be deceived, is no sufficient ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
for by this I might confute the
positions of all Astronomers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the starres are hard by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis possible they may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in their observing distance. But
I forbeare any further reply; my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is of that Treatise, that either
it was set forth purposely to tempt a
confutation, that hee might see the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of <hi>Galilaeus</hi> confirmed by others,
or else it was invented with as much
haste and negligence as it was printed,
there being in it almost as many faults
as lines.</p>
                     <p>Others thinke that these are not any
new Comets, but some ancient starres
that were there before, which now
shine with that unusuall brightnesle, by
reason of the interposition of such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,
which doe multiply their light;
and so the alteration will be here only,
and not in the heavens. Thus <hi>Aristotle</hi>
thought the appearance of the milkie
way was produced. For hee held that
there were many little starres, which
by their influence did constantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20652:92"/>
such a vapour towards that place
of heaven, so that it alwayes appeared
white. Now by the same reason may
a brighter vapor bee the cause of these
appearances.</p>
                     <p>But how probable soever this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
may seeme, yet if well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you shall finde it to bee altogether
absurd and impossible: for,</p>
                     <p>1. These starres were never seene
there before, and tis not likely that a
vapour being hard by us, can so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that light which could not before
be at all discerned.</p>
                     <p>2. This supposed vapour cannot be
either contracted into a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
or dilated into a broad: 1. it could
not bee within a little space, for then
that starre would not appeare with the
same multiplied light to those in other
climates. 2. it cannot be a dilated va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
for then other starres which were
discerned through the same vapour,
would seeme as bigge as that; this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is the same in effect with that
of the paralax, as you may see in this
Figure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:20652:93"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose A B to be a Hemispheare
of one earth, C D to be the upper part
of the highest region, in which there
might be either a contracted vapour, as
G, or else a dilated one, as H I. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
E F likewise to represent halfe
the heavens, wherein was this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Comet at K. Now I say, that a
contracted vapour, as G, could not
cause this appearance, because an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
at M could not discerne the
same starre with this brightnesse, but
perhaps another at L, betwixt which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20652:93"/>
the vapour is directly interposed. Nor
could it be caused by a dilated vapour,
as H I, because then all the starres that
were discerned through it, would bee
perceived with the same brightnesse.</p>
                     <p>'Tis necessary therfore that the cause
of this appearance should be in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
And this is granted by the most
&amp; best Astronomers. But, say some, this
doth not argue any naturall alteration
in those purer bodies, since tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the concourse of many little
vagabond starres, by the union of their
beames may cause so great a light. Of
this opinion were <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
amongst the ancient, and <hi>Baptista Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satus,
Blancanus,</hi> with others amongst
our moderne Astronomers. For, say
they, when there happens to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of some few starres, then doe
many other flie unto them from all the
parts of heaven like so many Bees unto
their King. But 1. 'tis not likely that
amongst those which wee count the
fixed starres, there should be any such
uncertaine motions, that they can wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from all parts of the heavens, as if
Nature had neglected them, or forgot
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20652:94"/>
to appoint them a determinate course.
2. If there be such a conflux of these,
as of Bees to their King, then what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is there, that they doe not still tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with it, that so the Comet may not
bee dissolved? But enough of this.
You may commonly see it confuted
by many other arguments.<note place="margin">Clavius in sphaeram. cap. 1.</note> Others
there are, who affirme these to bee
some new created starres, produced by
an extraordinary supernaturall power.
I answer, true indeed, tis possible they
might be so, but however, tis not likely
they were so, since such appearances
may be salved some other way; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to fly unto a miracle for such
things, were a great injury to nature,
and to derogate from her skill; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
much mis-becoming a man
who professes himselfe to be a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.
<hi>Miraculum</hi> (saith one) <hi>est ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantiae
Asylum,</hi> a miracle often serves
for the receptacle of a lazy ignorance;
which any industrious Spirit would be
ashamed of, if being but an idle way to
shift off the labour of any further
search. But here's the misery of it, we
first tye our selves unto <hi>Aristotles</hi>
                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:20652:94"/>
principles, and then conclude that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could contradict them, but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
whereas 'twould be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the Common-wealth of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if wee would ground our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
rather upon the frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of our owne, than the bare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of others.</p>
                     <p>Some there are who thinke, that
these Comets are nothing else, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
from our earth, carryed up
into the higher parts of the Heaven.
So <hi>Peno,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tycho Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gym. l. 1. c. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Rothmannus &amp; Galilaeus.</hi> But
this is not possible, since by computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
'tis found, that one of them is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
300 times bigger than the whole
Globe of Land and Water. Others
therefore have thought that they did
proceed from the body of the Sunne,
and that that Planet only is <hi>Cometarum
officinae, unde tanquam emissarii &amp; explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratores
emitterentur, brevi ad solem redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi:</hi>
The shop or forge of Comets
from whence they were sent, like so
many spies, that they might in some
short space returne againe. But this
cannot be, since if so much matter had
proceeded from him alone, it would
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20652:95"/>
have made a sensible diminution in his
body. The Noble <hi>Tycho</hi> therefore
thinks that they consist of some such
fluider parts of the Heaven, as the
milky way is framed of, which being
condenst together, yet not attaining to
the consistency of a Starre, is in some
space of time rarifyed againe into its
wonted nature. But this is not likely;
because the appearance of the milky
way dos not arise from some fluider
parts of the heaven (as he supposes)
but from the light of many lesser starrs
which are thereabouts.<note place="margin">Fromond. Meteor. l. 2. c. 5. art. 2.</note> And therefore
it is usually thus described.<note place="margin">Item Vesta tract. 5. c. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Via lactea
nihil aliud est quàm innumerabiles stella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
fixarum greges qui confuso &amp; pallenti
lumine tractum illum inalbant.</hi> The milky
way is nothing else but the pale and
confused light of many leser starres,
whereby some parts of the heaven are
made to appeare white.</p>
                     <p>And beside, what likely cause can
we conceive of this condensation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
there bee such qualities there, as
there are in our ayre, and then why
may not the Planets have the like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
as our earth? and if so, then 'tis
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20652:95"/>
more probable that they are made by
the ordinary way of nature, as they are
with us, and consist of such exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the bodies of the Planets, as
being very much rarified, may bee
drawne up, through the orbe of grosse
vaporous ayre that incompasses them.

If it be againe objected, that then there

him with their motion. Which are lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ecclipsed by the interposition of
his body, as the Moone is by our earth.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20652:96"/>
                        <hi>Venus</hi> is observed to increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

hath been noted by former ages, as

Concerning <hi>Mercury,</hi> there hath been
little or no observation, because for
the most part, hee lies hid under the
Sunne-beames, and seldome appeares
by himselfe. But when he dos, yet the
compasse of his body is so little, and
his light of so cleare a brightnesse, by
reason of his neerenesse to the Sunne,
that the perspective cannot make the
same discoveries upon him, as from
the rest.</p>
                     <p>So that if you consider their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
their opacity, or these others dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
you shall finde it probable
enough, that each of them may bee a
severall world. Especially, since every
one of them is allotted to a severall
orbe, and not altogether in one, as the
fixed starres seeme to bee. But this
would bee too much for to vent at the
first: the chiefe thing at which I now
ayme in this discourse, is to prove that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20652:96"/>
there may bee one in the Moone.<note place="margin">LIB. 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath been before confirmed, that
there was a spheare of thick vaporous
ayre encompassing the Moone, as the
first and second regions doe this earth.
I have now shewed, that thence such
exhalations may proceed as doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Comets: now from hence it
may probably follow, that there may
be winde also and raine, with such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meteors as are common amongst
us. This consequence is so dependant,
that <hi>Fromondus</hi> dares not deny it, though
hee would (as he confesses himselfe;)<note place="margin">De meteor. l. 3. c. 2. Art. 6.</note>
for if the Sunne be able to exhale from
them such fumes as may cause Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
why not then such as may cause
winds, and why not such also as may
cause raine, since I have above shewed,
that there is Sea and Land, as with us?
Now, raine seemes to be more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
requisite for them, since it may
allay the heate and scorchings of the
Sunne, when hee is over their heads.
And nature hath thus provided for
those in <hi>Peru,</hi> with the other inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
under the line.</p>
                     <p>But if there bee such great, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20652:97"/>
alterations in the Heavens, why
cannot we discerne them?</p>
                     <p>I answer:</p>
                     <p>1. There may be such, and wee
not able to perceive them, because of
the weaknesse of our eye, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of those places from us; they
are the words of <hi>Fienus</hi> (as they are

him assents <hi>Fromondus</hi> himselfe, when
a little after he sayes, <hi>Si in sphaeris plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum

                        <q>If we

                        <q>In that solary eclipse which

I plainly discerned that in her, which

habitation than our World (as <hi>Keplar</hi>

<hi>Adam;</hi> whether they are there in a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
estate, or else what meanes there
may be for their salvation? with many
other such uncertaine enquiries, which
I shall willingly omit, leaving it to
their examination who have more
leisure and learning for the search of
such particulars.</p>
                     <p>Being for mine owne part content
only to set downe such notes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto these, which I have observed
in other Writers.<note place="margin">De doct. ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia. l. 2. c. 12.</note>

There hath not yet beene
any such discovery concerning these,
upon which we may build a certainty,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20652:99"/>
or good probability: well may wee

doe find the things that are at hand, how
then can wee search out those things that
are in heaven?</hi> What a little is that
which wee know, in respect of those
many matters contained within this
great Universe? This whole globe
of earth and water, though it seeme
to us to bee of a large extent, yet it
beares not so great a proportion unto
the whole frame of Nature, as a small
sand doth unto it; and what can such
little creatures as we, discerne, who
are tied to this point of earth? or what
can they in the Moone know of us? <hi>If
we understand any thing</hi> (saith <hi>Esdras)

                     </p>
                     <p>So that 'twere a very needelesse
thing for us to search after any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
however, we may guesse in
the generall that there are some inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20652:100"/>
in that Planet: for why else
did providence furnish that place with
all such conveniences of habitation as
have beene above declared?</p>
                     <p>But you will say, perhaps; is there
not too great and intolerable a heate,
since the Sunne is in their Zenith every
moneth, and doth tarry there so long
before he leaves it?</p>
                     <p>I answer, 1. This may, perhaps,
be remedied (as it is under the line) by
the frequency of mid-day showers,
which may cloud their Sunne, and
coole their earth. 2. The equality of
their nights doth much temper the
scorching of the day; and the extreme
cold that comes from the one, requires
some space before it can bee dispelled
by the other, so that the heat spending
a great while before it can have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
hath not afterwards much time
to rage in. Wherfore notwithstanding
this doubt, yet that place may remaine
habitable. And this was the opinion
of the <hi>Cardinal de Cusa,</hi> when speaking
of this Planet, he sayes,<note place="margin">De doct. ign. l. 2. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Hic locus Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
est habitatio hominum &amp; animalium at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
vegetabilium.</hi> 
                        <q>This part of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20652:100"/>
world is inhabited by men, &amp; beasts,
and plants.</q> To him assented <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella;</hi>
but he cannot determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were men or rather some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of creatures. If they were
men, then he thinks they could not be
infected with <hi>Adams</hi> sinne; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
they had some of their owne,
which might make them liable to the
same misery with us, out of which, it
may bee, they were delivered by the
same means as we, the death of Christ;
and thus he thinks that place of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians</hi>
may be interpreted, where the
Apostle sayes,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>God gathered all things
together in Christ, both which are in earth,
and which are in the heavens:</hi> So also that
of the same Apostle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
where he sayes,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note> that <hi>it pleased the Father
to reconcile all things unto himselfe by
Christ, whether they be things in earth, or
things in heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I dare not jest with divine truths,
or apply these places according as fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
directs. As I thinke this opinion
doth not any where contradict Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so I thinke likewise, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee proved from it. Wherefore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20652:101"/>
                        <hi>Campanella's</hi> second conjecture may be
more probable, that the inhabitants of
that world, are not men as we are, but
some other kinde of creatures which
beare some proportion, and likenesse
to our natures. Or it may be, they are
of a quite different nature from any
thing here below, such as no imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can describe; our understandings
being capable only of such things as
have entered by our senses, or else such
mixed natures as may bee composed
from them. Now, there may be many
other species of creatures beside those
that are already knowne in the world;
there is a great chasme betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of men and Angels; It may bee
the inhabitants of the Planets are of a
middle nature between both these. Tis
not improbable that God might create
some of all kindes, that so he might
more compleatly glorifie himselfe in
the works of his Power and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>Cusanus <hi>too, thinks they differ from
us in many respects; I will set downe
his words as they may be found in the
above cited place,</hi> Suspicamur in regione

                     <p>
                        <q>Wee may conjecture (saith hee)
the inhabitants of the Sunne are like
to the nature of that Planet, more
cleare and bright, more intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
than those in the Moone where
they are neerer to the nature of that
duller Planet, and those of the earth
being more grosse and materiall
than either, so that these intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
natures in the Sunne, are more
forme than matter, those in the earth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20652:102"/>
more matter than forme, and those
in the Moone betwixt both. This
we may guesse from the fierie influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Sunne, the watery and
aereous influence of the Moone, as
also the materiall heavinesse of the
earth. In some such manner like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is it with the regions of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
starres; for, we conjecture that
none of them are without inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
but that there are so many
particular worlds and parts of this
one universe, as there are starres,
which are innumerable, unlesse it
be to him who created all things in
number.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For hee held that the stars were not
all in one equall orbe as wee common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppose; but that some were farre
higher than others, which made them
appeare lesse; and that many others
were so farre above any of these, that
they were altogether invisible unto us.
An opinion which (as I conceive) hath
not any great probability for it, nor
certainty against it.</p>
                     <p>The Priest of <hi>Saturne</hi> relating to
<hi>Plutarch</hi> (as hee faignes it) the nature
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20652:102"/>
of these Selenites, told him they were
of divers dispositions, some desiring to
live in the lower parts of the Moone,
where they might looke downewards
upon us, while others were more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mounted aloft, all of them shining
like the rayes of the Sunne, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
victorious, are crowned with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
made with the wings of <hi>Eustathia</hi>
or <hi>Constancie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath beene the opinion amongst
some of the Ancients, that their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Elysian fields were in the
Moone where the ayre is most quiet
and pure.<note place="margin">Nat. Com. l. 3. c. 19.</note> Thus <hi>Socrates,</hi> thus <hi>Plato,</hi> with
his followers, did esteeme this to bee
the place where those purer soules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite,
who are freed from the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and contagion of the body. And
by the Fable of <hi>Ceres,</hi> continually
wandring in search of her daughter
<hi>Proserpina,</hi> is meant nothing else but the
longing desire of men, who live upon
<hi>Ceres</hi> earth, to attaine a place in <hi>Proser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi>
the Moone or heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> also seemes to assent unto
this; but he thinks moreover, that there
are two places of happines answerable
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20652:103"/>
to those two parts which he fancies to
remaine of a man when he is dead, the
soule and the understanding; the soule
hee thinks is made of the Moone; and
as our bodies doe so proceede from
the dust of this earth, that they shall
returne to it hereafter; so our soules
were generated out of that Planet, and
shall be resolved into it againe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the understanding shall ascend unto
the Sunne, out of which it was made,
where it shall possesse an eternity of
well-being, and farre greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
than that which is enjoyed in the
Moone. So that when a man dies, if
his soule be much polluted, then must
it wander up and downe in the middle
region of the ayre where hell is, and
there suffer unspeakable torments for
those sins whereof it is guilty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the soules of better men, when they
have in some space of time beene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from that impurity which they did
derive from the body, then doe they
returne into the Moone, where they
are possest with such a joy, as those
men feele who professe holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
from which place (saith he) some
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20652:103"/>
are sent downe to have the superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of oracles, being diligent either
in the preservation of the good, either
from, or in, all perills, and the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or punishment of all wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but if in these imployments they
mis-behave themselves, then are they
againe to bee imprisoned in a body, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they remaine in the Moone,
till their souls bee resolved into it, and
the understanding being cleared from
all impediments, ascends to the Sunne
which is its proper place. But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a diverse space of time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the divers affections of the soule.
As for those who have beene retired
and honest, addicting themselves to a
studious and quiet life, these are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preferred to a higher happinesse. But
as for such who have busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in many broyles, or have beene
vehement in the prosecution of any
lust, as the ambitious, the amorous, the
wrathfull man, these still retaine the
glimpses and dreames of such things as
they have performed in their bodies,
which makes them either altogether
unfit to remaine there, where they are,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20652:104"/>
or else keepes them long ere they can
put off their souls. Thus you see <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchs</hi>
opinion concerning the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
and neighbours of the Moone,
which (according to the manner of the
Academicks) hee delivers in a third
person; you see hee makes that Planet
an inferior kind of heaven, and though
hee differ in many circumstances, yet
doth hee describe it to bee some such
place, as wee suppose Paradise to be.
You see likewise his opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place of the damned spirits,
that it is in the middle region of the
aire; and in neither of these is hee sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
but some more late and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Writers have agreed with him.
As for the place of Hell, many think
it may be in the aire, as well as any
where else.</p>
                     <p>True indeed,<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei l. 22. c. 16.</note> S. <hi>Austin</hi> affirmes that
this place cannot bee discovered; But
others there are who can shew the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of it out of Scripture; Some hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be in another world without
this,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 30.</note> because our Saviour calls it <gap reason="foreign">

outward darknesse.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 9.</note> But the most
will have it placed towards the center
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20652:104"/>
of our earth, because 'tis said, Christ
descended into the lower parts of the
earth; and some of these are so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this is its situation, that they
can describe you its bignesse also, and
of what capacity it is. <hi>Francis Ribera</hi> in
in his Comment on the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
speaking of those words, where 'tis
said,<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>that the blood went out of the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
even unto the horses-bridles by the
space of one thousand and six hundred fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,</hi>
interprets them to be meant of
hell, and that that number expresses
the diameter of its concavity, which is
200 <hi>Italian</hi> miles;<note place="margin">De Morib. div. l. 13. c. 24.</note> But <hi>Lessius</hi> thinkes
that this opinion gives them too much
roome in hell, and therefore he guesses
that 'tis not so wide; for (saith hee) the
diameter of one league being cubical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiplyed, will make a spheare ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of 800000 millions of damned
bodies, allowing to each six foot in the
square; whereas (sayes he) tis certaine,
that there shall not bee one hundred
thousand millions in all that shall bee
damned. You see the bold <hi>Iesuit</hi> was
carefull that every one should have but
roome enough in hell, and by the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20652:105"/>
strangenesse of the conjecture, you may
guesse that hee had rather bee absurd,
than seeme either uncharitable or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.
I remember there is a relation
in <hi>Pliny,</hi> how that <hi>Dionysiodorus</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,
being dead, did send a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from this place to some of his
friends upon earth, to certifie them
what distance there was betwixt the
center and superficies: hee might have
done well to have prevented this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and enformed them the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
capacity of that place. However,
certaine it is, that that number cannot
be knowne; and probable it is, that the
place is not yet determined, but that
hell is there where there is any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
soule, which may bee in the
regions of the ayre, as well as in the
center: And therefore perhaps it is
that the Divell is stiled the prince of
the ayre. But of this only occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by reason of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> opinion
concerning those that are round about
the Moone; as for the Moone it selfe,
hee esteemes it to bee a lower kind of
heaven,<note place="margin">Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>silent oracula.</note> and therefore in another place
he calls it a terrestriall starre, and an
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20652:105"/>
Olympian or celestiall earth; answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
(as I conceive) to the paradise of
the Schoolemen. And, that paradise
was either in, or neere the Moone, is
the opinion of some later Writers,
who derived it (in all likelyhood) from
the assertion of <hi>Plato,</hi> and perhaps, this
of <hi>Plutarch. Tostatus</hi> layes this opinion
upon <hi>Isiodor.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sir W. Raw. l. 1. c. 3. sect. 7.</note>

<hi>Bede;</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> fathers it upon
<hi>Strabus</hi> and <hi>Rabanus</hi> his Master.<note place="margin">In Genes.</note> Some
would have it to bee situated in such a

which caused the penman of <hi>Esdras</hi> to

of Paradise,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Esdr. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>than to weigh the weight

call againe a day that is past.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, there bee some others,
who think, that it is on the top of
some high mountaine under the line;
and these interpreted the torrid Zone
to be the flaming sword whereby Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
was guarded. 'Tis the consent
of divers others, that Paradise is situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in some high and eminet place. So
<hi>Tostatus: Est etiam Paradisus situ altissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Genes.</note>
                        <hi>supra omnem terrae altitudinem,</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20652:106"/>
is situated in some high place
above the earth:</q> and therefore in
his Comment upon the 49 of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
he understands the blessing of <hi>Iacob</hi>
concerning the everlasting hills to bee
meant of Paradise, and the blessing it
selfe to bee nothing else but a promise
of Christs comming, by whose Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the gates of Paradise should bee
opened. Unto him assented <hi>Rupertus,
Scotus,</hi> and most of the other Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as I find them cited by <hi>Pererius,</hi>
and out of him in Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Comment. in 2. Gen. v. 8.</note>
Their reason was this: because in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 3. sect. 6. 7.</note>
this place was not overflowed
by the Flood, since there were no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
there, which might draw that
curse upon it. Nay <hi>Tostatus</hi> thinks,
that the body of <hi>Enoch</hi> was kept there;
and some of the Fathers, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and <hi>Austin,</hi> have affirmed, that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
soules were reserved in that place
till the day of Judgement; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
'tis likely that it was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
by the Flood, It were easie to
produce the unanimous consent of the
Fathers, to prove that Paradise is yet
really existent. Any diligent peruser of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20652:106"/>
them, may easily observe how they
doe generally interpret the Paradise
whereto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 4. Luke 23. 43.</note> and that
wherein our Saviour promised the
Thiefe should be with him, to bee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the same from whence our first
parents were banished. Now there
cannot be any place on earth designed
where this should bee: And therefore
it is not altogether improbable that it
was in this other world.</p>
                     <p>And besides, since all men should
have went naked if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fell,
'tis requisite therefore that it should be
situated in some such place where it
might be priviledged from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of heat and cold. But now this
could not be (they thought) so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
in any lower, as it might in
some higher ayre. For these and such
like considerations, have so many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that Paradise was in a high ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
place. Which some have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
could bee nowhere but in the
Moone: For it could not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of any mountaine; nor can wee thinke
of any other body separated from this
earth, which can be a more convenient
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20652:107"/>
place for habitation than this Planet;
therefore they concluded that it was
there.</p>
                     <p>It could not bee on the top of any
mountaine.</p>
                     <p>1. Because we have expresse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 19.</note>
that the highest of them was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed.</p>
                     <p>2. Because it must be a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,
and not some small patch of
ground, since tis likely all men should
have lived there, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not
fell. But for a satisfaction of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ets,
together with a farther discourse
of Paradise, I shall referre you to those
who have written purposely upon this
subject. Being content for my owne

may conduce to shew the opinion of
others concerning the inhabitants of
the Moone; I dare not my selfe affirme
any thing of these <hi>Selenites,</hi> because I

that future ages will discover more;

that she made her bed in the Sea. Wee

why may not succeeding times, rayse
up some spirits as eminent for new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

of <hi>Keplar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Disserta. cum Nun. Syder.</note> that as soone as the art
of flying is found out, some of their
nation will make one of the first Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that shall transplant into that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world. I suppose, his appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this preheminence to his owne
Countreymen, may arise from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpartiall
affection to them. But yet
thus far I agree with him, That when
ever that Art is invented, or any other,
wherby a man may be conveyed some
twenty miles high, or thereabouts,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20652:109"/>
then, tis not altogether improbable
that some or other may be successefull
in this attempt.</p>
                     <p>For the better clearing of which I
shall first lay downe, and then answer
those doubts that may make it seeme
utterly impossible.</p>
                     <p>These are chiefly three.</p>
                     <p>The first, taken from the naturall
heavinesse of a mans body, whereby
it is made unfit for the motion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
together with the vast distance of
that place from us.</p>
                     <p>2. From the extreme coldnes of the
aethereall ayre.</p>
                     <p>3. The extreme thinnesse of it.
Both which must needs make it impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
though it were but as many single
miles thither, as it is thousands.</p>
                     <p>For the first. Though it were suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that a man could flie, yet wee may
well think hee would be very slow in
it, since hee hath so heavy a body, and
such a one too, as nature did not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intend, for that kind of motion.
Tis usually observed, that amongst the
varietie of birds, those which doe most
converse upon the earth, and are swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20652:110"/>
in their running, as a Pheasant, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,
&amp;c. together with all domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
fowle, are lesse able for flight, than
othhrs which are for the most part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wing, as a Swallow, swift, &amp;c.
And therefore wee may well think,
that man being not naturally endowed
with any such condition as may inable
him for this motion; and being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
tied to a more especiall residence
on the earth, must needs be slower than
any fowle, and lesse able to hold out.
Thus is it also in swimming; which Art
though it bee growne to a good emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
yet he that is best skilled in it, is
not able either for continuance, or
swiftnesse, to equall a fish; Because he
is not naturally appointed to it. So
that though a man could fly, yet hee
would be so slow in it, and so quickly
weary, that hee could never think to
reach so great a journey as it is to the
Moone.</p>
                     <p>But suppose withall that hee could
fly as fast, and long, as the swiftest
bird: yet it cannot possibly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
how he should ever be able to
passe through so vast a distance, as there
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20652:110"/>
is betwixt the Moone and our earth.
For this Planet, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grounds, is usually granted to bee
at the least, 52 semidiameters of the
earth from us. Reckoning for each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
3456 English miles, of
which the whole space will be about
179712.</p>
                     <p>So that though a man could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
keep on in his journey thither
by a straite line, though he could fly a
thousand miles in a day; yet he would
not arrive thither under 180 dayes, or
halfe a yeare.</p>
                     <p>And how were it possible for any
to tarry so long without dyet or sleep?</p>
                     <p>1. For Diet. I suppose there could
be no trusting to that fancy of <hi>Philo</hi> the
<hi>Iew</hi> (mentioned before,<note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note>) who thinks
that the musick of the spheares should
supply the strength of food.</p>
                     <p>Nor can wee well conceive how
a man should be able to carry so
much luggage with him, as might serve
for his <hi>Viaticum</hi> in so tedious a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                     <p>2. But if he could: yet he must have

consequently, cannot bee styled hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
                     <p>The meaning of this will bee more
clearely illustrated by a similitude. As
any light body (suppose the Sunne)
dos send forth his beames in an orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
forme; So likewise any magneticall
body, for instance a round loadstone
dos cast abroad his magneticall vigor
in a spheare.<note place="margin">Gilbert. de Mganete. l. 2. cap. 7.</note> Thus.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Where suppose the inward circle at
<hi>A</hi> to represent the Loadstone, and the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20652:111"/>
outward one betwixt B C, the orbe
that dos terminate its vertue.</p>
                     <p>Now any other body that is like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
comming within this sphere, as
B, will presently descend towards the
center of it, and in that respect may be
styled heavy. But place it without this
sphere as C, and then the desire of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ceaseth, and so consequently the
motion also.</p>
                     <p>To apply then what hath been said.
This great globe of earth and water,
hath been proved by many observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to participate of Magneticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
And as the Loadstone dos cast
forth its owne vigor round about its
body, in a magneticall compasse: So
likewise dos our earth. The difference
is, that it is another kind of affection
which causes the union betwixt the
Iron and Loadstone, from that which
makes bodies move unto the earth.
The former is some kind of neerenesse
and similitude in their natures, for
which, Philosophie as yet has not
found a particular name. The latter dos
arise from that peculiar qualitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the earth is properly distinguished
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20652:112"/>
from the other elements, which is its
Condensitie. Of which the more any
thing dos participate, by so much the
stronger will bee the desire of union to
it. So gold and others metalls which
are most close in their composition, are
likewise most swift in their motion of
discent.</p>
                     <p>And though this may seeme to bee
contradicted by the instance of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
which are of the same weight,
when they are melted, and when they
are hard: As also of water, which dos
not differ in respect of gravitie, when
it is frozen and when it is fluid: yet we
must know that metalls are not rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by melting, but mollified. And so
too for frozen waters, they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
condensed, but congealed into a
harder substance, the parts being not
contracted closer together, but still
possessing the same extension. But yet
(I say) tis very probable, that there is
such a spheare about the earth, which
dos terminate its power of attracting
other things unto it. So that suppose
a body to bee placed within the limits
of this sphere, and then it must needs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20652:112"/>
tend downewards, towards the center
of it. But on the contrary, if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this compasse, then there can bee
no such mutuall attraction; &amp; so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it must rest immoveable from
any such motion.</p>
                     <p>For the farther confirmation of this,
I shall propose two pertinent observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>The first taken in the presence of
many Physitians, and related by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
man in that profession,<note place="margin">Lib. de Sympath. &amp; Antip. cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Hieron.
Fracastorius.</hi> There being divers needles
provided of severall kindes, like those
in a Mariners Chart, they found, that
there was an attractive power, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the magnet; But that iron also
and steele, and silver did each of them
draw its owne mettle. Whence hee
concludes,<note place="margin">Vid. Bapt. Masul. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Acad. de attract. exer. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Omne trahit quod sibi simile est.</hi>
And as these peculiar likenesses, have
such a mutuall efficacy; so tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that this more generall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of condensitie, may bee
the cause, why things so affected desire
union to the earth. And though 'tis
likely that this would appeare betwixt
two lesser condensed bodies, (as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20652:113"/>
two peeces of earth) if they were
both placed at libertie in the aethereall
ayre, yet being neere the earth, the
stronger species of this great globe dos
as it were drownd the lesse.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a common experiment, that such
a lump of ore or stone, as being on the
ground, cannot be moved by lesse than
six men, being in the bottom of a deep
mine, may be stirred by two. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because then tis compassed with
attractive beams, there being many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it,<note place="margin">Nat. Hist. Cent. 1. exper. 33.</note> as well as below it. Whence
we may probably inferre (saith the
learned <hi>Verulam)</hi> 
                        <q>that the nature of
gravitie, dos worke but weakly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
far from the earth; Because the
appetite of union in dense bodies,
must bee more dull in respect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</q>
As we may also conclude from
the motion of birds, which rise from
the ground but heavily, though with
much labor; Whereas being on high,
they can keep themselves up, and soare
about by the meere extension of their
wings. Now the reason of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
is not (as some falsly conceive)
the depth of ayre under them. For a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20652:113"/>
bird is not heavier when there is but a
foote of ayre under him, than when
there is a furlong. As appeares by a
ship in the water, (an instance of the
same nature) which dos not sinke deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and so consequently is not heavier,
when it has but five fatham depth, than
when it has fifty. But the true reason
is, the weaknesse of the desire of union
in dense bodies at a distance.</p>
                     <p>So that from hence, there might be
just occasion to taxe <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his
followers, for teaching that heavines
is an absolute qualitie of it selfe, and
really distinct from condensitie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is onely a modification of it, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
another name given to a conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
body in reference to its motion.</p>
                     <p>For if it were absolute, then it should
alwayes be inherent in its subject, and
not have its essence depend upon the
bodies being here or there. But it is
not so. For,</p>
                     <p>1. Nothing is heavy in its proper
place, according to his owne principle,
<hi>Nihil grave est in suo loco.</hi> And then</p>
                     <p>2. Nothing is heavy, which is so
farre distant from that proper orbe to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20652:114"/>
which it dos belong, that it is not
within the reach of its vertue. As was
before confirmed.</p>
                     <p>But unto this it may be objected.
Though a body being so placed, be
not heavy <hi>in actu secundo;</hi> yet it is <hi>in
actu primo:</hi> because it retaines in it an
inward proness to move downewards,
being once severed from its proper
place. And this were reason enough
why the quality of heavinesse should
have an absolute being.</p>
                     <p>I answer, this distinction is only
appliable to such naturall powers as
can suspend their acts; and will not
hold in Elementary qualities, whose
very essence dos necessarily require
an exercise of the second act, as you
may easily discerne by an induction
of all the rest. I cannot say, that body
has in it the quality of heate, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
drinesse, moisture, hardnesse,
softnesse, &amp;c. which for the present,
has not the second act of these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And if you meane by the essence
of them, a power unto them: why,
there is not any naturall body but has
a power to them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:20652:114"/>
From that which hath beene said
concerning the nature of gravity, it
will follow; That if a man were above
the sphere of this magneticall vertue,
which proceeds from the earth, hee
might there stand as firmely as in the
open aire, as he can now upon the
ground: And not only so, but he may
also move with a farre greater swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
than any living creatures here
below, because then hee is without all
gravity, being not attracted any way,
and so consequently will not be liable
to such impediments, as may in the
least manner resist that kinde of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which hee shall apply himselfe
unto.</p>
                     <p>If you yet enquire, how wee may
conceive it possible, that a conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
body should not be heavy in such
a place?</p>
                     <p>I answer, by the same reason as a
body is not heavy in its proper place.
Of this I will set down two instances.</p>
                     <p>When a man is in the bottome of
a deepe river, though hee have over
him a multitude of heavy waters, yet
he is not burdened with the weight of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20652:115"/>
them. And though another body, that
should be but of an equall gravity,
with these waters, when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, would be heavy enough to
presse him to death; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whilst they are in the channell,
they doe not in the least manner, crush
him with their load. The reason is,
because they are both in their right
places; and tis proper for the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the more condensed body, to be
lower than the waters. Or rather thus,
Because the body of the man, dos
more nearely agree with the earth, in
this affection, which is the ground of
its attraction, and therefore doth that
more strongly attract it, than the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are over it. Now, as in such
a case, a body may lose the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its gravity, which is, to move,
or to presse downewards: So may it
likewise, when it is so far out of its
place, that this attractive power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach unto it.</p>
                     <p>Tis a pretty notion to this purpose,
mentioned by<note n="*" place="margin">Phys. l. 3. Q. 6. art. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Albertus de Saxonia,</hi>
and out of him by<note n="*" place="margin">Viridar. l. 4 prob. 47.</note> 
                        <hi>Francis Mendoca;</hi>
That the aire is in some part of it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20652:115"/>
navigable. And that upon this Staticke
principle;<note place="margin">Vide. Arch. l. de insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus humido.</note> any brasse or iron vessell
(suppose a kettle) whose substance is
much heavier than that of the water,
yet being filled with the lighter aire,
it will swimme upon it, and not sinke.
So suppose a cup, or wooden vessel,
upon the outward borders of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
aire, the cavity of it being
filled with fire, or rather aethereall
aire, it must necessarily upon the same
ground remaine swimming there, and
of it selfe can no more fall, than an
empty ship can sinke.</p>
                     <p>Tis commonly granted, that if there
were a hole quite through the center
of the earth, though any heavy body
(as suppose a milstone) were let fall
into it, yet when it came unto the place
of the center, it would there rest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
in the aire. Now, as in this
case, its owne condensity, cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but that it may rest in the open
aire, when there is no other place, to
which it should be attracted: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could it be any impediment unto
it, if it were placed without the sphere
of the earths magneticall vigor,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20652:116"/>
where there should be no attraction
at all.</p>
                     <p>From hence then (I say) you may
conceive, that if a man were beyond
this sphere, hee might there stand as
firmely in the open aire, as now upon
the earth. And if he might stand there,
why might hee not also goe there?
And if so; then there is a possibility
likewise of having other conveniences
for travelling.</p>
                     <p>And here tis considerable, that since
our bodies will then bee devoide of
gravity, and other impediments of
motion; wee shall not at all spend our
selves in any labour, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not much need the reparation
of diet: But may perhaps live altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without it, as those creatures
have done, who by reason of their
sleeping for many dayes together, have
not spent any spirits, and so not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any foode: which is commonly
related of Serpents, Crocodiles,
Beares, Cuckoes, Swallowes, and such
like. To this purpose,<note n="*" place="margin">Viridar. lib. 4. prob. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Mendoca</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
up divers strange relations. As
that of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> who is storied to

have slept 75 yeeares. And another of
a rusticke in <hi>Germany,</hi> who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally

                     <p>Againe, seeing we do not then spend
our selves in any labour, we shall not,
it may bee, neede the refreshment of
sleepe. But if we doe, we cannot desire
a softer bed than the aire, where wee
may repose our selves firmely and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20652:119"/>
safely as in our chambers.</p>
                     <p>But here you may aske, whether there
be any meanes for us to know, how far
this sphere of the earths vertue dos ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it selfe?</p>
                     <p>I answer, tis probable that it dos not
reach much farther than that orbe of
thick vaporous aire, that incompasseth
the earth; because tis likely the Sunne
may exhale some earthly vapors, near
unto the utmost bounds of the sphere
alloted to them.</p>
                     <p>Now there are divers wayes used by
Astronomers, to take the altitude of
this vaporous aire. As,</p>
                     <p>1. By observing the height of that
aire which causeth the <hi>Crepusculum,</hi> or
twilight; For the finding of which, the
Antients used this meanes: As soone as
ever they could discerne the aire in the
east to be altered with the least light,
they would by the situation of the
starres find out how many degrees the
Sun was below the <hi>Horizon,</hi> which was
usually about 18. From whence they
would easily conclude, how high that
aire must be above us, which the Sun
could shine upon, when hee was 18 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20652:119"/>
below us. And from this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
it was concluded to bee about
52 miles high.<note place="margin">Vitell. l. 10. Theo. 7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in this Conclusion, the Antients
were much deceived, because they
proceeded upon a wrong ground,
whilst they supposed that the shining
of the Suns direct rayes upon the aire,
was the only reason of the <hi>Crepusculum;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Keplar. Ep. Coper. l. 1. part. 3.</note>
Whereas tis certain that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things which may also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
to the causing of it. As,</p>
                     <p>1. Some bright clouds below the
<hi>Horizon,</hi> which being illuminated by
the Sunne, may be the meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
some light to our aire, before
the direct rayes can touch it.</p>
                     <p>2. The often refraction of the rayes,
which suffer a frequent repercussion
from the cavitie of this sphere, may
likewise yeeld us some light.</p>
                     <p>3. And so may the orbe of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
aire compassing the Sunne, part of
which must rise before his body.</p>
                     <p>2. The second way whereby we may
more surely find the altitude of this
grosser aire, is by taking the highth of
the highest cloud: which may be done,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20652:120"/>

of any cloud from the vertical

way, when a man shall choose such a
station, where he may at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
discerne the place on which the
cloud dos cast its shadow, and withall
dos observe, how much both the cloud
and the Sun decline from the vertical
point. From which he may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the true altitude of it, as you may
more plainely conceive, by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

the sights of your instrument, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
of it will give the angle
<hi>B A D.</hi> Afterwards having measured

                     <p>3. Another way to finde the height
of this vaporous aire, is, by knowing
the difference of altitude, which it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
in refracting the beames of any
star neere the <hi>Horizon.</hi> And from this
observation also, it is usually conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to bee about two or three miles
high.</p>

But now you must not conceive, as if
the orbe of magneticall vigor, were
bounded in an exact superficies, or as
if it did equally hold out just to such
a determinate line, and no farther. But
as it hath bin said of the first region,
which is there terminated where the
heat of reflexion dos begin to languish:
So likewise is it probable, that this
magneticall vigor dos remit of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
proportionally to its distance
from the earth, which is the cause of it:
And therefore though the thicker
clouds may be elevated no higher, yet
this orbe may be continued in weaker
degrees a little beyond them. We will
suppose it (which in all likelyhood is
the most) to bee about twenty miles
high. So that you see the former The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
remaines probable; that if a man
could but fly, or by any other meanes
get twenty miles upwards, it were
possible for him to reach unto the
Moone.</p>
                     <p>But it may bee againe objected:
Though all this were true; though
there were such an orbe of aire which
did terminate the earths vigor: And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:20652:121"/>
though the heavinesse of our bodies
could not hinder our passage, through
the vast spaces of the aetheriall aire;
yet those two other impediments may
seeme to deny the possibility of any
such voyage.</p>
                     <p>1. The extreme <hi>coldnesse</hi> of that aire.
If some of our higher mountaines for
this reason bee not habitable; much
more then will those places bee so,
which are farther from any cause of
heate.</p>
                     <p>2. The extreme thinnesse of it, which
may make it unfit for expiration. For if
in some mountaines (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells
us of <hi>Olympus,</hi> and out him<note n="*" place="margin">In Gen. ad literam. li. 3. cap 2.</note> S. <hi>Austine)</hi>
the aire bee so thin that men cannot
draw their breath, unlesse it were
through some moistned spunges; much
more then must that aire be thin, which
is more remotely situated from the
causes of impurity and mixture. And
then beside, the refraction that is made
by the vaporous aire incompassing our
earth, may sufficiently prove that
there is a great difference betwixt the
aethereall aire and this, in respect of
rarity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:20652:122"/>
To the first of these I answer, that
though the second region, be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endowed with so much coldnesse
as may make it fit for the production
of meteors; yet it will not hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that all that aire above it, which is
not appointed for the like purpose,
should partake of the same condition:
But, it may seeme more probable that
this aethereal aire, is freed from having
any quality in the extremes. And this
may be confirmed, from those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
arguments, which are usually
brought to prove the warmnesse of the
third region. As you may see in<note n="*" place="margin">Meteor. lib. 1. ca. 2. art. 1,</note> 
                        <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi>
and others who treate of that
subject.</p>
                     <p>Tis the assertion of <hi>Pererius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Comment. in Gen. 1. 8.</note> that the
second region, is not cold meerly for
this reason, because it is distant from
the ordinary causes of heat, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was actually made so at the
first, for the condensing of the clouds,
and the production of other meteors
that were there to be generated; which
(as I conceive) might bee sufficiently
confirmed from that order of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
observed by <hi>Moses,</hi> who tells us
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20652:122"/>
that the waters above the firmament
(by which, in the greatest probability,
we are to understand the clouds in the
second region) were made the second
day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 7, 8. whereas the Sunne it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
(whose reflection is the cause of
heate) was not created till the fourth
day, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. 19.</p>
                     <p>To the other objection I answer,
that though the aire in the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(where by reason of its coldnesse
there are many thicke vapors) doe
cause a great refraction; yet tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the aire which is next the
earth, is sometimes, &amp; in some places,
of a farre greater thinnesse, nay as
thin as the aethereall aire it selfe; since
sometimes there is such a speciall heat
of the Sun, as may rarifie it in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree; And in some dry places,
there are no grosse impure exhalations
to mixe with it.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be objected. If the
aire in the second region were more
condensed and heavy than this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee breath, then that must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tend downewards and possesse the
lower place.</p>
                     <p>

To this some answer, that the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the clouds in the open aire, is no
lesse than a miracle. They are the
words of <hi>Pliny. Quid mirabilius aquis in
caelo stantibus?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hist. l. 31. cap. 1.</note> what more wonderfull

should stand in the heavens? Others

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>aquae:</hi> Because the waters do hang
there after such a stupendous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
manner; Which seems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to bee favoured by Scripture,
where tis mentioned as a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods omnipotency, that hee
holds up the clouds from falling.
<hi>He binds up the waters in his thicke clouds,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 26. 8.</note>
                        <hi>and the cloud is not rent under them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that which unto me seemes full
satisfaction against this doubt, is this
consideration; that the naturall vigor
whereby the earth dos attract dense
bodies unto it, is lesse efficacious at a
distance: and therefore a body of lesse
density, which is neare unto it, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this thin aire wherein we breath,
may naturally bee lower in its situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than another of a greater condensity
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20652:123"/>
that is farther of; as suppose the clouds
in the second region. And though the
one bee absolutely and in it selfe more
fit for this motion of descent; yet by
reason of its distance, the earths mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
vertue cannot so powerfully
worke upon it.</p>
                     <p>As for that relation of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> If
it were true; yet it dos not prove this
aire to be altogether impassible, since
moistned spunges might helpe us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
its thinnesse: But tis more likely
that hee tooke it upon trust, as hee did
some other relations concerning the
height of the mountaines, wherein tis
evident that he was grossely mistaken.
As where he tells us of <hi>Caucasus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Meteor. l. 1. c. 11.</note> that it
casts its shadow 560 miles. And this
relation being of the same nature, wee
cannot safely trust unto him for the
truth of it.</p>
                     <p>If it be here enquired, what meanes
there may bee conjectured, for our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
beyond the sphere of the
earths magneticall vigor.</p>
                     <p>I answer. 1. Tis not perhaps impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that a man may be able to flye, by
the application of wings to his owne
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20652:124"/>
body; As Angels are pictured, as
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Daedaelus</hi> are fained, and as
hath bin attempted by divers, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
by a Turke in Constantinople, as
<hi>Busbequius</hi> relates.<note place="margin">Mr. Burton. Melanch. pa. 2. sect. 2 mem. 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. If there bee such a great <hi>Ruck</hi> in
<hi>Madagascar,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 40.</note> 
                        <hi>Marcus Polus</hi> the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian
mentions, the feathers in whose
wings are twelve foot long, which can
soope up a horse and his rider, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,
as our kites doe a mouse; why
then tis but teaching one of these to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a man, and he may ride up thither, as
<hi>Ganymed</hi> dos upon an eagle.</p>
                     <p>3. Or if neither of these wayes will
serve: Yet I doe seriously, and upon
good grounds, affirme it possible to
make a flying Chariot. In which a
man may sit, and give such a motion
unto it, as shall convey him through
the aire. And this perhaps might bee
made large enough to carry divers
men at the same time, together with
foode for their <hi>viaticum,</hi> and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
for traffique. It is not the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of any thing in this kind, that can
hinder its motion, if the motive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be answerable thereunto. We see a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20652:124"/>
great ship swimmes as well as a small
corke, and an Eagle flies in the aire as
well as a little gnat.</p>
                     <p>This engine may be contrived from
the same principles by which <hi>Archytas</hi>
made a wooden dove, and <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a wooden eagle.</p>
                     <p>I conceive it were no difficult matter
(if a man had leisure) to shew more
particularly, the meanes of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it.</p>
                     <p>The perfecting of such an invention,
would be of such excellent use, that it
were enough, not only to make a man
famous, but the age also wherein hee
lives. For besides the strange discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that it might occasion in this other
world, it would be also of inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advantage for travelling, above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other conveiance that is now in use.</p>
                     <p>So that notwithstanding all these
seeming impossibilities, tis likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that there may be a meanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
of journying to the Moone;
And how happy shall they be, that are
first successefull in this attempt?

                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus finished this discourse,
I chanced upon a late fancy to this
purpose under the fained name of
<hi>Domingo Gonsales,</hi> written by a late
reverend and learned Bishop: In
which (besides sundry particulars
wherein this later Chapter did unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
agree with it) there is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a very pleasant and well contrived
fancy concerning a voyage to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world.</p>
                     <p>Hee supposeth that there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and usuall passage for many
creatures betwixt our earth and this
planet. Thus hee saies; those great
multitudes of locusts, wherewith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
countries have bin destroyed, do
proceed from thence. And if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
the authors who treat of them,
wee shall finde that many times they
fly in numberlesse troopes, or swarmes,
and for sundry dayes together before
they fall, are seene over those places
in great high clouds, such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
nearer, are of extension enough
to obscure the day, &amp; hinder the light
of the Sunne. From which, together
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20652:125"/>
with diverse other such relations, he
concludes, that tis not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
they should proceed from
the Moone. Thus likewise he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Swallowes, Cuckoes, Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales,
with divers other fowle,
which are with us only halfe the year,
to flye up thither, when they goe from
us. Amongst which kinde, there is a
wilde Swan in the East Indies, which
at certain seasons of the year doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
take their flight thither. Now
this bird being of great strength, able
to continue for a long flight, as also
going usually in flocks, like our wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geese;
he supposeth that many of them
together, might be taught to carry the
weight of a man; especially if an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
were so contrived (as he thinks it
might) that each of them should beare
an equall share in the burden. So that
by this means, tis easily conceiveable,
how once every yeare a man might fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
such a voyage; going along with
these birds at the beginning of winter,
and againe returning with them at the
Spring.</p>
                     <p>And here, one that had a strong
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20652:126"/>
fancy, were better able to set forth the
great benefit and pleasure to be had by
such a journey. And that whether you
consider the strangenesse of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
language, arts, policy, religion of
those inhabitants, together with the
new traffique that might be brought
thence. In briefe, doe but consider the
pleasure and profit, of those later dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
in <hi>America,</hi> and wee must
needs conclude this to be inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
beyond it.</p>
                     <p>But such imaginations as these, I
shall leave to the fancy of the Reader.

1 'Tis not the <hi>purpose</hi> of it, to
set downe an exact Treatise of
this kind of <hi>Astronomy;</hi> but rather
to remove those common preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
which usually deterre men
from taking any Argument ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this way, into their conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
For we may obserue, that
in those points which are cryed
downe by the more generall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
men doe for the most part
rest themselves in the superficiall
knowledge of things, as they seem
at their first appearances, thinking
they can say enough to any Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
against which they can urge
the most obvious and easie Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and therefore seldome or
never search into the depth of
these points, or enter into any seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
impartiall examination of
<pb facs="tcp:20652:132"/>
those grounds on which they are
bottomed. Which as it must needs
be a great hinderance to the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
of all kind of Learning:
so more especially is it in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
We might discerne a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comelinesse and order in this
great Fabricke of the World, and
more easily understand the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in Astronomy, if we could
with indifferencie attend to what
might bee said for that opinion
of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>For the manner.</hi> It is not
maintained with such heate and
religion, as if every one that reads
it, were presently bound to yeeld
up his assent: But as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Warres where <hi>victory</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee had, Men must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="tcp:20652:133"/>
with peace: So likewise is
it in this, and should bee in all
other Philosophicall contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If there bee nothing able
to convince and satisfie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Reader, hee may still
injoy his owne opinion. All
men have not the same way of
apprehending things; but according
to the varietie of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
custome, and abilities, their
Vnderstandings are severally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
to different assents:
Which had it beene but well
considered by some of our hot
<note n="*" place="margin">Fromond. Al. Ross.</note> adversaries, they would not
have shewed more <hi>violence</hi> in
opposing the <hi>Persons</hi> against
whom they write, than <hi>strength</hi>
in confuting the <hi>cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis an excellent rule to bee
<pb facs="tcp:20652:133"/>
observed in all disputes, That
Men should give <hi>soft Words</hi> and
<hi>hard Arguments,</hi> that they would
not so much strive to <hi>vex,</hi> as
to <hi>convince</hi> an Enemy. If this
were but diligently practised in
all cases, and on all sides, wee
might in a good measure bee
freed from those vexations in
the search of Truth, which the
wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
did so much complaine
of, <hi>Ecclesiastes, 1. 18. In much
Wisedome there is much Griefe,
and he that increaseth Knowledge,
increaseth Sorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude: Though there
should be nothing in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
conducible to your Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Benefit; yet it may
serve in the <hi>Perusall,</hi> as it did
<pb facs="tcp:20652:134"/>
in the <hi>Composure</hi> for the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of such leisure houres, as
may conveniently bee spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Theologicall Truths, it
is the safest method, first
of all to looke unto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority; because
that carryes with it as cleer an evidence
to our Faith, as any thing else can be to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20652:138"/>
our reason. But on the contrary, in the
examination of Philosophicall points,
it were a preposterous course to begin
at the testimony and opinion of others,
and then afterwards to descend unto
the reasons that may bee drawne from
the Nature and Essence of the things
themselves: because these inartificiall
Arguments (as the Logicians cal them)
doe not carry with them any cleere and
convincing evidence; and therefore
should come after those that are of
more necessary dependance, as serving
rather to confirme, than resolve the
Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>But yet, so it is, that in those points
which are besides the common opinion,
men are carried away at the first by the
generall cry, and seldome or never come
so farre as to examine the reasons that
may bee urged for them. And therfore,
since it is the purpose of this discourse
to remove those prejudices which may
hinder our judgement in the like case,
'tis requisite that in the first place
there bee some satisfaction given to
those Arguments that may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

and strange discoveries, there was
none able to finde out such a Secret as
this, besides some fabulous Pithagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and of late <hi>Copernicus?</hi> Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the World should last for
above five thousand yeares together,
and yet the Inhabitants of it be so dull
and stupid, as to be unacquainted with
it's motion? Nay, shall wee thinke that
those excellent men, whom the Holy
Ghost made use of in the penning of
Scripture, who were extraordinarily
inspired with supernaturall Truths,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20652:139"/>
should notwithstanding be so grossely
ignorant of so common a matter as
this? Can wee beleeve, if there were
any such thing, that <hi>Iosuah,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. should know
nothing of it? Certainly it must needs
argue a strong affectation of Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for a man to take up any groundlesse
fancy against such antient and generall
Authority.</p>
                     <p>I answer: As wee should not bee so
fondly conceited of our selves, and the
extraordinary Abilities of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
ages, as to thinke every thing that
is antient to be absolute: Or, as if it
must needs bee with opinions, as it is
with cloths, where the newest is for the

so superstitiously devoted to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as to take up every thing for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
which drops from the pen of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

It behoves every one in the search of
Truth, alwaies to preserve a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
liberty: not to be so inslaved to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20652:139"/>
opinion of any man, as to thinke what
ever he sayes to be infallible. We must
labour to find out what things are in
themselves by our owne experience, and
a through examination of their natures,
not what another sayes of them. And if
in such an impartiall enquiry, we chance
to light upon a new way, and that which
is besides the common rode, this is
neither our fault, nor our unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Not our fault, because it did not arise
from Singularity or Affectation. Not
our unhappinesse, because it is rather a
Priviledge to be the first in finding out
such Truths, as are not discernable to
every common eye. If Noveltie should
alwaies be rejected, neither would Arts
have arrived to that perfection wherein
now wee enjoy them, nor could we euer
hope for any future reformation: though
all Truth be in it self Eternall; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of mens opinions, there is scarse
any so antient, but had a beginning, and
was once counted a Noveltie; and if
for this reason it had been condemned
as an errour, what a generall darknesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20652:140"/>
and ignorance would then have been in
the World, in comparison of that light
which now abounds; according to that
of the Poet:

                     <p>But for more full satisfaction of all
those scruples that may arise from the
seeming Novelty or Singularity of this
opinion, I shall propose these following
considerations.</p>
                     <p>Suppose it were a Noveltie:<note place="margin">Consid. 1.</note> Yet 'tis
in Philosophy, and that is made up of
nothing else; but receives addition from
every dayes experiment. True indeed,
for Divinity wee have an infallible rule
that do's plainly inform us of all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Truths; and therfore the Primitive
Times are of greater Authority, because
they were neerer to those holy Men who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20652:140"/>
were the pen-men of Scripture. But now
for Philosophy, there is no such reason:
what ever the Schoole-men may talke;
yet <hi>Aristotles</hi> works are not necessarily
true, and hee himselfe hath by sufficient
Arguments proved himselfe to be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto errour. Now in this case, if wee
should speake properly, Antiquity do's
consist in the old age of the World, not
in the youth of it. In such Learning as
may be increased by fresh experiments
and new discoveries: 'tis we are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of more Authority than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages; because wee have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of more time than they had, and
Truth (wee say) is the Daughter of
Time. However, there is nothing in
this opinion so Magisterially proposed,
but the Reader may use his owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and if all the reasons considered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
doe not seeme convincing unto
him, he may freely reject it.</p>
                     <p>In those naturall points which carry
with them any doubt or obscurity, it is
the safest way to suspend our assents: and
though we may dispute <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con;</hi> yet
not to settle our opinion on either side.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20652:141"/>
In weighing the Authority of others,
'tis not their multitude that should
prevaile,<note place="margin">Consid. 2.</note> or their skill in some things
that should make them of credit in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, but wee should examine what
particular insight and experience they
had in those times for which they are
cited. Now 'tis plaine, that common
people judge by their senses; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
their voices are altogether unfit to
decide any Philosophicall doubt, which
cannot well be examined or explained
without discourse and reason. And as
for the antient Fathers, though they
were men very eminent for their holy
lives and extraordinary skill in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
yet they were most of them very
ignorant in that part of Learning which
concernes this opinion, as appeares by
many of their grosse mistakes in this
kinde, as that concerning the <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
&amp;c. and therefore it is not their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
neither, in this businesse, that to an
indifferent seeker of Truth will bee of
any strong Authority.</p>
                     <p>But against this it is<note n="*" place="margin">Alex. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ss. l. 1. sect. c. 8.</note> objected, That
the instance of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> do's not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20652:141"/>
argue any speciall ignorance in these
learned Men: Or, that they had lesse skil
in such humane Arts than others; since
<hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, and <hi>Pliny,</hi> did deny this
as well as they.</p>
                     <p>I answer:</p>
                     <p>1 If they did, yet this do's make
more to the present purpose: For if such
great Schollers, who were so eminent
for their knowledge in naturall things,
might yet notwithstanding be grossely
mistaken in such matters as are now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and certaine: Why then wee have
no reason to depend upon their asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Authorities, as if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
                     <p>2 Though these great Naturalists,
for want of some experience were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in that opinion, whilest they
thought no place was habitable but the
temperate <hi>Zones;</hi> yet it cannot be from
hence inferred, that they denied the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie
of <hi>Antipodes:</hi> since these are
such Inhabitants as live opposite unto
us in the other temperate <hi>Zone;</hi> and
'twere an absurd thing to imagine that
those who lived in different <hi>Zones,</hi> can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20652:142"/>
be <hi>Antipodes</hi> to one another; and argues
that a man did not understand, or else
had forgotten that common distinction
in <hi>Geography,</hi> wherein the relation of the
Worlds Inhabitants unto one another,
are reckoned up under these three
heads; <hi>Antaeci, Periaeci,</hi> and <hi>Antipodes.</hi>
But to let this passe: 'Tis certaine, that
some of the Fathers did deny the being
of any such, upon other more absurd
grounds. Now if such as <hi>Chrisostome,
Lactantius,</hi> &amp;c. who were noted for great
Schollers, and such too as flourished in
these latter times, when all humane
Learning was more generally profest,
should notwithstanding be so much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in so obvious a matter: Why then
may wee not think that those Primitive
Saints, who were the pen-men of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and eminent above others in their
time for holinesse and knowledge,
might yet be utterly ignorant of many
Philosophicall Truths, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
knowne in these dayes? 'Tis
probable, that the Holy Ghost did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them onely with the knowledge
of those things whereof they were to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20652:142"/>
be the pen-men, and that they were not
better skilled in points of Philosophy
than others. There were indeed some of
them who were supernaturally indowed
with humane Learning; yet this was,
because they might thereby bee fitted
for some particular ends, which all the
rest were not appointed unto: thus <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was strangely gifted with all kinde
of knowledge, in a great measure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was to teach us by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the extreme vanity of it,<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 18.</note> that
we might not so settle our desires upon
it, as if it were able to yeeld us content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So too the Apostles were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
inspired with the knowledge
of Languages, because they were to
preach unto all Nations. But it will not
hence follow, that therfore the other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pen-men were greater Schollers than
others. 'Tis likely that <hi>Iob</hi> had as much
humane Learning as most of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Booke is more especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for lofty expressions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of Nature; and yet 'tis not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he was acquainted with all those
mysteries which later Ages have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20652:143"/>
because when God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of his owne folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he proposes to him such questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as being altogether unanswerable;
which notwithstanding, any ordinary
Philosopher in these dayes might have
resolued. As you may see at large in the
thirty eighth Chapter of that Booke.</p>
                     <p>The occasion was this: <hi>Iob</hi> having
<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 13. 3.</note> before desired that he might dispute
with the Almighty concerning the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
of his owne wayes, and the
unreasonablenesse of those afflictions
which he underwent, do's at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his desire in this kinde; and God
vouchsafes in this thirty eighth chapter,
to argue the case with him. Where he
do's shew <hi>Iob</hi> how unfit he was to judge
of the wayes of Providence, in disposing
of Blessings and Afflictions, when as he
was so ignorant in ordinary matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not able to discerne the reason of
naturall and common events. As<note n="*" place="margin">V. 8. 10, 11.</note> why
the Sea should bee so bounded from
overflowing the land? What is the
<note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> bredth of the Earth? what is the<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Snow or Hayle? what was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20652:143"/>
the<note n="†" place="margin">V. 28. 29.</note> cause of the Raine or Dewe, of Ice
and Frost, and the like. By which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it seemes <hi>Iob</hi> was so utterly pusled,
that hee is faine afterwards to humble
himselfe in this acknowledgement:
<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 42. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>I have uttered that I understood not,
things too wonderfull for me, which I knew
not: wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent
in dust and ashes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that 'tis likely these holy Men
had not these humane Arts by any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
inspiration, but by instruction and
study, and other ordinary meanes; and
therefore <hi>Moses</hi> his skill in this kinde is
called the Learning of the Egyptians.<note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note>
Now because in those times all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were taughr onely in a rude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
manner; therefore 'tis likely that
they also had but a darke and confuse
apprehension of things, and were liable
to the common errours. And for this
reason is it, why<note n="*" place="margin">Iosh ca. 10. Quaest. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Tostatus</hi> (speaking of
<hi>Iosuahs</hi> bidding the Moone stand still as
well as the Sun) sayes, <hi>Quod forte er at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritus
circa Astrorum doctrinam, sentiens
ut vulgares sentiunt:</hi> That perhaps hee
was unskilfull in Astronomy, having
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20652:144"/>
the same grosse conceit of the Heavens,
as the vulgar had. From all which it
may be inferred, that the ignorance of
such good Men and great Schollers
concerning these Philosophical points,
can bee no sufficient reason, why after
examination we should deny them, or
doubt of their Truth.</p>
                     <p>'Tis considerable,<note place="margin">Consid. 3.</note> that in the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and first beginnings of <hi>Astronomy,</hi>
and so in severall Ages after, this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath sound many Patrons, and those
too Men of eminent note and learning.
Such was more especially <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
who was generally and highly esteemed
for his divine wit, and rare inventions;
under whose mysterious sayings, there
be many excellent Truths to bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>But against his testimony, it is againe
<note n="†" place="margin">Alex. Ross. l. 2. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 2. c. 10.</note> objected; If <hi>Pythagoras</hi> were of this
opinion, yet his Authority should not
be of any credit, because he was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of many other monstrous absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer: If a mans errour in
some particulars should take away his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20652:144"/>
credit for every thing else, this would
abolish the force of all humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
for <hi>humanum est errane.</hi> Secondly, 'tis
probable that many of <hi>Pythagora's</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which seeme so absurd, are not to
be understood according to their letter,
but in a mysticall sense.</p>
                     <p>2 But he objects again, that <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
was not of this opinion; and that for
two reasons: First, because no antient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
that he had read ascribes it unto
him. Secondly, it is contradictory to his
other opinions, concerning the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that was made by the motion of the
Heavens; which could not consist with
this other of the Earth's motion.</p>
                     <p>To the first I answer: The Objector
could not chuse but know that this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
is by many antient authors ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to that sect, whereof <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was
the chief. He might have seene it expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
in<note n="*" place="margin">De Coelo, lib. 2. ca. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>In which the Philosopher do's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously
reckon up the three chiefe
particulars implyed in the opinion of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20652:145"/>
the <hi>Pythagorians.</hi> First, the Suns being in
the centre of the World. Secondly, the
earth's annuall motion about it, as being
one of the planets: thirdly, it's diurnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
wherby it caused day &amp; night.</p>
                     <p>To his second reason I answer: First,
that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> thought the Earth to be
one of the Planets (as appeares by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
testimony concerning him) and to
move amongst them the rest. So that his
opinion concerning the motion of the
heavens, is not inconsistent with that of
the earth. Secondly, but as for the coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
harmony, he might perhaps under
this mysticall expression, according to
his usuall custome, shadow forth unto
us that mutuall proportion &amp; harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
consent, which he did conceive in the
severall bignes, distance, motions of the
orbs. So that notwithstanding these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
it is evident that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was
of this opinion, and that his Authority
may adde somwhat for the confirmation
of it. Vnto him assented<note n="*" place="margin">Archime des de arae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae numero.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristarchus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
who flourished about 280 yeares
before the Birth of our Saviour, and was
by reason of this opinion, arraigned for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20652:145"/>
prophanes and sacriledge by the <hi>Ariopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gites,</hi>
because he had blasphemed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of <hi>Vesta,</hi> affirming the earth to move.
To them agreed <hi>Philaus, Heraclides, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Nicetas, Syracusanus, Ecphantus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus,</hi>
and <hi>Plato</hi> himself, (as some think.)
So likewise <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
relates it in his life; who in reference to
this opinion, built the temple of <hi>Vesta</hi>
round, like the universe: in the middle of
it was placed the perpetuall vest all fire;
by which he did represent the Sunne in
the centre of the world. All these men
were in their severall times of speciall
Note, as well for their extraordinarie
learning, as for this opinion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis considerable,<note place="margin">4. Consid.</note> that since this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Astronomy</hi> hath bin raised to any
perfection, there have been many of the
best skill in it, that have assented unto
that assertion which is here defended.
Amongst whom was the Cardinall <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De docta ignor. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note>
but more especially <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
who was a man very exact and diligent
in these studies for above 30 yeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from the yeare 1500 to 1530, and
upwards: and since him, most of the best
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20652:146"/>
Astronomers have been of this side. So
that now, there is scarce any of note and
skil, who are not <hi>Copernicus</hi> his followers,
and if we should goe to most voices, this
opinion would carry it from any other.
It would be too tedious to reckon up
the names of those that may be cited for
it; I wil only mention some of the chief:
Such were <hi>Ioachinus Rheticus,</hi> an elegant
writer, <hi>Christopherus Rothman, Mestilin,</hi> a
man very eminent for his singular skill
in this Science; who though at the first
he were a follower of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> yet upon
his second and more exact thoughts, he
concluded <hi>Copernicus</hi> to be in the right,
&amp; that the usual <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Praef. ad Narrat. Rhetici.</note> 
                        <hi>praescriptione
potiùs quàm ratione valet,</hi> do's prevaile
more by prescription then reason. So
likewise <hi>Erasmus Reinholdus,</hi> who was the
man that calculated the Pratenicall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
from <hi>Copernicus</hi> his observations,
and did intend to write a Commentarie
upon his other Works,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but that he was
taken out of this life before hee could
finish those resolutions. Vnto these also
I might adde the Names of <hi>Gilbert, Kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
Gallilaeus,</hi> with sundry others, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20652:146"/>
have much beautified and confirmed
this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> with their new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Nay I may safely affirme, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the varietie of those opinions
that are in <hi>Astronomy,</hi> there are more (of
those which have skill in it) that are of
this opinion, not only than any other
side, but than all the rest put together.
So that now it is a greater Argument of
Singularitie to oppose it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis probable,<note place="margin">5 Consid.</note> that many other of the
Antients would have assented unto this
opinion, if they had been acquainted
with those experiments which later
times have found out for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: And therefore<note n="*" place="margin">in Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> 
                        <hi>Rheticus</hi> and
<note n="†" place="margin">Myst. Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr. cap. 1. Item praef. ad 4. l. Astr. Copern.</note> 
                        <hi>Keplar</hi> doe so oten wish that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
were now alive againe. Questionlesse he
was so rational &amp; ingenious a man (not
halfe so obstinate as many of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers)
that upon such probabilities as
these, he would quickly have renounced
his owne Principles, and have come
over to this side: for in one place, having
proposed some questions about the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,<note place="margin">de Coel. l. 2. c. 12.</note>
which were not easie to bee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
He sets downe this rule, That in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20652:147"/>
a man may take a liberty to
speake that which seems most likely to
him: and in such cases, an aptnesse to
guesse at some resolution, for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our Philosophicall thirst, do's
deserve rather to bestiled by the name

as well <hi>Eudoxus</hi> as <hi>Calippus;</hi> and to
entertaine that (not which is most anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but) which is most exact and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to reason.<note place="margin">Alm. lib. 13. cap. 2.</note> And as for <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> 'tis his
counsell, that wee should endeavour to
frame such suppositions of the Heavens,
as might be more simple, being void of
all superfluities: and he confesses, that
his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> had many implications in
it, together with sundry intricate and
unlikely turnings; and therefore in the
same place, hee seems to admonish us,
that wee should not bee too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the Heavens were really in the
same Forme, wherein Astronomers did
supposethem. So that 'tis likely, 'twas
his chief intent to propose unto us such
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20652:147"/>
a frame of the coelestiall bodies, from
which wee might, in some measure,
conceive of their different appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and according to which, wee
might be able to calculate their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But now, 'tis <hi>Copernicus</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
to propound unto us, the
true naturall Causes of these severall
Motions, and Appearances: It was
the intent of the one, to settle the
Imagination; and of the other, to
satisfie the judgement. So, that wee
have no reason to doubt of his assent
unto this Opinion, if hee had but
clearely understood all the grounds
of it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis reported of <hi>Clavius,</hi> that when
lying upon his Death-bed, he heard
the first Newes of those Discoveries
which were made by <hi>Gallilaeus</hi> his
Glasse, he brake forth into these words:
<hi>Videre Astronomos, quo pacto constituendi
sunt orbes Coelestes, ut haec Phaenomena
salvari possint:</hi> That it did behoove A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers,
to consider of some other
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> beside that of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might salve all those new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20652:148"/>
Intimating that this old one,
which formerly he had defended, would
not now serve the turne: and doubtlesse,
if it had been informed how congruous
all these might have been unto the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> hee would quickly
have turned on that side. 'Tis conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that amongst the followers of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi>
there are scarce any, who were
not formerly against him; and such, as at
first, had been throughly seasoned with
the Principles of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> in which, for
the most part, they have no lesse skil, than
those who are so violent in the defence
of them. Whereas on the contrary,
there are very few to bee found amongst
the followers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>
that have read any thing in <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
or doe fully understand the Grounds of
his opinion; and I thinke, not any, who
having been once setled with any strong
assent on this side, that have afterwards
revolted from it. Now if we do but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
weigh with our selves, that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ingenious, considering men, should
reject that opinion which they were
nursed up in, and which is generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20652:148"/>
as the truth; and that, for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of such a <hi>Paradox</hi> as is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Schooles, and commonly cryed
downe, as being absurd and ridiculous;
I say, if a man doe but well consider all
this, he must needs conclude, that there
is some strong evidence for it to bee
found out by examination; and that in
all probabilitie, this is the righter side.</p>
                     <p>'Tis probable,<note place="margin">7 Consid.</note> that most of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who have opposed this opinion,
since it hath bin confirmed by new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
were stirred up thereunto by
some of these 3 insufficient grounds.</p>
                     <p>1 An over-fond and partial conceit
of their proper inventions. Every man is
naturally more affected to his owne
brood, than to that of which another is
the Author; though perhaps, it may bee
more agreeable to reason. 'Tis very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for any one, in the search of Truth,
to find in himselfe such an indifferencie,
as that his judgement is not at all swayd
by an overweening affection unto that
which is proper unto himselfe. And this
perhaps might bee the first reason that
moved the noble <hi>Tycho</hi> with so much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20652:149"/>
heat to oppose <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that so hee
might the better make way for the spre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which was of his
owne invention. To this I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
refer that opinion of <hi>Origanus</hi> and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Carpenter,</hi> who attribute to the earth
only a diurnall revolution. It do's more
especially concerne those men that are
<hi>Leaders</hi> of severall sides, to beat downe
any that should oppose them.</p>
                     <p>2 A servile and superstitious feare
of derogating from the authoritie of
the antients, or opposing that meaning
of Scripture phrases; wherein the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
infallible Church, hath for a long
time understood them. 'Tis made part
of the new Creed, set forth by <hi>Pius</hi> the
fourth, 1564, That no man should assent
unto any interpretation of Scripture,
which is not approved of by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the Fathers. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the Iesuites, who are otherwise
the greatest affectors of those opinions,
which seeme to be new and subtill, doe
yet forbeare to say any thing in defence
of this; but rather take all occasions to
inveigh against it.<note n="*" place="margin">Serrarius Commen. in Ios. cap. 10. Quaest. 14. <hi>So</hi> Lipfius Phisiol. l. 2.</note> One of them do's
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20652:149"/>
expressely condemn it for a heresie. And
since him, it hath bin called in by<note n="†" place="margin">Ann. Dom. 1616. item 1633.</note> two
Sessions of the Cardinals, as being an
opinion both absurd and dangerous.
And therefore likewise doe they punish
it, by casting the Defenders of it into
the Popes truest Purgatorie, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
but yet neither these Councels,
nor any (that I know of) since them, have
proceeded to such a peremptorie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it, as to conclude it a heresie: fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
perhaps, lest a more exact examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the discoverie of future
times, finding it to bee an undeniable
Truth, it might redound to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of their Church, and it's infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
And therefore he that is most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against it, in the heat and violence of
opposition, will not call it a heresie: the
worst that he dares say of it, is, That it is
<hi>opinio temeraria quae altero saltem pede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travit
haeresios limen;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fromondus Antarist. cap. 6.</note> A rash opinion, and
bordering upon heresie. Though unto
this likewise he was incited by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse
of disputation, and a desire of
victorie, for it seemes many eminent
men of that Church before him, were a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20652:150"/>
great deale more milde and moderate in
their censures of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> the third, was not so much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at <hi>Copernicus,</hi> when he dedicated his
Worke unto him.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Cusa,</hi> do's expresly
maintaine this opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scombergius,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Capua,</hi>
did with much importunitie and great
approbation, beg of <hi>Copernicus</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
that he writ in this kind. And
it seems the Fathers of the Councell of
<hi>Trent,</hi> were not such confident defenders
of <hi>Ptolomy's hypothesis</hi> against <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
as many now are. For speaking of those
intricate subtilties, which the Fancies
of men had framed, to maintain the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church, they compared
them to Astronomers, who (say they) do
faine <hi>Excentricks</hi> and <hi>Epicijcles,</hi> and such
engines of Orbes, to save the <hi>Phenomena;</hi>
though they know there are no such
things. But now, because this opinion of
<hi>Copernicus</hi> in later times hath been so
strictly forbidden, and punished, it will
concerne those of that Religion, to take
heed of medling in the defence of it, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20652:150"/>
rather to submit the liberty of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
unto the command of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
and (which is very absurd) even in
naturall Questions, not to assent unto
any thing, but what authoritie shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of.</p>
                     <p>3. A iudging of things by sence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by discourse and reason: a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the meaning of Scripture, to the
letter of it; and from thence concluding
Philosophicall points, together with an
ignorance of all those grounds and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
in Astronomie, upon which
this opinion is bottomed. And this in
all likelihood, is the reason why some
men, who in other things perhaps are
able Schollers, doe write so vehemently
against it: and why the common people
in generall doe cry it downe, as being
absurd and ridiculous. Vnder this head
I might referre the opposition of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fuller, Al. Ross.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But now, no prejudice that may arise
from the bare authoritie of such ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as these, will be liable to sway the
judgement of an indifferent considering
man; and I doubt not but that hee, who
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20652:151"/>
will throughly weigh with himselfe
these particulars that are here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
may find some satisfaction for
these Arguments, which are taken from
the seeming Noveltie and Singularitie
of this Opinion.</p>

                     <p>The places that seem to oppose this,
are of two kinds. First, such as imply a

                     <p>Those of the first kind seem to beare
in them the cleerest evidence, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are more insisted on by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
They may be referred unto these
three heads.</p>
                     <p>1 All those Scriptures where there
is any mention made of the rising, or
setting of the Sunne or Starres.</p>
                     <p>2 That story in <hi>Iosuah,</hi> where the
Sunne standing still, is reckoned for a
miracle.</p>
                     <p>3 That other wonder in the dayes
of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when the Sunne went back
ten degrees in the Diall of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> All
which places doe seeme to conclude,
That the diurnall motion is caused by
the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer in generall;</p>
                     <p>That the Holy Ghost in these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20652:152"/>
expressions, is pleased to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
himselfe unto the conceit of the
vulgar, and the usuall opinion: whereas,
if in the more proper phrase it had been
said, That the Earth did rise and set; or,
that the earth stood still, &amp;c. the people
who had been unacquainted with that
secret in Philosophy, would not have
understood the meaning of it, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was convenient, that they should
be spoken unto in their own Language.</p>
                     <p>I but you will reply, It should seeme
more likely, if there had been any such
thing, that the Holy Ghost should use
the truest expressions: for then he would
at the same time have informed them of
the thing, and reformed them in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
since his authoritie alone had been
sufficient to have rectified the mistake.</p>
                     <p>I answer:</p>
                     <p>1 Though it were, yet 'tis beside
the chiefe scope of those places, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us in any Philosophicall points,
as hath been proved in the former book;
especially when these things are neither
necessary in themselves, nor do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
induce to a more ful understanding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20652:153"/>
of that which is the maine businesse of
those Scriptures. But now the people
might better conceive the meaning of
the Holy Ghost, when he do's conforme
himselfe unto their capacities and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
than when hee talks exactly of
things in such a proper phrase, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their reach: And therefore 'tis said
in <hi>Isaiah, I am the Lord which teacheth thee</hi>
utilia, <hi>profitable things:</hi> where the glosse
ha's it, <hi>non subtilia,</hi> not such curiosities of
Nature as are not easily apprehended.</p>
                     <p>2 'Tis not only besides that which
is the chiefe purpose of those places, but
it might happen also to be somwhat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
unto it. For men being naturally
unapt to beleeve any thing that seemes
contrary to their senses, might upon this
begin to question the authoritie of that
Booke which affirmed it, or at least to
retch Scripture some wrong way, to
force it to some other sence which might
be more agreeable to their owne false
imagination.<note n="†" place="margin">Praescript. cap. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us of some
Hereticks, who when they were plainly
confuted out of any Scripture, would
presently accuse those texts or Books to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20652:153"/>
be fallible; and of no authority; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yeeld Scripture to bee erroneous,
than forgoe those Tenents for which
they thought there was so good reason.
So likewise might it have been in these
points which seem to beare in them so
much contradiction to the sences and
common opinion: and therfore 'tis excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
advise set down by S.<note n="†" place="margin">In Genes. ad lit. lib. 2. in fine.</note> 
                        <hi>Austin. Quod

neforte quod postea veritas patefecerit, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
libris sanctis sive testamenti veteris, sive
novi, nullo modo esse possit adversum, tamen
propter amorem nostri erroris oderimus:</hi>
That wee should not hastily settle our
opinions concerning any obscure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
lest afterwards, the truth being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
(which however it may seeme,
cannot bee repugnant to any thing in
Scripture) wee should hate that, out
of love to the error that wee have before
entertained. A little reading may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
us how these Texts have bin abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to strange and unmeant Allegories,
which have mentioned any naturall
truth in such a manner as was not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to mens conceits. And besides, if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20652:154"/>
the Holy Ghost had propounded unto
us any secrets in Philosophie, we should
have bin apt to be so busied about them,
as to neglect other matters of greater
importance. And therefore Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
proposing the question,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 9.</note> what should be
the reason, Why the Scripture do's not
cleerely set down any thing concerning
the Nature, Figure, Magnitude, and
Motion of the Heavenly Orbes; hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
it thus: The Holy Ghost being to
deliver more necessarie Truths, would
not insert these, lest men according to
the varietie of their dispositions, should
neglect the more weighty matters, and
bestow their thoughts about the specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
naturall points, which were lesse
needfull. So that it might seeme more
convenient, that the Scripture should
not meddle with the revealing of these
unlikely Secrets, especially when it is to
deliver unto us many other mysteries
of greater necessitie, which seeme to be
directly opposite to our sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And therefore, I say, the holy Ghost
might purposely omit the treating of
these Philosophicall Secrets, till time
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20652:154"/>
and future discoverie, might with lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
settle them in the opinion of
others: As he is pleased in other things
of a higher kind, to apply himselfe unto
the infirmitie of our apprehensions, by
being represented, as if hee were a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, with the parts and passions
of a man. So in these things likewise,
that he might descend to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
do's he vouchsafe to conforme his
expressions unto the errour and mistake
of our judgements.</p>
                     <p>But before we come to a further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
let us a little examine those
particular Scriptures, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
urged to prove the motion of the
Sun or Heavens. These (as was said)
might be distributed under these three
heads.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Those places which mention the
rising or setting of the Sunne, as that in
the</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 19. 5. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Psalme,</hi> The Sun like a Bridegroome
commeth out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as
agyant to runne his race: His going forth is
from the end of Heaven, and his circuit unto
the end of it, and there is nothing hid from
the heate thereof. <hi>And that in</hi> Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20652:155"/>
The Sunne ariseth, and the Sunne goeth
downe,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which Scriptures, we may observe
divers phrases that are evidently spoken
in reference to the appearance of
things, and the false opinion of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
And therefore 'tis not altogether
unlikely, That this, which they seem to
affirme concerning the motion of the
Heavens, should also bee understood in
the same sence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sun like a Bridegroome commeth out
of his chamber;</hi> alluding perhaps unto the
conceit of ignorant people: as if it took
rest all the while it was absent from us,
and came out of it's chamber, when it
arose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And reioyceth as a Gyant to run his race;</hi>
because in the Morning it appeares
bigger than at other times; and therfore
in reference to this appearance, may
then be compared unto a <hi>Giant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His going forth is from the end of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and his circuit unto the ends of it.</hi> Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
againe unto the opinion of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
who not apprehending the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Heavens, doe conceive it to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20652:155"/>
have two ends: one where the Sun riseth,
the other where it setteth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And there is nothing bid from the heate
thereof,</hi> speaking still in reference to the
common mistake, as if the Sunne were
actually hot in it self; and as if the heate
of the weather were not generated by
reflection, but did immediately proceed
from the body of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>So likewise, for that in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
where 'tis said, <hi>the Sun riseth, and the Sun
goeth downe,</hi> &amp;c. which phrases being
properly understood, doe import that he
is sometimes in a higher place than at
others: whereas, in a circumference,
there is no place higher or lower, each
part being at the same distance from the
centre, which is the bottome. But now
understand the phrase in reference to
the Suns appearance, and then we grant
that he do's seem sometimes to rise, and
sometimes to go downe, because in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Horizon, (which common
people apprehend to bee the bottome,
and in the utmost bounds of it to joyne
with the heavens,) the Sun do's appeare
in the Morning to rise up from it, and in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20652:156"/>
the Evening to goe down unto it. Now
I say, because the Holy Ghost, in the
manner of these expressions, do's so
plainly allude unto vulgar errours, and
the false appearance of things: therefore
'tis not without probabilitie, that hee
should be interpreted in the same sence,
when he seemes to imploy a motion in
the Sun or Heavens.</p>
                     <p>2 The second place, was that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Iosuah:</hi> where 'tis mentioned as a
miracle. That the Sunne did stand still.
And <hi>Iosuah</hi> said,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ios. 10. 12, 14 Galilaeus</hi> maintaines the literall sense of this place: towards the end of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, which hee calls <hi>Nov-Antiq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat. doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Sunne stand thou still upon
Gibeon, and thou Moone in the valley of
Ajalon. So the Sun stood still in the midst of
Heaven, and hasted not to goe downe about a
whole day. And there was no day like that,
before it or after it.</hi> In which place like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
there are divers phrases wherin the
Holy Ghost do's not expresse things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their true nature, and as they
are in themselves: but according to their
appearances, and as they are conceived
in common opinion. As,</p>
                     <p>1 When he sayes, <hi>Sun stand thou still
upon Gibeon,</hi> or over <hi>Gibeon.</hi> Now the
whole Earth being so little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20652:156"/>
to the body of the Sun, and but as a
point, in respect of that Orbe wherein
the Sun is supposed to move, and <hi>Gibeon</hi>
being, as it were, but a point of this
Globe of Earth: therefore the words
cannot be understood properly, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to appearance.<note place="margin">Tostat. in locum, Quaest. 16. 17.</note> 'Tis probable
that <hi>Iosuah</hi> was then at <hi>Azecha,</hi> a little
East from <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Sunne being
somewhat beyond the Meridian,<note place="margin">Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus in locum.</note> did
seeme unto him as he was in that place,
to bee over against <hi>Gibeon;</hi> and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this appearance, and vulgar
conceit, do's hee command it to stand
still upon that place.</p>
                     <p>2 And so secondly for that other
expression; <hi>And thou Moone in the valley
of Ajalon.</hi> This Planet was now a little
East from the Sun, it being about three
or foure dayes old (as<note n="†" place="margin">Tostat. ib. Quaest. 18. Serrarius in Iosh. 10. Quaes. 21. 22.</note> Commentators
guesse. <hi>Ajalon</hi> was three miles from
<hi>Gibeon</hi> Eastward, and <hi>Iosuah</hi> commanded
the Moone to stand still there: because
unto him it did then seeme to be over
against that valley; whereas, 'tis certaine,
if he had been there himselfe, it would
still have seemed to be as much distant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20652:157"/>
from him. Iust as men commonly speak
in shewing another the Stars: we point
to a Star over such a chimney, or such a
tree, because to us it appeares so; wheras
the Star in it selfe is not sensibly more
over them, than it is over us. So that in
in this phrase likewise the Holy Ghost
doth conforme himselfe unto the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of things, and our grosser con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>And the Sun stood still in the midst of
Heaven.</hi> Now to speake properly, and as
the thing is in it selfe, Heaven ha's no
midst but the centre; and therefore, this
also must be interpreted in reference to
the opinion of the vulgar, and by the
midst of Heaven, wee are to understand
such a place as was not very neere to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the ends, the East or West.</p>
                     <p>4 <hi>And there was no day like that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it or after it:</hi> which words are not to
be understood absolutely, for there are
alwaies longer daies under the Poles:
but in respect to the opinion of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
that is, there was never any day so
long which these ignorant people
knew of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:20652:157"/>
3 As for this last place concerning
the Sunnes returning ten degrees in the
diall of <hi>Ahaz:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. King. 20. 11.</note> I thinke it may probably
be affirmed, That it is to be understood
only concerning the shadow:<note place="margin">Isai. 38. 8.</note> which
though it doe necessarily happen in
all horizontall dialls, for any latitude
betwixt the Tropickes: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in all declining dialls, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of whose Pole is lesse than the
Sunnes greatest declination; as <hi>Clavius
de Horol. cap.</hi> 21. observes: yet the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of this relation in scripture,
makes the event to differ from that other
which is common and naturall: which
against it's nature did seem to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when as the Sunne it selfe was
not in the least manner altered from it's
usuall course. Of this opinion were
<hi>Abarbinell; Arius Montanus, Burgensis,
Vatablas Sanctius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The reasons for it may be these;</p>
                     <p>1 The miracle is proposed onely
concerning the shadow; <hi>Wilt thou that
the shadow shall ascend or returne by ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:</hi>
there being not in the offer of
this wonder, any the least mention
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20652:158"/>
made concerning the Sunnes going
backwards.</p>
                     <p>2 'Tis likely wee should have had
some intimation concerning the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
length of the day, as it is in
that of <hi>Iosuah;</hi> but in this relation, the
chiefe matter that the story takes notice
of, is the alteration of the shadow.</p>
                     <p>3 Had it been by the supposed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of the Sunnes body, this had been
a greater miracle then those which were
performed upon more solemne occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it had been more wonderfull then
it's seeming rest in <hi>Iosuahs</hi> time; then the
supernaturall Eclipse at our Saviours
death, when the Moone was in the full.
And then it is not likely, that the Holy
Ghost in relating of this miracle,
should chiefly insist in expressing how
the shadow returned, and that onely in
the diall of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 This Figure did not appeare in
the Sun it selfe; because in the 2. <hi>Chron.
32.</hi> 31. 'Tis said, that <hi>the Embassadors of
the king of Babylon did come unto Hezekiah,
to enquire of the wonder that was done in the
land;</hi> and therefore it seems the miracle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20652:158"/>
did not consist in any change of the
Heavens.</p>
                     <p>5 If it had been in the Sunne, it
would have been as well discerned in
other parts of the world, as in the land
of Iudaea. And then,</p>
                     <p>1 What need the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>
send thither to enquire after it? If you
reply, because it was occasioned by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
recoverie; I answer, 'tis not likely
that the heathens would ever beleeve so
great a miracle should bee wrought
meerly for a signe of one mans recovery
from a disease. But would either be apt
to thinke that it was done for some
more remarkable purpose, and that by
some of their owne gods, unto whom
they attributed a far greater power, than
unto any other. 'Tis more probable, that
they might heare some flying rumour of
a miracle that was seene in Iudaea:
which because it happened only in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi>
house and diall; and that too up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his recoverie from a dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they might be more apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that it was a signe of it.</p>
                     <p>2 Why have we no mention made
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20652:159"/>
of it in the writings of the Antients? It
is no way likely, that so great a miracle
as this was (if it were in the Sun) should
have been passed over in silence; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
since it happened in those later
times, when there were many heathen
writers that flourished in the world,
<hi>Hesiod, Archilochus, Symonides;</hi> and not
long after, <hi>Homer,</hi> with divers others; and
yet none of them have the least mention
of any such prodigie. Wee have many
relations of matters that were lesse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
which were done about that
time; the Historie of <hi>Numa Pompilius,
Gyges;</hi> the fight betwixt the three Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
with divers such stories. And 'tis
scarse credible, that this should have
been omitted amongst the rest.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we have (as many guesse) some
hints from prophane antiquitie, of the
miracle wrought by <hi>Iosuah.</hi> Vnto which,
'tis thought the Antients did allude in
the fable of <hi>Phaëton;</hi> when the Sun was
so irregular in his course, that hee burnt
some part of the world. And question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
then, this which happened in later
times, would not have been so wholly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20652:159"/>
forgotten. 'Tis an Argument urged
by<note n="*" place="margin">Tractat 35. in Mat.</note> 
                        <hi>Origen,</hi> That the Eclipse at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Passion was not universall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no prophane author of those times
mentions it. Which consequence is
the very same with that which is urged
in this other case; but by the way, his
antecedent was false, since<note n="†" place="margin">Apologet. cap. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi>
affirmes, That it was recorded amongst
the Romane <hi>Annels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as for that story in <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note>
where after he had related the flight of
<hi>Senacherib,</hi> he tels us, how the Sunne did
foure times in the space of 10340 yeres
invert his course, and rise in the West;
which would seeme so unto other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if he had only returned, as many
conclude, from this Scripture. As for
this story, (I say) it cannot well bee ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as pertinent to the present busines,
because it seems to have reference unto
times that never were.</p>
                     <p>So that all these things being well
considered, we shall find it more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that this miracle doth consist in the
returne of the shadow.</p>
                     <p>If you object,<note place="margin">Isa. 38. 8. Ionah. 4. 8.</note> That the Scripture
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20652:160"/>
do's expresly say, <hi>the Sunne it selfe returned
tenne degrees;</hi> I answer, 'tis a frequent
manner of speech in Scripture, to put
the cause for the effect; as that in <hi>Ionas,</hi>
Where 'tis said,<note place="margin">Ion. 4. 8.</note> That <hi>the Sunne did beat
upon the head of Ionas;</hi> that is, the beames
of the Sunne.<note place="margin">Psal. 121. 6.</note> So that of the <hi>Psalmist,
The Sunne shall not smite thee by day,</hi> that
is, the heate which proceeds from the
Sunnes reflection. In the same sence
may the phrase bee understood in this
place; and the Sunne may be said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe, because the light, which
is the effect of it, did seeme to doe so; or
rather, because the shadow, which is
the effect of that, did change it's
course.</p>
                     <p>This later Scripture then, will not at
all make to the present purpose: as for
those of the two former kinds, I have
alreadie answered, That they are spoken
in reference to the appearance of
things, and vulgar opinion. For the
further illustration of which, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to confirme these two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p>1 That the Holy Ghost in many
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20652:160"/>
other places of Scripture, do's accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
his expressions unto the errour
of our conceits: and do's not speake
of divers things as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but as they appeare unto us.
Therefore 'tis not unlikely, that these
phrases also may bee liable unto the
same interpretation.</p>
                     <p>2 That divers men have fallen
into great absurdities, whilest they
have looked for the grounds of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
from the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and therefore it may bee dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in this point also, to adhere
so closely unto the Letter of the
Text.</p>

                        <hi>Vallesius.</hi> 
                        <q>There are sundry
things in holy Writ concerning natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
points, which most men think are
not so to be understood, as if the Holy
Ghost did intend to unfold unto us
any thing in that kinde: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring

all to the salvation of our

to common opinion. And a
little after, <hi>Ego, divina haec eloquia,</hi> &amp;c.
I for my part am persuaded, that these
divine Treatises were not written by
the holy and inspired pen-men, for the
interpretation of Philosophy, because
God left such things to be found out
by mens labour and industrie. But yet
whatsoever is in them concerning na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is most true: as proceeding from

all those things which the Scripture

wherein they were first intended; but
now that it do's speake somtimes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

was intimated before; wherfore (by

                        <hi>Fromondus</hi> his triumph upon
the later part of this quotation, is but
vaine, and to no purpose. 'Tis a good rule
set downe by a learned<note n="†" place="margin">Sanctius in Isa. 13. 5. Item in Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. lib. 9. num. 45.</note> Commentator,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20652:162"/>
to bee observed in the interpretation of
Scripture: <hi>Scriptura sacra saepè non tam ad
veritatem ipsam, quam ad hominum opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
sermonem acommodat;</hi> that it do's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times accommodate it's expressions,
not so much to the truth it selfe, as to
mens opinions. And in this sence is that
speech of <hi>Gregorie</hi> concerning Images
and Pictures, attributed by<note n="*" place="margin">Comment. in Gen. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Calvin</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Librum esse ideotarum,</hi> that it is a Booke
for the simpler and ignorant people. For
it being written to informe them, as well
as others, 'tis requisite that it should use
the most plaine and easie expressions.
To this purpose likewise is that of
<note n="†" place="margin">In Gen. c. 1, v. 10. art. 6</note> 
                        <hi>Mersennus, Mille sunt Scripturae loca,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>There are very many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are not to bee interpreted
according to the Letter;<note place="margin">Vide Hiero. in Ier. 28. Aquinas in Iob. 26. 7.</note> and that for
this reason, because God would apply
himselfe unto our capacity and sence:</q>
                        <hi>Presertim in ijs, quae adres naturales, oculis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
subject as pertinent;</hi> more especially
in those things which concerne nature,
and are subject to our eyes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the very same place, though hee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20652:162"/>
be eager enough against <hi>Copernicus,</hi> yet
hee concludes that opinion not to be a
heresie; because (saith he) those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which seeme to oppose it, are not
so evident, but that they may bee capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of another interpretation: Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that it was not unlikely they
should be understood in reference to
outward appearance and common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
And that this manner of speech is
frequently used in many other places
of scripture, may be easily manifest from
these following examples. Thus though
the Moone may be prooved by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
observation, to bee lesse than any of
the visible Stars, yet because of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and vulgar opinion, therefore
doth the Scripture in comparison to
them,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 16.</note> call it one of the great Lights.<note place="margin">Psal. 136. 7.</note> Of
which place, saith <hi>Calvin, Moses populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
scripsit, nos potius respexit quam sydera.
Moses</hi> did not so much regard the nature
of the thing, as our capacitie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
uses a popular phrase: so as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
people without the help of Arts and
Learning, might easily understand him;
And in another place, <hi>Non fuit Spiritus
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20652:163"/>
Sancti concilium Astrologiam docere:</hi> 
                        <q>It was
not the purpose of the Holy Ghost to
teach us Astronomy:<note place="margin">Comment. in Psa. 136.</note> but being to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a Doctrine, that concernes the
most rude and simple people, hee do's
(both by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himself unto their phrases and
conceits: lest any should thinke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
his owne ignorance with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of difficultie: As men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do in those things which are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after a learned and sublime man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>
Thus <hi>Zanchi</hi>

rationem habuit nostri humaníque ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicij,</hi>
&amp;c. <q>When <hi>Moses</hi> calls the Moon
a great light: he had a more especiall
reference to mens opinions of it, than
to the truth of the thing it self, because
he was to deale with such, who do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
judge rather by their sense, than
by their reason.</q> Nor will that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Fromondus</hi> and others avoid
this interpretation, when he tells us of
<hi>magnum Materiale:</hi> which referres to the
bulke and quantitie of the body; and
<hi>magnum Formale,</hi> which imports the
greatnesse of it's light. For we grant, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20652:163"/>
it is really unto us a greater light then
any of the Stars, or than all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
yet there is not any one of them,
but is in it's selfe a bigger light than
this; And therefore when wee say this
speech is to be understood according to
it's appearance, we do not oppose this to
reality: But 'tis implied, that this reality
is not absolute, and in the nature of the
thing it selfe, but only relative, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to us. I may say a candle is a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
light then a Star, or the Moone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is really so to me. How ever any
one will thinke this to be spoken, onely
in relation to it's appearance, and not to
be understood as if the thing were so in
it selfe. But (by the way) it do's concerne
<hi>Fromondus</hi> to maintaine the Scriptures
authority,<note place="margin">De Meteor. lib. 4. cap. 2. art. 5.</note> in revealing of natural secrets;
because, from thence it is that he fetches
the chiefe Argument for that strange
Assertion of his, concerning the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the winde;<note place="margin">Iob, 28. 25.</note> Where <hi>Iob sayes,</hi> that
<hi>God makes the weight for the winde.</hi> Thus
likewise, because the common people
usually thinke the rain to proceed from
some waters in the <hi>expansum:</hi> therefore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20652:164"/>
doth <hi>Moses</hi> in reference to this errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conceit, tell us of waters above the
Firmament, and the Windowes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:<note place="margin">Comment. in Psal, 148. 4.</note>
Of which saith <hi>Calvin, Nimis servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
literae se astringunt.</hi> &amp;c. <q>Such men
too servilely tye themselves unto the
letter of the text, who hence conclude,
that there is a Sea in the Heavens:
when as we know that <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets, to accommodate themselv's
unto the capacitie of ruder people, do
use a vulgar expression; and therefore
it would be a preposterous course, to
reduce their phrases unto the exact
rules of Philososophy.</q> Let me adde,
that from this mistake, 'tis likely did
arise that groundlesse observation of
the antient Iewes; who would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any to read the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
till he was arrived to thirty yeres of age.
The true reason of which, was this: not
because that Booke was harder than any
other; but because <hi>Moses</hi> conforming
his expression to vulgar conceits, and
they examining of them by more
exact rules of Philosophy, were faine
to force upon them many strange
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20652:164"/>
Allegories, and unnaturall Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>Thus also, because for the most part
we conceive the Starres to be innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
therefore doth the Holy Ghost
often speak of them in reference to this
opinion.<note place="margin">Ier. 35. 22.</note> So <hi>Ieremy, As the hoast of Heaven
cannot be numbred, neither the sand of the
Sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of
David:</hi> So likewise when God would
comfort <hi>Abraham</hi> with the promise of
a numberlesse posterite, hee bids him
looke up to Heaven, and tells him, that
his Seed should be like those Stars for
number:<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 5.</note> Which, saith<note n="*" place="margin">In 1. cap. Sphaerae.</note> 
                        <hi>Clavius, Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum

is to be understood according to the
common opinion of the vulgar, who
think the Stars to be of an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
whilest they behold them all (as
they seeme confused) in a cleere night.
And though many of our Divines doe
commonly interpret this speech to be a
<hi>Hyperbole;</hi> yet being well considered, we
shall finde that <hi>Abrahams</hi> posteritie, in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20652:165"/>
some few generations, were farre more
than there are visible Starres in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament;
and of such onely do's God
speake, because hee bids <hi>Abraham</hi> looke
up to the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>Now all these, even unto six differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Magnitude, are reckoned to bee
but 1022. True indeed, at the first view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Heavens, it may seeme an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
thing, that they should be of no
greater a number; but the reason of this
is, because they appeare scattered and
confused: so that the eye cannot place
them in any such order, as to reckon
them up, or take any distinct surveigh of
of them.<note place="margin">Sir. <hi>Fr. Bac.</hi> table of colours, <hi>num.</hi> 5.</note> Now 'tis a knowne truth, <hi>Quod
fortius operatur pluralit as partium, ubi ordo
abest; nam inducit similitudinem infiniti, &amp;
impedit comprehensionem:</hi> That a pluralitie
of Parts without order, ha's a more
strong operation, because it ha's a kinde
of seeming infinitie, and so hinders
comprehension. And then besides, there
are more appearances of Starres many
times, than there are bodies of them; For
the eye, by reason of it's weakenesse and
disabilitie, to discerne any thing at so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20652:165"/>
great a distance; as also, because of those
beames which proceed from such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
bodies in a twinkling and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
manner, and so mixe and confound
themselves at their entrance into that
Organ: it must needs receive more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
than there are true bodies.
But now, if a man doe but leisurely and
distinctly compare the Stars of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with those of this number, that are
noted in a Coelestiall Globe, hee shall
scarse find any in the Skie which are
not marked with the Globe; nay, he may
observe many in the Globe, which hee
can scarse at all discerne in the heavens.</p>
                     <p>Now this number of the Starres is
commonly distributed into 48 Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
in each of which, though wee
should suppose tenne thousand Starres,
(which can scarse be conceived) yet
would not all this number equall that
of the children of Israel. Nay, 'tis the
assertion of <hi>Clavins,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In prim. ca. Sphaerae.</note> that <hi>Abrahams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
in some few generations, were
farre more then there could be Stars in
the Firmament, though they stucke so
close that they touched one another:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20652:166"/>
And he proves it thus: A great circle in
the Firmament, do's containe the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of a Starre of the first Magnitude
14960 times. In the diameter of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
there are contained 4760 dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
of such a Star: now if wee multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this circumference by a diameter,
the Quotient will be 71209600, which
is the full number of Starres, that the
eighth Sphaere (according to <hi>Ptolomies</hi>
grounds,) would containe, if they stood
so close, that they touched one another.</p>
                     <p>The children of Israel were reckoned
at their going out of Aegypt,<note place="margin">Num. 1. 46.</note> 603550, of
such as were one and twenty yeares old,
and upwards, and were able to go to war;
besides children, &amp; women, and youths,
and old men, and the Levites; which in
probabilitie, did alwaies treble the other
number. Now if they were so many at
one time, we may well conceive, that in
all those severall generations, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and since, the number was much
augmented; and long before this time,
did far exceed this supposed multitude
of the Stars. From all which, wee may
inferre, that the Scripture expressions in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20652:166"/>
this kind, are to be understood acording
to appearance and common opinion.</p>
                     <p>Another place usually cited for the
same purpose, to shew that the Holy
Ghost do's not speake exactly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
naturall secrets;<note place="margin">1. Kin. 7. 23. 2. Chro. 4. 2.</note> as that in the <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which relates unto us the
measure of <hi>Solomons</hi> brazen Sea, whose
diameter was ten cubites, and it's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
thirty; whereas to speake
Geometrically, the more exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt the diameter and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
is not as ten to thirty, but
rather as seven to twenty two.</p>
                     <p>But against this 'tis<note n="*" place="margin">Ross. lib. 1. sect. 1. c. 8.</note> objected by
our adversaries,</p>
                     <p>1 This Sea was not perfectly round,
but rather inclining to a semicircular
Forme, as<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq. Iud. lib. 8. cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> affirmes.</p>
                     <p>I reply: If it were so, yet this is so
much from helping the matter, that it
makes it much worse; for then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
will be far greater.</p>
                     <p>But secondly, Scripture, which is to
be beleeved before <hi>Iosephus,</hi> do's tell us
in expresse tearms, that it was round all
about, 1. <hi>Kings,</hi> 7. 23.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:20652:167"/>
2 The proportion of the diameter
to the circumference,<note place="margin">Ross. ibid.</note> is not exactly the
same: as seven to two and twenty, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lesse. I answer, though it be, yet 'tis
neerer unto that, then any other number.</p>
                     <p>3 The scripture do's but according
to it's usuall custome,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> suppresse the lesse
number, and mention only that which is
bigger and more full. So in some<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 15. 13 Acts, 7. 6.</note> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Abrahams</hi> posteritie is said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the land of Aegypt for foure
hundred yeares; when as notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 12. 41.</note> other scriptures tell us, that they
tarried there thirty yeares longer.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> Thus
likewise in one<note n="*" place="margin">Gen 46. 27.</note> place, the number of
<hi>Iacobs</hi> house, who came into Egypt, is
reckoned to be seventy; whereas,<note place="margin">Acts, 7. 14.</note> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
they are said to be seventy five.</p>
                     <p>I answer: All this is so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the force of the present Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it do's rather confirme it, and
more cleerely evidence unto us, that the
Scripture do's not only, not speak exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in these subtle and more secret points
of Philosophy, but also, in the ordinarie
obvious numbring of things, do's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
unto common custome, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20652:167"/>
often use the round number for the
whole.</p>
                     <p>4 'Tis yet objected by<note n="†" place="margin">Fromond. Vesta. 4. tract. 3. c. 2.</note> another
adversarie, That wee have no reason to
expect, the Holy Ghost should reveale
unto us this secret in Nature; because
neither <hi>Archimedes,</hi> nor any other, had
then found it out. I reply, and why
then should we thinke that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
must needs informe us of the
Earths Motion; when as neither <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
nor <hi>Copernicus,</hi> nor any else, had
then discovered it?</p>
                     <p>5 In taking the compasse of this
vessell,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> they measured somewhat below
the brim, where it was narrower than at
the top, and so the circumference there,
might bee exactly but thirty cubites;
whereof it's diameter was ten.</p>
                     <p>I answer: 'tis evident this is a meere
shift, there being not the least ground
for it in the Text. And then besides, why
might not we affirme, That the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was measured from that place, as wel
as the circumference? since 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the Holy Ghost did speak ad
idem; and not tell us the bredth of one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20652:168"/>
place, and the compasse of another. So
that all our adversaries evasions cannot
well avoid the force of the Argument
that is taken from this Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Again, common people usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Earth to be such a plaine, as in
it's utmost parts is terminated by the
Heavens, so that if a man were in the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermost
coasts of it, hee might touch
the skie. And hence also, they think that
the reason why some countries are hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than others, is, because they lie nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
unto the Sun. Nay, <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us of
some Philosophers too, who in this
point have grossely erred; affirming, that
there was a place towards the utmost
coasts of <hi>Lusitania,</hi> where a man might
heare the noise that the Sunne made, as
he quencht his Beames in his descent
to the Ocean; which, though it be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
mistake, yet we may note, that the
Holy Ghost in the expression of these
things, is pleased to conforme himselfe
unto such kinde of vulgar and false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits;
And therefore, often speaks of the
<note n="*" place="margin">Psa. 19. 6. Mat. 24. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>ends of Heaven,</hi> and the<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ps.</hi> 22. 27, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>ends of the
world.</hi> In this sence, they that come from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20652:168"/>
any far countrey, are said to come from
the <hi>end of Heaven, Isaiah,</hi> 13. 5. And in
another place, <hi>From the side of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Deut.</hi> 4. 32. All which phrases, doe
plainly allude unto the errour of vulgar
capacities (saith <hi>Sanctius)</hi> which hereby
is better instructed,<note n="†" place="margin">Comment. in Isa. 13. 5.</note> then it would be by
more proper expressions.</p>
                     <p>Thus likewise, because ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot well apprehend how so great
a weight as the Sea and Land, should
hang alone in the open aire, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded upon some <hi>Basis</hi> to uphold
it: therefore in this respect also, do's
Scripture apply it selfe unto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,<note place="margin">Iob. 38. 4.</note>
where it often mentions the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 102. 25.</note> Which phrase, in
the letter of it, do's manifestly allude
unto mens imaginations in this kinde.</p>
                     <p>Thus also the common people usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceive the Earth to be upon the
Water; because, when they have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
any way as farre as they can, they are
at length stopped by the sea. Therefore
doth Scripture in reference to this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,<note place="margin">Psal. 136. 6.</note>
That <hi>God stretched the Earth upon
the Waters,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>founded the Earth upon the Seas,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20652:169"/>
and established it upon the Flouds;</hi> Of
which places saith <hi>Calvin, Non disputat
Philosophicè David, de terrae situ; sed popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariter
loquens, ad rudium captum se accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modat:</hi>
'Twas not <hi>Davids</hi> intent to speak
philosophically concerning the Earths
scituation; but rather, by using a popular
phrase, to accommodate his speech unto
the capacities of the ruder people.</p>
                     <p>In this sence likewise, are wee to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all those places of Scripture,
wherein the coasts of Heaven are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
from the relations of Before,
Behinde, the right hand, or the left.
Which do not imply (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Subtil. Exercit. 67.</note> 
                        <hi>Scaliger)</hi>
any absolute difference in such places,
but are spoken meerely in reference to
mens estimations, and the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those people, for whom the
Scriptures were first penned. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was the opinion of the Iewish
Rabbies, that man was created with his
face to the East; therefore the Hebrew
word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, signifies <hi>Ante,</hi> or the East; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Sinistra,</hi> or the North. You
may see all of them put together in that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20652:169"/>
place of <hi>Iob, Behold I goe forward, and he is
not there,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 23. 8. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and backward, but I cannot perceive
him; on the left hand, where he doth work, but
I cannot behold him. He hideth himselfe on
the right hand, that I cannot see him.</hi> Which
expressions, are by some interpreters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
unto the foure coasts of Heaven,
according to the common use of those
originall words. From hence it is, that
many of the Antients have concluded
hell to be in the North, which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the left hand: unto which side
our Saviour tels us,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 33.</note> that the Goats shall
be divided. Which opinion, likewise
seems to be favoured by that place in
<hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob, 26. 6, 7.</note> where 'tis said, <hi>Hell is naked before God,
and destruction hath no covering.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
'tis added, <hi>Hee stretched out the
North over the empty place.</hi> Vpon these
grounds, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> interprets that speech
of the Preacher, <hi>Eccles. 11. 3. If the tree
fals towards the South, or towards the North,
in the place where the tree falleth, there shal it
be.</hi> Concerning those who shal go either
to heaven or hell. And in this sence also
do's some expound that of <hi>Zachary,</hi> 14. 4
Where 'tis said, <hi>that the mount of Olives
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20652:170"/>
shall cleere in the midst; halfe of it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
towards the North, and halfe of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South.</hi> By which is intimated,
that amongst those Gentiles, who shall
take upon them the profession of Christ,
there are two sorts; Some that go to the
North, that is to Hell; and others to the
South, that is to Heaven. And therefore
it is (say they) that God so<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 1. 14. 15. item ca. 4. 6. 6. 1.</note> often threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
evill out of the North; and upon
this ground it is (saith<note n="†" place="margin">Li. de nat. popul. ca. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Besoldus)</hi> that
there is no Religion that worships that
way. We read of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> that
they adore towards the South; the <hi>Iewes</hi>
towards the West; <hi>Christians</hi> towards
the East, but none to the North.</p>
                     <p>But of this onely by the way. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
certaine it is that the Holy Ghost
do's frequently in Scripture set forth
the severall coasts of Heaven by those
relative tearmes of right hand and left
hand, &amp;c. which expressions doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
any reall intrinsicall difference
betwixt those places, but are rather fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the apprehension of those men,
from whose fancy it is that they have
such denominations.<note n="*" place="margin">De Coelo, lib. 2 cap. 2.</note> And though <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:20652:170"/>
concludes these severall positions
to be naturall unto the Heavens, yet his
authoritie in this particular is not
available, because he delivers it upon a
wrong ground, supposing the Orbs to be
living creatures, and assisted with intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences.
Wee may observe, that the
meaning of these coasts by the relations
of right hand and left hand, &amp;c. is so far
from having any ground in the nature of
those severall places, that these relations
are not onely variously applyed unto
them by divers religions (as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,)
but also by divers Arts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.
Thus because <hi>Astronomers</hi> make
their observations towards the South
parts of the Horizon, where there bee
most Stars that rise and set: therefore do
they account the West to be at their
right hand, and the East their left. The
<hi>Cosmographers</hi> in taking the latitude of
places, and reckoning their severall cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
must looke towards the North
Pole; and therefore, in their phrase, by
the right hand is meant the East; and by
the left hand, the West: and thus (saith
<hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">De placit. Philos. li. 2. cap. 10.</note> are we to understand these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20652:171"/>
in <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle.</hi>
The Poets count the South to bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the left, and the North the right
hand. Thus<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucan</hi> speaking of the

<q>
                           <l>Ignotum vobis Arabes venistis in orbem:</l>
                           <l>Vmbras mirati nemorum, nonire sinistras.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Augures</hi> taking their observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at the East, count the South to be at
their right hand, and the North their
left: So that these denominations have
not any reall ground in the nature of the
things, but are imposed upon them by
the Scripture phrase, in reference to the
account and opinion of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>

together with the generalitie of
our later Physitians,) because they are

of that part, and recovered by
medicines applyed unto it.</p>
                     <p>So likewise are wee to understand
those other places: <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 59. 5. where
some translations reade it, <hi>Ova Aspidum
ruperunt,</hi> they have broken the Vipers
eggs; alluding to that common but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
story of the Viper, who breakes
his passage through the bowells of the
female. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 4, 5. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
speaks of the deafe Adder, <hi>that stops
her eares against the voice of the charmer.</hi>
Both which relations (if we may beleeve
many naturalists) are as false as they are
common: and yet because they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
with the generall opinion of
those days, therfore doth the holy Ghost
vouchsafe to allude unto them in Holy
Writ.<note place="margin">Vesta Trac. 3. cap. 3.</note> 'Tis a plaine mistake of <hi>Fromon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
when in answer to these places, he is
feigne to say, that they are used prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially
only, and doe not positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing. For when <hi>David</hi> writes
these words, that they are <hi>like the deafe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20652:172"/>
Adder which stoppeth her eares,</hi> &amp;c. This
affirmation is manifestly implyed, That
the deafe Adder do's stop her eares
against the voice of the charmer: which
because it is not true in the letter of it,
(as was said before) therefore 'tis very
probable, that it should bee interpreted
in the same sence wherein here it is
cited.</p>
                     <p>In reference to this also, wee are to
conceive of those other expressions;
<hi>Cold commeth out of the North, Iob,</hi> 37. 9.
and againe, <hi>faire weather comes out of the
North, ver.</hi> 22. So <hi>ver. 17. thy garments are
quieted when he warmeth the Earth by the
South winde.</hi> And <hi>Prov. 25. 23. The North
wind driveth away raine.</hi> Which phrases
do not containe in them any absolute
generall truth, but can so farre only bee
verified, as they are referred to generall
climates: and though unto us who live
on this side of the Line, the North wind
be coldest and driest; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the South wind moist and warme, by
reason that in one of these places there
is a stronger heate of the Sun to exhale
moist vapors, than in the other: yet it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20652:172"/>
clean otherwise with the inhabitants
beyond the other Tropicke; for there
the North wind is the hotest, and moist,
and the South the coldest and dry: So
that with them, these Scriptures cannot
properly bee affirmed, that <hi>cold or that
faire weather commeth out of the North;</hi> but
rather on the contrary. All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
do's not in the least man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
derogate from the truth of these
speeches, or the omnisciencie of the
speaker: but doe rather shew the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Goodnesse of the blessed
Spirit, in vouchsafing thus to conforme
his Language unto the capacitie of
those people unto whom these speeches
were first directed. In the same sence are
we to understand all those places where
<hi>the Lights of Heaven</hi> are said to be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Ioel, 2. 31. Item c. 3. 15.</note>
                        <hi>and the Constellations not to give their

of their appearance to us; and
therefore, in another place answerable
to these, God sayes, <hi>he will cover the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
and so make the Starres thereof
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20652:173"/>
darke, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37. 2. Which argues, that
they themselves were not deprived of
this light (as those other speeches seem
to imply) but wee.</p>
                     <p>In reference to this likewise are wee
to conceive of those other expressions,
that <hi>the Moone shall blush, and the Sunne bee

appeare so unto us. Thus also <hi>Marke,

is, they shall be so wholly covered from
our sight, as if they were quite fallen
from their wonted places. Or if this bee
understood of their reall Fall, as it may
seeme probable by that place in the
<hi>Revelations, 6. 13. And the Stars of Heaven
fell unto the Earth, even as a Figge-tree ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
her untimely Figges, when she is shaken

not of them that are truly Stars,

the opinion of the unskilfull vulgar
(saith<note n="*" place="margin">Comment, in Isai. cap. 13. 5.</note>

of the same Scripture, sayes: <hi>Hoc de

Interpreters do by no means understand
this of true Starres, but of the Comets
and other fiery Meteors. Though the
falling of these be a naturall event, yet
may it be accounted a strange prodigie,
as well as an Earthquake, and the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Sunne and Moone, which
are mentioned in the verse before.</p>
                     <p>In reference to this, doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

that the cause of these things was

according to their construction, these
phrases are to be understood in relation
unto their ignorance unto whom these
speeches were immediately directed.</p>
                     <p>For this reason is it: Why, though
there be in nature many other causes of

Vnto all these Scriptures, I might
adde that in <hi>Amos,</hi> 5. 8. which speakes
of the Constellation commonly called
the seven Starres; whereas, later discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have found that there are but sixe of

of them being but a deceipt of the eye
arising from their too great neernes; and
if a man try in a cleere night to number
them distinctly, he shall find that there
will sometimes appeare but sixe, and
some times more.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:20652:174"/>
True indeed, the originall word of
this Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, do's not necessarily
imply any such number in it's significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but yet our English translation
renders it the seven Starres; and if it had
been expresly so in the Originall too, it
might have spoken true enough, because
they are usually esteemed of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
And when it had been said, <hi>He made
the seven Stars and Orion,</hi> we might have
easily understood the words thus: Hee
made those Constellations that are
commonly knowne unto us under such
names.</p>
                     <p>From all these Scriptures 'tis cleerly
manifest, that it is a frequent custome
for the Holy Ghost to speake of naturall
things, rather according to their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and common opinion, than the
truth it selfe. Now it is very plaine, and
our enemies themselves do grant it, that
if the World had bin framed according
to the Systeme of <hi>Copernicus,</hi>

                     <p>Wherefore 'tis not improbable, that

                     <p>Vnto what strange absurdities this
false imagination of the learneder <hi>Iewes</hi>
hath exposed them, may be manifest by

it is, that they proove the shin-bone of
<hi>Og</hi> the Giant to bee above three leagues
long;<note place="margin">Schickard. ib. Disp. 6. num. 2.</note> Or (which is a more modest relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that <hi>Moses</hi> being fourteen cubites in
stature, having a Speare tenne Ells in
length, and leaping up ten cubits, could
touch this Giant but on the Ancle. All
which, they can confirme unto you by a
Cabalisticall interpretation of this
story, as it is set downe in Scripture.
Hence it is, that they tell us of all those
strange Beasts which shall be seen at the
comming of the <hi>Messias;</hi> as first, the Ox,
which <hi>Iob</hi> calls <hi>Behemoth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Buxtor. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. Iuda. cap. 36.</note> that every day

                        </gap> upon a thousand hils. If you
aske how this Beast do's to finde pasture
enough, they answer, that hee remaines
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20652:176"/>
constantly in one place, where there is
as much grasse grows up in the night, as
was eaten in the day.</p>
                     <p>They tell us also of a Bird, which was
of that quantitie, that having upon a
time cast an egge out of her neast, there
were beaten down by the fall of it, three
hundred of the tallest Cedars, and no
lesse than threescore villages drowned.
As also of a Frog, as big as a Town capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Many other relations there are, which
containe such horrible absurdities, that
a man cannot well conceive how they
should proceed from reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And all this arising from that
wrong Principle of theirs; That
Scripture did exactly containe in it all
kind of Truths; and that every meaning
was true, which by the Letter of it, or by
Cabalisticall interpretations might be
found out.</p>
                     <p>Now as it hath been with them, so
likewise hath it happened in proportion
unto others: who by a superstitious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
unto the bare words of scripture,
have exposed themselves unto many
strange errours. Thus<note n="*" place="margin">Enarrat. in Gen.</note> S. <hi>Basil</hi> holds,
That next to the Sun, the Moon is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than any of the Stars, because <hi>Moses</hi>

                     <p>Thus others maintaine, That there
are waters properly so called above the
starry Firmament, because of those vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
expressions in Scripture, which in
their literall sence doe mention them.
Of this opinion were many of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,

Where
are those men that can proove the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
to have a sphaericall Forme. The
reason of which was this, Because 'tis
said in one Scripture, <hi>that God stretched
forth the Heavens as a curtain, Psal. 104. 2.

Isai.</hi> 40. 22. And so in that place of the

<hi>a Tent or Tabernacle:</hi> which because
it is not sphaericall, therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

is as evident as demonstration can make
a thing. And therefore,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib 3. Comment. in Galat. ca. 5.</note> S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his

had issued out of the womb; when I did break
up for it my decreed place; and set bars and
doores, and said, hitherto shalt thou come, and
no further, and here shall the pride of thy
waves be staid. <hi>So likewise,</hi> Prov. 8. 29.
God gave to the Sea his decree, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
should not passe his commandement. <hi>And</hi>
Ierem. 5. 22. I have placed the sand for a
bound of the Sea by a perpetuall decree that
they cannot passe it: and though the waves
thereof crosse themselves, yet can they not
prevaile; though they roare, yet can they not
passe over, that they turne not againe to cover
the Earth. <hi>In all which places (say they)
'tis implied, that the water of it selfe,

                     <p>Others inferre the same conclusion
with that in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> where the rivers
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20652:179"/>
are said to come from the Sea; which
they could not doe, unlesse that were
higher. I answer: They should as well
consider the later part of that Scripture,
which sayes, that the Rivers returne to
that place from whence they came, and
then the force of this consequence will
vanish. To this purpose, some urge that
speech of our Saviour, where hee bids
<hi>Simon</hi> to launch forth into the deep;<note place="margin">Luke 5. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> the
Latine word is, <hi>in altum;</hi> from whence,
they gather that the Sea is higher than
the Land. But this savours so much of
Monkish ignorance, that it deserves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be laughed at, than to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
                     <p>But now if we consider the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this Element, according to
the rules of Philosophy: we shall finde,
that it's not overflowing the Land is so
farre from being a miracle, that it is a
necessarie consequence of it's nature;
and 'twould rather be a miracle, if it
should be otherwise, as it was in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
deluge. The reason is, because the
water of it self must necessarily descend
to the lowest place; which it cannot do,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20652:179"/>
unlesse it be collected in a sphaericall
Forme, as you may plainly discerne in
this Figure.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Where the Sea at D. may seeme to
be higher than a mountaine at B, or C.
because the rising of it in the midst do's
so intercept our sight from either of
those places, that wee cannot looke in a
streight line, from the one to the other.
So that it may seem to be no lesse than a
miracle, by which the sea (being a heavy
body) was withheld from flowing down
to those lower places of B, or C. But
now, if you consider that the ascending
of a body is it's motion from the centre,
and descent is it's approaching unto it:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20652:180"/>
you shall find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that for the Sea to moove
from D. to B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or C. is a motion of
Ascent, which is contrary to it's nature,
because the mountaine at B, or C. are
farther off from the centre, than the Sea
at D. the Lines A, B. and A, C. being
longer than the other A, D. So that for
the Sun to keep alwaies in it's channell,
is but agreeable to it's nature, as being
a heavy body. But the meaning of those
Scriptures, is, to set forth the power and
wisedome of God: who hath appointed
these channels for it, and beset it with
such strong banks to withstand the fury
of it's waves. Or if these men doe so
much rely on naturall points, upon the
bare words of Scripture, they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
bee confuted from those other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where God is said to have founded
the Earth upon the Seas, and establisht
it upon the Flouds. From the literall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of which, many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
have fallen into another errour:
affirming the Water to be in the lower
place; and as a <hi>basis,</hi> whereon the weight
of the Earth was borne up. Of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

it is here applyed, is <hi>permanet;</hi> or as we

of generation and corruption, to which
other things in it are liable. And though
<hi>Pineda,</hi> and others, keep a great deale of

yet they grant this to be the naturall
meaning of it: which you may more

                     <p>4 From the Sea; though it bee as

                     <p>From whence it is manifest; that this
constancie or standing of the Earth, is
not opposed to it's locall motion, but to
the changing or passing away of divers

forever; &amp; questionles, if we examine it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20652:183"/>
impartially, we shal find that the phrase
seemes more to favour this absurditie,
than that which our adversaries would
collect from hence; that it is without
motion.</p>
                     <p>But M. <hi>Fuller</hi> urging this text against
<hi>Copernicus;</hi> tells us, if any should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete
these phrases, concerning the
Earth's standing still, <hi>ve.</hi> 4. and the Suns
motion, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. in reference onely to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and common opinion; he must
necessarily also understand those two
other verses, which mention the motion
of the wind and rivers in the same sence.
As if he should say; because some things
appeare otherwise than they are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every thing is otherwise than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares;
or, because Scripture speakes of
some naturall things, as they are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
according to mans false conceit;
therefore 'tis necessarie, that every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
thing mentioned in Scripture, must
be interpreted in the like sence: or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in one place, wee read of the ends
of a Staffe, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 8. 8. and in many
other places of the ends of the Earth,
and the ends of Heaven: Therefore the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20652:184"/>
earth &amp; heavens have as properly ends as
a Staffe. 'Tis the very same consequence
of that in the objection. Because in this
place of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> wee read of the rest
of the Earth, and the motion of the Sun;
therefore, these phrases must needs bee
understood in the same proper constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as those afterwards, where motion
was attributed to the Wind and Rivers.
Which inference you see is so weake,
that the Objector need not triumph so
much in it's strength as he doth.</p>
                     <p>Another proofe like unto this, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from S. <hi>Peter, epist. 2. cap. 3. ver.</hi> 5.

immooveable.</p>
                     <p>I answer: 'tis evident that the word
here is equivolent with <hi>fuit:</hi> and the
scope of the Apostle is, to shew that
God made all the Earth: both that
which was above the water, and that
which was under it. So that from this
expression, to collect the rest and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie

as this other. Such a man made

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those things are immoovable.</p>
                     <p>To such vain and idle consequences
do's the heate of opposition drive our
adversaries.</p>
                     <p>A third Argument stronger than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former, they conceive may

not particularly of our Earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may as well proove the immobility
of the Heavens, they being the greatest
pert of the World; in comparison to
which, our Earth is but as an insensible

                     <p>If you reply, that the word in these

and which is yet more, the same place
do's likewise mention this supposed set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lednesse
of the Earth, <hi>Prov. 3. 19. The
Lord by wisdome hath founded the Earth:
and by understanding hath he established the

more proove an immobilitie in the
Earth than in the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>If you yet reply, That by the Heavens
there is meant the seat of the Blessed,
which do's not moove with the rest.</p>
                     <p>I answer: though by such an evasion a
man might possibly avoid the force of
this place: yet, first, 'tis but a groundlesse
shift, because then, that verse will not
containe a full enumeration of the parts
in the World, as may seeme more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

shew, that God created this Earth where

our adversaries will affirme the Moone,

the very same expressions be counted as
sufficient Arguments to take it away
from the Earth.</p>
                     <p>If it be replyed, That by establishing
the Heavens, is meant only the holding
of them up, that they doe not fall downe
to us (as <hi>Lorinus</hi> explaines that in the

to this sence, is it most frequently
used in Scripture. And therefore, the

                        </gap> the

translate it by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, a seat
or appointed scituation, which may as
well be attributed to the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>The third expression is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> that it

to move; but <hi>declinare,</hi> or <hi>vacillare,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

Thus is it used by <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 17. 5. where

thy foot to bee mooved.</hi> Thus likewise,
<hi>Psal. 16. 8. Because the Lord is at my right
hand, I shall not be moved:</hi> which last place
is translated in the new Testament

<hi>fluctuare,</hi> or <hi>vacillare,</hi> to be shaken by
such an uncertaine motion as the waves

have their usuall motion, and yet in this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20652:188"/>
sence be said not to move, that is, not
to decline or slip aside: so neither can
the same phrase applyed to the Earth,
prove it to be immovable.</p>
                     <p>Nor doe I see any reason, why that of
<hi>Didacus Astunica</hi> may not be truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Comment. in Iob.</note>
That wee may prove the naturall
motion of the Earth, from that place in

as well as it's rest and immobilitie from

                     <p>From all which, it is very evident, that
each of these expressions, concerning
the founding or establishing both of
Heaven or Earth, were not intended to
shew the unmovablenesse of either,
but rather, to manifest the power and
wisedome of Providence, who had so
setled these parts of the World in their
proper scituations, that no naturall
cause could displace them, or make
them decline from their appointed
course. As for such who doe utterly
dislike all new interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
even in such matters as do meerely
concern opinion, and are not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
I would only propose unto them a

                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:20652:190"/>
2 From principles of naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.<note place="margin">LIB. 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 From common appearances in
Astronomy.</p>
                     <p>Those of the first kinde are chiefly
two: The first is grounded on that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Scripture phrase, which speakes of
the Sunne, as being above us. So <hi>Solomon</hi>
often mentioning humane affaires, calls
them,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>the works which are done under the
Sunne.</hi> From whence it appeares that the
Earth is below it; and therefore, neerer
to the centre of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> than the
Sunne.</p>
                     <p>I answer: Though the Sun in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
to the absolute frame of the
World, be in the midst; yet this do's not
hinder, but that in respect to our Earth,
he may be truly said to bee above it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee usually measure the height or
lownesse of every thing, by it's being
further off, or neerer unto this centre of
our Earth. From which, since the Sunne
is so remote, it may properly bee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that wee are under it; though not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that bee in the centre of
the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:20652:190"/>
A second Argument of the same kinde,
is urged by <hi>Fromundus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis requisite,<note place="margin">Antar. c. 12. item Vesta. tract 5. c. 2.</note> that Hell (which is in
the centre of the Earth) should be most
remotely scituated from the seat of the
Blessed. But now this Heaven, which is
the seat of the Blessed, is concentricall
to the starry Sphaere. And therefore it
will follow, that our Earth must bee in
the midst of this Sphaere; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in the centre of the World.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This Argument is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon these uncertainties;</p>
                     <p>1 That Hell must needs bee scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the centre of our Earth.</p>
                     <p>2 That the heaven of the Blessed,
must needs bee concentricall to that of
the Starres.</p>
                     <p>3 That places must bee as farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in scituation as in use:</p>
                     <p>Which because they are taken for
granted, without any proofe, and are in
themselves but weake and doubtfull:
therefore the conclusion (which alwaies
followes the worser part) cannot bee
strong, and so will not need any other
answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:20652:191"/>
The second sort of Arguments taken
from naturall Philosophy, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
these three:</p>
                     <p>1 First,<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> from the vilenesse of our
Earth, because it consists of a more for
did and base matter than any other part
of the World; and therefore, must bee
scituated in the centre, which is the
worst place, and at the greatest distance
from those purer incortuptible bodies,
the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This Argument do's sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
such propositions for grounds,
which are not yet prooved; and therfore
not to be granted. As,</p>
                     <p>1 That bodies must bee as farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in place, as in Nobilitie.</p>
                     <p>2 That the Earth is a more ignoble
substance than any of the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
consisting of a more base and vile
matter.</p>
                     <p>3 That the centre is the worst place.</p>
                     <p>All which, are (if not evidently false)
yet very uncettaine.</p>
                     <p>2 From the nature of the centre;<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note>
which is the place of rest, and such as in
all circular motions, is it's selfe immoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20652:191"/>
And theresore will be the fittest
scituation for rhe Earth; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it's heavinesse, is naturally unfit
for motion.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This Argument likewise is
grounded upon these two foolish foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
As,</p>
                     <p>1 That the whole Frame of Nature
do's moove round, excepting onely the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>2 That the whole Earth, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in it's whole, and in it's proper place,
is heavy; or more unfit for a naturall
motion, than any of the other Planets.</p>
                     <p>Which are so farre from being such
generall grounds, from which contro.
versies should be discussed, That they
are the very thing in question betwixt
us and our adversaries.</p>
                     <p>3 From the nature of all heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note>
which is to fall towards the lowest
place. From whence they conclude, that
our Earth must be in the centre.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This may proove it to be a
centre of gravitie, but not of distance;
or that it is in the midst of the World.
Yea (but say our adversaries) <hi>Aristotle</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:20652:192"/>
for this urges a demonstration, which
must needs be infallible. Thus, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of light bodies, do's apparantly
tend upward towards the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the World: but now the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heavy bodies, is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the ascent of the other; wherefore
it will necessarily follow, that these doe
all of them tend unto the centre of the
World.</p>
                     <p>I answer: Though <hi>Aristotle</hi> were a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the art of <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> and he from
whom we received the rules of disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet in this particular, 'tis very plain
that hee was deceived with a fallacie,
whilst his Argument do's suppose that
which it do's pretend to proove.</p>
                     <p>That light bodies doe ascend unto
some circumference which is higher
and above the Earth, is plaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.
But that this circumference is
the same with that of the World, or
concentricall unto it, cannot be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
affirmed, unlesse he suppose the earth
to bee in the centre of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi>
which is the thing to be prooved.</p>
                     <p>I would fain know from what grounds
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20652:192"/>
our adversaries can proove, that the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of heavy bodies is to the centre; or
the ascent of light bodies, to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the World. The utmost
experience we can have in this kinde,
do's but extend to those things that are
upon our Earth, or in the aire above it.
And alas, what is this unto the vaste
frame of the whole <hi>Vniverse?</hi> but <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctulum,</hi>
such an insensible point, which
do's not beare so great a proportion to
the whole, as a small sand do's unto the
Earth. Wherefore it were a sencelesse
thing, from our experience of so little a
part, to pronounce any thing infallibly
concerning the scituation of the whole.
The Arguments from <hi>Astronomy,</hi> are
chiefly these foure; each of which, are
boasted of to be unanswerable.</p>
                     <p>1 The <hi>Horizon</hi> do's everie where
divide all the great circles of a Sphaere
into two equall parts:<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> So there is always
halfe the Equinoctiall above it, and half
below. Thus likewise, there will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
be six signs of the <hi>Zodiacke</hi> above
the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and other six below it. And
besides, the circles of the Heaven and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20652:193"/>
Earth, are each way proportionable to
one another: as fifteen Germane miles
on the Earth, are every where agreeable
to one degree in the Heavens; and one
houre in the Earth, is correspondent to
fifteen degrees in the <hi>Equator.</hi> From
whence it may bee inferred, that the
Earth must necessarily bee scituated in
the midst of these circles; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in the centre of the World.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This Argument do's right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proove the Earth to be in the midst of
these circles: but we cannot hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that it is in the centre of the
World: from which, though it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much distant, yet would it still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the midst of those circles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the eye that imagines them
to be described about it. Wherefore it
were a weake and preposterous collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to argue thus, That the Earth is in
the centre of the World; because in the
midst of those circles; or because the
parts and degrees of the Earth, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
in proportion, to the parts and
degrees in Heaven. Whereas, it follows
rather on the contrary, That these circles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20652:193"/>
are equally distant and proportionall in
their parts; in respect of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is our eye that describes them
about the centre of it.</p>
                     <p>So that though a farre greater part of
the world did appeare at one time than
at another; yet in respect of those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which our eye describes about the
Earth, all that wee could see at once,
would seem to be but a perfect Haemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere:
As may bee manifested by this
following Figure.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20652:194"/>
Where if wee suppose A. to bee our
Earth, B. C. D. E. one of the great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which we fancy about it, F. G. H. I.
the orbe of fixed Starres, R. the centre
of them. Now though the Arke, G. F. I.
bee bigger than the other, G. H. I. yet
yet notwithstanding, to the eye on the
Earth, A. one will appeare a semicircle,
as well as the other; because the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
do's transferre all those Starres
into the lesser circle, B. C. D. E. which
it do's fancy to be described above that
centre. Nay, though there were a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earth, at a far greater distance from
the centre of the world, even in the place
of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as suppose at Q. yet then also
would there bee the same appearance.
For though the Arke, K. F. L. in the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heaven, were twice as big as the other,
K. H. L. yet notwithstanding at the
Earth, Q. they would both appeare but
as equall Hemispheres, being transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into that other circle, M. N. O. P.
which is part of the Sphaere that the eye
describes to it selfe above the Earth.</p>
                     <p>From whence wee may plainely
discern, That though the Earth be never
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20652:194"/>
so farre distant from the centre of the
World; yet the parts and degrees of that
imaginarie Sphaere about it, will always
be proportionall to the parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>2 Another demonstration like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this former,<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> frequently urged to the
same purpose, is this: If the Earth be out
of the centre of the World, then must it
be scituated in these three positions:
either in the <hi>Equator,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vid. Carp. Geog. l. 1. c. 5.</note> but out of the
<hi>Axis;</hi> or secondly, in the <hi>Axis,</hi> but out of
the <hi>Equator;</hi> or thirdly, besides both of
them. But it is not placed according to
any of these scituations; therefore must
it needs be in the centre.</p>
                     <p>1 'Tis not in the <hi>Equator,</hi> and beside
the <hi>Axis.</hi> For then, first, there will bee
no <hi>Equinox</hi> at all in some places, when
the days and nights shall be of an equall
length: secondly, the afternoones and
forenoones will not bee of the same
length; because, then our Meridian
Line must divide the <hi>Hemisphaere</hi> into
unequall parts.</p>
                     <p>2 'Tis not in the <hi>Axis,</hi> but out of the
<hi>Equator;</hi> for then, first, the <hi>Equinox</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:20652:195"/>
would not happen when the Sunne was
in the middle line betwixt the two <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,</hi>
but in some other paralell, which
might bee neerer to one of them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the earth did approach to one
<hi>Tropicke</hi> more than another. Secondly,
there would not bee such a proportion
between the increase &amp; decrease of days
and nights, as now there is.</p>
                     <p>3 'Tis not besides both of them:
For then, all these inconveniences, and
sundry others must with the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of consequence be inferred. From
whence it will follow, That the Earth
must be scituated there, where the <hi>Axis</hi>
and <hi>Equator</hi> meet, which is in the centre
of the World.</p>
                     <p>To this we grant, that the Earth must
needs be placed both in the <hi>Axis</hi> and
<hi>Equator;</hi> and so consequently, in the
centre of that sphaere which we imagine
about it: But yet this will not prove,
that it is in the midst of the <hi>Vniverse.</hi>
For let our adversaries suppose it to bee
as far distant from that, as they conceive
the Sun to be; yet may it still be scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the very concourse of these two
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20652:195"/>
Lines: because the <hi>Axis</hi> of the World
is nothing else but that imaginary Line
which passes through the Poles of our
Earth, to the Poles of the World. And
so likewise the <hi>Equator,</hi> is nothing else
but a great circle in the midst of the
Earth, betwixt both the Poles, which by
imagination is continued even to the
fixed Starres. Thus also, we may affirme
the Earth to be in the plane of the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke,</hi>
if by it's annuall motion it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
that imaginarie circle: and in the
plane of the <hi>Equator,</hi> if by it's diurnall
motion about it's own <hi>Axis,</hi> it did make
severall paralels, the midst of which
should be the <hi>Equator.</hi> From whence it
appeares, that these two former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
proceed from one and the same
mistake, whilest our adversaries suppose
the circumference and centre of the
Sphaere, to be the same with that of the
World.</p>
                     <p>Another demonstration of the same
kinde,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> is taken from the Eclipses of the
Sunne and Moone; which would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
happen when these two Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are diametrically opposed, but som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20652:196"/>
times when they are lesse distant than a
semicircle, if it were so, that the Earth
were not in the centre.</p>
                     <p>I answer: This Argument, if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
will be found most directly to
inferre this conclusion, That in all
Eclipses, the Earth is in such a strait
Line (betwixt the two Luminaries,)
whose extremities doe point unto op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
parts of the <hi>Zodiacke.</hi> Now
though our adversaries should suppose
(as <hi>Copernicus</hi> do's) the Earth to be sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
in that which they would have to
bee the Sunnes Orbe; yet would there
not bee any Eclipse, but when the
Sunne and Moone were diametrically
opposite, and our Earth betwixt them:
As may cleerely bee manifested by
this Figure, where you see the two
Luminaries in opposite Signes: and
according as any part of our Earth is
scituated by it's diurnall revolution,
so will every Eclipse be either visible,
or not visible unto it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:20652:196"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last and chiefe Argument, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the appearance af the Starres;
which in every Horizon,<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> at each houre
of the night,<note place="margin">Arist. de coe. lo. li. 2. c. 14.</note> and at all times of the yere,
seeme of an equall bignesse. Now this
could not bee, if our Earth were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
neerer unto them by 2000000
Germane miles, which is granted to bee
the diameter of that Orbe, wherein the
Earth is supposed to move.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:20652:197"/>
I answer: this consequence will not
hold, if we affirme the Earth's Orbe not
to be big enough for the making of any
sensible difference in the appearance of
the fixed Stars.<note place="margin">Copern. li. 1. cap. 5, 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, but (you wil say) tis beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and without all reason, to think the
fixed Starres of so vast a distance from
us, that our approaching neerer unto
them by 2000000 Germane miles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make any difference in the seeming
quantitie of their bodies.</p>
                     <p>I reply: There is no certaine way to
find out the exact distance of the starry
Firmament: but we are fain to conclude
of it by conjectures, according as seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reasons and observations seem most
likely unto the fancies of divers men.
Now that this opinion of <hi>Copernicus</hi> do's
not make it too big, may be discerned
from these following considerations.</p>
                     <p>The Worlds <hi>great</hi> &amp; <hi>little,</hi> are relative
tearmes, and do import a comparison to
somthing else: So that where the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as it is according to <hi>Copernicus)</hi> is
said to be too big; 'tis likely, that this
word is to be understood in reference to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20652:197"/>
some other thing of the same kinde, the
least of which, is the Moones Orbe: but
now if it's being so much bigger than
this may bee a sufficient reason, why
it should be thought too great, then it
seemes that every thing which exceeds
another of the same kind, in such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
may be concluded to be of too
big a quantitie: and so consequently, we
may affirme, that there is no such thing
in the World. And hence it will follow,
that Whales and Elephants are meere
<hi>Chimaera's,</hi> and poeticall fictions, because
they doe so much exceed many other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures. If all this eighth sphaere
(saith <hi>Gallilaeus)</hi> as great as it is, were a
light body, and placed so farre from us
that it appeared but as one of the lesser
Starres, wee should then esteeme it but
little; and therefore, we have no reason
now to thrust it out from being
amongst the works of nature, by reason
of it's too great immensitie. 'Tis a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
speech of our adversaries, <hi>Tycho,
Fromundus,</hi> and others, in excuse of that
incredible swiftnesse which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
in their <hi>primum mobile,</hi> That 'twas
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20652:198"/>
requisite the motion of the Heavens
should have a kind of infinitie in it, the
better to manifest the infinitenesse of
the Creator. And why may not wee as
well affirme this concerning the bignes
of the Heavens? <hi>Difficilius est accidens
praeter modulum subjecti intendere, quàm
subjectum sine accidente augere</hi> (saith <hi>Kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.)</hi>
His meaning is, that 'tis lesse absurd
to imagine the eighth Sphaere of so vast
a bignesse, as long as it is without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or at least, ha's but a very slow one:
than to attribute unto it such an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
celeritie, as is altogether dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to it's bignesse.</p>
                     <p>2 'Tis the acknowledgement of
<hi>Clavius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Comment. in Sphaer. cap. 1.</note> and might easily be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
That if the centre were fastened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pole of the World, the Orbe
wherein he supposes the Sunne to move,
would not be able to reach so farre in the
eighth Sphaere (being considered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Ptolomies Hypothesis)</hi> as to
touch the Pole-starre: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(saith he) is so neere the Pole it
selfe, that wee can scarse discerne it to
move: Nay, that circle which the Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starre
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20652:198"/>
makes about the Pole, is aboue
foure times bigger than the Orbe of the
Sunne. So that according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our adversaries, though our Earth
were at that distance from the centre, as
they suppose the Sunne to be, yet would
not this <hi>eccentricitie</hi> make it neerer to
any one part of the Firmament, than
the Pole-starre is to the Pole, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his confession, is scarse sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And therefore according to their
opinion, it would cause very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the appearance of those Stars,
the biggest of which do's not seeme
to bee of above five cubites in it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter.</p>
                     <p>3 'Tis considerable, That the sphaeres
of <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Mars,</hi> are according to
the generall opinion, of very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension;
and yet each of them is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely to carry about it's particular
Planet, which are but very little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the fixed Starres. Now if for
the scituation of these fixed Starres,
there should be allotted a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of the World, 'tis certaine, that
their Orbe must be farre bigger than it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20652:199"/>
is commonly supposed, and very neer to
this opinion of <hi>Copernicus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 Wee usually judge the bignesse
of the higher Orbs, by their different
motions. As because <hi>Saturne</hi> finishes his
course in thirty yeares, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in
twelve, therfore we attribute unto those
Orbes such a different proportion in
their bignesse. Now if by this rule wee
would finde out the quantitie of the
eighth Sphaere, wee shall discerne it to
be farre neerer unto that bignesse, which
<hi>Copernicus</hi> supposeth it to have, than that
which <hi>Ptolomy, Tycho,</hi> and others, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ascribe unto it. For the starry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
(say they) do's not finish his course
under 26000 yeares; whereas <hi>Saturne,</hi>
which is next unto it, do's compasse his
Orbe in thirty yeares. From whence it
will probably follow, that there is a very
great distance betwixt these in place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have such different termes of
their revolutions.</p>
                     <p>But against this answer: unto the last
Argument, our adversaries thus reply:</p>
                     <p>1 If the fixed Starres be so far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from us,<note place="margin">Fromond. Vesta. tract. 5. cap. 1.</note> that our approaching nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20652:199"/>
unto them by 2000000 Germane
miles, doe not make any sensible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in their appearance, then <hi>Gallilaeus</hi>
his perspective could not make them
seeme of a bigger Forme, than they doe
to the bare eye, which yet is contrary to
common experience.</p>
                     <p>2 From hence it may bee inferred,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
That the least fixed Star is bigger than
all this Orbe wherein wee suppose the
Earth to move; because there is none of
them but are of a sensible bignesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Firmament, whereas, this it
seemes is not.</p>
                     <p>3 Since God did at first create the
Starres <hi>for the use of all nations that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wholeheavens, Deut.</hi> 4. 19.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it might
have argued some improvidence in him,
if he had made them of such vast magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
whereas they might as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
their light and influences, and so
consequently be as serviceable to that
end for which they were appointed, if
they had been made with lesse bodies,
and placed neerer unto us. And 'tis a
common <hi>maxime,</hi> that nature in all
her operations, do's avoid superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20652:200"/>
and use the most compendious
way.</p>
                     <p>I answer:</p>
                     <p>1 To the first, whether the perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
do make the fixed Starres appeare
bigger than they do to the bare eye, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly be concluded, unlesse wee
had such an exact glasse, by which wee
might trie the experiment. But if in
this kinde we will trust the authoritie of
others,<note n="*" place="margin">Astron. Copern. lib. 4. par. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Keplar</hi> tells us from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of skilfull men, that the better
the perspective is, by so much the lesse
will the fixed Starres appeare through
it, being but as meer points from which
the beames of light doe disperse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like haires. And 'tis commonly
affirmed by others, that the Dog-starre;
which seemes to bee the biggest Starre
amongst those of the first magnitude,
do's yet appeare through this glasse but
as a little point no bigger than the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
part of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Hence it is, that
though the common opinion hold the
Starres of the first magnitude to be two
minutes in their diameter, and <hi>Tycho</hi>
three, yet<note n="†" place="margin">System. mundi, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>Gallilaeus,</hi> who hath bin most
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20652:200"/>
versed in the experiments of his owne
perspective, concludes them to bee but
five seconds.</p>
                     <p>2 To the second: First wee affirme,
the fixed Starres to be of a vaste magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
But however, this Argument do's
not induce any necessitie that we should
conceive them so big as the earth's Orb.
For it might easily bee prooved, that
though a Starre of the sixth magnitude
were but equall in diameter unto the
Sunne (which is farre enough from the
greatnesse of the Earth's Orbe) yet the
starry heav'n would be at such a distance
from us, that the Earth's annuall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could not cause any difference in it's
appearance.</p>
                     <p>Suppose the <hi>diameter</hi> of the Sunne to
be about half a degree,<note place="margin">Vide Galil. ibid.</note> as our adversaries
grant; whereas a Starre of the sixth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
is fifty thirds, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in that of the Sun 2160 times.
Now if the Sunne were removed so far
from us, that it's <hi>diameter</hi> would seeme
but as one of that number whereof it
now containes 2160, then must his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from us, bee 2160 times greater
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20652:201"/>
than now it is: which is all one, as if wee
should say, that a Starre of the sixth
magnitude is severed from us by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>semidiameters</hi> of the Earth's Orb. But
now according to common consent, the
distance of the Earth from the Sun, do's
containe 128 <hi>semidiameters</hi> of the
Earth, and (as was said before) this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
distance of the fixed Starres, do's
comprehend 2160 <hi>semidiameters</hi> of the
Earth's Orbe. From whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that the <hi>semidiameter</hi> of the Earth,
in comparison to it's distance from the
Sunne, will bee almost doubly bigger
than the <hi>semidiameter</hi> of the Earth's
Orbe, in comparison to this distance of
the Starres. But now the <hi>semidiameter</hi> of
the Earth, do's make very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the appearance of the Sunne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we see common observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the surface of it, are as exactly true to
the sence, as if they were made from the
centre of it. Wherefore, that difference
which would bee made in these fixed
Stars, by the annuall course of the earth,
must needs be much more unobservable,
or rather altogether insensible.</p>

2 The consequence of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is grounded upon this false suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
That every body must necessari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
be of an equall extension, to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from whence there do's not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
any sensible difference in it's
quantitie. So that when I see a Bird
flying such a height in the aire, that my
being neerer unto it, or farther from it,
by tenne or twenty foot, do's not make
it seem unto my eyes either bigger or
lesse; then I may conclude that the bird
must needs be either ten or twenty foot
thicke: or when I see the body of a Tree
that may be halfe a mile from me, and
perceive that my approaching neerer to
it by thirty or forty paces, do's not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
make any different appearance,
I may then inferre, that the Tree is forty
paces thicke; with many the like absurd
consequences, that would follow from
that foundation upon which this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is bottomed.</p>
                     <p>To the third I answer: 'Tis too much
presumption, to conclude that to bee
superfluous, the usefulnesse of which we
doe not understand. There be many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20652:202"/>
ends in these great works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which humane wisedome cannot
reach unto, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes of
those things that are under the Sunne,
so may we also of those things that are
above it, <hi>That no man can find out the works
of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>for though a man labour to seek it out.</hi>
Yea further: <hi>Though a wise man thinke to
know it, yet shall he not be able to finde it.</hi> He
that hath most insight into the works of
nature, is not able to give a satisfying
reason, why the Planets or Stars should
be placed just at this particular distance
from the Earth, and no neerer or farther.
And besides, this Argument might as
well be urged against the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> or <hi>Tycho,</hi> since the Starres, for
ought we know, might have been as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to us, if they had been placed
farre neerer, than either of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
suppose them. Againe, were there
any force in such a consequence, it
would as well conclude a great impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of nature, in making such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of those lesser Stars, which have
lately discovered by the perspective.
For to what purpose should so many
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20652:202"/>
Lights be created for the use of man,
since his eyes were not able to discerne
them? So that our disabilitie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all those ends which might be
aimed at in the works of nature, can bee
no sufficient Argument to proove their
superfluitie. Though Scripture doe tell
us that these things were made for our
use, yet it do's not tell us, that this is
their only end. 'Tis not impossible, but
that there may be elsewhere some other
inhabitants, by whom these lesser Stars
may be more plainly discerned. And (as
was said before) why may not we affirm
that of the bignesse, which our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doe concerning the motion of the
Heavens? That God, to shew his owne
immensitie, did put a kinde of infinitie
in the creature.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another Argument to
this purpose, urged by<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. sect. 2. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Al. Ross.</hi> which
was not referred to any of the former
kinde, because I could scarsely beleeve
I did rightly understand it: since he puts
it in the front of his other Arguments,
as being of strength and subtilty enough
to be a leader unto all the rest; and yet
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20652:203"/>
in the most likely sence of it, 'tis so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
simple to be pressed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
that every fresh man would
laugh at it. The words of it are these:
<hi>Quod minimum est in circulo debet esse cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum
illius, at terra longè minor est Sole, &amp;
Aequinoctialis terrestris est omnium in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
circulus minimus, ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By the same reason, it would rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> were in the
centre, since both these are lesse than the
Earth. And then, whereas he sayes that
the Aequinoctiall of the Earth is the
least circle in the Heavens, 'tis neither
true nor pertinent, and would make one
suspect, that hee who should urge such
an Argument, did searse understand any
thing in Astronomy.</p>
                     <p>There are many other objections like
unto this, not worth the citing: The
chiefe of all have bin already answered;
by which you may discerne, that there is
not any such great necessitie, as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
pretend, why the Earth should
bee scituated in the midst of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</hi>

according to the <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Tycho:</hi> who

good reason, denies it to be in the midst
of the fixed Starres; as if the Planets,

                     <p>There bee sundry other particulars,
whereby this opinion concerning the
Sunnes being in the centre, may bee
strongly evidenced: which because they
relate unto severall motions also, cannot
therefore properly be insisted on in this
place. You may easily enough discerne
them, by considering the whole frame of
the Heavens, as they are according to
the <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Copernicus;</hi> wherein, all
those probable resolutions that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for divers appearances amongst the
Planets, doe mainly depend upon this
supposition, that the Sunne is in the
centre. Which Arguments (were there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20652:204"/>
no other) might be abundantly enough
for the confirmation of it. But for the
greater plenty, there are likewise these
probabilities considerable.</p>
                     <p>1 It may seem agreeable to reason,
that the light which is diffused in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Starres through the circumference
of the World, should be more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained, and (as it were) contracted
in the centre of it, which can only be by
placing the Sunne there.</p>
                     <p>2 'Tis an Argument of<note n="*" place="margin">In prim. cap. Sphaer.</note> 
                        <hi>Clavius,</hi>
and frequently urged by our adversaries,
That the most naturall scituation of the
Sunnes body was in the midst, betwixt
the other Planets; and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because from thence he might more
conveniently distribute amongst them
both his light and heate. The force of
which, may more properly bee applyed
to proove him in the centre.</p>
                     <p>3 'Tis probable that the planetarie
Orbes (which are speciall parts of the
<hi>Vniverse)</hi> doe moove about the centre of
the World, rather than about any other
centre which is remote from it. But now
'tis evident, that the Planet <hi>Saturne, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20652:205"/>
Mars, Venus, Mercury,</hi> doe by their

                        </gap>s is
scituated in the midst of the World.</p>
                     <p>As for the three upper Planet, 'tis
found by observation, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
neerest to the Earth, when in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Sunne, and farthest from

difference is so eminent, that <hi>Mars</hi> in
his <hi>Perige</hi> do's appeare sixty times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than when hee is in the <hi>Apoge,</hi> and at
the greatest distance.</p>
                     <p>Now, that the revolution of <hi>Venus</hi>
and <hi>Mercury</hi> also is about the Sun, may
from hence be evidenced: first, because
they are never at any great distance
from him: secondly, because they are
seen sometimes above, and sometimes
below him: thirdly, because <hi>Venus,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her different scituations, do's
change her appearance, as the Moone.</p>
                     <p>4 There is yet another Argument,
which<note n="†" place="margin">De Coelo. lib. 2. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe do's repeat
from <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> The most excellent
body should have the best place; but
the Sunne is the most excellent body,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20652:205"/>
and the centre is the best place; therfore
'tis likely the Sunne is in the centre. In
the frame of nature (which is supposed
to be of an orbicular forme) there are
but two places of any eminency, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
and the centre. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
being of so wide a capacity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so fitly be the peculiar seat of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that is so little in respect of it: and
besides, that which is the most excellent
part of the World, should bee equally
preserved in it selfe, and shared in it's
vertues by all the other parts, which can
only be done by it's being placed in the
midst of them. This is intimated unto
us in that frequent speech of <hi>Plato,</hi> that
the Soule of the World do's reside in
the innermost place of it: and that in
<note n="*" place="margin">Saturnal. lib. 1. cap. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who often compares the sun
in the World, to the Heart in a living
creature.</p>
                     <p>Vnto this <hi>Aristotle</hi> answers by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction:
There is <hi>medium magnitudinis,</hi>
so the centre is the middle of a Sphaere:
and there is <hi>medium naturae,</hi> or <hi>infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationis,</hi>
which is not alwayes the
same with the other; for in this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20652:206"/>
sence the Heart is the middle of a man;
because from thence (saith hee) as from
the centre, the vitall spirits are convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all the members: and yet we know
that it is not the centre of Magnitude,
or at an equall distance from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts.</p>
                     <p>And besides, the middle is the worst
place, because most circumscribed, since
that is more excellent which do's limit
any thing, than that which is bounded
by it. For this reason is it, that <hi>Matter</hi> is
amongst those things which are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and <hi>Forme,</hi> that which do's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe.</p>
                     <p>But against this answer of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it
is againe replyed:</p>
                     <p>1 Though it be true,<note place="margin">Keplar. Astr. Copern. lib. 4. par. 2.</note> that in living
creatures the best and chiefest part is
not placed alwaies just in the midst, yet
this may be, because they are not of an
orbicular forme, as the World is.</p>
                     <p>2 Though that which bounds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing be more excellent than that
which is terminated by it, yet this do's
not proove the centre to bee the worst
place, because that is one of the tearmes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20652:206"/>
or limits of a round body, as well as the
circumference.</p>
                     <p>There are likewise other Arguments
to this purpose, much insisted on by

                     <p>For according to this (say they) wee
may conceive an excellent Harmonie
both in the number and the distance of

then those greater Works, the Heavens)
for then the five Mathematicall bodies,

                        <hi>Euclid,</hi> wil beare
in them a proportion answerable to the
severall distances of the Planets from
one another.</p>
                     <p>Thus a <hi>Cube</hi> will measure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betwixt <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter;</hi> a <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis</hi>

<hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> a <hi>Dodecaëdron,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betwixt <hi>Mars</hi> and the Earth; an
<hi>Icosaëdron,</hi> the distance betwixt the <hi>Earth</hi>
and <hi>Venus;</hi> and an <hi>Octoëdron,</hi> the distance
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20652:207"/>
betwixt <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> that is, if we
conceive a circumference described
immediately without the <hi>Cube,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within it, the distance betweene
these two will shew what proportionall
distance there is betwixt the Orbe of
<hi>Saturne,</hi> and that of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Thus also, if
you conceive a circumference described
on the outside of a <hi>Pyramis</hi> or <hi>Tetraëdron,</hi>
and another within it, this will shew
such a proportionall distance, as there is
betwixt the Orbe of <hi>Mars,</hi> from that of
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> And so of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Now if any aske why there are but six

there are but five proportions, so

now there are six tearmes required to
consummate this number of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:20652:207"/>
Thus likewise by placing the Sunne
in the centre,<note place="margin">LIB. 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> wee may conceive such a
proportion betwixt the Bodies of the
Planets, as will be answerable unto their
severall Sphaeres: Then <hi>Mercury,</hi> which

Body; <hi>Venus</hi> bigger than that, but lesse

than <hi>Venus,</hi> but lesse than the rest; <hi>Mars</hi>
bigger than the <hi>Earth,</hi> but lesse than <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;
Iupiter</hi> bigger than <hi>Mars,</hi> and lesse
than <hi>Saturne; Saturne</hi> being the highest,
should also be the biggest. All which

the second of these, they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
handled in the sixth Proposition,
where the Earth's <hi>eccentricitie</hi> was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>So that the chiefe businesse of this
Chapter, is to defend the Earth's diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion, against the objections of
our adversaries. Sundry of which obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to speak (as the truth is) do beare
in them a great shew of probabilitie,
and such too (as it seemes) was very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,
since <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> &amp;c.
men of excellent parts and deep judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
did ground upon them, as being
of infallible and necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:20652:209"/>
I shall reckon them up severally, and
set downe such answers unto each, as
may yeeld some satisfaction to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
seeker of truth.</p>
                     <p>1 First then, 'tis objected from our
sences; If the Earth did move, we should
perceive it. The Westerne mountaines
would then appeare to ascend towards
the Starres, rather than the Stars to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
below them.</p>
                     <p>I answer: The sight judges of motion
according as any thing do's desert the
plane whereon it selfe is seated: which
plane every where keeping the same sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
and distance, in respect of the
eye, do's therefore seem immovable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and the motion will appeare in
those Starres and parts of the Heaven;
through which the verticall Line do's
passe.</p>
                     <p>The reason of such deceit may be
this: Motion being not a proper object
of the sight, nor belonging to any other
peculiar sence, must therefore be judged
of by the <hi>sensus communis,</hi> which is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to mistake in this respect; because it
apprehends the eye it self to rest immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20652:209"/>
whilest it do's not feel any effects
of this motion in the body: As it is when
a man is carried in a Ship; so that sence
it but an ill judge of naturall secrets.
'Tis a good rule of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: A Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
must not bee carried away by the
bare appearance of things to sight, but
must examine them by reason. If this
were a good consequence, The Earth
do's not move, because it do's not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
so to us, we might then as well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that it do's move when we goe upon
the water, according to the verse:
<q>Provehimur portu, terraeque, verbesque recedunt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or if such Arguments would hold, it
were an easie matter to prove the Sunne
and Moone not so big as a Hat, or the
fixed stars as a Candle.</p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Al. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>oss. l. 1. sect. 1 cap. 1.</note> but if the motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
bee onely apparant, and not reall,
then the motion of the clouds will be so
too, since the eye may bee as well decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the one as the other.</p>
                     <p>I answer: 'Tis all one, as if he should
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20652:210"/>
inferre, that the sence was mistaken in
every thing, because it was so in one
thing: and this would be an excellent
Argument to prove that opinion of
<hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that the Snow was blacke.</p>
                     <p>The reason why that motion which is
caused by the Earth, do's appeare as if it
were in the Heavens, is, because the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
communis</hi> in judging of it, do's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the eye to be it selfe immovable
(as was said before) there being no sence
that do's discerne the effects of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the body; and therefore, it do's
conclude every thing to move, which it
do's perceive to change it's distance
from it: So that the clouds do not seem
to move sometimes, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they are every where carried
about with our Earth, by such a swift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution;
yet this can be no hinderance
at all, why wee may not judge aright of
their other particular motions, for
which there is not the same reason.
Though to a man in a Ship, the Trees
and Bankes may seeme to move; yet it
would be but a weak Argument, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from hence, that therefore such a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20652:210"/>
one could not tell whether his friend
do's really stirre, whom he sees to walke
up and downe in the Ship: or that hee
might as well bee deceived in judging
the Oares to move, when they doe not.</p>
                     <p>'Tis againe replyed by the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
That it is not credible, the eve
should bee mistaken in judging of the
Starres and Heavens; because those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
light bodies, are the primarie and
proper Objects of that sence.</p>
                     <p>I answer: The deceit here is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the light or colour of those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but concerning their motion;
which is neither the primarie nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object of the Eye, but reckoned
amongst the <hi>Objecta Communia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 Another common Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this motion, is taken from the
danger that would thence arise, unto all
high buildings, which by this would
quickely bee ruinated, and scattered
abroad.</p>
                     <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Coper. l. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>8</note> This motion is supposed to
be naturall: and those things which are
according to nature, have contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to other matters, which are by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20652:211"/>
force and violence. Now it belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things of this later kind, to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and hurtfull; whereas those of the
first kinde must be regular, and tending
to conservation. The motion of the
Earth is alwaies equall and like it selfe:
not by starts and fits. If a glasse of Beere
may stand firmely enough in a Shippe,
when it moves swiftly upon a smooth
streame, much lesse then will the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Earth, which is more naturall;
and so consequently more equall, cause
any danger unto those buildings that
are erected upon it. And therefore to
suspect any such event, would bee like
the feare of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who would not
acknowledge the being of any <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gibert de Magn. lib. 6. cap. 5.</note>
lest then he might bee forced to
grant that they should fall downe unto
the Heavens. We have equall reason to
be afraid of high buildings, if the whole
World above us were whirled about
with such a mad celeritie as our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
suppose; for then there would be
but small hopes, that this little point of
Earth should escape from the rest.</p>
                     <p>But supposing (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. sect. 1. cap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Rosse)</hi> that this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20652:211"/>
motion were naturall to the Earth, yet
it is not naturall to Townes and Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
for these are artificiall.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer: Ha, ha, he.</p>
                     <p>3 Another Argument to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is taken from the rest and quietnes
of the aire about us; which could not be,
if there were any such swift motion of
the Earth. If a man riding upon a fleet
horse, doe perceive the aire to beat
against his face, as if there were a winde,
what a vehement tempest should wee
continually feele from the East, if the
Earth were turned about with such a
swift revolution as is supposed.</p>
                     <p>Vnto this 'tis usually answered, That
the aire also is carried along with the
same motion of the Earth: For if the
concavitie of the Moones Orbe, which
is of so smooth and glabrous a superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
may (according to our adversaries)
drive along with it the greatest part of
this Elementarie World, all the regions
of Fire, and all the vast upper regions
of Aire, and (as some will have it) the
two lower Regions, together with the
Sea likewise; for from hence (saith <hi>Alex.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20652:212"/>
Rosse, lib. 1. sect. 1. cap. 3.)</hi> is it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Tropicks</hi> there is a constant
Easterne wind, and a continuall flowing
of the Sea Westward; I say, if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heavens which are smooth
bodies, may bee able to carry with it so
great a part of the elementarie World: or
if the rugged parts of the Moons Body
be able to carry with it so great a part of
the aire, as <hi>Fromondus (Ant. c. 16.)</hi> affirms:
much more then may our earth, which is
a rugged mountainous Body, be able to
turne about so little a part of the world,
as that vaporous aire next unto it.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:20652:212"/>
Suppose the inward circle to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Earth; and the outward, the
thicker aire which encompasses it.
Now it is easily conceivable, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of so great a Body as this
Globe of Earth, may turne about by it's
meere motion (if there were nothing
els) so little a part of the adjoyning aire,
as is here represented: And yet,</p>
                     <p>1 The disproportion betwixt the
thicknesse of the Earth, and this Orb of
Aire, is farre greater than could bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the Figure, being but as twenty
miles; which is at most the thicknesse of
this Aire, unto 3456 miles, which is the
semidiameter of our Earth, and so is but
as an insensible number in respect of
this other.</p>
                     <p>2 Besides the meere motion of the
Earth, which in probabilities (being
such a rugged body) might bee enough
to carry so little a part of the aire along
with it; there is also (as wee suppose) a
magneticall vigor which proceeds from
it, whereby 'tis more able to make all
things that are neere unto it, to observe
the same revolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:20652:213"/>
But if it be so (saith<note n="*" place="margin">Li. 1. sect. 1. cap. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Alex. Ross.)</hi> that
not only the man, but the <hi>medium</hi> also,
and the Object bee moved: this must
needs be such a great hinderance to the
sight, that the eye cannot judge exactly
of any thing. For suppose the man alone
to be in a motion, hee could not see so
well as when hee is still; but now if not
only he, but his spectacles, and booke
were all mooved, he would not bee able
to discerne any thing distinctly.</p>
                     <p>I answer: the consequence were perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
if all these were severall motions:
but if the Subject, and <hi>Medium,</hi> and
Object were all carried with one and the
same equall motion (as it is here suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
this could be no impediment to
the act of seeing, but it would bee all
one with the rest; because by this means,
they are not severed from one another;
and therefore the <hi>species</hi> are not distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
'Tis an excellent saying of<note n="*" place="margin">Syst. mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, Collop. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi>
and may serve for the resolution of
many such doubts as these: <hi>Motus eate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
tanquàm motus operatur, quatenus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem
habet ad eas res quae ìpso distituun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
in ijs verò-rebus, quae totae aequaliter de
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20652:213"/>
eo participant, nihil operatur, &amp; ita se habet
ac si nullus esset.</hi> If a man be within some
roome of a Ship, he may read altogether
as easily when the Ship moves, as when
it stands still.</p>
                     <p>4 Another Argument against this
circular motion of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is grounded
upon that common Principle amongst
the <hi>Aristotelians: Vnius corporis simplicis
unum tantum est motus:</hi> One kind of body
ha's but one kind of motion. But now
the Earth and Water ha's a motion of
descent: the Aire, a motion of ascent;
and therefore none of them can have
any circular motion naturall unto them.</p>
                     <p>I answer: First, these right motions of
elementarie bodies belong onely to the
parts of them, and that too when they
are out of their proper places; so that the
whole to which they belong, may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, have another motion
of it's owne. But secondly, this saying
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> cals a Principle, will not
consist with other evident experiments
of nature. Thus, though a Loadstone in
respect of it's matter and condensitie,
naturally tends downward; yet this do's
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20652:214"/>
not hinder, but that in respect of some
other qualities, as it's desire of union and
coition to another loadstone, it may also
naturally move upwards. From whence
it will follow, that the same elementarie
bodie may have divers natural motions.</p>
                     <p>5 The gravitie and magnitude
of this Earthy Globe, do make it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unfit for so swift a motion.</p>
                     <p>I answer: First, Heavinesse can onely
be applyed unto those bodies which are
out of their proper places, or unto such
parts as are severed from the whole to
which they belong. And therefore the
Globe of Earth, considered as whole,
and in it's right place, cannot truly bee
called heavy. I deny not, but that there
is in it, and so likewise in the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
an ineptitude to motion, by reason
of the matter and condensitie of their
bodies: And so likewise there is, as truly
(though not according to the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees)
in the least particle of a materiall
condensed substance: so that this cannot
reasonably be pretended as a just impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
why the earth should be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of such a motion. Secondly, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20652:214"/>
though this Globe be of so vast a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
yet as nature bestowes upon
other creatures (for instance an Eagle
and a Flye) spirits, and motive powers,
proportionable to their severall bodies:
so likewise may she indowe the Earth
with a motive facultie answerable to it's
greatnesse. Or if this may make the
Earth incapable of so swift a motion, as
is supposed, much more then will the
Heavens bee disabled for that greater
swiftnesse which is imagined in them.
I might adde, the Globe of the Sun and
<hi>Iupiter</hi> are observed to move about their
owne centres; and therefore the Earth,
which is farre lesse than either of them,
is not by reason of it's too great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
made unfit for such a revolution.
Thirdly, as for the swiftnesse of the
Earth's course, it do's not exceed (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
well considered) the celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of some other motions, with which
we are acquainted; as that of the clouds,
when driven by a tempestuous wind;<note place="margin">Mae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lin prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Rhet. Fromond. Vesta. tract. 1. cap. 3.</note> that
of a Bullet shot from a Cannon, which
in the space, a minute do's fly 4 miles.
Or as another hath observed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20652:215"/>
scruple of an hour it may passe the
fifteenth part of a Germane mile: Than
which, there is not any point in the
Earth's Equinoctiall that moves faster;
and though a Bullet bee much slower in
moving a greater distance, yet for so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a space, while the force of the pouder
is most fresh and powerfull, it do's equal
the swiftnesse of the Earth. And yet,</p>
                     <p>1 A bullet or cloud is carried in it's
whole body, being fain to break it's way
through the aire round about it: but now
the earth (in respect of this first motion)
do's remaine still in the same scituation,
and move onely about it's owne centre.</p>
                     <p>2 The motion of a Bullet is violent,
and against it's nature, which do's
strongly incline it to move downwards.
Whereas the Earth being considered as
whole, and in it's proper place, is not
heavy, nor do's it containe any repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie
to a circular motion.</p>
                     <p>6 The chiefe Argument, on which
our adversaries do most insist, is this: If
there were such a motion of the Earth
as is supposed,<note place="margin">Aristot. de Coelo, lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> then those bodies which
are severed from it in the Aire, would
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20652:215"/>
be forsaken by it. The clouds would
seeme to rise and set as the Starres. The
Birds would be carried away from their
nests. No heavy body could fall perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular.
An Arrow or Bullet being shot
from East to West by the same vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
will not bee carried an equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from us, but we should by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of our Earth, overtake that
which was shot to the East, before it
could fall. If a man leaping up should
abide in the Aire but one second scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of an houre, or the sixtieth part of a
minute, the Earth in that space, would
withdraw it selfe from him almost a
quarter of a mile. All these and many
other such strange inferences, which are
directly contrary to sence and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
would follow from this motion of
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>There are three severall wayes most
frequently used for the resolving of
these kind of doubts.</p>
                     <p>1 From those magneticall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which all elementarie bodies do
partake of.</p>
                     <p>2 From the like motions of other
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20652:216"/>
things within the roome of a sailing
Ship.</p>
                     <p>3 From the like participation of
motion in the open parts of a Ship.</p>
                     <p>1 For those <hi>magneticall</hi> properties,
with which all these bodies are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For the better understanding of this,
you must know, That besides those
common elementarie qualities of heat,
coldnesse, drinesse, moisture, &amp;c. which
arise from the predominancie of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Elements; there are likewise other
qualities (not so well known to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients)
which wee call <hi>magneticall,</hi> of
which every Particle in the Terrestriall
Globe do's necessarily participate: and
whether it be joyned to this Globe by
continuitie or contiguitie; or whether it
be severed from it, as the Clouds in the
second Region, a Bird, or Bullet in the
Aire; yet do's it still retaine it's magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
qualities, together with all those
operations that proceed from them.</p>
                     <p>Now from these properties doe wee
suppose the circular motion of the
Earth to arise.</p>
                     <p>If you aske, what probabilities there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20652:216"/>
are, to prove that the Earth is indowed
with any such affections. I answer: 'Tis
likely, that the lower parts of this
Globe do not consist of such a soft fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Earth, as there is in the surface
(because there can be no such use for it,
as here, and nature do's nothing in vain;)
but rather, of some hard rocky sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
since we may well conceive, that
these lower parts are pressed close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the weight of all those heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
above them. Now 'tis probable, that
this rocky substance is a Load-stone, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a <hi>Iaspis, Adamant, Marble,</hi> or any
other; because experience teacheth us,
that the Earth and Loadstone do agree
together in so many properties. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man were to judge the matter of
divers bodies; each of which should bee
wrapt up in some covering from his eye,
so that he might not only examine them
by some other outward signes: If in this
examination he should find any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
body which had all the properties
that are peculiar to a Load-stone, hee
would in reason conclude it to be of that
nature, rather than any other. Now there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20652:217"/>
is altogether as much reason why wee
should inferre, that the inward parts of
the Earth doe consist of a magneticall
substance. The agreement of these two
you may see largely set forth in the
treatise of D. <hi>Gilbert.</hi> I will instance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in one Example; which of it self may
sufficiently evidence, that the Globe of
Earth do's partake of the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the load-stone. In the mariners
needle you may observe the magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
notions of <hi>direction, variation, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
the two last of which are found
to be different, according to the varietie
of places. Now this difference cannot
proceed from the needle it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that is the same every where. Nor
can we well conceive how it should bee
caused by the Heavens; for then the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
would not be alwaies alike in the
same place, but diverse, according to
those severall parts of the heaven, which
at severall times should happen to bee
over it: And therefore, it must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceed from the Earth, which being
it selfe endowed with magneticall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
do's diversly dispose the motions
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20652:217"/>
of the needle, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of that disponent vertue which is
in it's severall Ports.</p>
                     <p>Now to apply this unto the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
instances of the Objection: We say,
though some parts of this great Magnet
the Earth, may according to their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be severed from the whole; yet are
they alwayes joyned to it by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the same magneticall qualities;
and doe no lesse observe these kinde of
motions, when they are separated from
the whole, than if they were united to
it. Nor need this seeme incredible, that
a heavy Bullet, in such a swift violent
course, should bee able to observe this
magneticall revolution of the whole
Earth; when as we see that those great
bodies of <hi>Saturne, Iupiter,</hi> &amp;c. hanging
in the vaste spaces of the aetheriall Aire,
do so constantly and regularly move on,
in their appointed courses: Though we
could not shew any similitude of this
motion in these inferior bodies, with
which we are acquainted; yet wee must
know, there may be many things which
agree to the whole frame, that are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20652:218"/>
in the divers parts of it. 'Tis
naturall unto the Sea to ebbe and flow,
but yet there is not this motion in every
drop or bucket of Water. So if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
every part of our bodies severally,
the humours, bones, flesh, &amp;c. they are
all of them apt to tend downewards, as
being of a condensed matter; but yet
consider them according to the whole
Frame, and then the bloud or humours
may naturally ascend upwards to the
Head, as well as descend to any of the
lower parts. Thus the whole Earth may
move round, though the severall parts of
it have not any such particular revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their owne. Thus likewise, though
each condensed body being considered
by it selfe, may seem to have only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of descent; yet in reference to that
whole Frame of which it is a part, it
may also partake of another motion
that may be naturall unto it.</p>
                     <p>But some may here object: Though
the Earth were endowed with such
magneticall affections, yet what proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
is there that it should have such
a revolution? I answer: 'Tis observed of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20652:218"/>
those other magneticall bodies of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
Iupiter,</hi> and the Sun, that they are
carried about their owne centers; and
therefore 'tis not improbable, but that it
may be so with the Earth also; which if
any deny, he must shew a reason why in
this respect they should be unlike.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but though the Earth did move
round, what ground is there to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that those bodies which are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from it, as a Bullet, or the clouds,
should follow it in the same course?</p>
                     <p>I answer: Those spots which are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
about the Sun, and are thought
to bee clouds or evaporations from his
body, are observed to bee carried about
according to his revolution. Thus the
Moone is turned round by our Earth:
the foure lesser Planets by the body of
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> Nay, thus all the Planets in their
severall Orbes, are moved about by the
revolution of the Sunne, upon it's owne
<hi>Axis</hi> (saith <hi>Keplar)</hi> and therefore much
more may an Arrow or Bullet be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
round by the magneticall motion of
our Earth.</p>
                     <p>The second way, whereby some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20652:219"/>
unto the instances of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is, by shewing the like motions
of other things within some roome
of a sailing Ship. Thus experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(say they) that a candle, as also the
fumes that come from it, will alwayes
keep the same scituation in the swiftest
motion of a Ship, as if it did rest immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably,
and the flame will not more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
bend one way, or have any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
fluctuation, but burne as strait and
quietly, as if it did stand still. Againe,
it ha's been found (say those that have
been versed in these kinde of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
that the same force will cast a
body but at an equall distance, whether
or no the body do move with, or against
the motion of the Ship. As also that
any weight being let fall, will descend
in as true a perpendicular, as if the Ship
did stand still. If a man leaping up, doe
tarry in the Aire one second minute
of an houre, yet the Ship will not in it's
greatest swiftnesse (as it should accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the calculation of our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
be carried from him at least fifteen
foot. If wee suppose a man to jumpe in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20652:219"/>
such a Ship, he will not be able to passe
farther, when he jumps against the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of it, than when hee jumps with it.
All which particulars may argue, that
these things are carried along together,
by the common motion of the Ship.
Now if bodies may be thus jointly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by such a praeternaturall motion,
much more then will they accompanie
the Earth in it's diurnall revolution,
which we suppose to bee naturall unto
them, and as a Law imposed by God in
their first Creation.</p>
                     <p>If the flame of a candle, or the smoke
that comes from it (things that are so
easily movable) are notwithstanding
carried so equally, and without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance,
by the motion of a Ship: then
also the Cloudes in the Aire, and all
other light Bodies, may well enough be
turned about by the revolution of our
Earth.</p>
                     <p>If an equall force wil cast an heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but at an equall distance, whether or
no it move with, or against the motion
of the Ship; then may wee easily con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive,
that an Arrow or Bullet being
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20652:220"/>
shot with the same violence, will passe
but the same space on the Earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no it be shot towards the East
or West.</p>
                     <p>If a heavy Body, while the Ship do's
move, will fall downe in a strait Line,
then it is not the revolution of our
Earth that can hinder a perpendicular
descent.</p>
                     <p>If a man leaping up in a Ship, may
abide in the Aire on the second scruple
of an houre, and yet this Ship in it's
greatest swiftnesse not withdraw it selfe
fifteene foot; then will not the Earth in
that space go from him almost a quarter
of a mile.</p>
                     <p>But against this 'tis objected,<note place="margin">Fromondus Vesta. tract. 2. cap. 2.</note> That
the Earth ha's the similitude of an open
Ship, and not of any room that is close.
And though it bee true, that when the
Roofe and the Walls doe all move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the Aire which is included be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, must bee carried along by
the same motion; yet it is not so with
the Earth, because that hath not any
such Walls or Roofe, wherein it may
containe and carry along with it the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:20652:220"/>
And therefore experience will
rather argue against this supposed revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
Thus 'tis observed, that a stone
being let fall from the Mast of a Ship
that moves swiftly, will not descend to
the same point, as if the Ship did stand
still. From whence it will follow, that if
our Earth had such a circular motion,
then any heavy body being let fall from
some high Tower, or other steep place,
would not descend unto that point of
Earth which was directly under it at
the beginning.</p>
                     <p>To this wee answer; That the Aire
which moves along with our Earth, is as
well limited in certaine bounds, as that
which is included in a roome. If you
aske where these bounds are termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
I answer neither by the utmost parts
of the World, nor yet by the concavitie
of the Moons Orb (as <hi>Fromondus</hi> would
have us affirme) but by the Sphaere of
vaparous Aire that encompasses our
Earth; or which is all one, by the Orbe
of magneticall vigor, which proceeds
from it. And besides, tis considerable
that all Earthly Bodies are not onely
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20652:221"/>
contained within these limits, as things
are in a close roome, but also as parts in
that whole to which they belong.</p>
                     <p>2 Though the carrying along of
the <hi>medium</hi> may solve the motion of
light Bodies in a Ship, as the flame of a
candle, smoake, or the like; yet this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
concurre to that which hath bin said
of heavy Bodies, as a man leaping up, a
Bullet descending, &amp;c. since it is not
the motion of the meere Aire that is
able to make these partake of the same
motion with the Ship. Vnto that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which he urges from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of a Stone falling in an open
Ship, Wee answer:</p>
                     <p>1 Though the instance of a Ship,
may serve as a proofe for this opinion, it
being an Argument <hi>a minori ad majus,</hi>
from an accidentall motion to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
yet it will not serve against it. For
though it were not thus in accidentall
motions; yet this would not hinder but
that it might be so in those that are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be proper and naturall.</p>
                     <p>2 As for that experiment it selfe,
'tis but a groundlesse imagination, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20652:221"/>
was never yet confirmed by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
experience, because 'tis certaine the
event would be clean otherwise, as shall
be prooved in the third way of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p>3 The third and last way of clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the doubts in the sixth Argument,
is by shewing the like participation of
motion, in those things that are in the
open parts of a Ship. To which purpose
<hi>Gallilaeus</hi> urges this experiment:<note place="margin">Syste. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. Colloq. 2.</note> If any
one should let fall a Stone from an
high Mast, he would find <hi>lapidem in eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
semper Navis locum decidere, seu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistat
illa, seu quantacunque velocitate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veatur:</hi>
that the Stone would alwayes
descend unto the very same place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the Ship did move or stand
still. The reason of which is, because the
motion of the Ship is likewise impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Stone: which impression is
not equally prevalent in a light body, as
a Feather, or Wooll, because the Aire
which ha's power over them, is not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
along by the same motion of the
Ship. Thus likewise will it be in this
other experiment: If a man upon a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20652:222"/>
Horse should in his swiftest course
let fall a Bullet or Stone, these heavy
Bodies, besides their owne descent,
would also participate that transverse
motion of the Horse. For as those
things that are throwne from us, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the it motion when they are out of
the hand in the open Aire: so likewise
must it bee when the force is conferred
by that motion which the arm ha's from
the Horse. While a man is riding, his
arme is also carried by the same swiftnes
of the Horse; therefore, if hee should
onely open his hand and let fall any
thing, it would not descend in a strait
Line, but must necessarily be driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by reason of that force impressed
in it by the swiftnesse of the Horse,
which is also communicated to the
arme: it being all one in effect, whether
or no the arme be moved by a particular
motion of it's owne, as it is in casting
of things from us; or by the common
motion of the Body, as it is in dropping
of any thing from us, either when wee
are on the toppe of some sayling
Shippe, as in the <hi>Former;</hi> or on
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20652:222"/>
some running Horse, as in this <hi>Later</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>What hath been said concerning the
motion of <hi>descent,</hi> is likewise applyable,
both to that which is <hi>upward,</hi> and that
which is <hi>transversall.</hi> So that when 'tis
objected, if the Earth did move, then
a Bullet that were shot up perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
would bee forsaken by it,
and not descend to the place from
whence it arose: Wee answer, that
the Cannon which is upon the Earth,
together with the Bullet in it, doe
partake of the same circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the Earth, and this
perhaps our adversaries will grant,
whilest wee suppose the Bullet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
still in the Cannon, all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
will bee to shew how it must
necessarily observe the same motion,
when it is shot out into the open Aire.
For the better explication of this,
you may note this following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.<note place="margin">Gallil. Syst. Colleq. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:20652:223"/>
                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where wee suppose A. C. to bee
a Cannon perpendicularly, erected
with a Bullet in it at B. which if it were
immovable, wee grant that the Bullet
being discharged, must ascend in a just
perpendicular. But now conceive this
Cannon to move along with the Earth,
then in that space of time while the
Bullet by the force of the pouder is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
to the top of the Bore, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
will be transferred to the scituation
D. E. so that the Bullet must bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
according to the Line F. G. which
is not directly upright, but somewhat
declining. Now the motion of the
Bullet in the Aire, must necessarily be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20652:223"/>
conformed unto that direction that is
impressed in it by the Cannon from
whence it is shot, and so consequently it
must bee continued according to the
Line F. G. and therefore will alwayes
keep perpendicularly over the point
from which it did ascend.</p>
                     <p>If you reply, that the motion of the
Bullet in the Cannon must needs bee so
so swift, that the Earth cannot carry the
Cannon from C. to E. in the same space
of time, wherein the Bullet do's move
from B. to A. I answer: 'tis not materiall
whether the Earth bee of a greater or
lesser swiftnesse than the Bullet, because
the declination must alwayes bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the motion of the
Earth, and if wee suppose this to bee
slower than the Bullet, then the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Line F. G. will bee so much
the lesse.</p>
                     <p>This truth may yet farther bee illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by the practise of those Fowlers,
who use to kill Birds as they are flying:
Concerning which Art, tis commonly
thought that these men direct their
aimes to some certaine space in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20652:224"/>
Aire, just before the Birds, where they
conceive the Bullet wil meet with them
in their flight; whereas the truth is,
they proceed in this case, the very same
way, as if the Birds did stand still, by a
direct aiming at their bodies, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of their flight by the motion of
the piece, till at length, having got a
perfect aime, they discharge, and do hit
altogether as surely, as if the Birds were
sitting upon a Tree. From whence wee
may observe, that the motion of the
piece, as in our aiming, it is made to
follow the Birds in their flight (though
it be but slow,) yet is communicated to
the Bullet in the Aire.</p>
                     <p>But here it may seeme very difficult
to give any reason according to those
grounds concerning the flight of birds;
which being animated, have a liberty to
fly here or there, to tarry for a good
space of time in the open Aire, and so
'tis not easie to conceive what meanes
there is, by which they should partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the Earth's diurnall revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Gallilaeus</hi> answers, that the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20652:224"/>
motion of the Aire, as it do's turne
about the Clouds, so doth it also carry
with it the Birds, together with such
other like things that are in it. For if
some violent winde bee able to drive
with such swiftnesse a full laden Ship,
to throw downe Towers, to turne up
Trees, and the like; much more then
may the diurnall motion of the Aire,
(which do's so farre exceed in swiftnesse
the most tempestuous winde) be able to
carry with it the bodies of Birds.</p>
                     <p>But if all things bee turned about by
this revolution,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> then it should seeme
there is no such thing as a right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether of ascent, or descent in
a strait Line.</p>
                     <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> The moving of heavy or
light bodies, may bee considered in a
double relation.</p>
                     <p>1 According to the space wherein
they move, and then we grant their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not to bee simple, but mixed of a
direct and circular.</p>
                     <p>2 According to the body or <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
wherein they move, and then they
may properly be said to have right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20652:225"/>
because they passe through the
<hi>medium</hi> in a strait Line; and therefore it
is, that unto us they seeme directly to
ascend or descend. <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe
would not deny, but that Fire may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
in a strait Line unto it's Sphaere,
and yet participate also of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion which hee supposes to
bee communicated from the Heavens,
unto the upper part of the Aire, and it's
owne Region. So likewise must it bee
for the descent of any thing. Suppose
a Ship in it's swiftest motion, and a man
in it, having some vessell filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
should let fall into it a little Ball of
Waxe, or some other matter which may
be slow in it's sinking, so that in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
it should scarse descend the space
of a cubit, though the Ship (it may be)
in the same time may passe at least a
hundred cubits; yet would this still
seeme unto the eye to descend in a strait
Line; and the other motion which is
communicated unto it by the Shippe,
would not at all bee discernable in it.
And though in this case, the motion
were in it selfe composed of a circular
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20652:225"/>
and direct; yet in respect of us it would
appeare, and so might be stiled exactly
strait.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be thus in those which are
generally granted to be praeternaturall
motions; wee need not doubt then the
possibilitie of the like effect in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which wee conceive to be proper
and naturall, both to the Earth, and the
things that belong unto it.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another Objection to
this purpose urged by<note n="*" place="margin">Austriaca Syder. par. 2. prop. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>Malapertius,</hi> a
late Iesuite, who though hee doe with
much eagernesse presse this Argument
concerning a Bullet or Stone, against the
opinion of <hi>Copernicus;</hi> yet he grants that
it might easily be resolved, if the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it would affirme that the Aire
did move round with the earth. But this
(saith he) they dare not avouch; for then
the Comets would always seem to stand
stil, being carried about with the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this aire, and then they could not
rise or set, as experience shews they doe.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be answered, that most
Comets are above that Sphaere of Aire
which is turned round with our Earth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20652:226"/>
as is manifest by their height. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that appeares in them, is caused by
the revolution of our Earth, whereby we
are turned from them.</p>
                     <p>As for those which are within the
Orbe of our Aire, these do seem to stand
still. Such a one was that mentioned
by<note n="†" place="margin">De bello Iudaico, lib. 7. cap. 12. Dion. lib. 54.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> which did constantly hang

the one being low, and such as

                     <p>I have done with all the Arguments

themselves to be rather the Objections

sweares <hi>that there shall be time no longer;</hi>
and therefore the Heavens must rest,
since by their motion it is that time is
measured. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>Rom. 8. 20.
That all the Creatures are made subject to

1. 4. The Sunne riseth, and the Sunne

                     <p>To these it may be answered:</p>
                     <p>In the first you may note a manifest
contradiction,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.</note> when hee will have the
Earth to bee hotter than the Water, by
reason of this motion; when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing
he acknowledges the Water to
move along with it; and therefore too in
the next Line he infers that the Water,
because of that heate and rare faction
which it receives from this motion with
the earth, must be incapable of so much
cold as to be congealed into Ice.</p>
                     <p>But unto that which may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to bee his meaning in this and the
next Argument: I answer, if he had fully
understood this opinion which hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
he would easily have apprehended
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20652:228"/>
that it could not be prejudiced by either
of these consequences. For we suppose
that not only this Globe of Earth and
Water, but also all the vaporous Aire
which invirons it, are carried along by
the same motion. And therfore, though
what hee sayes concerning the heate,
which would bee produced by such a
motion, were true; yet it would not bee
pertinent, since our Earth and Water,
and the Aire next unto them, are not by
this meanes severed from one another,
and so doe not come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of this Argument.</p>
                     <p>If any reply, That this will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hold true concerning the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Aire, where there is such
a separation of one body from another;
and so consequently, an answerable
heate: I answer,</p>
                     <p>1 'Tis not generally granted, That
motion in all kind of bodies do's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
heate; some restraine it onely to
follid bodies: affirming, That in those
which are fluid, it is rather the cause of
coldnesse. This is the reason (say they)
why running Waters are ever to our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20652:228"/>
sence the coolest: and why amongst
those Winds which proceed from the
same coasts of Heaven, about the
same time of the yeare, the strongest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
is the coldest? If you object, that
running Waters are not so soone frozen
as others: They answer, this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are thereby heated; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
unto congellation, it is requisite
that a Body should settle and rest, as
well as be cold.</p>
                     <p>2 If wee should grant a moderate
heate in those parts of the Aire, we have
not any experiment to the contrary, nor
would it prejudice the present opinion,
or common Principles.</p>
                     <p>As the sound of this motion is not
more heard than the Harmony of the
Heavens:<note place="margin">Ad. 3.</note> so neither is there any reason
why this motion should cause a sound,
more than the supposed motion of the
Heavens, which is likewise thought to
be continued unto the Aire hard by us.</p>
                     <p>This will prove the Earth to move as
well as the Heavens;<note place="margin">Ad. 4.</note> For that ha's, first,
a round Figure, as is generally granted.
Secondly, being considered as whole,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20652:229"/>
and in it's ptoper place, it is not heavy,
as was proved before: and as for the two
other conditions, neither are they true
of the Heavens; nor if they were, would
they at all conduce to their motion.</p>
                     <p>1 This Argument would prove that
the Sea did not ebbe and flow,<note place="margin">Ad. 5.</note> because
there is not the same kind of motion
in euery drop of Water: or that the
whole Earth is not sphaericall, because
every little piece of it is not of the same
Forme.</p>
                     <p>This is rather an illustration than a
proofe;<note place="margin">Ad. 6.</note> of if it do prove any thing, it
may serve as well for that purpose unto
which it is afterward applyed, where
the motion of every Planet is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to depend upon the revolution of the
Sunne.</p>
                     <p>That the Sunne and Planets do work
upon the Earth by their own reall daily
motion,<note place="margin">Ad. 7.</note> is the thing in question; and
therefore must not be taken for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ground.</p>
                     <p>Wee grant that the Earth is firme
and stable from all such motions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is jogged or uncertainly shaken.<note place="margin">Ad. 8.</note>

1 For the authoritie of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
which hee urges for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of these Scriptures; this will
be but a weake Argument against that
opinion which is already granted to bee
a Paradox.</p>
                     <p>2 The Scriptures themselves, in
their right meaning, will not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the present purpose.</p>
                     <p>As for that in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> if wee consult
the cohaerence, wee shall finde that
the scope of the Prophet is to set
forth the Glory of the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.
Wherein (hee sayes)
there shall not bee any need of the
Sunne or Moone, but Gods presence
shall supply them both: <hi>For the Lord
shall be unto thee an everlasting Light,
and thy God thy glory, ver.</hi> the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
and as for this Sunne and
Moone, it shall not goe downe, or
withdraw it selfe: but hee shall bee
an <hi>everlasting Light</hi> without intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.<note place="margin">Vid. Revel. 21. 23. item c. 22. ver. 5.</note>
So that 'tis evident hee speakes
of that Light which shall hereafter
bee, in stead of the Sunne and
Moone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:20652:230"/>
As for that in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> wee
yeeld, that <hi>time shall cease;</hi> but to say that
this depends upon the cessation of the
Heavens, is to beg the question, and to
suppose that which is to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi>
that time is measured by the motion of
the Heavens, &amp; not of the Earth.<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. c. 1. l. 2. quaest. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Perre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
(from whom this last argument was
borrowed without acknowledgement)
might have told him in the very same
place, that time do's not absolutely, and
universally depend upon the motion of
the Heavens, <hi>sed in motu &amp; successione, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juslibet
durationis,</hi> but in any such suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
by which duration may be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</p>
                     <p>As for that in the <hi>Romans,</hi> wee say,
that there are other vanities to which
the Heavenly Bodies are subject: As
first, unto many changes and alterations,
witnesse those Comets, which at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times have been discerned amongst
them; and then likewise to that generall
corruption, in which all the creatures
shall be involved at the last day.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 10, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>When
they shall passe away with a great noise, and
the Elements shall melt with fervent heate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:20652:230"/>
Thus you see, there is not any such
invincible strength in these arguments,
as might cause the Author of them to
triumph before hand with any great
noise of victory.</p>
                     <p>Another Objection like unto these
is taken from the Etymologie of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
words. Thus the Heavens are
called <hi>Aethera, ab</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> because they
are alwaies in motion, and the Earth
<hi>Vesta, quia vi stat,</hi> because of it's immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer: 'Twere no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to finde such proofes for
this opinion, as well as against it.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee may see that the Hebrew
word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>quia currit;</hi>
and <hi>Terra, non quod terratur, sed quod pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renni
cursu omnia terat,</hi> saith <hi>Calcagnius.</hi>
However, though wee suppose the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
to be never so true and genuine;
yet it can at the best but shew what the
more common opinion was of those
times when such names were first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
                     <p>But suppose all this were so,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> That
the Earth had such a diurnall revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20652:231"/>
yet how is it conceivable that
it should at the same time have two
distinct motions.</p>
                     <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> This may easily bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
if you consider how both
these motions doe tend the same way
from West to East. Thus a Bowle
being turned out of the hand, ha's two
motions in the Aire; one, whereby it is
carried round; the other, whereby it is
cast forward.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been delivered in
this Chapter, the indifferent Reader
may gather some satisfaction for those
Arguments which are usually urged
against this diurnall motion of the

                     <p>1 If we suppose the
Earth to be the cause of this motion,
then will those vast and glorious Bodies
of the Heavens be freed from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,
unnaturall swiftnes, which
must otherwise bee attributed unto
them.</p>
                     <p>For if the diurnall revolution be in
the Heavens,<note place="margin">Vid. Maest. Epit. Astr. lib. 1. in fine.</note> then it will follow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
that each Starre in the <hi>Equator</hi> must in
every houre move at the least 4529538
Germane miles. So that according
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20652:232"/>
to the observation of<note n="*" place="margin">De Prop. l. 5. prop. 58.</note> 
                        <hi>Cardan,</hi> who
tels us, that the pulse of a well tempered
man do's beat 4000 times in an houre;
one of these Starres in that space, whilst
the pulse beats once, must passe 1132
Germane miles (saith <hi>Alphraganus:)</hi> Or
according to <hi>Tycho</hi> 732 Germane miles.
But these numbers seem to be somwhat
of the least; and therefore many others
doe much inlarge them, affirming that
every Starre in the <hi>Equator,</hi> in one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the pulse, most move 2528 of
these miles.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the assertion of<note n="†" place="margin">Comment. in prim cap. Sphaerae.</note> 
                        <hi>Calvius,</hi> that
though the distance of the Orbs, and so
consequently their swiftnesse, seeme to
be altogether incredible; yet it is rather
farre greater in it self, than Astronomers
usually suppose it; &amp; yet (saith he) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common grounds, every star
in the <hi>Equator,</hi> must move 42398437½
miles in an houre. And though a man
should constantly travel 40 miles a day;
yet he would not be able to goe so far as
a Star do's in one houre, under 3904
yeares: Or if wee will suppose an Arrow
to bee of the same swiftnesse, then must
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20652:232"/>
it compasse this great Globe of Earth
and Water 1884 times in an hour. And
a Bird that could but fly as fast, might
go round the World seven times in that
space, whilest one could say, <hi>Ave Maria,
gratia plena, Dominus tecum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which though it be a pretty round
pace; yet you must conceive that all this
is spoken onely of the eighth Sphaere,
and so being compared to the swiftnesse
of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> is but a slow and
heavy motion.</p>
                     <p>For (saith the same author) the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of each Orbe is equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it's concave superficies from
the centre of the Earth. Thus the Orbe
of the Moone do's containe as much
space in it's thicknesse, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the neerest parts of that and the
centre. Thus also the eighth Sphaere is
as thicke as that whole space betwixt
the centre of the Earth, and it's owne
concave superficies. So likewise must it
be in those three other Orbes, which he
supposes to bee above the Starry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Now if we proportion their swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
according to this difference in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20652:233"/>
their bignesse, you may then conceive (if
you can) what a kinde of celeritie that
must be, by which the <hi>primum mobile</hi> wil
be whirled about.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tycho</hi> makes the distance of the Stars
to bee much lesse, and their motion
flower; and yet hee is faine to confesse,
that it is <hi>omni cogitatione celerior.</hi>

A man may more easily
conceive the possibilitie of any Fable
or Fiction how Beasts and Trees might
talke together, than how any materiall
Body should bee moved with such a
swiftnesse.</p>
                     <p>Not but that 'tis possible for God to
turne them about with a farre greater
velocitie. Nay 'tis possible for Art to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20652:233"/>
contrive a motion, which shall be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
slow in that proportion as this is
swift. But however, the question here, is
not what can be done, but what is most
likely to be don according to the usuall
course of Nature. 'Tis the part of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
in the resolution of naturall
events, not to fly unto the absolute Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God, and tell us what he can doe,
but what according to the usuall way of
Providence, is most likely to be done, to
find out such causes of things, as may
seem most easy &amp; probable to our reason.</p>
                     <p>If you ask what repugnancy there is in
the Heavens, unto so great a swiftnes: we
answer, Their being such vast, materiall
condensed substances, with which this
inconceivable motion cannot agree.</p>
                     <p>Since Motion and Magnitude are
two such Geometricall things, as beare
a mutuall proportion to one another;
therefore it may seeme convenient, that
slownesse should be more agreeable to a
great Body, and swiftnes to a lesser: and
so it would bee more consonant to the
Principles of Nature, that the Earth,
which is of a lesser quantitie, should be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20652:234"/>
appointed to such a motion as is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
proportionable to it's bignes, than
that the Heavens that are of such a vast
magnitude, should bee whirled about
with such an incredible swiftnes, which
do's as farre exceed the proportion of
their bignesse, as their bignesse do's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
this Earth, that is but as a point or
centre to them. 'Tis not likely that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in these constant and great workes,
should so much deviate from that usual
harmony and proportion which she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
in lesser matters. If this Globe of
Earth onely were appointed to move
every day round the Orbe of the fixed
Starres, though it be but a little Body,
and so more capable of a swift motion;
yet that swiftnesse would be so extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disproportionable unto it, that wee
could not with reason conceive it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
according to the usuall course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But now that the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of such strange bignesse, with so
many Starres, which do so farre exceed
the magnitude of our Earth, should
bee able to turne about with the
same celeritie: Oh 'tis altogether

beyond the fancy of a Poet or a mad
man.</p>
                     <p>For answer unto this Argument, our
adversaries tell us, that there is not in
the Heavens any repugnancie to so
swift a motion; and that whether wee
consider the nature of those Bodies, or

                     <p>2 Their magnitude will helpe
them in their swiftnesse:<note place="margin">Ross. lib. 1. sect. 1. ca. 1.</note> For the greater
any body is, the quicker will it be in it's

proceed from some externall Agent, as
the Winde will drive a great Cloud, or

                     <p>1 The sound of a Cannon,<note place="margin">Idem lib. 2. sect. 1. ca. 5.</note> in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time is carried for twenty miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>2 Though a Starre bee scituated
so remotely from us; yet the Eye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it in a moment, which is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some motion, either of the Species
of the Starre, or the Rayes of the Eye.
Thus also the Light do's in an instant
passe from one side of the Heaven to
another.<note place="margin">Idem lib. 1. sect. 1. cap. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 If the force of Pouder be able to
carry a Bullet with so great a swiftnesse,
we need not doubt then, but that the
Heavens are capable of such a celeritie,
as is usually attributed unto them.</p>
                     <p>Vnto these it may be answered:</p>
                     <p>1 Where they say that the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bodies are without all gravitie, wee
grant it, in the same sence as our Earth
also, being considered as whole, and in
it's proper place, may bee denied to bee
heavy: since this qualitie in the exactest
sence; can onely bee ascribed unto such
parts as are severed from the whole to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20652:235"/>
which they belong. But however, since
the Heavens or Stars are of a materiall
substance, 'tis impossible but there
should bee in them some ineptitude to
motion; because matter is of it selfe a
dull and sluggish thing; and by so much
the more, as it is kept close and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed
together. And though the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> doe with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
deny the Heavens to be capable
of any reluctancie to motion; yet it
were easie to prove the contrary out
of their owne Principles. 'Tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
how the upper Sphaere should
move the nether, unlesse their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
were full of rugged parts (which
they deny:) or else one of the Orbes
must leane upon the other with it's
weight, and so make it partake of it's
owne motion. And besides, they tell
us, that the farther any Sphaere is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the lesse
is it hindered by that in it's proper
course, and the sooner do's it finish it's
owne revolution. From whence it will
easily follow, that these Bodies have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
from one another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:20652:236"/>
I have often wondred, why amongst
the inchanted Buildings of the Poets,
they have not fained any Castle to bee
made of the same materials with the
sollid Orbs, since in such a fabrick there
would have been these eminent conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                     <p>1 It must needs be very pleasant, by
reason of it's perspicuitie, because it is
more diaphanous than the Aire it selfe,
and so the Walls of it could not hinder
the prospect any way.</p>
                     <p>2 Being so solid and impenitrable,
it must needs be excellent against al vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of weathers, as also against the
assaults of the enemy, who should not
be able to breake it with the most furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
batteries of the Ram, or pierce
it with any Cannon shot.</p>
                     <p>3 Being void of all heavinesse, a
man may carry it up and downe with
him, as a Snaile do's his House: and so
whether hee follow the enemy, or fly
from him, hee ha's still this advantage,
that he may take his castle and defence
along with him.</p>
                     <p>But then againe, there are on the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20652:236"/>
other side as many inconveniences.
For,</p>
                     <p>1 It's perspicuitie would make it
so open, that a man should not bee able
to retire himselfe into any private part
of it. And then,</p>
                     <p>2 Being so extremely sollid, as wel
as invisible, a man should be stil in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of knocking his head against every
Wall and Pillar; unlesse it were also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangible,
as some of the <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.</p>
                     <p>3 It's being without all gravitie,
would bring this inconvenience, that
every little puffe of wind would blow it
up and downe; since some of the same
sect are not ashamed to say, that the
Heavens are so utterly devoid of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that if but a little Fly should
justle against the vast frame of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
Sphaeres, hee would move them
out of their places.</p>
                     <p>A strong fancy, that could bee at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
might might make excellent sport
with this Astronomicall fiction.</p>
                     <p>So that this first evasion of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
will not shelter them from the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20652:237"/>
force of that Argument, which is taken
from the incredible swiftnes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
                     <p>2 Whereas they tell us in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, that a bigger Body, as a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
will naturally descend swifter
than a lesse, as a Pibble. I answer: This
is not because such a great Body is in
it selfe more easily movable; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the bigger any thing is which is
out of it's owne place, the stronger will
bee it's naturall desire of returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so consequently, the quicker
it's motion. But now those Bodies that
move circularly, are alwayes in their
proper scituations, and so the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is not applyable unto them. And
then, whereas 'tis said that Magnitude
do's alwayes adde to the swiftnesse of a
violent motion (as Winde will move
a great Shippe sooner than a little
Stone:) Wee answer, This is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a Shippe is more easily movable
in it selfe than a little Stone: For I
suppose the Objector will not thinke
hee can throw the one as farre as
the other; but because these little
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20652:237"/>
Bodies are not so liable to that kinde
of violence from whence their motion
do's proceed.</p>
                     <p>As for those instances which are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to illustrate the possibilitie of this
swiftnesse in the Heavens, wee answer:
The passage of a sound is but very slow
in comparison to the motion of the
Heavens. And then besides, the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Species of sound or sight,
which are accidents, are not fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the like celeritie in a materiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
and so likewise for the Light
which<note n="*" place="margin">De Anima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe, and with
him the generalitie of Philosophers,
doe for this very reason prove not to
bee a Body, because it moves with
such swiftnesse, of which (it seemes)
they thought a Body to bee incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Nay, the<note n="†" place="margin">Ross. lib. 2. sect. 1. ca. 4.</note> Objector himselfe
in another place, speaking of Light
in reference to a substance, do's say:
<hi>Lumen est accidens, sic species rei visae,
&amp; alia est ratio substantiarum, alia acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that of a Bullet, wee answer: Hee
might as well have illustrated the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20652:238"/>
swiftnes of a bullet, which wil passe 4 or
5 miles in 2 minutes, by the motion of a
hand in a Watch, which passes 2 or 3 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in 12 houres; there being a greater
disproportion betwixt the motion of
the heavens, and the swiftnes of a Bullet,
than there is 'twixt the swiftnes of a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and the motion of a hand in a watch.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument to this purpose
may be taken from the chiefe end of the
Diurnall and Annuall motions,<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> which
is to distinguish betwixt Night and
Day, Winter and Summer; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
to serve for the commodities
and seasons of the habitable World.
Wherfore it may seeme more agreeable
to the Wisedome of Providence, for to
make the Earth as well the efficient, as
the finall cause of this motion: Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since nature in her other operations
do's never use any tedious difficult
means to performe that which may as
well bee accomplished by shorter and
easier wayes. But now, the appearances
would be the same, in respect of us, if
only this little point of Earth were
made the subject of these motions, as if
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20652:238"/>
the vast Frame of the World, with all
those Stars of such number and bignes
were moved about it.<note place="margin">Galen.</note> 'Tis a common
Maxime, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do's nothing in vaine, but in all her
courses do's take the most compendious
way. 'Tis not therefore (I say) likely, that
the whole Fabricke of the Heavens,
which do so much exceed our Earth in
magnitude and perfection, should bee
put to undergoe so great and constant a
Worke in the service of our Earth,
which might more easily save all that
labour by the circumvolution of it's
owne Body; especially, since the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
doe not by this motion attaine any
farther perfection for themselves, but
are made thus serviceable to this little
Ball of Earth. So that in this case it
may seeme to argue as much improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in nature to imploy them in this
motion, as it would in a<note n="*" place="margin">Lansberg.</note> Mother, who
in warming her Childe, would rather
turne the fire about that, than that about
the sire: Or in a<note n="†" place="margin">Keplar.</note> Cook, who would not

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20652:239"/>
it:<note n="*" place="margin">Galilaeus.</note> Or in a man, who ascending some
high Tower, to save the labour of stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his head, should rather desire that
all the Regions might successively bee
turned before his eye, that so hee might
easily take a view of them.</p>
                     <p>Wee allow every Watch-maker so
much wisdome as not to put any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Instrument, which is superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or may bee supplied an easier way:
and shall wee not thinke that Nature
ha's as much providence as every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Mechanicke? Or can wee imagine
that She should appoint those nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and vast Bodies, the Stars, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
us with such a swift and restlesse
motion, so full of confusion and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
when as all this might as well
be done by the revolution of this little
Ball of Earth?</p>
                     <p>Amongst the severall parts of the
World,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> there are six Planets which are
generally granted to move. As for the
Sun and the Earth, and the fixed Starres,
it is yet in question, which of them are
naturally indowed with the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Now common reason will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20652:239"/>
unto us, that motion which is most
agreeable to that which in kind and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
is most neer to those Bodies that
undoubtedly are moved. But now there
is one eminent qualification, wherin the
Earth do's agree with the Planets; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Sun, together with the fixed stars,
do in the same respect differ from them:
and that is Light, which all the Planets
and so too the Earth, are fain to borrow
elswhere, whilest the Sun and the Stars
have it of their owne. From whence it
may bee probably concluded, that the
Earth is rather the subject of this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than the other. To this it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Sun and Stars seem to be of
a more excellent Nature than the other
parts of the World; and therfore should
in reason be indowed with the best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.
But now motion is not so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a condition as rest. That is but a kind
of wearisome and servile thing; wheras,
this is usually ascribed to God himself:

                        <note n="†" place="margin">De Coelo, li. 2. cap. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, 'tis very agreeable
to reason that the time appointed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20652:240"/>
for the revolution of each Orbe, should
be proportionable to it's bignesse. But
now this can onely be by making the
Earth a Planet, and the subiect of the
annuall and diurnall motions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis probable, that this do's rather
move than the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>According to the common <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
the <hi>primum mobile</hi> will move round in
a day. <hi>Saturne</hi> in thirty yeares. <hi>Iupiter</hi> in
twelve. <hi>Mars</hi> in two. The <hi>Sunne, Venus,</hi>
and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which have severall Orbes,
yet will agree in their revolutions, being
each of them about a yeare in finishing
their courses: Whereas by making the
Earth a Planet, there will be a just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betwixt the bignesse of the
Orbes, and the time of their motions:
For then, next to the Sunne or Centre,
there will be the Sphaere of <hi>Mercury;</hi>
which as it is but narrow in it's diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so likewise is it quick in it's motion,
running it's course in eighty eight days.
<hi>Venus,</hi> that is next unto it, in 224 dayes.
The Earth in 365 daies, or a yeare. <hi>Mars,</hi>
in 687 dayes. <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 4332 dayes. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi>
in 10759 dayes. Thus likewise is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20652:240"/>
it with those <hi>Medicean</hi> Starres that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> That which is lowest
amongst them, finishes his course in
two and twenty houres; the next in
three dayes and a half; the third, in seven
dayes; and the farthest in seventeen days.
Now as it is (according to <hi>Aristotles</hi>
confession) more likely that Nature
should observe such a due proportion
betwixt the Heavenly Orbes: so is it
more probable, that the Earth should
move, rather than the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>This may likewise be confirmed from
the appearance of Comets:<note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which, there are three things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
granted, or if they were not,
might be easily proved: namely,</p>
                     <p>1 That there are divers Comets in
the Aire, betwixt the Moone and our
Earth.</p>
                     <p>2 That many of these Comets do
seeme to rise and set as the Stars.</p>
                     <p>3 That this appearing motion is
not properly their owne, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
unto them from somewhat else.</p>
                     <p>But now, this motion of theirs cannot
be caused by the Heavens; and therefore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20652:241"/>
it must necessarily proceed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of our Earth.</p>
                     <p>That the Moones Orbe cannot carry
along with it the greater part of the aire
wherein these Comets are placed, might
easily be proved from the common
grounds. For the concave Superficies of
that Sphaere is usually supposed to bee
exactly terse and smooth; so that the
meer touch of it cannot turne about the
whole Element of Fire, with a motion
that is not naturall unto it. Nor could
this Elementarie Fire which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to be of a more rarified and subtle
Nature, communicate the same motion
to the thicker Aire, and that to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(as some affirme:) For by what
meanes could that smooth Orbe take
hold of the adjoyning Aire. To this
<hi>Sarsius</hi> answers, that there are great
gibbosities, and mountainous inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in the concavitie of the lowest
Sphaere, and by these is it inabled to
carry along with it the Fire and Aire.
But<note n="*" place="margin">Antarist. cap. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Fromondus</hi> tels him, <hi>Fictitiaista &amp;
ad fugam reperta sunt.</hi> And yet his owne
Conjecture is scarse so good, when hee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20652:241"/>
affirmes, that this motion of the aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Aire, as also of that elementary
Aire hard by us, is caused by that
ruggednesse which there is in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Planets; of which opinion
wee may with as good reason say as hee
sayes to <hi>Sarsius: Fictitia ista, &amp; ad fugam
reperta;</hi> These things are meere fictions
invented for shifts, and without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
ground.</p>
                     <p>But now this appearance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
may easily be resolved, if wee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the earth to move. For then, though
they did still remaine in their wonted
places; yet this, by it's diurnall revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
successively with drawing it self from
them, they wil appear to rise &amp; set. And
therefore, according to this common
naturall experiment, it is more probable
that the Earth should move, than the
Heavens.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument urged by some,
to prove that this Globe of Earth is
easily movable, is taken from the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those who affirme that the accesse
of any weight unto a new place:<note place="margin">Vid. Vasq. lib. 1. disp. 2. cap. 816.</note> as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an army do's make the Earth poise
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20652:242"/>
it selfe afresh, and change the centre of
gravitie that it had before: but this is
not generally granted; and therefore
not to bee insisted on as a common
ground.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose likewise is that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> who from <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
his saying, that hee could move
the Earth, if he knew where to stand and
fasten his instrument; concludes, that
the Earth is easily movable; whereas
'twas the intent of <hi>Archimedes</hi> in that
speech, to shew the infinit power of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines:
there being no weight so great,
but that an instrument might be inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to move it.</p>
                     <p>Before we finish this Chapter, tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that we enquire what kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
that is from which those motions
that <hi>Copernicus</hi> ascribes unto the Earth,
do's proceed. Whether or no it be some
Animall Power, that do's assist (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle)</hi>
or informe (as <hi>Keplar</hi> thinks) or
else some other naturall motive quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which is intrinsicall unto it.</p>
                     <p>Wee may observe, That when the
proper genuine cause of any motion is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20652:242"/>
not obvious, men are very prone to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
unto that which they discerne
to be the most frequent Originall of it
in other things, Life. Thus the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
affirme, the Soule of the Water to bee
the cause of the ebbing and flowing of
the Sea.<note place="margin">Senec. Nat. Qu. lib. 5. cap. 5, 6.</note> Thus others thinke the Winde
to proceed from the Life of the Aire,
whereby it is able to move it selfe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
waies, as other living creatures. And
upon the same grounds doe the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
Stoicks,</hi> and some of the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
affirme the Heavens to bee anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
From hence likewise it is, that so
many do maintaine <hi>Aristotle</hi> his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning <hi>Intelligences:</hi> which some
of his followers, the Schoole-men, doe
confirme out of Scripture. From that
place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. where 'tis said, <hi>The
Powers of the Heaven shall bee shaken.</hi> In
which words, by <hi>Powers</hi> (say they) are
meant the Angels, by whose power it
is, that the Heavens are moved. And so
likewise in that, <hi>Iob,</hi> 9. 13. Where the
vulgar ha's it, <hi>Sub quo curvantur, qui por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
orbem;</hi> that is, the Intelligences.
Which Text, might serve altogether as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20652:243"/>
well to prove the Fable of <hi>Atlas</hi> and
<hi>Hercules.</hi> Thus <hi>Cajetan</hi> concludes from
that place in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> 136. 5. Where
'tis said, <hi>God by wisdome made the heavens:</hi>
or according to the vulgar, <hi>Qui fecit Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
intellectu,</hi> That the Heavens are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by an intelligent Soule.</p>
                     <p>If wee consider the originall of this
opinion, we shall find it to proceed from
that mistake of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who thought
the Heavens to be Eternall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to require such a moving cause, as
being of an immateriall Substance,
might be exempted from all that weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and inconstancie, which other
things are liable unto.</p>
                     <p>But now this ground of his is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, since 'tis certain, That the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
had a beginning, and shall have an
end. However, the imploying of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in these motions of the World, is
both superfluous, and very improbable.</p>
                     <p>1 Because a naturall Power, intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
to those Bodies, will serve the
turne as well. And as for other operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are to bee constant and
regular, Nature do's commonly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20652:243"/>
make use of some inwarde Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                     <p>2 The Intelligences being immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
cannot immediatly worke upon a
Body. Nor do's any one tell us what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
they should make use of in
this businesse. They have not any hands
to take hold of the Heavens, or turne
them about. And that opinion of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,
Dur and, Soncinas,</hi> with other School-men,
seemes to bee without all reason;
who make the faculty, whereby the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
move the Orbs, to be the very same
with their Vnderstandings and Will:
So that if an Angell doe but meerely
suspend the Act of willing their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they must necessarily stand still; and
on the contrary, his only willing them
to move, shall bee enough to carry them
about in their severall courses. Since it
were then a needlesse thing for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to have appointed Angels unto
this businesse, which might have been
done as well by the only Will of God.
And besides, how are the Orbes capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of perceiving this Will in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences?
Or if they were, yet what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20652:244"/>
Facultie have they of themselves,
which can inable them to obey it?</p>
                     <p>Now as it would bee with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
so likewise is it with the Earth,
which may bee turned about in it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall
revolution, without the helpe of
Intelligences, by some motive Power
of it's owne, that may be intrinsicall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet enquired, what cause there
is of it's annuall motion: I answer, 'Tis
easily conceivable, how the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
may serve for both these, since
they tend the same way from West to
East.</p>
                     <p>However, that opinion of <hi>Keplar</hi> is
not very improbable, That all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Planets are moved round by the
Sunne, which once in twenty five, or
twenty six dayes, do's observe a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about it's owne Axis, and so carry
along the Planets that encompasse it;
which Planets are therefore slower or
swifter, according to their distances
from him. If you aske by what means
the Sunne can produce such a motion?</p>
                     <p>He answers: By sending forth a kind
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20652:244"/>
of Magneticke Vertue in strait Lines,
from each part of it's Body; of which
there is alwaies a constant succession: so
that as soone as one beame of this vigor
ha's passed a Planet, there is another
presently takes hold of it, like the teeth
of a Wheele.</p>
                     <p>But how can any vertue hold out to
such a distance?</p>
                     <p>He answers: First, as light and heate,
together with those other secret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which work upon Minerals in the
Bowels of the Earth: so likewise may
the Sunne send forth a magneticke, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertue, whose power may bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to the farthest Planets. Secondly,
if the Moone, according to common
Philosophy may move the Sea, why
then may not the Sun move this Globe
of Earth?</p>
                     <p>In such <hi>Quaere's</hi> as these, wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
only from conjectures that speech
of the wise man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 11. being more

                     <p>1 As for the difference betwixt days

There will not
appeare any difference, whether or no
the Eye be moved from the Object, or
the Object from the Eye. And therfore
I cannot chuse but wonder that a man of
any reason or sence should make choise
of no better an Argument to conclude
his booke withall, than that which were
read at the later end of <hi>Al. Ross.</hi> where
he infers, that the Earth do's not move,
because then the shadow in a Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall

                     <p>2 As for the difference of Moneths,
we say, That the diverse illumination of
the Moone, the different bignes of her
Body, her remaining for a longer or
shorter time in the earth's shadow, when
she is eclipsed, &amp;c. may well enough be
solved by supposing her to move above
our Earth, in an Eccentricall Epicycle.

thirty minutes. The Points B. C. are
imagined to be the Poles, B. the North
Pole, and C. the South.</p>
                     <p>Now if we suppose this Earth to turn
about its owne <hi>Axis,</hi> by a diurnall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then every Point of it will describe a
paralell Circle, which will be either
bigger or lesser, according to it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Poles. The chiefe of
them are the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> D. E. The
two <hi>Tropicks,</hi> F. G. and H. I. The two
<hi>Polar</hi> Circles M. N. the <hi>Arcticke,</hi> and K.
L. the <hi>Antarcticke:</hi> of which, the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall</hi>
only is a great Circle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will alwaies be equally divided by
the Line of Illumination M. L. wheras
the other paralels are thereby distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into unequal parts. Amongst which
parts, the diurnall Arches of those that
are towards B. the North Pole, are big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Nocturnall, when our
Earth is in ♑ and the Sunne appeares in
♋ Insomuch, that the whole <hi>Arcticke</hi>
Circle is enlightened, and there is day
for halfe a yeare together under that
Pole.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Earth proceeds to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20652:249"/>
the other <hi>Solstice</hi> at ♋ and the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in ♑ then that <hi>Hemisphere</hi> must
be involved in darknesse, which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
partake of Light. And those para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
towards the North &amp; South Poles
will still bee divided by the same ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie.
But those bigger parts which
were before enlightened, will now bee
darkened, <hi>&amp; vice versa.</hi> As when the
Earth was in N. the <hi>Arcticke</hi> Circle
M. N. was wholly enlightned, and the
<hi>Antarcticke,</hi> K. L. altogether in the dark.
So now, when it is in A. the <hi>Antarcticke,</hi>
K. L. will be wholly in the Light, and
the other M. N. altogether obscured.
Whereas the Sun before was verticall
to the inhabitants at the <hi>Tropick</hi> F. G.
So now is he in the same scituation to
those that live under the other <hi>Tropicke,</hi>
H. I. And whereas before the Pole did
incline twenty three degrees thirty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
towards the Sunne, so now do's it
recline as much from him. The whole
difference will amount to 47 degrees,
which is the distance of one <hi>Tropicke</hi>
from the other.</p>
                     <p>But now in the two other Figures,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20652:249"/>
when the Earth is in either of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctialls</hi>
♈♎ the Circle of Illumination
will passe through both the Poles; and
therefore must divide all the paralels
into equall parts. From whence it will
follow, that the Day and Night must
then bee equall in all places of the
World.</p>
                     <p>As the Earth is here represented in ♎
it turnes only the enlightened part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: as it is in ♈ wee see it's noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Hemisphere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that according to this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
wee may easily and exactly reconcile
every appearance concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Dayes, and Nights,
Winter and Summer, together with
all those other varieties which depend
upon them.</p>

than at another; that when She seemes
biggest and neerest unto us, wee then
discerne her as being perfectly round.
Therefore doth this Planet also move
in a Circle that incompasses the Sun.
Which Circle do's not containe the
Earth within it; because then, <hi>Venus</hi>
would sometimes be in <hi>opposition</hi> to the
Sunne; whereas, 'tis generally granted,
that She never yet came so far as to be in
a <hi>Sextile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this Circle below the Sun (as
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> supposeth) because then this
Planet, in<note n="†" place="margin">Matutina Vespertin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

would appeare horned, which She do's
not.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it above the Sunne, because
then She would alwaies appeare in the
Full, and never Horned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:20652:253"/>
From whence it will follow, that this
Orbe must necessarily bee betwixt the
Earth and the Sunne; as that at C.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Mars:</hi> 'tis observed, That hee
do's appeare sixty times bigger when he
is neer us, than at his greatest distance;
that he is sometimes in <hi>opposition</hi> to the
Sunne. From whence we may conclude,
that his Orbe do's containe our Earth
within it. 'Tis observed also, that he do's
constantly appeare in the Full, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Horned; from whence likewise it is
manifest, that the Sunne is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within it's Orbe, as it is in that
which is represented by the Circle, E.</p>
                     <p>And because the like appearances are
observed in <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> (though
in lesse degrees) therefore wee may with
good reason conceive them to be in the
Heavens, after some such maner as they
are here set downe in the Figure, by the
Circles, F. G.</p>
                     <p>As for the Moone: because Shee is
sometimes in <hi>opposition</hi> to the Sunne;
therefore must her Orbe comprehend in
it the Earth: because She appeares dark
in her Conjunction, and sometimes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:20652:253"/>
eclipses the Sunne; therefore that must
necessarily be without her Orbe, as it is
in that <hi>Epicycle</hi> at H. In the Centre of
which, the Earth must necessarily bee
scituated according to all those appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
mentioned before. So that the
Orbe of it's annuall motion, will bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the Circle D.</p>
                     <p>All which appearances, cannot so
well be reconciled by <hi>Ptolomey, Tycho,
Origanus,</hi> or by any other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> as
by this of <hi>Copernicus.</hi> But the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these to the severall Planets, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with sundry other particulars,
concerning the <hi>Theoricall</hi> part of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi>
you may see more fully set downe
by those who have purposely handled
this subject, <hi>Copernicus, Rheticus, Galilae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
but more especially <hi>Keplar:</hi> nnto
whom I doe acknowledge my selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for sundry particulars in this
discourse.</p>
                     <p>I have done with that which was the
chiefe purpose of the present Treatise;
namely, the removall of those common
prejudices that men usually entertaine
against this opinion. It remaines, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20652:254"/>
by way of conclusion, I endeavour to
stirre up others unto these kind of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which by most men are so much
neglected.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the most rationall way, in the
prosecution of severall Objects, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
our love and endeavour after
every thing, according to the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and desireablenesse of it. But now,
amongst all Earthly Contentments,
there is nothing either better in it selfe,
or more convenient for us, than this kind
of Learning; and that, whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it according to it's <hi>generall</hi> Nature,
as a <hi>Science;</hi> or according to it's more
<hi>speciall</hi> Nature, as <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Science.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Consider it as a <hi>Science.</hi> Certaine
it is, that amongst the varietie of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
those are more eligible which
conduce unto the welfare of that which
is our best part, our Soules. 'Tis not so
much the pleasing of our sences, or the
increasing of our Fortunes, that do's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our industry, as the information of
our Iudgements, the improvement of
our Knowledge. Whatever the World
may thinke; yet it is not a vast Estate, a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20652:254"/>
Noble Birth, an eminent place, that can
adde any thing to our true reall Worth;
but it must be the degrees of that which
makes us <hi>Men,</hi> that must make us <hi>better
Men,</hi> the endowments of our Soule, the
enlargement of our Reason. Were it
not for the contemplation of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
the heathen<note n="*" place="margin">Praef. ad lib. 1. Nat. Quaest.</note> 
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> would not so
much as thanke the gods for his Being.
<hi>Nisi ad haec admitterer non fuit opere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium

non est vita tanti, ut sudem, ut aestuem.</hi>
Take but away this benefit, &amp; he would
not thinke Life worth the sweating for.
So much happinesse could hee discerne
in the Studies of Nature. And therfore
as a <hi>Science</hi> in generall, it may very well
deserve our Love and Industry.</p>
                     <p>2 Consider it as such a particular
<hi>Science, Astronomy:</hi> the Word signifies
the Law of the Stars; and the Hebrewes

                     <p>Now this of all naturall <hi>Sciences</hi> may
best of all challenge our Industry; and
that, whither you consider it,
<list>
                           <item>1 Absolutely, as it is in it selfe: or,</item>
                           <item>2 As it stands in reference to us.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 As it is in it selfe. The excellencie
of any <hi>Science</hi> may be judged of (saith
the Philosopher) first, by the excellency
of the Object. Secondly, by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of it's demonstrations.</p>
                     <p>1. For the <hi>Object.</hi> It is no lesse than
the whole World (since our Earth also
is one of the Planets) more especially
those vast and glorious Bodies of the
Heavens. So that in this respect, it far
exceeds all those barren, empty specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
about <hi>Materia prima,</hi> and <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale,</hi>
and such like cob webs of learning;
in the study of which, so many doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
their younger yeares. And for the
same reason likewise is it to be preferr'd
before all those other <hi>Sciences,</hi> whose
subjects are not either of so wide an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or so excellent a Nature.</p>
                     <p>2 For the <hi>demonstrations</hi> of <hi>Astronomy,</hi>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:20652:255"/>
they are as infallible as truth it self; and
for this reason also do's it excel all other
knowledge, which do's more depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conjectures &amp; uncertaintie. They are
onely those who want skill in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of this <hi>Science,</hi> that mistrust the
conclusions of it. Since therefore in
these respects, it is one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Sciences</hi> in Nature, it may best
deserve the industry of Man, who is one
of the best Works of Nature. Other
creatures were made with their Heads
and Eies turned downwards: would you
know why man was not created so too?
why it was, that he might be an Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer?

                     <p>True indeed, an ordinary view and

enquiry into their Natures, will
raise our Vnderstandings unto a neerer
Knowledge, and greater Admiration of
the Deitie. As it is in those inferiour
things, where the meere outside of a
Man, the comelinesse and majesty of his
countenance, may bee some Argument
from whence to inferre the excellencie
of his Creator. But yet the subtle Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomist,
who searches more deeply into
this wonderfull structure, may see a
cleerer evidence for this in the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the inward Fabricke, the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

all those secret contrivances in the

the proving of a God, and making Men

                     <p>Now when wee lay all this together,
that he who hath most in the World,

is but an inconsiderable point; and
yet that this whole <hi>Vniverse</hi> do's not
beare so great a proportion to the Soul
of man, as the earth do's unto that: I say,
when a man in some retired thoughts
shall lay all this together, it must needs
stir up his spirits to a contempt of these
earthly things, and make him place his
love &amp; endeavour upon those comforts
that may be more answerable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
