            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He meant to haue mounted the <hi>Alpes,</hi> that ſtumbled by the way at a ſorie Mole-hill. But I ſee it is Souldiers lucke, for when they hope to effect wonders, they conclude with iuſt nothing.

            <p>GEntlemen, if I haue fitted your humors with this fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, much good doe it yee, I would it were for you: if it be offenſiue to ſome queaſie ſtomacke, it proceedeth rather vpon ſome diſtempered humour in the partie ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then of any fault of mine: and yet to ſpeake truly, I meant not to pleaſe all. For when I firſt vndertooke the ſubiect, I knew it could not be handled without offence: but as I haue not detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any one particularly of mine owne knowledge, ſo if any man vpon a guiltie conſcience will accuſe himſelfe, his fault be vpon his owne head: ſhould we forbeare to ſpeake againſt vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vicious will be offended? if that might once be brought to paſſe, it were high time to follow <hi>Tarltons</hi> aduice, to pull downe the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſet vp the <hi>Ale-houſe.</hi> And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inferiour officers would then fall to decay: amongſt the reſt, the poore hang-man would miſcarie for want of maintenance, but let them comfort themſelues, vice muſt be corrected, and ſinne will be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And for the hangman me thinks I durſt warrant him worke, ſo long as there is a Pope in <hi>Rome,</hi> or a Papiſt in great Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>Now for mine owne part, that haue taken vpon me to ſpeake of ſo many faults, let me firſt manifeſt mine owne, I confeſſe I haue iested at abuſe, and I haue a little ſcoffed at thoſe that doe vſe themſelues to make a ſcoffe at vertue. In the ſetting downe whereof I haue imitated the Painter, who applieth colours but according to his picture. So in theſe diſcourſes, I haue kept a Souldiers <hi>Decorum,</hi> expreſſing matter of little regard, with words and phraſes beſt befitting the ſubiect. And where I haue to deale with more ſerious circumſtance, I haue tempered my ſtile with words and tearmes thereafter.</p>

And for him that ſhal reade a Lecture of Abſtinence, when men be in the midſt of their cuppes, ſhould haue ill audience: and where men haue betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to reſt, the ſound of the Trumpet, and the clattering of Armour doth rather interrupt their quiet, then augment their courage. An Orator at a table, being requeſted to ſpeake of Eloquence anſwered; <hi>Thoſe things that are fit for the place and time preſent, I am ignorant of: and that which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I know at this time would be out of ſeaſon.</hi> Thus euerie thing is made gracefull, or diſgracefull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to time and place.

<pb facs="tcp:16371:5"/>there is no man willing to heare of his owne miſſe; when he that ſhould but looke into the ſinnes of the mightie Giants of the world muſt neds periſh, when he that ſhould but ſearch out their euill that will wallow in wickedneſſe, and yet will not bee controlled, is thought vnworthy to liue in a wel-gouerned Common-wealth: <note place="margin">Auguſtus wel pleaſed with fault finders.</note>yet the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was neuer angrie with accuſers, but thought it neceſſarie, that where there were ſtore of vices, there ſhould likewiſe be many to find fault.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Alexander</hi> vnderſtanding that ſome had breathed out bad reports againſt him, ſought no reuenge, but ſaid: <hi>That it belonged to Kings, to do well, and to heare ill.</hi> It hath bin a cuſtom in ſome parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> that when their King or any other great commander amongſt them were dead, if any man came againſt him, to charge him with any notorious vice, or to oppoſe any faults againſt him, he was denied buriall, which amongſt them was eſteemd to be a greter infelicity, then if a man were depriued from the ioyes of heauen. <note place="margin">Paſquils piller</note>
               <hi>Paſquilles</hi> pillar was tollerated in <hi>Rome,</hi> to reprehend all ſorts of ſinnes, till they touched the <hi>Pope</hi> with his Cleargie. <note place="margin">many reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more for feare of the world, then for feare of God.</note>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thought it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie point of pollicie, that there ſhould be ſuch reprouers, whereby to repreſſe enormitie in thoſe for feare of worldly ſhame, that otherwiſe neither remorſe of conſcience, nor any feare of their gods, could haue reſtrained or kept in compas. The like conceit was had amongſt the <hi>Thurines,</hi> where it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16371:5"/>was thought the wicked were rather reſtrained for feare of worldly ſhame, then for any feare or dread of God. Euerie man had free libertie therefore to ſpeake, either for the generall good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, or to reprooue any mans priuate enormitie, till in the ende they made a lawe, that no man ſhould finde fault at anie abuſe, vnleſſe at <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie.</hi>

            <p>I remember a merrie ieſt of two prating com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, eſpecially noted for their many wordes: the one of them growing a little ſicke of a feuer Iordan, the other came to ſee him, who after his departure being met withall by a ſecond friend, that was likewiſe going to viſite this ſicke man, and knowing the other to be newly come from him, asked of him how he did: the other anſwered, in no danger of death, for I find he hath not forgot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16371:6"/>his prating: the other comming where the ſicke man was lying on his bed, after ſome comfortable words, told him whom he met withall: it is true ſaid the other, he was here to ſee me, but he ſo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me with his prattle, that I was glad when he was gone.</p>

            <p>God created Nature, and gaue it a lawe, which lawe he will haue it likewiſe to followe; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may wee more woonder at the Philoſophers for the inſight they had in naturall things, or for the blindneſſe in the knowledge of Him that was the Author of all things, who the more they labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Philoſophy to comprehend, by ſo much the ſooner they loſt themſelues, ſo that one of their moſt profound Clarkes called <hi>Symonides,</hi> deſired by <hi>Cicero</hi> the Tyrant, to inquire what God was, and demaunding but one dayes reſpite, was in his deepeſt imaginations ſo confounded, that ſeeing the farther hee ſought, the more he failed, was enforced to ſtay his attempts, and to ſubiect his opinion to the inſcrutable eſſence of the moſt Higheſt.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy in theſe cauſes concerning God, is not able to render any reaſon, becauſe they are not martialled vnder her iuriſdiction.

            <p>This is partly confirmed by our Sauiour Chriſt by the example of the Steward, who being called to an account by his Maſter, reſerued a round pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the goods to his owne vſe; which wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though it were faultie, yet Chriſt in this ſort commended it, ſaying; <hi>The children of this world are wiſer in their generation then the children of light.</hi> But theſe natural Philoſophers, becauſe they could not reach into the height of Diuinitie, deuiſed ſo fond and ill ioynted a cauſe, as Lady <hi>Fortune,</hi> to whoſe power they might impute good or badde ſucceſſe.</p>

            <p>Some of the Philoſophers will needes haue it, that all occurrents (whatſoeuer) are gouerned by a fatall deſtinie, and this fate or deſtinie they do call God. As <hi>Criſippus</hi> firſt ſpeaking of a ſpirituall power gouerning the whole world, concludeth it to be the deſtinie, the eternall purpoſe and decree of all things.</p>

            <p>Who is ſo fooliſh to thinke, that the affaires of mortall men are carried headlong, or do happen, as it were by chance-medley: he is (no doubt) in a pittifull caſe, that will not acknowledge the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

               <note place="margin">A King muſt not be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed of treaſure.</note>The expences of a King is great, and therefore he muſt be well ſtored, and ſtil prepared with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to beare out the charge. It is he that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Realmes and ſubiects, from the ſpoyle and rapine of forreigne forces: It is he that muſt be prouident <hi>in the time of peace,</hi> to haue all things in a readineſſe againſt <hi>the time of warre.</hi> Can he then be vnprouided of treaſure? <note place="margin">Warres not to be mainteined with emptie coffers.</note>Or ſhall his ſubiects grudge and murmure againſt him, if he ſupply his wants by Taxes or Subſidies, which are warranted by the word of God, and which the Prince may take with a verie good conſcience, for the bearing out of his expences, which doe concerne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and ſafetie of the ſubiects:<note place="margin">Many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Scriptures to warrant it.</note> the king muſt defend all, and there is no reaſon but his wantes ſhould be ſupplied by all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A neceſſarie conſideration for princes.</note>There is yet a matter of great importance for a Prince to conſider of, that vnder this priuilege of taxing his ſubiects for his needfull and neceſſarie affaires, hee doth not oppreſſe them for any vaine or idle expences; for what is he that dare preſcribe limits or bounds to a King? what he ſhould take or leaue of his ſubiects. If he haue not a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of himſelfe, if he haue not a charitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards his people, of his owne princely nature, who dare croſſe him in his courſes, or tell him of thoſe faults wherein he offendeth? or what Subiect (that knoweth his duetie) dare ſpeake againſt a princes prerogatiue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16371:64"/>It was not without cauſe therefore, that <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> with ſuch admiration did ſay, <hi>Miror ſi ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis rectorum poteſt ſaluari.</hi> And <hi>Apolonius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the treaſure taken by a Prince from his ſubiects by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, is more baſe then yron: for being wette with the teares of the people, it cankereth and becommeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Subiects muſt not reſiſt.</note>That Prince therefore that will exact more then inough, between god &amp; his own conſcience be it; but the ſubiect is to make no reſiſtance. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath left vs example, for hee himſelfe paid that was impoſed vpon him: and when the Scribes and Phariſies demaunded of him, whether it were lawfull to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he did not impugne it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Kings haue need of great priuileges.</note>Kings and Princes had neede of great priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, their cares are many, and farre exceeding the common capacitie of the ſimple multitude. A Princes royall Robe doth couer many cares, and their guardes are not able to defend the aſſaults of troubled thoughts.</p>
            <p>Better for a <hi>Prince</hi> to bee <hi>Irus</hi> for contentment, then to enioy the Empire of the whole world. For whileſt he ſeeth all pleaſures, he enioyeth none, and in the middeſt of his ſugred dainties, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp ſorrowes, euery day tyred with ſuters, troubled with <hi>Damocles,</hi> euerie night ſubiect to broken ſleepes, troubleſome thoughts, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth dreames.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Kings</hi> daintie diſhes are alwayes ſawced with ſuſpition, &amp; there is reaſon; for although amongſt

               <note place="margin">Chamber counſellers that are ſtill buzzing in the eares of Princes.</note>the vulgar, too much ielouſie ſauoureth of little wit, yet more hurt commeth of the light beleefe of Princes, then of miſtruſt: amongſt the reſt, <hi>Thales</hi> admoniſheth <hi>Kings and Princes to ſuſpect him moſt, that is most buſie ſtill to be whiſpering in his eare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> aduiſeth, that a Prince ought earneſtly, and aboue all things, to haue care of things diuine, he rendreth this reaſon; <hi>For thoſe ſubiects doe hope that they ſhall ſuffer leſſe iustice from that Prince whom they deeme religious, and who feareth God: and leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies are complotted againſt him, as hauing God him ſelfe for his helpe and ſuccour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the time preſent.</note>Let me now ſpeake but a word of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and let me ſpeake truly of our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, here within this Empire <hi>of great Britain:</hi> with what zeale and feruencie hath our royall King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed that Religion of the Goſpel, the which although hee found it here readie planted to his hand, yet with how many ingins hath the Pope and the Diuell ſought ſithence, to vndermine and ouerthrow it, and are yet euerie day endeuoring, if his Maieſty himſelfe were not the more firme and conſtant.</p>
            <p>He hath then bleſſed himſelfe, his Realmes, and Dominions with the light of the Goſpel; and if the happineſſe of peace be a bleſſing, we likewiſe enioy it by his happie gouernement. To prop vp all with great ſecuritie, he hath made choiſe of a moſt wiſe, diſcreete and godly diſpoſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, the Pillars (indeede) of a happie Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16371:65"/>To conclude, if there be felicitie in peace, in proſperitie, in pleaſure, in plentie, we inioy all by his wiſdome and prouidence: if there be any thing wanting, it is but thankefull hearts to God, and to our King, that hath bleſſed vs with thoſe foyſons, that we are glutted, and almoſt readie to burſt; but let vs take heede, that with the churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> we harden not the heart of <hi>Dauid</hi> againſt vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The crueltie of one man towards an other.</note>Let vs now looke into the particular dealing of one man towards another, and we ſhall find ſuch plentie of fraude, linked together with violence, as if one were brought into the world to ſubuert and roote out another: and I thinke the world would ſuddenly periſh, if wrath were not by mercie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">We are afraid to do well.</note>We ſpeake of <hi>Honeſtie,</hi> but it is with halfe a lip; and for <hi>Vice,</hi> we ſeeme to ſhut it out at the broade gate, but we priuily take it in againe at the Wicket: we make a gappe where the gate ſtands open, and we ſeeke to enter by force, where the high way lyes by fauour. We deſire to come to Chriſt by night with <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> that no bodie might ſee vs for feare of worldly loſſes, and it is a point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to take Chriſt in one hand, and the world in another, and to make ſome outward appearance a litle to ſatisfie the world, if it be but with a dumb ſhew.</p>
            <p>A man for faſhions ſake may inroll himſelfe in the <hi>Muster booke of Ieſus Christ,</hi> but in the day of ſeruice, he may ranke himſelfe to fight in <hi>Satans campe.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ill feaſting with God.</note>It is enough for vs to cry, Lord, Lorde, but not to doe any thing that is commanded by the Lord of Lords: if we doe thinke of God, we thinke him eaſie enough to be pleaſed, we know how to driue him off, and to gaine time, till wee haue a more fit opportunitie.</p>
            <p>Man is made of body and ſoule, and the bodie is then in his moſt floriſhing eſtate, when the ſoule is beſt obeyed; but the body rebelling, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lazie and ſluggiſh, the ſoule then beginneth to faint: but the ſoule being immured in the durtie priſon of the body, feeleth not her owne euill, but in the euill that ſhe there indureth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> that ſhoulde rule, is but incloſed in the narrowe compaſſe of the head, all the reſt of the partes of the body beſides are left to affections: Anger raigning in the fortreſſe of the heart, Pride, Luſt, Concupiſcence, and ſuch other poſſeſsing all the partes of the body; our eyes, whoſe office ſhould be to direct our ſteppes in a right courſe, are they not our gerateſt ſtumbling blockes? what enemies more malitious to vs than our eares, that are ſtill wide open to wickedneſſe? The tongue, is it not more apt to ſpeake ill, than good? our hands, our feete, and all the reſt of our other partes, more nimble and ready to vanitie than vertue.</p>

            <p>Notwithout wiſdome the world is reported to be Sphericall, for it is ſtill turning, and with great iudgement <hi>Fortune</hi> is ſaid to be blind, for ſhe is ſtill flitting, and when we thinke to haue the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt footing, we are euen then moſt ſubiect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining.</p>
