         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And about the ſame time, (rather for that the Romans were willing to beleeve whatſoever was reported of the Carthaginians, then for that the reports that were brought them were worthy credit) the Senate reſolved, utterly to demoliſh Carthage. And then it was that <hi>Publius Scipio Emilianus,</hi> a man wholy reſembling in his vertues his Grandfather <hi>Publius Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and his father <hi>Lucius Paulus</hi> and in all endowments, both of warre and peace, and as well for his Iudgement, as Knowledge, the moſt eminent of his time,

So unlike was <hi>Sylla</hi> the ſouldier to <hi>Sylla</hi> the Conqueror, that while he overcomes he was more mild then the gentleſt ſpirit: after the victory, more cruell then can bee ſpoken.

The right wing of the Iulian Navie was governed by <hi>Marcus Latius,</hi> the laſt by <hi>Arruntius,</hi> the command in chiefe of the whole ſea fight reſted upon <hi>Agrippa: Caeſar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to himſelfe the place to which fortune ſhould call him,

And being Generall, who ought to puniſh runawayes ſeverely, did himſelfe runne away from his owne ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Their conſtancy in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting moſt bravely, even when they had loſt their head that ſhould have directed them, did long continue, and when they

diſpaired of victory, they fought to dye. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſiring to reduce them to quiet thoughts by words, whom he might have ruined with the ſword, calling to them, and ſhewing them that <hi>Antonius</hi> was fled: asked them for whom and with whom they would now fight.

And by all men it was acknowledged that the ſouldiers had done the duty of the braveſt Generall, and the Generall behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as the moſt cowardly ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. So that thou mayeſt make a doubt whether he would have

               <p>BVt having ſet forth, as it were in groſſe, the forme of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his governement, let us now reckon up the particulars. With what prudence did he call to him <hi>Rhaſcupolis</hi> the killer of <hi>Cotys</hi> his brothers ſonne? uſing in that affaire eſpecially the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of <hi>Flaccus Pomponius</hi> of Conſular qualitie, a man borne for all things that were to bee
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19670:219"/>
juſtly done, and rather with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt vertue deſerving glory, then hunting after it? With what a gravity, as a Senator and judge, not as a Prince and Preſident, did he heare, and expedite cauſes? with what celerity did he ruine <hi>Libo,</hi> that ungrateful man, and one that did labour for innovations? with what principles did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and having ſeaſoned him with the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſouldiourſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him backe the ſubduer of Germany; With what honors did he glorifie his youth? the adornements of his triumph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing correſpondent to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the acts which he had performed? How often did he ſhew reſpect to the people in a Congiary or Dole, and when by the Senates appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he might doe it, how willingly did hee
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:19670:220"/>
perfect the taxe of the Senate, ſo as he neither willingly did give any provocations to ryot, nor did ſuffer an honeſt poverty to be deprived of honors. With how great honour did he ſend his <hi>Germanicus</hi> into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces beyond the Seas: with what power of his directions, employing as his Miniſter and aſſiſtant his ſonne <hi>Druſus,</hi> did he compell <hi>Maroboduus</hi> that hung upon the frontires of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (let me ſpeake with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his royall eſtate) like a ſerpent thruſt out of the earth, with the wholeſome medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his advices to get him home againe? How doth hee hold him in, honorably but yet not ſecurely? Of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was that warre which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commenced by <hi>Sacrovir</hi> and <hi>Iulius Florus,</hi> he with a ſtrange
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19670:220"/>
celeritie and ſpeed did ſuppreſſe So that the people of Rome did know that they had conquered before they knew they were entred into a warre, and the Meſſenger that brought word of the victory, came before him that told of the danger. The war alſo of Africa that was full of terror, and ſtill greater by the dayly additions to it, by his direction and advice was in a ſhort time buried.</p>
