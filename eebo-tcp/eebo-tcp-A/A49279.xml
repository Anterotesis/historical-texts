         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THIS Informant ſaith, That having been employed as a Workman ſeveral times at the Houſe of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> at <hi>Tixall</hi> in the County aforeſaid, he was ſollicited by Mr. <hi>Francis Hind,</hi> Steward to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> to become a Witneſs againſt <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> late Steward to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> any way to invalidate or take off his Evidence in relation to the Popiſh Plot, and he ſerved this Informant with a <hi>Subpoena</hi> to come up to <hi>London</hi> for that purpoſe, at the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110400:3"/>
late intended Tryal of the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> in <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt; but before his coming up, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hind, Francis Aſton,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sawyear,</hi> Servant to the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton, &amp;c.</hi> ſent for this Informant into a private Room in the ſ<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe; and there told him, That if he would ſwear ſuch things as ſhould be dictated to him by the Perſons aforeſaid, to invalidate or take off the ſaid <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Evidence, he ſhould have ſuch a Reward as ſhould be to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and not want for Money and Horſe, as might become a man of better Quality than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And this Informant agreeing to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, came up to <hi>London</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>They perſwaded this Informant likewiſe to ſwear that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Cheating Rogue, and had cheated this Informant and many more in the Country, whilſt he was the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Steward. To which this Informant anſwered he would, and ſaith that <hi>Hind</hi> told him, That if he would do according as they directed him, that he ſhould (beſides the Rewards agreed upon) have his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges born in coming to Town, in ſtaying here, and going down again. And likewiſe ſaith, that he was to ſwear that <hi>James Anſell,</hi> (being a Witneſs in ſome things relating to the Diſcovery of the Plot) was a Perjured Rogue, and a Thief, and had perjured himſelf ſeveral times; and all ſuch other things as they ſhould dictate to him when he came up to <hi>London,</hi> in order to take off both their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And ſaith thoſe that promiſed to make good his Reward for ſo doing, was Mr. <hi>Herbert Aſton,</hi> his Lordſhips Uncle, <hi>Francis Aſton,</hi> Son to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110400:3"/>
the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sawyear,</hi> Servant to the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Informant ſaith, That being in <hi>London,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Tryal not being come on, he received no more of his Reward but his bare Charges; however they faithfully promiſed him when he had made good what he had promiſed them to ſwear, he ſhould have his full Reward made good to him.</p>
            <p>And this Informant ſaith, That in <hi>September</hi> laſt going up to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe, he was made very welcome, and after ſome time was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of the Servants of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s, where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay; and this Informant told him, at one <hi>Richard Perkins</hi> next Houſe to his own in <hi>Shutborrow,</hi> about a Mile diſtant from my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s; the ſaid Servant, after ſome diſcourſe had with this Informant, told him that he might do them good ſervice, and have a good Reward for his pains, if he could deviſe to ſet fire on the Room where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay, and burn him in his Bed. To which this Informant anſwered, that if he ſhould do ſo, he ſhould burn his own Houſe, and endanger the whole Town: To which the Servant replyed, that it were better that his Houſe and the whole Town were burnt, rather than he (meaning Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>) ſhould eſcape, who was a Rogue, and had betray'd his Lords Secrets, with ſeveral other Gentlemen; he at the ſame time tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Informant, that he ſhould (if he would undertake it) be well rewarded to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but perceiving this Informant not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110400:4"/>
willing, told him he was a Coward, he would not undertake to do ſo good a piece of ſervice. The ſaid Servant at the ſame time went to one <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Moore,</hi> another Servant of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s, who was to join with this Informant in the ſaid Fact; and this Informant going home, ſaw the ſaid <hi>Walter Moore</hi> walking about the ſaid Houſe that was ſo to be fired; and this Informant not being willing that ſuch a wicked Act ſhould be done, acquainted one of his Neighbours with it, and ſo a Watch was ſet to preſerve the ſaid Houſe where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay, and all the Town, that night, and all the time after ſo long as Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ſtayed there: This Informant having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> ſay, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Rogue for having betrayed his Lords Secrets: And likewiſe ſaith, that when this Informant was to be a Witneſs for the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> one <hi>Samuel Holt</hi> who was another Servant of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s, and alſo one <hi>Sawyear,</hi> being <hi>Subpoena'd</hi> up as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>; they told this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Perjured Rogue, for laying the Plot of the Presbyterians upon the Papiſts, and if they or either of them could meet the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> conveniently, they would do his buſineſs for him: And ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Holt</hi> had received a ſum of Money for the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as likewiſe the ſaid <hi>Walter Moore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Informant ſaith, That all thoſe things which were ſo by them, as aforeſaid, dictated to him, were altogether falſe, to any knowledge of this Informant, in relation to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110400:4"/>
and the ſaid Mr. <hi>James Anſell.</hi> And ſaith that ſeveral other Matters and Perſons he knows of that were concerned herein (this Informant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always made privy to moſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances in this nature) that would almoſt hang them, which he is unwilling to diſcover againſt them, for that they are related to him.</p>
