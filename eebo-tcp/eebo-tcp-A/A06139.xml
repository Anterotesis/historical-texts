            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most Noble Prince <hi>Henrie</hi> by the grace of God, Prince of Great <hi>Britaine.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Oscius</hi> the Romane Tragedian (most noble Prince) contending with <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, which of them both should perswade most people, either <hi>Roscius</hi> with his motions, and gestures of his body; or <hi>Cicero</hi> with varietie, and copy of his tongue. This hath been in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in Greece much vsed; and now in Rome more: but of such motions and gestures of men, that can speake with their hands, with their eies, with their shoulders, and with their feet, <hi>Salomon</hi> bids vs to take heed, that will speake like <hi>Aristippus</hi> to <hi>Dionisius</hi> heeles.</p>
            <p>Such were they that held their heads on the left side, like King <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, while <hi>Philip</hi> liued: such were they after <hi>Philip,</hi> that like <hi>Alexander</hi> his Sonne with their bushes and standing haires, would be called <hi>Opistho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comae,</hi> because <hi>Alexander</hi> was so, &amp; now too many such, like the Courtiers of <hi>Meroe</hi> in Ethiope, where if their King halt, they will also halt, in such sort, that <hi>Cirses</hi> and <hi>Calipso</hi> could not make such a Metamorphosis of <hi>Vlisses</hi> men, as men make of themselues.</p>
            <p>There was then in Rome but one bird that was taught to say, <hi>Aue Caesar Imperator:</hi> one bird in <hi>Carthage</hi> to say, <hi>Deus est hanno:</hi> and one bird in all Greece, that was taught to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but not onely these flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fowles fledde from Rome, from Carthage, and from Greece, to Great Britane; of whom we may now say, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> said then of the like, <hi>Quibus credamus, nescimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9236:3"/>But also of late such Rauens and Vultures, that salute vs with their tongues, and say, <hi>Aue;</hi> and with their hearts, <hi>Caue,</hi> which if their bodies were opened, as the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> or as the Lacedemonians did <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> their hearts should bee found, as their hearts were, <hi>pilosa &amp; hispida,</hi> full of haires and thornes.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Torquine</hi> the proud, there was in <hi>Rome</hi> but one Serpent that could bark like a dogge, and one dogge that could speake like a man, but now so many barking Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in Rome, &amp; so many speaking dogs out of Rome, that, <hi>Quos fugiamus, ignoramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But such are the fruits of some religion, that as then in Egypt, they had their Sphinxes in their temples, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound their darke and obscure Diuinitie full of Oracles: so now they haue in Rome, not onely Egyptian Sphinxes in their temples, but also Corinthian Sphinxes in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, such as <hi>Cicero</hi> charged <hi>Hortensius</hi> to haue in his house to plead his causes.</p>
            <p>But as then many Philosophers went from Greece to India, and to Ethiope, to see <hi>Sacerdotes solis,</hi> and the most famous table of the Son, <hi>in Sabulo,</hi> and to heare <hi>Hiarchas</hi> lectures of the nature and motions of the starres, and of <hi>Tantalus</hi> well. So also many now goe from Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane to <hi>Rome,</hi> not as <hi>Appollonius</hi> the Philosopher went from Greece to India, to heare the Gymnosophists: but as <hi>Saul</hi> went from Hierusalem to Damasco, for commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and authoritie to kill and murther Christians, and to persecute Kingdomes, and Countreys.</p>

            <p>I may not omit in this place a fit history, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Spaniard, that bragged much before <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the'mperor, of 3. such strange things that the King of Spaine his master had, that all the world had not the like, a great Mountaine of Salt, a bridge that fed yearely tenne thousand of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and a Citie walled about with fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> hearing this bragge of the Spaniard, sayd before <hi>Maximilian,</hi> that hee had in one of his Cities three greater wonders, three Monasteries, the first of Friars praedicators whose barnes were full of all kind of Corne and had no ground to tillage.</p>
            <p>The second Monasterie was of Franciscan Friers, whose Coffers were full of mony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reuenewes comming in.</p>
            <p>And the third of blacke Muncks, who had multitudes of children hauing no maried wiues, this is not strange in Spaine, in Rome, or in any other countries where monasteries be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fauorinus</hi> the Philosopher wondred more of three greater wonders, than the Spaniard did of his Mountaine, of his bridge, and of his citie; or the Germane of his three Monasteries: that he

being a naturall French man should be thought a Graecian, &amp; being an Eunuch, shuld be accounted an Adulterer, and <hi>Fauorinus</hi> being an enemie to <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour should liue. <hi>Heidfield de Arith. Cap. 31.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Augustine</hi> brag'd not like the Spaniard, nor like <hi>Albertus</hi> the Germane to see his three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, he agreed with both in the number of three, for <hi>Augustine</hi> wished to haue seene <hi>Paul</hi> in the face, Christ in his bodie, and the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> in her chiefe flourishing time: but <hi>Beda</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed but one, to haue seene Christ <hi>in suo deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> sawe him in Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi>

                  <p>So the Kings of <hi>Egipt</hi> reserued the bodies of their Kings in high buildings made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, farre from the ground, as in their <hi>Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Laberinths,</hi> in such sort that the sonnes should see their fathers, and so many fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his father, buried in such sort, reserued and kept with odors and sweetnes, as though they were aliue.</p>
                  <p>They mourned seauenty two dayes, abstained from wine or any other meate, sauing bread and the water of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
