            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have, with a deep Senſe and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
often beheld the Diſtance
and Diſſatisfaction you are under
in reference to your ancient and
faithful Brethren and that Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,
which, I am ſure, was once very
dear and valuable with you, and I would
have the Charity to hope, is what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you deſire ſtill: And, for your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57347:3"/>
ſakes that would not willingly think
amiſs, nor differ, nor divide from thoſe
that otherwiſe you have an Eſteem for
and are in Judgment one with, as to the
<hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Doctrines of Truth;</hi> I deſire to
open my Mind, both with tenderneſs and
plainneſs; and if what I ſay has the Voice
and Matter of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in it, and
may be helpful to you, in cloſing with
your Brethren again, I ſhall greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice:
In which, know this, I ſeek you
not in the words of <hi>Man's Wiſdom,</hi> nor
to raiſe <hi>Controverſie,</hi> nor for <hi>Victory,</hi> nor
any <hi>By ends,</hi> but for the ſake of that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>ſeamleſs Garment,</hi> in
which the <hi>Truth</hi> cloathed us all in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and with which it will cloath
and comfort all its faithful Servants and
true Friends to the end. <hi>1st. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the Difference, and what you have
both in Conferrence and Writing alledged
for the Ground of your Diſſatisfaction and
Diſſent:</hi> Next, <hi>I ſhall conſider the Nature
and Merit of it;</hi> and laſt of all, <hi>give my
ſence upon the whole matter, in order to
a better understanding for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is a <hi>Difference,</hi> is but too
plain, for it has in ſome parts proceeded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57347:3"/>
to a <hi>Separation,</hi> as well to places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as in matters of Diſcipline. The
Ground of this Diſſatisfaction, upon which
ſo great a Diſtance has been raiſed, you
ſay is, <hi>Requiring your Complyance with
ſome Practices relating to Diſcipline,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Womens <hi>meetings and coming</hi> twice
<hi>before Men and Womens meetings about
Marriages, before they are admitted to be
ſolemnized among us;</hi> ſome of you think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>that there is no Service for</hi> Womens
<hi>meetings at all;</hi> others, <hi>no Service in their
being</hi> diſtinct <hi>from Mens meetings,</hi> at
leaſt, <hi>no neceſſity for either, and therefore
no neceſſary Complyance to be required and
inſiſted upon, but every one left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in Chriſt, leſt Impoſition and Formality
ſhould prevail among us, as they have done
in other Religious Societies.</hi> In this, I
think, I have truly and fairly ſtated the
Caſe on your part, and given your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to our Practice, and the reaſon
why you diſſent from it.</p>
            <p>Now Friends, I ſhall conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and merit of this Diſſatisfaction and
Diſſent, wherein I beſeech your Attention,
Patience, and Candour, and I hope you
will find, that we are clear of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57347:4"/>
and Formality you object or fear.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I do not find that
you have any juſt cauſe to fear, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
an infringement on your Chriſtian
Liberty, ſince it has been, and is moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
declared by the Brethren, chiefly
concerned in the good Order and Service
of the Church, that they have no thought
or deſign of impoſing any thing upon the
Conſciences of Friends; or, that Friends ought
to have now any more than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
any other reaſon or Meaſure of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
or Conformity in Matters relating
to God, than the <hi>conviction of the Light and
Spirit of Chriſt in every Conſcience.</hi> But
there is this diſtinction to be conſidered
well of, That the matters in Difference are
not ſuch as require ſuch an Exerciſe and
Conviction of Conſcience as is pleaded,
becauſe they relate not to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
Did they require <hi>Faith,</hi> or did they
appertain to <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as if you were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to worſhip God only in ſuch a <hi>Place,
Time, Geſture, Raiment, with ſuch words and
forms of Speech, &amp;c.</hi> which has been the
caſe of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>National
Church,</hi> your Objection and Plea were
good: But this about which your Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57347:4"/>
ariſes, is purely <hi>Diſcipline in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and not in Worſhip; Formality in
Order, and not in Religion:</hi> It is about me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of regulating our ſelves, as to the
civil or outward part of the Church, as we
are a <hi>Society;</hi> how we may avoid Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and preſerve the Credit of our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from Cenſure and Scandal.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, <hi>To keep the neceſſitous;</hi> as
<hi>Poor, Aged, Sick,</hi> and <hi>Orphans: To recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
Differences: To take care of Births,
Marriages, and Burials:</hi> In fine, <hi>to prevent,
rebuke and reſtore diſorderly walkers.</hi> To
all which, I conceive, there is no need of
an Act of <hi>Faith,</hi> or other Exerciſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
than, as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>to be
ready to every good word and work:</hi> I mean,
here is nothing required to be believed as
an <hi>Article of Faith;</hi> here is, no <hi>Novelty</hi> or
<hi>Formality</hi> in Worſhip introduc'd, or any
thing propoſed as an End or Service for our
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens</hi> meetings, that can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
admit of the raiſing of ſuch a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Conſcience, ſince the things propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are Duties that all civil Societies, as well
as Church-fellowſhips, agree in, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the ſupport of the Reputation of
<hi>Fellowſhips</hi> and <hi>Societies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57347:5"/>
Now this being the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>true End,
Vſe,</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of our <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens
meetings,</hi> and that 'tis the <hi>End</hi> that always
denotes and conſtitutes the nature of the
means, it cannot juſtly be thought to be
of the nature of <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi>
as the words are commonly taken in an
i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l ſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to expect t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e compliance of
Members of a Society, to ſuch Methods of
Order as the <hi>Elders</hi> thereof have exhorted
to, and the generality of the People have
embraced, and which the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of thoſe that diſſent, declare they
diſſent from, rather for fear of ſuffering an
Enfringement of their Chriſtian Liberty,
than any diſlike to the Practice it ſelf: I
ſay, this cannot be called or accounted ſuch
an Impoſition upon Conſcience, becauſe
they are <hi>Expedients of Order</hi> and <hi>Methods
of Rule</hi> about things univerſally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>thing</hi> will not bear the word;
for inſtance, Becauſe I may ſay it is againſt
my Conſcience to confeſs to ſuch an Article
or Doctrin of Faith, or to worſhip God af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
ſuch a preſcribed form, that therefore
it would ſound reaſonable for me to ſay
<hi>it is againſt my Conſcience to ſubmit to the
Council of the Church for ending of Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57347:5"/>
and it is againſt my Conſcience, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once told the Brethren I intend to marry
ſuch a Woman, to come again a fortnight, or a
month after, to ask if they have informed
themſelves of mine and the Womans clearneſs,
both towards Parents and other perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſolemnize it.</hi> Surely this would
look to reaſonable people an <hi>over-tender</hi>
or an <hi>over-righteous,</hi> or rather, indeed, an
<hi>over-free</hi> and <hi>large Conſcience,</hi> that would
ſcruple, at <hi>twice</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> publiſhing the
<hi>Banns,</hi> to prevent undutifulneſs to Parents
and injury to Pre-engagements, when thoſe,
we profeſs to exceed, require in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that it be thrice done. In like
manner it would look very ſtrange in me
to call a Church-care of circumſpect wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up to the religious Principles of the
Society, that I have voluntarily embraced,
an <hi>impoſing or over-driving of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you object, <hi>Why muſt we go before
Women,</hi> and <hi>why Women apart from Men?</hi>
This ſtill, Friends, can be no Impoſition,
as is before expreſſed, becauſe <hi>it is no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith, nor Practice of Worſhip,</hi> but a
referring ſtill to our <hi>external Order of Life;</hi>
And we ſay, <hi>Women</hi> as well as <hi>Men,</hi> becauſe
they are concerned, for they are part of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57347:6"/>
the Church of Chriſt; and the common
<hi>Banus</hi> that are published in <hi>Churches</hi> (ſo
called) or <hi>Markets,</hi> exclude not <hi>Women</hi> to
make their Exception any more than <hi>Men.
But why Women apart,</hi> ſay you? We think
for a very good reaſon; the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,
which encreaſes the Buſineſs of
the Church, and Women, whoſe baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will not permit them to ſay or do
much as to Church-affairs before the Men,
when by themſelves, may exerciſe their
Gifts of Wiſdom and Underſtanding in a
diſcreet care for their own Sex, at leaſt;
which makes up not the leaſt part of the
Buſineſs of the Church, and this while the
<hi>Men</hi> are upon their proper buſineſs alſo.
So that as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> make up the
Church, <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> make up the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of the Church; and therefore it is
very reaſonable they ſhould be <hi>Helpers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
in doing the Church's buſineſs.
This way <hi>Women</hi> are made uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in and to the Church, as were the
<hi>Holy Women</hi> of old, that were ſo much
commanded by the Apoſtle, for <hi>Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
indeed. And, as I ſaid before,
their buſineſſes being hereby diſtinct,
<hi>two buſineſſes are doing at one and the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57347:6"/>
time,</hi> and conſequently, there muſt needs
be a greater diſpatch; which in Country
places, and Winter Seaſons, where Friends
come <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Fifteen miles</hi> to Meetings, muſt
needs be very convenient and comfortable.
I may add, that there are divers things
that ſeem peculiar to <hi>Women,</hi> that were not
fit for <hi>Men,</hi> and in which <hi>Men</hi> did and
would find themſelves often at a loſs, which
renders their diſtinct Meetings farther
convenient.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons and Motives to
the preſent Practice of the Church of
Chriſt, without enfringing Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<hi>by compelling Conſcience to any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith or Practice, relating to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi>
we meaning by our whole <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Government,</hi> no other thing than a
<hi>careful Eye and Check upon Practice;</hi> an
<hi>Expediency againſt Irregularity in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi>
whether towards them that are
without, or thoſe that are within the ſame
Communion, to which the <hi>ſtrong</hi> will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
for the ſake of the <hi>weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My own ſence upon this whole matter
is, That <hi>a miſapprehending the Intention of
the Brethren, and an undiſtinguiſhing zeal
againſt Impoſitions on the one hand, and a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57347:7"/>
fear on the other ſide, that thoſe who ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook
and miſrendered, the deſign of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
were either high-minded and unruly,
or prone to undue liberty, or that they not
being the firſt promoters of this Diſciplin in
Government, detracted from them that were,
and ſo would leſſen the Credit and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Endeavours, with ſuch as were
peculiar Favourers; and that, in fine, their
Diſſent tended to the breach of Brotherly
Love and Vnity in the Church.</hi> I ſay, my
ſence is, That this on each ſide, <hi>with the
heats that followed, perhaps much worſe than
the thing it ſelf,</hi> gave life to the <hi>Diviſion</hi>
that thoſe that fear the Lord have truly
mourned for. And ſince I have hinted
the Heats that may have attended the
management of this Difference, be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that I ſay, the Difference, <hi>through
thoſe Heats,</hi> is now more <hi>in Spirit than
Fact,</hi> in Mind than Matter: It is come in
Fact to this; <hi>Whether the care of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould belong to</hi> Women <hi>as well as</hi>
Men, <hi>eſpecially relating to their own Sex,
the</hi> Women <hi>being ſo great a part of the
Church:</hi> And over this, I think, you are
got for the moſt part. 2. <hi>Whether the</hi>
Women <hi>may meet ſeparately from the</hi> Men?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57347:7"/>
And for anſwer to this, be pleaſed to take
notice of your own unavoidable Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>You allow Meetings of Care in general,
and do not deny</hi> Women <hi>abſolutely their
ſhare among the</hi> Men, <hi>and that particular
Members muſt be accountable to the Society
they are of, in point of Conversation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rules embraced by the ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi>
I ſay, you own the end, you allow
the means, you referr the choice of your
means to the Society, and you, as well as
we, expect a compliance with thoſe Rules.
Then the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether infact</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<hi>meetings be a part of that Diſcipline
the Church admits of?</hi> And it is evident,
that the Church of God does, generally
ſpeaking, receive and practiſe it, with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and advantage. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beſeech you, Friends, to ponder in
your minds, upon what a narrow point
your Diſtance ſtands, and that the main
and tender point is allowed you, <hi>viz. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is free,</hi> and unconcern'd in the
Queſtion; and the viſible Ground of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
being ſo ſmall, weigh with your ſelves
by what has been, what may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this lamentable Breach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57347:8"/>
I am as much for <hi>Liberty</hi> as any man;
I ever was ſo, and hope I ever ſhall be
for it; but we muſt refer it to a proper
Object, or we ſhall abuſe what we do
ſo much prize, and pervert one of the
greateſt Priviledges we can pretend to.
I do not mean, by the Liberty we are to
reſign to the Benefit of <hi>Society,</hi> That
which is private or perſonal; no, this
does not enter into private or perſonal
Liberty, concerning which, the Apoſtles
taught us to bear, and not offend one
another; as about Meats and Drinks: I
may add Clothes, Houſes, Trades, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſo as there be no Exceſs, for that is every
where wrong: Theſe things regard not
Society, but a man's ſelf, and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Liberty alone. What is it to the
<hi>Society,</hi> what or when I eat, what ſort
of Clothing I wear, or Houſe I live in,
or Trade I will be of, ſo as Exceſs or
Uncomelineſs be avoided? This is ſtill
in my own power, and many like
things, hard to be numbred, about which
<hi>Society</hi> is not in the leaſt concerned,
nor in which any Member of it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
or called in queſtion. In the
next place, we do alſo all agree, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57347:8"/>
Faith muſt not be forced nor Worſhip
<hi>conſtrained,</hi> for that grates upon Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which God only can effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
or rightly perſwade. But that
bears not upon our Queſtion, as I ſaid
before; for the compliance deſired in it
is about <hi>Order,</hi> not <hi>Faith,</hi> and that not
about <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but <hi>Converſation,</hi> in which
if you ſubmit your Liberty, it is for the
Good of <hi>Society,</hi> and you have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of in the Benefit and Comfort
thereof. Do you ſerve or take care of
others, that before were free of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement?
Others alſo are tryed by the
ſame Rules, to ſerve and be concerned for
you, that formerly owed you no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if you are under the Notice and
Reproof of others, as to your perſonal
Conduct, they are equally under yours
upon occaſion; ſo that you loſe nothing
but what you get, nor give nothing but
what you receive again, and to a right
Spirit and a good Mind this mutual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
will appear reaſonable, chriſtian,
and requiſite. And as in no Age the
Reſiſter and Gainſayers of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
in any of the Lord's eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
have paſſed without the mark of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57347:9"/>
God's Rebuke; ſo thoſe that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
and oppoſed the Wiſdom of God in
his faithful Servants, have ever failed
of their Purpoſe, and been finally mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to have been lead by a wrong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And as obſervable it is, that thoſe
by whom the Lord has eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and who were the firſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his ſeveral Diſpenſations to the
Sons of Men, have alwaies exerciſed that
Authority among the People they have
gathered, and have been conſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from falling away, though ſome
or other have riſe againſt them with
that clamour, as if they had ſet up
themſelves, and were gone from what
they taught or were, and took too
much upon them. But, what have they all
come to? Read and Judge.</p>
            <p>Nor was it ever heard of in the
Dealings of GOD with the Sons of
Men, that he varied or changed his
Diſpenſations in the Life-time of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of any of them, as ſome have
been ready to imagine, nor yet in that
Age in which he has brought them forth:
Which engages me to beſeech you, in
the Bowels of the Love of Chriſt our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57347:9"/>
only Root of Life and Light, and Love
and Peace, that you be like minded
with your Friends and Brethren, and
ſee that the Life and the Fellowſhip of
the Truth be preſerved in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practice of Fellowſhip; which
will be, if the love of God, which firſt
made us love one another, be kept in,
for that is a ſovereign Antidote againſt
all the <hi>Poyſon</hi> of Diſcontent, evil Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and the Diviſions that are wont to
follow. And inſtead of reproaching our
<hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> whom God has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and whom we have honoured,
and could have laid down our Lives for,
and who know nothing by themſelves,
but that they are as true to the Lord,
and in as good a condition in the Truth
as ever they were, and have done, and
intended in what they have done, as
much the Benefit of the Lord's People
I ſay, inſtead of reproaching them with
<hi>Vſurping Authority,</hi> and <hi>taking too much
upon them,</hi> let us conſider, that thoſe
whom we have received with ſo much
reverent Love, and as worthy of double
Honour in the greater things, are not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57347:10"/>
unworthy to be heard and followed by
us in <hi>leſſer</hi> matters: Let us regard and
value their Care, and love them for it.
So true is that Saying among Men,
<hi>That is well ſpoken which is well taken,</hi> that
the Bent and Purpoſe of a Man's Spirit
is that which gives the Juſt reaſon of
acceptance or rejection.</p>
            <p>You have, dear Friends, judged too
much after an <hi>outward appearance,</hi> and, you
may ſee, not truly there neither. <hi>Open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Hearts, your Souls, and Spirits,</hi> and
taſte with the divine ſenſe of the tender and
meek Truth, the aim and end of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
Herein be a little more truly free
and univerſal in your Minds, and you
will perceive this Care has a large and
a long Proſpect for Good. The due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of your ſpiritual Senſes will anſwer
all your Objections, and ſatisfie every up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Soul among you; but if you <hi>look
out, miſtake Liberty, miſtake Impoſition,
miſtake Formality,</hi> miſtake the <hi>nature</hi> and
<hi>end</hi> of things, and the <hi>Intention</hi> of your
ancient Friends and Brethren in them,
you will judge carnally, and be ready to
think as it outward Rule and Lordlineſs
were aimed at, and a departing from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57347:10"/>
Truth, even whilſt our Care, in the
ſight of the Lord, is for the Honour of
it, in reference to the <hi>young,</hi> the <hi>weak,</hi>
and ſuch as may be <hi>careleſs,</hi> and ready
to <hi>fall aſleep;</hi> for ſuch ſome yet are,
and ſuch are yet like to be; and for
their ſakes a <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as to Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt be, as well as that there are
natural Infirmities, as <hi>Sickneſs Age, &amp;c.</hi>
that unavoidably call for it. Nor did
or can ever any Community ſubſiſt
without it; and the Heats, Prejudice,
and Rents that have ariſen about the
How or Manner of it, ſhew the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to be right, nor of a good
tendency; the end of that Order, in the
Minds and Hands of thoſe from whence
we joyfully received the Teſtimony of
the Truth, being the Glory of God,
and Good of his People, as a <hi>Primitive
Chriſtian Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude; As this is not a <hi>Plea for
Impoſition</hi> nor <hi>Forms of Worſhip,</hi> but
<hi>Forms of Diſcipline,</hi> as to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Behaviour of our ſelves in our
Converſe both with thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57347:11"/>
and thoſe that are within, and that
there is no viſible Communion or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this World of Bodies, but what is
ſubject to them, and muſt in ſome ſort
ſubſiſt by them; I beſeech you, that
we, as becomes a reaſonable and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
People, and as <hi>dear Children,</hi> may
be of <hi>one Heart,</hi> and <hi>one mind,</hi> and
walk together as thoſe that have been
Partakers of <hi>one Life,</hi> and that have
drank into <hi>one Spirit;</hi> for, it is a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing to ſee Brethren walk together in
Love.</p>
            <p>O Friends, let us labour againſt <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Animoſities, watchings for Evil, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation,</hi>
the Sin that flung the <hi>Angels</hi>
out of their Heavenly Station: Let us
ſee to our own Spirits, how they are,
if <hi>meek, lowly, humble, tender,</hi> by which
the true and preſerving Judgment is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known and felt; or, if not <hi>high,
fierce, hard,</hi> and <hi>prejudiced;</hi> for a man
may come to loſe a good frame of
Spirit upon very Trifles. It is not
alwaies what the Matter is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
ariſes upon, but <hi>how far the thing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57347:11"/>
is eſpouſed,</hi> and what place a man ſuffers
it to have in his Mind: If Jealouſie, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
Revenge, or Contradiction
prevail, Diviſion muſt follow: Some
are apt to reſent things too ſoon, and
carry it too far, even to Obſtinacy,
through the Workings of the Evil One
in a Myſtery; ſo that though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Quarrel may be ſome
Fact or other, yet that has the leaſt
ſhare oftentimes in the Difference, it
being enflamed and encreaſed by the
<hi>myſterious workings of the Spirit of Strife
and Variance in the Mind,</hi> according to
an old Saying, <hi>The greateſt Feuds often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
