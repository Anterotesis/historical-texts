            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Popular Reception of
Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> celebrated
Piece, has built him no
small Reputation: But it had been
an infinite higher Glory, both to
the Book and the Author, had the
Argument been taken up in his
Pulpit-Reign. Then he would
have convinced the World that he
put Pen to Paper in the Spirit of
Zeal and Piety, and not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
open to that untoward Suspicion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That all this Labour'd Pile of
Stage-Reformation is only the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Idleness and Abdication.
<pb facs="tcp:49930:3"/>
He takes up the Whip for the
Play-house, as <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
did the School-birch, when be
had lost the Scepter.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Wit and Learning
(to do him all just Right) shine
through the whole Piece; but when
the poorest <hi>Ingenii Largitor</hi> gives
Birth to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> she looks
not quite so lovely, as when she
has a more Honourable Parent.
Besides, there's another very strong
Reason why an Invective against
the <hi>Stage,</hi> was no earlier Ofspring
of this Ingenious Author. Alas,
'twas no Subject for Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi>
smiling Days. The Theatre was
then too much the Minion of his
old <hi>Great Master</hi> and <hi>Mistress;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49930:3"/>
and Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> we all very well
know, was more the <hi>Courtier,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Blessings of that warm Sun,
then to rally either This or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Darling of <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as much <hi>Ingenuity</hi> as this
Treatise may boast, it has as much
of the <hi>Gall</hi> too: But where the
Satyr falls heaviest, will be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Inquiry. 'I is true, the
Lash seems wholly designed against
the <hi>Theatres:</hi> But if the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
be so fatally destructive to
<hi>Morality, Virtue,</hi> nay <hi>Religion</hi>
it self, as that <hi>Treatise</hi> endeavours
to render it, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has more
satyriz'd the <hi>Pulpit</hi> than the <hi>Stage:</hi>
For whilst 'tis undeniably true, that
Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> is the first, either
<pb facs="tcp:49930:4"/>
Pulpit or Press-Sermon, upon that
Text; this universal Silence of the
whole Clergy, must conclude either
their Ignorance of such a Fatality,
when Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is the first Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer,
or what's worse, their
neglect of their Christian Duty,
when Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is the first Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if none of all this Capital
Guilt-shall be proved upon the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house;
and the Influences of the
Stage shall have no such mortal
Malignity, as this Author threatens
from it; then the Satyr lies nearer
home, and only lashes himself.</p>

            <p>THE Ingenious Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Learned <hi>Treatise, A short
View of the Immorality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness
of the English Stage,</hi> &amp;c.
has not given it a Title that fully reaches the
Subject, and the great Design of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
piece of Oratory: For in his whole
Discourse, which he divides into six Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
In the First he confronts the present
Stage, by setting forth the general Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Modesty of the Ancient Greek
and Latin Dramatick Poetry; and in the
Four next Chapters de descends to a View
of the English Theatres, where he Seats
himself down, and very Magisterially sits
Censor and Judge upon several particular
Dramatick Offenders and Offences, in some,
and only some, of our late Plays.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, the Title Page seems to carry
the Contents of the Book, as if his present
Work in hand were only a Christian Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Abuses</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> viz. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness</hi>
and <hi>Immorality</hi> crept into the Stage.
But in his last Chapter, he plainly tells us,
his Design is not <hi>Reformation,</hi> but <hi>Eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
For here he throws by the Pruning
Hook, and takes up the Axe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49930:5"/>In due prevention therefore against so
dangerous a Weapon, in so angry a Hand,
we'll endeavour first to Guard the <hi>Root;</hi>
and afterwards we'll joyn with him, and
give him free leave to Lop off as many
of the <hi>Luxurious Branches,</hi> as shall not be
found worth saving.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore with some Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of that <hi>Last Chapter,</hi> which he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles,
<hi>The Opinion of</hi> Paganism, <hi>of the</hi>
Church, <hi>and</hi> State, <hi>concerning the</hi> STAGE,
here likewise we'll set out first from Home,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Opinion of the English State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Here, <hi>says our Author,</hi> I shall come
down to our own Constitution, and I find
by 39th of <hi>Eliz. chap. 4.</hi> and <hi>1 Iac. chap.</hi> 7th.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That all Common Players of
Interludes, counterfeit <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> shall be taken adjudged
and deem'd Rogues, Uaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
and Sturdy Beggars,
and shall sustain all Pains and
Punishments, as by this Act is
in that behalf appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Penalties are Infamous to the last
degree, and Capital too, unless they give
over. 'Tis true, the First Act, <hi>viz.</hi> 39th
of <hi>Eliz.</hi> excepts those Players which belong
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49930:5"/>
to a Baron or other Person of higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and are Authorized to Play under
the Hand and Seal of Arms of such Baron
or Personage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But in the latter Statute this Privilege
of Licensing is taken away, and all of
them are expresly brought under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
without distinction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true in this last Act, as he says, the
Barons Privilege of Licensing Players was
taken away; but this Author, that reads no
farther than what wright or wrong serves
his own Turn, and quotes Authority but by
Halves, forgets that that Act of the Ist. of
<hi>Iac.</hi> was but a Temporary Act, to hold in
force but that Sessions of Parliament. But
this small Trip we'll forgive him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for a little more Light into this 39th.
of <hi>Eliz.</hi> by way of Context to explain the
Cause. The Clause against Players begins
thus.</hi> Be it Enacted that all
Persons calling themselves
Scholars, going about beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
all Seafaring Men,
pretending Losses of their
Ships or Goods on the Sea,
going about the Country beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
All idle Persons going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
in any Country, either beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49930:6"/>
or using any subtle Craft,
or unlawful Games or Plays,
or feigning themselves to have
knowledge in Physiognomy,
Palmistry, or other like Crafty
Science, or such like Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Imaginations: All Persons
that be, or utter themselves to
be Proctors, Procurors, Patent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers,
Collectors for Goals,
Prisons or Hospitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Law, 'tis plain, is particularly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd
against a sort of People that have no
settled Habitation, Rovers up and down the
Country, and therefore called Vagabonds.
But what's all this to the Establishment of
our Publick Theatres? Besides, why are
all Offenders in this Act thus stigmatiz'd
and punish'd as Rouges, but for the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Frauds and Cheats upon the People?</p>
            <p>Nay, this Act chiefly strikes not at the
Professions of the Offenders here mention'd,
but the Abuse or Corruption of them, as in
the Scholar, Seaman, Proctor, Procuror,
Patent-gatherer or Collector, as well those
as are really so, as those that utter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such. The Mendicant Scholar, for
Instance, as a Scandal to Learning, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49930:6"/>
nay, perhaps the Church it self;
the Seaman as an Impostor, <hi>viz.</hi> with his
pretended Losses; the Proctor as a Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Litigious Suits among the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the Patent-gatherer under the Mask of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
charity, Collecting the Mony into his
own Pocket, not only to the Abuse of the
Country, but to the very Scandal of the
Government, when the most Pious Royal
Acts of Grace shall be thus fraudulently
perverted, to the carrying on so notorious
a Cheat: And therefore the Patent-gatherer
or Collector Unlicens'd was thus branded,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And undobtedly 'twas much upon
the same scandalous Account, that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licens'd
Players of Interludes are here herded
among all those Rascally Companions: For
why should not the Government, with all
Reason, surmize an equal Danger to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
from such Unqualify'd Players, and
accordingly provide against them, as being
Persons who under no Warrant of Authority,
nor Honourable Patron to vouch for their
Integrity, might be as justly suspected of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery,
Cheating or Pilfering, as any other
of their Brethren in Iniquity, mention'd in
the Act? Nor can this particular Brand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Offenders, here mentioned, bear any
shadow of Construction to Asperse, Taint
or Scandalize, the Profession of Playing it
self, and the Publick Theatres supported by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49930:7"/>
Royal Patents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any more than the same
Brand upon the Scholar, the Proctor, the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the formentioned Corruption,
should be interpreted a Reflection upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Law, Learning or Charity. Nor are His
Majesty's Servants, the present Authorized
Actors, any more concerned at the Common
mistaken Cry of Fools from starting this
Statute against them; than any honest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> with a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of Common Sense, ought to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
That this Opinion of the State concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Stage, here Quoted, makes any
thing for his Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <q>About the Year 1580. there was a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Play-houses. 'Tis somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and therfore I shall describe
some part of the Relation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many Godly Citizens, and other well disposed
Gentlemen of <hi>London,</hi> considering that Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,
and Dicing-houses, were Traps for
Young Gentlemen and others, and perceiving
the many Inconveniencies and great Damage
that would ensue upon the long-suffering of the
same, not only to particular Persons, but to
the whole City; and that it would be a great
Disparagement to the Governours, and a Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Government of this Honourable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if they should any longer continue, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some Pious Magistrates therewith, desiring

them to take some Course for the Suppression of
Common Play-houses, Dicing-houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof,
who thereupon made humble Suit to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
and her Privy-Council, and obtain'd
Leave of her Majesty to thrust the Players out of
the City, and to pull down all Play-houses and
Dicing-houses within their Liberties; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
was effected. And the Play-houses in
<hi>Grace-Church-Street,</hi> &amp;c. were quite put
down and suppress'd. <hi>Rawlidge his Monster
lately found out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 2, 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Name of this Author that Mr. <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
has here Quoted, being utterly a Stranger
to all the great Scholars in Title-page Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through St. <hi>Paul's Church-yard</hi> or <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Britain,</hi> I am sorry I am so much in the
Dark, that neither <hi>Stow, Baker, Cambden,</hi>
nor <hi>Holinshed,</hi> make any mention of this
Revolution in or about the Year 1580, <hi>viz.</hi>
this <hi>Abdication</hi> of the <hi>Publick Play-houses</hi> by
Queen <hi>Elizbeth;</hi> however not to dispute
the Veracity of an Affirmative in <hi>Verbo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotis,</hi>
but take it as an Orthodox Record,
I cannot but stand a little amaz'd to think
what wondrous State-opinion he has here
discover'd.</p>
            <p>First, 'tis here observable that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Grievances alleged against <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi>
were so far from a publick Censur of
the <hi>State,</hi> that they were only a private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49930:8"/>
of some <hi>Godly Citizens,</hi> &amp;c. who
therewith acquainted some Magistrates, (the
Magistrates themselves were not the first
Complainants.) The Foundation of, and
Arguments against this Grievance, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the score of <hi>Inconvenience</hi> and <hi>Damage,</hi>
that their Continuance and Sufferance on
that Account would be a Dishonour to the
Government of the City, not of the <hi>State</hi> nor
<hi>Church:</hi> For her were no Suggestions either
of <hi>Immorality, Lewdness, Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
or <hi>Vanity,</hi> or any <hi>Religious charge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, as <hi>Godly</hi> Men as the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
are here presented; whilst on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the whole Accusation against them, and
the whole <hi>Godly Fear</hi> was founded expresly
on no other danger, then the <hi>entrapping</hi> the
Youth of the City, whether Gentle or Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whether Gentlemens Sons or Citizens
Pretences or Servants, undoubtedly to the
squandering away their Parents or Masters
Money; and therefore, if too long suffer'd,
a publick Inconvenience or Damage would
ensue to the whole City. Hereupon these
Complainants Petition'd the Magistracy, and
the Magistracy the Queen; and her Gracious
Royal Grant was this, That that Eye-sore,
a Play-house in <hi>Grace-Church-Street,</hi> in the
Heart of the Metropolis, should be supprest,
and the Players thrust out of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and possibly banish'd as far as to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49930:8"/>
And what makes the whole Grievance
(without Ralleay) very remarkable, Here are
<hi>Play-houses</hi> and <hi>Dicing-houses,</hi> both joyn'd in
one Sentence of City Excommunication, the
<hi>Dicing-houses</hi> of the two, so much the more
dangerous Inhabitants within the Walls,
That the Youth of the City, <hi>viz.</hi> Sons,
Servants, Prentices or Cash-keepers, from so
fatal a Temptation and Snare, might be
truly Trapt into the Loss of those Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Sums, perhaps purloin'd or embezell'd
from Parents or Masters, to a very dangerous
Consequene to the whole City indeed;
whilst on the other side, the small Figure,
the <hi>Low-priz'd</hi> Play-houses made in those
Days, rendred them so little Threatners of
any such Capital Danger; that both <hi>Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi>
and <hi>Play-house</hi> are here Sentenced to
<hi>Banishment</hi> together, the one for <hi>Suspicion of
Robbery,</hi> and the other of <hi>Petty Larceny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these two Authorities being all he
says upon that Head, <hi>viz. The Opinion of the
State concerning the Stage,</hi> I have Quoted
them <hi>verbatim</hi> at full length, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may guess the strength of this Learned
Argumentator, by this first Sample we
have given of him.</p>
            <q>Ex pede Herculem.</q>
            <p>But to match him with an Opinion of
the State concerning the Stage, out of <hi>Stow's</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49930:9"/>
Chronicle, <hi>Anno</hi> 1583. not above three
Years after the said Abidication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stow</hi> 23d <hi>Eliz.</hi> Comedians and Stage-players
of former Time, were very poor and ignorant in
respect of these in this Time; but being now grown
very skilful and exquisite Actors for all Matters,
they were entertain'd into the Service of divers
Great Lords, out of which Companies there were
Twelve of the Best chosen, at the request of Sir
<hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> they were Sworn the Queens
Servants, and were allow'd Wages, and Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's,
as <hi>Grooms of the Chamber,</hi> and until
that Year 1583, the Queen had no <hi>Players.</hi>
Amongst those Twelve <hi>Players</hi> were Two rare
Men, viz. <hi>Thomas Wilson</hi> for a quick, delicate,
refin'd extemporal Wit, and <hi>Richard Tareletion,</hi>
for a wonderous plentiful, pleasant, extemporal
Wit. He was the wonder of his Time. He ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Buried in <hi>Shoreditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from this Authority of Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi>
which we may venture to call Authentick,
it looks a little odly, that this Chronicle
should take such particular notice of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
Court Favours, that smiled upon these
Darling of the Stage, and be so silent upon
the Calamity of the other Excluded City
Members of the same Fraternity. Methinks
the pulling down of Houses, and Banishing
the whole publick City-diversion, but just
three Years before, shou'd have made as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49930:9"/>
loud an Alarum at this Court Preserment
to their Younger Brothers, and certainly
deserved as large a Page in this History, at
least for the Queen's Honour: For it looks
like a little piece of Injustice to that Glorious
Memory, to let any part of publick Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
such as the suppression of Vice, as
<hi>Dice-houses</hi> and <hi>Play-houses,</hi> (and such our
Author here designs it) perform'd by that
Illustrious Princess, lye untransmitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
But when <hi>Play-houses</hi> and <hi>Dice-houses</hi>
are so suspiciously joyn'd together by
this unknown Author, what if these <hi>Play-houses</hi>
should prove but <hi>Gaming-houses</hi> at last?
is looks very shrewdly that way, all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
consider'd. But this I only surmize;
besides, it looks like misdoubting the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> Testimony, and so I'll ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give him his Point.</p>
            <p>However, as I am ready to do him Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
as to his Quotations, I hope he will do
the like by mine, and allow me at least this
Triumph to the Stage, That the <hi>Pious
Queen</hi> had a better Opinion of <hi>Players</hi> than
Mr. <hi>Collier's Godly Citizens,</hi> when she did
them the Honour of Entertaining them as
her <hi>Menials</hi> in her <hi>Livery,</hi> and under her own
<hi>Roof.</hi> But perhaps that Princess design'd
to make a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the <hi>Stage,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Church;</hi> and therefore was resolv'd to
redeem the <hi>Stage-players</hi> from their Original
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49930:10"/>
State of <hi>Infamy</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> Quoted <hi>pag. 241.</hi>
where he tells you, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>refused
the</hi> Jus Civitatis <hi>to</hi> Players, <hi>seiz'd their
Freedom, and made them perfectly Foreign to the
Govenment, which St.</hi> Augustine <hi>was pleas'd
to commend 'em for.</hi> And afterwards <hi>page
256. The whole Tribe of them was thrown out
of all Honour and Privilege. They were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer'd to be Lords nor Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now notwithstanding not only all these
<hi>Pagan</hi> Blots in their Scutcheon, but even the
very <hi>Theodostan Code,</hi> that <hi>page 241.</hi> calls them
<hi>Personae Inhonestae;</hi> belike this Gracious Queen
was pleased to give them that gentler Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
under her <hi>English,</hi> them they had found
either from the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> Laws; and
at least advanc'd them to tread very near the
Heels of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> under such Royal
Smiles, and the kind Court Reception she
gave them.</p>
            <p>But methinks this Ingenious Quoter of
History need not have look'd so far back as
to 1580. or Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> 39. or <hi>Iac.</hi> 1st.
for a National Opinion of the <hi>Stage:</hi> Here
was a Modern one of much fresher Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and more pat to his purpose, when the
Stage-plays lay under a more Universal Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Reign of those later
Powers at the Helm, who with no little A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49930:10"/>
leap'd over the <hi>Block,</hi> and the whole
<hi>White-hall Stage</hi> it stood upon, and yet stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the <hi>Straw.</hi> &amp;c. A profane <hi>Comedy</hi>
or <hi>Tragedy,</hi> were all Heathen and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,
but Pious <hi>Regicide</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
were Religion and Sanctity with them. The
<hi>Camel</hi> would go down, but the <hi>Gnat</hi> stuck
in their Throats.</p>
            <p>Now this Learned Gentleman ought by
all means to have Quoted this National Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Stage,</hi> as not only an Argument
much more to his Cause, but a Relation that
in pure Gratitude to the Patrons of his Book,
ought not to have been omitted. For as
this Author's View of the <hi>Stage</hi> is that more
than Ordinary Darling to the Gentlemen of
that Kidney, he cou'd in Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
do no less than tickle 'em with their
own Memoirs. Nay as the whole Society
of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Calves-head Feast,</hi>
have made this Book their particular Bosom
Favourite, it would be prudent in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
(and perhaps the Book was Compos'd
and Calculated for that purpose) to harangue
so considerable a Party; for 'tis a hard World
we live in, and the gaining of good Friends
may be serviceable.</p>
            <p>From these, next let us see how the <hi>Stage</hi>
stands discouraged by the Laws of other
Countries, as he has alrady shew'd you
how it stands in our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49930:11"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>To begin with the</hi> Athenians. These
People <hi>Plutarch tells you,</hi> thought a Comedy
so unreputable a Performance, that they made
a Law, that no Iudge of the <hi>Areopagus</hi>
should write one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Learned Gentleman is resolved to
make his Foreign <hi>State-Authority</hi> against the
Stage and his <hi>English</hi> one all of a piece. For
methinks this <hi>Athenian</hi> Law, that only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the Gravity of a Judge from writing
a Comedy, Recorded by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental
Black and White, as the <hi>Athenian</hi>
State-opinion against <hi>Plays,</hi> is certainly that
most charming Argument, enough to set
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> himself a smiling.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who were remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
for the Wisdom of their Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Their Government would not endure the
<hi>Stage</hi> under any Regulation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, here's one positive Bill of Exclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To pass on to the <hi>Romans. Tully</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that their Predecessors counted
all <hi>Stage-plays</hi> uncreditable and scandalous.
Insomuch that any <hi>Roman</hi> who turned
<hi>Actor,</hi> was not only to be Degraded, but
likewise <hi>as it were</hi> Disincorporated, and
Unnaturaliz'd by the Order of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49930:11"/>This <hi>Roman</hi> State-opinion is almost as
Doughty a Quotation as his <hi>Athenian</hi> one.
For here the Predecessors of the <hi>Romans</hi>
counted Plays uncreditable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But their
kinder Successors, belike were of a contrary
State-Opinion. Their Fore-fathers only
past it as a Temporary Act, like the first of
<hi>Iac.</hi> For the uncreditable Player was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
set <hi>rectus in Curia.</hi> And how did
those opinionated Predecessors (pray mark it)
handle the <hi>Roman</hi> Offender that turn'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor?
Why truly, as <hi>Cicero</hi> Cited by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
tells us, They Disincorporated and
Unnaturaliz'd him. And how did they
do all this? Why truly, <hi>as it were.</hi> Their
Censors of the <hi>Stage</hi> did put their <hi>Order</hi> in
Execution but very gently. Well, to do
this Author as much Justice, as he has done
the <hi>Roman</hi> Censors, I must own to the
World, that he argues <hi>(as it were)</hi> most judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously,
and, <hi>as it were,</hi> to the purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We read in</hi> Livy, <hi>That the Young People
kept their</hi> Fabulae Attellanae <hi>to themselves.</hi>
               <q>They would not suffer this Diversion to
be blemish'd by the <hi>Stage.</hi> For this Reason,
as the Historian observes the <hi>Actors</hi> or
the <hi>Fabulae Attellanae</hi> were neither Expell'd
their Tribe, nor refused to serve in Arms,
both which Penalties it appears the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Players</hi> lay under.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49930:12"/>Here <hi>Livy</hi> gives us another <hi>Roman State-Account</hi>
in Relation to the <hi>Stage,</hi> viz. That
some of their Dramatick Entertainments
were thought worthy to be the particular
Performance of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who belike were
either so pleas'd with it, or so proud of it, as
to Monopolize the Diversion to themselves,
and all without the least Stain to their
Gentility. That Lash of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
was only, as it appears, or, as it were, for
the poorer Hirelings Players; and for this
very good Reason,
<q>Et quod
Turpe est cerdoni Volesos Brutosque decebit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Playing in it self belike was no fault, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Money for it was all.</p>
            <p>His last State Opinion is, <q>That in the
Theodosian <hi>Code</hi> Players are called <hi>Personae
Dishonestae,</hi> &amp;c.</q> That is (to Translate it
softly) Persons Maimd, and blemish'd in
their Reputation. Their Pictures might be
seen at the Play-house, but were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to hang in any creditable Place of the
Town, the Function of the Players being
scandalous by the Civil Law.</p>
            <p>As scandalous as the Civil Law had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Players, however these scandalous Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
were handled as softly as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49930:12"/>
Their scandal was so little a publick
Nuisance, that the Christian Government,
even in its primitive Lustre, always suffer'd
them amongst them; and as <hi>Gondibert</hi> says,
<q>
                  <l>—Is not Powers Permission a Consent,</l>
                  <l>Which is in Kings the same as to Ordain;</l>
                  <l>And Ills ordain'd are free from punishment?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But of this Subject, I shall have occasion
to be more at large.</p>
            <p>These few State Memoris against the
<hi>Stage,</hi> that <hi>Stage</hi> that Flourish'd in the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires, above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years together; in the Histories of so
many Ages, and through two such Spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Empires, are all he can find us; I dare
not say, will not; for he's never sparing of
Scandal if he knew where to get it.</p>
            <p>To all these State Authorities, he finishes
that Head of his Discourse with a long Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
Letter of the Lord Bishop of <hi>Arras</hi> in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> publish'd about two Years ago a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Plays; too long here to repeat.</p>
            <p>But here I am afraid our Author mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
himself. For one single <hi>Flandrian</hi>
Doctor, as I take it, is not a whole National
Opinion; and therefore this Pastoral Letter
is but a very indifferent Authority upon that
Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49930:13"/>Now for another Head, which he calls
the Testimony of the most celebrated Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosophers, Orators and Historians,
concerning the Stage.</p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Plato,</hi> this Philosopher
tells us, <q>That Plays raise the Passions,
and pervert the use of them, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
are dangerous to Morality. For
this Reason he banishes these Diversions
his Common-wealth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> lays it down for a Rule, <q>That
the Law ought to forbid young People
the seeing of Comedies, such Permissions
not being safe till Age and Discipline had
confirmed them in Sobriety, fortified their
Virtue, and made 'em as it were proof
against Debauchery. That the force of
Musick and Action is very affecting, it
commands the Audience, and changes the
Passions to a resemblance of the Matter
before them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Charge of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Plays somewhat agrees, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Passions,</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> Expounds
the changing the Passions of the Audience to
a Resemblance of, or Sympathy with, the
Matter before them; only <hi>Plato</hi> sat a little
the severer Judge upon them; for he Banisht
them his Common-wealth: But <hi>Aristotle</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
not Matters so high as to a total Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but allows them as an innocent Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49930:13"/>
to Persons of mature Age and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But methinks Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> gives but a
lame Account of <hi>Plato's</hi> Reason for Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Plays from out his Common-wealth.
For I can hardly believe that that Learned
Philosopher, whatever Motives he had for
Excluding Plays from his Government,
would have talk'd so far out of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy, as to tell us that <hi>Raising a
Passion perverts the use of it.</hi> For if, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
explains the Case, the Raising the
Passion is here meant, That the Passion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
on the Stage imprints the same
Passion into the Audience (a Point which
we shall hardly grant him, and which we
shall have occasion to speak of hereafter:)
Yet all this while, if the worst Passion or
Representation on the Stage should have
this wondrous Operation upon the frail Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
For instance, if a Man should see
a <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> and grow as mad, and
pull up Oaks as fast as he; or a Lustful <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
and presently fall a Ravishing: Or a
Young Lady should see a lewd <hi>Thais,</hi> and
immediately take Taint, and play the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
like her; however here's no perverting
the use of the worst of all these Passions.
'Tis true, all these foremention'd Passions are
none of the best: But the worst Passion in
producing its own natural bad Effects,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49930:14"/>
               <hi>Plato</hi> would hardly have call'd it, perverting
the use of the Passion. But Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in
<hi>verbo Sacerdotis</hi> assures us, he Translates
faithfully, and therefore as wise a Man as
<hi>Plato</hi> was, we are bound to give it against
him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tully</hi> cries out upon Licentious Plays
and Poems, as the Bane of Sobriety and
Wife thinking. That Comedy subsists up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Lewdness, and that Pleasure is the root
of all Evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Plutarch,</hi> he tells us, was of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Plays were dangerous to corrupt
Young People: (And here he joyns with
<hi>Aristotle.</hi>) And therefore Stage-Poetry,
when it grows too hardy and licentious,
ought to be checkt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Plutarch</hi> concurs with <hi>Tully, viz.</hi>
That Plays are to be checkt only when too
Licentious, as the Bane of Sobriety, and an
Excitation to Lewdness.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Livy</hi> reports the Original of Plays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Romans, viz.</hi> That they were
brought in upon the score of Religion, to
pacifie the Gods, and remove a Mortality.
But then he adds, That the Motives are
sometimes good, when the Means are
stark naught; that the Remedy in this
Case was worse than the Disease, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49930:14"/>
Atonement more Infectious than the
Plague.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Livy</hi> is an Author, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has all
the reason in the World to set a value upon;
for he's a Man of his own Gall. He owns
that Plays were Originally an Institution
founded upon Religion, that by their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power and Influence they pacified the
Anger of the Gods, and removed a Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or some other general Mortality. (For
he plainly confesses they did the Work, not
the Cure design'd, but perform'd.) Yet
with all these sovereign and pacifick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and the whole Glory of a National
Deliverance wrought by them, the Remedy
was a worse Plague than that it had cured.
Could Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself have declaim'd
more pathetically!</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Valerius Maximus, Livy's</hi> Cotemporary,
gives much the same account of the Rise
of Theatres at <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Twas Devotion
that built them. And for the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of those Places, which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>
calls the <hi>Ornaments;</hi> this Author Censures
as the <hi>Blemishes of Peace:</hi> And which is
more, he affirms, They were the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Civil Distractions, and that the
<hi>State</hi> first blush'd, and then bled for the
Entertainment. He concludes,, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of Plays were intollerable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49930:15"/>And very well he might conclude so, if
he was of his own Cotemporaries Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> That they were a worse Plague
than what they cured. But methinks these
two <hi>Roman</hi> Authors between them have
given Plays an unaccountable Power; for
belike they could make Peace in Heaven,
and raise Wars on Earth; they pacified the
Gods, but set the World at Dissention. And
indeed had either the Spirit of a <hi>Livy</hi> or <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
reign'd amongst them, those Civil Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
had been not at all to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at: For such angry Gentlemen would
have found Matter of Quarrel with Plays,
though for their atoning of Heaven, and
averting of Judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Philosopher, he tells us, was
very angry at the Play-house, and for this
Reason, <q>That scarce any Body would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselves to the study of Nature and
Morality, unless when the <hi>Play-house</hi> was
shut, and the Weather foul. That there
was no Body to teach Philosophy, because
there was no Body to learn it. But that
the Stage had Nurseries and Company
enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Quarrel of <hi>Seneca</hi> against the Stage,
I confess was highly reasonable; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
that angry Gentleman of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was sensibly touch'd in the most tender
part, <hi>viz. Honour</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi> Perhaps the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49930:15"/>
Auditory had found as much good Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be glean'd up at a Play-house Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
as at a Philosophy one; and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Play-house-School got ground of
the Philosophers, 'twas high Time, to cry
out, <hi>Great was his own</hi> Diana <hi>of</hi> Ephesus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> relating how <hi>Nero</hi> hired decay'd
Gentlemen, for the Stage, complains of the
Mismanagement; and lets us know, 'twas
the part of a Prince, to Relieve their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and not to tempt it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that
his Bounty should rather have set them
above an ill Practice, then put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Nero's</hi> Conduct, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be Vindicated, however, begging
both <hi>Tacitus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> Pardon, I must
give it on his side in this Case; and say, he
was here very much in the Right. For if
that Prince thought it no Degradation to his
own Imperial Dignity, Personally to Act
in Plays himself, I know no Reason he
had to think it either a Shame or a Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
in a Private Gentleman, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
one too, to come upon the Stage. If
the Sovereign could play the <hi>Histrio,</hi> sure
the Subject was not above it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Plays, in the Opinion of the Judicious
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> are dangerous to corrupt Young
People; and therefore Stage-Poetry, when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49930:16"/>
it grows too Hardy and Licentious, ought
to be check'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Charge against the Play-house,
is not over severe; the Dangers from
the Stage only threaten'd the Younger sort
of People. Wisdom and Gravity, nay, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself, might enter a
Play-house Walls, and come off unhurt.
Nay, as Dangerous as it might be even to
Youth it self; the Danger belike lay not
either in the Play-house or the Play; but
the Abuses and Corruptions that crept into
the Representations there: For he condemns
the Stage-Poetry, but only when it grows
too <hi>Hardy</hi> and too <hi>Licentious. Plutarch's</hi>
Check does not reach Mr. <hi>Collier's,</hi> he brings
only the pruning Hook.</p>
            <p>I have here recited every Individual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
quoted by Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosophers, Historians, and Orators;
I think they are somewhat short of half a
Score. And how far their several Authorities
reach, I hope I have indifferently well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.</p>
            <p>Well, to Sum up this Heathenish Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
This Learned Scholiast has made
hard shift to muster up a little above half a
dozen Philosophers, Orators and Historians,
that have either enter'd their <hi>Pagan</hi> Protests,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49930:16"/>
or prefer'd some Arraignment against
Plays.</p>
            <p>Now the particular Opinions of not half
a score of these Dissenting Ethnick Doctors,
out of at least half as many hundred of that
Fraternity, especially too at their rate of
talking, or Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> for 'em, is no more
a Conclusive Argument, in my simple
Judgment, against the Stage; Then a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
in his Tub and his Rags; or an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus</hi>
at his Roots and his Water, should
perswade any Rational Man from a clean
Shirt upon his Back, and a good House o're
his Head; or a good Dish of Meat and a
Bottle of Wine for his Dinner, <hi>viz.</hi> if he is
able to purchase it.</p>
            <p>And now as doughtily as these Orators
have supported his Cause, upon this Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
Foundation, what a <hi>Colossus</hi> has he
rais'd.</p>
            <p>For he concludes upon this Head, with
telling us, <q>This was the Opinion of those
Celebrated <hi>Authors,</hi> with respect to <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres.</hi>
They charge 'em with the Corruption
of Principles and Manners, and lay in all
imaginable Caution against them. And
yet these Men had seldom any thing but
this World in their Scheme; and form'd
their Judgment only upon Natural Light,
and common Experience. We see then
to what sort of Conduct we are obliged.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49930:17"/>
The Case is plain: Unless we are little
enough to renounce our Reason, and fall
short of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and live <hi>under</hi> the pitch
of <hi>Heathenism.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here I must confess this Insinuation is
very artful. But all this while these Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
that charge the Stage with this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Principle and Manners, give us
but their bare Word for it. Was it enough
for the Great <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the very
Doctors of the Chair in the Old Heathen
Divinity, (for Religion was then but Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophies
Pupil); was it enough, I say, for
those Zealots in Morality, to see that Stage
that had stood hundreds of Years, and to
look upon it, as such a Nursery of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and say no more against it? Does it
look like the Man that the World received
him, for <hi>Plato,</hi> to tell us in a Line and a
Half, That <hi>Plays raise the Passions, and pervert
the use of them, and by consequence are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to Morality;</hi> only to start such an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
Fragment, and not make a little
Sermon-Work upon that Text? Perhaps
indeed, <hi>Sic Volo, sic Iubeo,</hi> might be enough
to banish Plays from his own Common-wealth;
and even that short Sentence might
be Supererrogation. However, he owed
that Justice both to the World around him,
and Posterity after him, to read a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Esculapian Lecture upon so Epidemick a
Disease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49930:17"/>Undoubtedly had either <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
but half Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> Pique against the
Play-houses, they would have spared their
Ink as little as he has done; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
have supplied him with more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Satyr, and more sensible Arguments
upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>But for once I'll joyn Issue with him, and
to throw some Weight more into his Scale,
I'll suppose these half a dozen Philosophical
Doctors with their <hi>Natural Light,</hi> and as
many Doctor <hi>Collier's</hi> with their <hi>Divine
Light,</hi> had all past their Negative Vote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Stage; however they would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carry the Cause. For truly I know no
Reason why the Stage should be obliged to
stand upon a stronger Basis then the very
Sanction of our <hi>Laws</hi> themselves. And I
doubt not but a Foundation may be very
honest and innocent, though not establish'd
by a <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these Testimonies of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he tells you, <q>He'll add a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Poets, who both seem to be good
Judges of the Affair in hand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The first is <hi>Ovid,</hi> who in his Book, <hi>De
Arte Amandi,</hi> gives his Reader to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that the Play-house was the most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Place to forage in. Here would be choice,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49930:18"/>
nothing being more common than to see
Beauty surprized, Women Debauch'd,
and Wenches pick'd up at those Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Ovid. <hi>Lib. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Sed tu praecipue curvis venare Theatris,</l>
            <l>Haec Loca sunt voto fertiliora tuo.</l>
            <l>—Ruit ad celebres cultissiama Foemina
Ludos;</l>
            <l>Copia judicium saepe mor at a meum est.</l>
            <l>Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut
ipsae,</l>
            <l>Iile Locus casti damna pudor is habet.</l>
            <p>In this Authority of <hi>Ovid,</hi> our Learned
Observator, quite forgets himself, and runs
off from his Theme. For <hi>Ovid</hi> has nothing
to say against the <hi>Stage,</hi> or any Reflection,
or Objection against the Dramatick Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
there. His present Business, to speak
in the modern Dialect, is only with the <hi>Pit,
Box</hi> and <hi>Galleries.</hi> This Quotation therefore
is but very indifferently rank'd under that
Head, <hi>viz. The Opinion of Paganism concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Stage.</hi> He tells us indeed, the Young
and the Fair are to be seen at the Theatres;
That Beauty and High Toppings, <hi>Faemina
Cultissima,</hi> and undoubtedly Beauty and High
Virtue too, <hi>Faemina Castissima</hi> may be seen in
a Play-house; nay, and come thither too,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49930:18"/>
               <hi>to see and be seen,</hi> without any offence to
Modesty. And hither 'tis that <hi>Ovid</hi> invites
his Young Pupils in the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> to <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
in (as he calls it.)</p>
            <p>And here I'll give Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> the Point,
<hi>viz.</hi> That a Debauchee may pick up a
Wench at those Diversions. Nor is it any
great wonder in so Universal a Concourse
of the Young and the Fair, to find some
smutty Corn in so large a Field. <hi>Society</hi>
and <hi>Crowds,</hi> upon a more sacred Ground
than a <hi>Play-house,</hi> are not wholly compos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Honour and Innocence, but that a
Carrion Crow may be catch'd even in a
flock of Doves.</p>
            <p>And truly had not Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
over-sighted, he would have inform'd
us, that <hi>Ovid</hi> was of the same Opinion. For
in the very immediate foregoing Verses to
this Quotation, he advises his Young Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
to forage the <hi>Temples of the Gods;</hi> for
he may find the same Game to fly at there
too.</p>
            <p>And here I am sorry I must joyn with
<hi>Ovid;</hi> when much Diviner Altars are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the same Profanation. 'Tis not all
Religion and Piety that enters a Church
Door: Hypocrisie and Wantonness are too
often too bold Intruders: And not only to
<hi>see and to be seen,</hi> is the height of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but possibly the <hi>Lecture</hi> and the <hi>Sermon</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49930:19"/>
may be sometimes made the screen to the
<hi>Rover</hi> and the <hi>Wanton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> I hope, will not infer
from hence, that the Church Doors should
be shut up, or Devotion barr'd entrance, for
fear of Prophanation or Hypocrisie herding
in along with them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, there may be a Case, and a
weighty one, for keeping us out from
<hi>Church, Prayers, Sacraments,</hi> and what not;
as we find it recorded in a Learned Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
publish'd by this Orthodox School-man,
called, <hi>A Perswasive to Consideration,
tender'd to the</hi> Royalists, <hi>particularly those of
the</hi> Church of <hi>England, Printed in the Year,
1695. being a Discourse upon this Text—</hi> In
the Day of Adversity consider—Where
Page 35 we Read, as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>However, I am loth to leave my Church!
<hi>(the Auditor thus Expostulating with him)</hi>
You say well. But can you expect to find the
Church, where it's peculiar Doctrines are
disowned; where it's Authority is opposed,
and betrayed to the Secular Power? Does the
Being of a Church consist in Brick and Stone?
What would you do if <hi>Jupiter</hi> was worshipped
there? I hope the chiming of the Bells would
not draw you to the Service of the Idol. If
it is urged, that we may be so planted as to
want the Advantage of an Orthodox Pastor;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49930:19"/>
What is to be done in such Circumstances?
Must we pray alone, without the Assistance of
Priest or Congregation? To this Question,
after what has been said, I think the Proverb
a sufficient Return; <hi>Better be alone than
in ill Company.</hi> If 'tis farther objected,
That by this Principle we lose the Benefit of
the Blessed Sacrament. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>1. That this Objection is oftentimes no
more than Pretence: For if People would
take that Pains which the Regard to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
requires, it seldom happens but they
might receive it from proper Hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But 2. I answer, That breaking the <hi>Unity</hi>
of the Church by Schismatical Communion,
and making <hi>our selves Partakers of other
Men's Sins,</hi> (1 Tim. 5. 22.) is a bad Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for the Sacrament. To break a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law for a positive Ordinance, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so valuable, looks like robbing in order to
Sacrifice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And therefore when the Case is truly put;
a pious Desire of Receiving will be Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to the Thing. This being an allowed Rule
in Instances of Necessity. So that we cannot
be said to lose the Benefit of the Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
though we are not so happy as to
partake in the Administration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49930:20"/>Now by the same Strength of Reason
he has here carry'd the Cause against the
whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Excluded
his Royalists from all publick Devotion;
undoubtedly he may shut up the Play-house
Doors, and exclude 'em from all publick
Diversion too.</p>
            <p>The other Poet he joyns with <hi>Ovid,</hi> is the
Author of the <hi>Plain-Dealer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Poet, in his <hi>Dedication</hi> to <hi>Lady B.</hi>
some Eminent <hi>Procuress,</hi> pleads the Merits
of his Function, and insists upon being Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leted
upon Free Quarter. <hi>Madam,</hi> says he,
<hi>I think a Poet ought to be as free of your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as of the Play-houses, since he contributes to
the Support of both, and is as necessary to such
as You, as the Ballad-Singer to the Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse,
in convening the Cullies at the</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
<hi>to be pick'd up and carried to a Supper,
and Bed, at Your Houses.</hi> This is frank
Evidence, and ne're the less true for the
Air of a Jest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As frank as this <hi>Plain-Dealer's</hi> Evidence is,
here's nothing but what, with a very Grave
face of Truth, and in as earnest a Jest,
might have been said upon any other Publick
places of Meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dancing-Schools,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49930:20"/>
the <hi>Mall,</hi> the <hi>Parks,</hi> the <hi>Gardens;</hi> and
where not? And unless this Man of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
would have a Law made to suppress
all Places of general Resort, and confine
Mankind to Cells and Caves, I know not
well how he will prevent all these Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that the <hi>Plain-Dealer</hi> has here rallied
upon.</p>
            <p>Nay, this I will positively averr, That
both the <hi>Plain-Dealer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Collier's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
on this side, lies much stronger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any other publick Place of Resort than
the Play-house. For if Wantonness and
Lewdness will creep into all Publick Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
though of never so innocent a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Theatres lie least obnoxious to that
Danger. For in all the other forementioned
Places of Resort, we make our own Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
have no Entertainment but what we
give our selves; and consequently, as <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the Mother of Lust,</hi> and when <hi>We</hi>
have least to do, the <hi>Devil</hi> has most; we lie
more open to Temptation and Irregular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
than we can do in a Play-house, where
the Diversion is all found to our Hands, and
the Auditor has both his Eyes and his Ears
so employ'd, and is so much taken up with
either the Pity and Concern for the Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Tragedy, or a Mirth and Delight
from the Pleasantry of Comedy, that he has
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49930:21"/>
hardly the Leisure to rove after any Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own.</p>
            <p>And therefore if our Platonick Author
is for banishing of Plays, for this only
Grievance within the Walls of a Play-House,
he may as justly Vote for the rooting
up a Garden, for fear the Spider should suck
Poyson from the Flowers.</p>
            <p>Next, to proceed to his Testimony of the
Fathers, he begins with <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived in the second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
            <p>
               <q>'Tis not lawful <hi>(says this Father)</hi> for us
to be present at the Prizes of the <hi>Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
least by this Means we should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Murders there committed.
Neither dare we presume upon the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of your other <hi>Shows,</hi> least our Senses
should be tinctur'd and disobliged with
Indecency and Prophaneness. The Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Distractions of <hi>Tereus</hi> and <hi>Thyestes</hi> are
Nonsense to us. We are for seeing no
Representations of Lewdness. The Stage
Adulteries of the Gods and Hero's are
unwarrantble Entertainments; and so
much the worse because the Mercinary
Players set them off with all the Charms
and Advantages of Speaking. God forbid
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49930:21"/>
that Christians, who are remarkable for
Modesty and Reservedness, who are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to Discipline, and train'd up to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
God forbid, I say, that we should
dishonour our Thoughts, much less our
Practice, with such Wickedness as this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived in the latter End
of this Century, thus Addresses the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
upon this Subject.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We keep off from your Publick Shews,
because we cannot understand the Warrant
of their Original. There's Superstition and
Idolatry in the Case; and we dislike the
Entertainment, because we dislike the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its Institution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>His Book, <hi>De Spectaculis,</hi> was wrote on
purpose to diswade the Christians from the
publick Diversions of the Heathens, of
which the Play-house was one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Arguments of <hi>Tertullian</hi> which are too
long here to recite, were chiefly upon these
two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Pleasure was a bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Thing,</hi> and the Levity of the Theatres
for that Cause was not consistent with the
severer Principles of Christianity. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Argument was the <hi>low Character</hi> of
Players, from the <hi>Magistracy it self, who,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49930:22"/>
though they abetted</hi> the Stage, <hi>discountenanced
the</hi> Players, <hi>and crampt their Freedoms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he insinuates the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being present at those Entertainments;
and tells us one sad Example of a <hi>Demoniack
Possession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A certain Woman went to the Play-house,
and brought the <hi>Devil</hi> home with
her. And when the unclean Spirit was
prest in the Exorcism, and ask'd how he
durst attack a Christian? I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(says he) but what I can justifie;
for I seiz'd her upon my own Ground.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I enter upon any other Argument,
I shall make some few Remarks upon this
<hi>Possession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not Dispute <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Veracity
in this Relation; yet methinks, upon a
thorough Examination, neither <hi>Tertullian</hi>
nor Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> have over-well proved the
Play-house to be the Devils own Ground,
when the Title's supported by no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than a bare single Affirmative, and
that from no other Mouth than the <hi>Father
of Lies,</hi> the Devil himself. If the Play-house
were really a Chattellany of Lucifer,
a Fief of the Infernal Empire, some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49930:22"/>
are of Opinion, the Devil would be the
last would tell us so: For as the subtilty of
that cunning Seducer strows all his Pit-falls
with Flowers, he has neither that Charity
for Mankind, nor owes that Service to God,
to play thus Booty against himself in so
frank a Declaration. However, if that rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Sworn Enemy of Man, had any such
generous Principle in him, the <hi>Dives</hi> in
Flames had had no occasion of supplicating
a Monitory Messenger, to send to his World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Friends, from <hi>Abraham:</hi> But might e'ne
have begg'd the Civil Favour of that kind
Errand from one of his own Tormentors.
This I must say, that this foolish Devils im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
Discovery was so Capital a piece
of Treason against the Interest of his own
Infernal Kingdom, that really I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to set him <hi>Rectus in Curia Diabolica,</hi>
he wants <hi>Absolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but perhaps you'll say, This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
was no Blunder in his Politicks, but
extorted by the Divine Force of the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.
Really Sir, that may be. However
to give this Devil and his Vouchers their
due, all this Confession carries a very rank
Face of a Sham still. For if it were substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Verity, that the Play-house was truly
and firmly the Devils own Ground, and
every Christian Rambler catch'd upon it his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49930:23"/>
own Lawful, and, to use his own words, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable
Seizure; at this rate, the Devil must
be soften'd into a Spirit of that unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Mercy, so very unlike the Bible Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
we have of him, when among so many
Thousands and Ten Thousands, nay Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
and Millions of Christians, that since
that Day have been caught in a Play-house
Walls, so pat for his Clutches; nevertheless
this only single Seizure of that kind is all
that's Recorded against him.</p>
            <p>I have several times heard this Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack
Story warmly play'd, as not a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Battery against the Theatres, by
some passionate Zealots, no very good
Friends either to our Church or our Stage;
and to confirm this Diabolical Authority,
those Enthusiasts without question had read,
that 'twas no new Thing for the Cloven-foot
to deliver Oracles, and therefore doubt not
but this may be one.</p>
            <p>But in all these Declamations of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
against Stage-plays, St. <hi>Cyprian, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and all of 'em
confess 'twas the General Opinion of the
Christians that Plays were a <hi>Lawful Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
and therefore the whole business of
those Declamations, is the opening the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Eyes, and refuting that too Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49930:23"/>
Erroneous Opinion; and what occasion'd
that spreading Error amongst them was,
that the appearance of that general Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
in those Entertainments gave them
that Reception amongst the Christians, that
they could not believe them Criminal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some express Divine Precept against
them; and accordingly St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<hi>de Spectaculis,</hi> argues against those, <hi>who
thought the Play-house no unlawful Diversion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'twas not condemned by express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So</hi> Tertullian <hi>reproves the Christians,</hi> That
their Faith is either too full of Scruples, or too
barren of Sense. Nothing <hi>(he says)</hi> will serve
to settle them but a plain Text of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
They hover in uncertainty, because 'tis not said
as expresly, <hi>[Thou shalt not go to the Play-house,]</hi>
as 'tis <hi>[Thou shalt not Kill,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>And here, with all due Reverence to these
Christian Fathers, the Scriptural silence in that
Case well furnish some more curious Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
than they have been pleas'd to make;
and which I hope will be no unpardonable
Inquiry to prosecute a little farther then
they have done.</p>
            <p>First then, as our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> was
Born in the Days of <hi>Augustus,</hi> 'tis known,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49930:24"/>
by all Historians, that the shutting up of
<hi>Ianus's</hi> Temple Doors in his Reign, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
open'd those of the Play-houses. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrick
Representations in all the Provinces
of the Spacious <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, were the
then Common Publick Diversion and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and such they continued many
Reigns after him.</p>
            <p>Now it may raise a little Wonder why
the Apostles, that went forth by a special
Command of the Almighty to Convert all
Nations, Preaching Repentance, and the
Kingdom of Heaven; They that so exactly
perform'd that great Commission, as to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
or Censure Vice and Impiety from the
highest to the lowest, in all its several Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
not only pronounced their lowder <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathemas</hi>
against the more crying Sins, but
read Divinity-Lectures even upon the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe
and Dressing-Box, correcting the very
Indecencies of the <hi>Hair,</hi> the <hi>Apparel,</hi> and
each uncomely <hi>Gesture, &amp;c.</hi> That these Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
of <hi>Salvation</hi> should travel through so
many Heathen Nations (the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they
were sent to call) and meet at every turn
the <hi>Theatre</hi> and the <hi>Stage-players</hi> staring them
in the very Face, and not make one Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
against them, is a Matter of very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reflection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49930:24"/>Had the Play-house been, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
calls it, the <hi>Seat of Infection;</hi> or as <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus</hi> much to the same Sense calls it,
the <hi>Chair of Pestilence;</hi> and (to join the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Unclean Spirit</hi> along with
them,) <hi>the Devils own Ground;</hi> I am of
Opinion in this Case, that those Divine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
the Apostles, that sets Bars to the
<hi>Eye,</hi> the <hi>Ear,</hi> the <hi>Tongue,</hi> to every smallest
Avenue that might let in the <hi>Tempter;</hi> would
hardly have left the Broad Gates to the
Play-house so open, without one Warning
to the unwary Christian in so direct a Road
to Perdition. Such a Discovery I believe
would have been rather the earlier Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Favour of some of our kind Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Guardians, then the Extorted Confession
of our greatest Infernal Enemy two hundred
Years after.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives a Reason for
this Apostolical Silence, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That some
things are more strongly forbidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
unmention'd. The Divine Wisdom
would have had a low Opinion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
had it descended to particulars in
this Case. Silence is sometimes the best
Method for Authority. To forbid, often
puts People in mind of what they should
not do; and thus the force of the Precept
is lost by naming the Crime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49930:25"/>Here the World must pardon me, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to say, That St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> plays more
the <hi>Orator</hi> than the <hi>Church-man.</hi> I hardly
believe that there has been that Crime too
Black to lie upon Scripture Paper, when the
very Sin that drew down Fire upon <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> has been recorded there: Nor
can I grant him his Consequence, <hi>viz. That
such Black Sins are the more strongly forbidden
because unmention'd.</hi> This I am certain, That
the many, the loud, and the repeated Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of Vengeance from the Mouths
of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
denounced against the most Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Iniquities and Abominations, does not
very well prove the Scriptural Silence in such
Cases.</p>
            <p>Besides, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> here, under the notion
of a <hi>Reason</hi> for such Silence, either flies
wide from the Matter, or else contradicts
himself. The Charge he all along lays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Plays, is the <hi>Levities and Impertinences
of the Comedies,</hi> the <hi>Ranting Distractions of
Tragedies,</hi> that <hi>Plays were originally the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heathen Idolatry.</hi> That as they are
<hi>Lewd Representations,</hi> they <hi>are of this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence,</hi> viz. <hi>That by using to see such
Things we shall learn to do them,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>that
therefore we must draw off our Inclinations from
these Vanities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49930:25"/>All this is so far from a Blackness too
deep for Paper, or a Monster too hideous
for the Modesty of Divine Revelation to
expose to Light, that nothing can be less.
But granting this Christian Father the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of being sometimes cooler, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
warmer upon that Subject, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Levities and Vanities to be so
many <hi>Gorgons</hi> and <hi>Medusa's;</hi> granting the
Play-house to be that <hi>Rock,</hi> that <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,</hi>
or any other more devouring Gulph;
however, the Divine Wisdom in that Case,
instead of having a low Opinion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
had it descended to a particular Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against it; especially when the hidden
Rock or Quicksand lay so unseen by the
general Eye of Christians, that both by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
and St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Confession, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
appear'd so little, that 'twas the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Christian Opinion, the Play-house was
a Lawful Diversion; on the contrary, the
Divine Wisdom, I say, had as much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of some seasonable Admonition, to
hang out as a Watch-Light or Sea-Mark,
against those hidden Rocks, as ever <hi>Aaron</hi>
had to warn the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> from the
Tents of <hi>Coran, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> before
the Earth opened to swallow them: And
undoubtedly had there been any such true
Danger in a Play-house, the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
without either a low Opinion of it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49930:26"/>
in descending to <hi>give</hi> such a particular
Caution, or the weak-sighted Christian
to <hi>want</hi> it; amongst its other many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
particualar Monitory Favours and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
wou'd have added this One more to
that infinite Number. I wish this Divine
Author has not himself a much lower Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Christians, when to crutch his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against the Play-house, he would
insinuate, that even a Gospel-Precept may be
sometimes ensnaring, and the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God himself against a Sin, a
Temptation to draw us into it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that in some Cases it is much safer,
and more divine Prudence, to leave the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to grope out his way to Salvation, than
to give him a Light to guide him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Besides, these Fathers, instead of defending
the Spiritual Silence against Plays (the main
Argument they drive at,) the Gospel-Light
being no ways wanted to guard against
them, but that even the very Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was sufficient in that Case; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as they have managed their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Stage, have put it so far
out of the power of Nature, that they seem
to enforce the absolute necessity of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Revelation Pilot even to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Danger that lay there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49930:26"/>For Instance, <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Will you not avoid this Seat of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
The very Air suffers by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities,
and they almost pronounce the
Plague! What tho' the Performance may
be in some measure Pretty and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
What, tho' <hi>Innocence,</hi> yes, and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
too, shines through some part of it?
'Tis not the Custom to prepare Poison un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palatable,
nor make up Rats-bane with
<hi>Rhubarb</hi> and <hi>Sena.</hi> No, to have the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
speed, they must oblige the Sense,
and make the Dose pleasant. Thus the
Devil throws in a Cordial Drop to make
the Draught go down; and steals some
few Ingredients from the <hi>Dispensatory</hi> of
Heaven. In short, look upon all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
Sentences of the Stage: Their
Flights of Fortitude and Philosophy, the
Loftiness of their Stile, the Musick of the
Cadence, and the fineness of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
Look upon it only, I say, as
Honey dropping from the Bowels of a
Toad, or the Bag of a Spider. Let your
Health over-rule your Pleasure, and don't
Die of a little <hi>Liquorishness.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Visible Beauties of the Stage
were made up of all those attracting
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49930:27"/>
Charms and Graces, <hi>viz. Engaging Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Morality, Philosophy, Virtue</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi>
and all so <hi>shining;</hi> could <hi>Nature</hi> in
this Case, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, <hi>so govern, where
Revelation does not reach,</hi> as to discover the
<hi>Latent</hi> Poison in the Pill, and all mix'd up
with so many <hi>Ingredients of Heaven,</hi> and
under so many Leaves of Gold? Could
meer Natural Light <hi>supply the Holy Text,</hi>
to warn us against so lovely and fair a Face,
set forth by <hi>Tertullian</hi> with all these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
Enchantments, without any want
of a Spiritual Illumination, to tell us, 'Tis
the <hi>Syren</hi> that wears it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> however endeavours to palliate
this Scriptural Silence, and tells us, <hi>Though
Plays are not expresly forbidden in Scripture,
we have the meaning of the Prohibition, though
not the Sound, in the First Psalm,</hi> Blessed is
the Man that walks not in the Counsel of
the Ungodly, nor stands in the way of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
nor sits in the Seat of the Scornful.</p>
            <p>I hope no Man will interpret my Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the Application of this Text to the
Condemnation of Play-houses, to any want
of Veneration to so celebrated a Pillar of
the Church as <hi>Tertullian;</hi> nay, and all this
the substantial Meaning, only the empty
Sound wanting!—And here I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49930:27"/>
had the <hi>Demoniack</hi> Woman had no
plainer Christian Light to lead her to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
than this to shew her the Snares of a
Play-house, I am very much afraid she had
continued under <hi>Possession</hi> still, and never
got loose from the Infernal Talons that
seiz'd her there.</p>
            <p>And here again I must once more beg my
Reader not to charge me with the Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Divine Writ, when I declare from
my Soul I should as soon quote, and with
as reasonable a Construction, that Verse in
the <hi>Psalm, Why does the Heathen rage, and
the People imagine a vain Thing?</hi> for a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edg'd
Sword against <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> the
Ranting of Tragedy, and the Fiction of
Comedy; and that <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> and the
Comical <hi>Davus,</hi> were both hewed down
together.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Fathers.</p>
            <p>If the Heathen Dramatick Poetry, in the
Plays of their Times, were so scandalous,
so lewd, and infamous a Representation,
that the very mention of them in Divine
Precept, though to set the Mark of <hi>Cain</hi>
upon them, <hi>[Thou shalt not see a Play]</hi> by
the Venerable <hi>Tertullian</hi> being even rank'd
with <hi>[Thou shalt not Kill],</hi> were too black
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49930:28"/>
a Record to foul the very Paper with: I
am here very much afraid, that this Learn'd
Histriomastix, our Author, has thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a great deal of Oyl and Labour in
washing the Ethiop; when in his First
Chapter of <hi>The Immodesty of the Stage,</hi> in
his comparing the Ancient and Modern
Play-wrights, he clears almost the whole
Body of the Greek and Latin Dramatick
Poets from every Thing so much as tending
to Lewdness or Smut, or even a double
Entendre that way. In short, what with
the Native Morals and Virtues of the Poets
themselves, and the Superiour Care of the
Publick <hi>Inspectors</hi> and <hi>Censors</hi> of the Theatre,
he sets forth, at large, that Modesty and
Innocence of the Heathen Stage, so far from
encouraging Lewdness and Debaucheries,
corrupting of Manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any of those
hideous Phaenomena's through that long and
learned Harangue of the Fathers against
them; that hardly any thing, scarce North
and South, can be more opposite, than the
Sentiments of these Doctors of the Primitive
Church in his last Chapter, and of this
sometimes Minister of the English Church
in the first Chapter.</p>
            <p>For Instance, he begins with <hi>Plautus,</hi> an
Author that, he tells us, <q>Has left us 20
intire Comedies; out of which Volume
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49930:28"/>
of Antiquity, he quotes but five censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Passages, and those but moderate
ones, <hi>viz. Lena</hi> and <hi>Bacchis</hi> the Strumpet
are airy and somewhat over-merry, but
not obscene. <hi>Chalinus,</hi> in Womans
Cloths, is the most remarkable. <hi>Pasicompa
Charinus</hi> his Wench, talks too freely to
<hi>Lysimachus,</hi> and so does <hi>Sophroclidisca,</hi>
Slave to <hi>Lemnoselene;</hi> and lastly, <hi>Phro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesiam,</hi>
a Woman of the Town, uses a
double Entendre to <hi>Stratophanes.</hi> This
Poet, he farther informs us, confesses
Smut a scandalous Entertainment; that
such Liberties ought to fall under Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
to lie unmentioned, and be blotted
out of Memory. And that this was not
a Copy of his Countenance, we may
learn from his Compositions. Nay, this
very <hi>Plautus,</hi> who wrote in an Age not
perfectly refin'd, has regard to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
of Modesty, and the Dignity
of Humane Nature; and though he often
seems to design his Plays for a Vulgar
Capacity, he does not make Lewdness
his Business.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Terence,</hi> who appear'd when Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was more exact, and the Town better
polish'd, he says, <q>That he managed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and has but one faulty bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Expression, which is that of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49930:29"/>
                  <hi>Chremes</hi> to <hi>Clitopho.</hi> This single Sentence
apart, the rest of his Book is unfullied,
and fit for the nicest Conversation. Nay,
his very Strumpets are modest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
not unbecoming their Sex.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Seneca,</hi> he assures us, <q>He is clean
throughout the whole Piece; and stands
generally off from the point of Love.
In fine, to dispatch the <hi>Latins</hi> together, he
tells you, They had nothing smutty so
much as in a Song, and kept their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
under Discipline.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To do the same Right to the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets
he tells us, <q>How the Stage had both its
beginning and highest Improvement at
<hi>Athens.—Aeschylus</hi> was the first who
appear'd with any Reputation: His Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
seems noble, and his Mind generous,
willing to transfuse it self into the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and inspire them with a Spirit of
Bravery. His Materials were shining
and solid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Tragedian had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a nice Regard to good Manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so govern'd his Expressions of Love,
that they carried a Face of Virtue along
with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Sophocles,</hi> that next succeeded him on
the Stage, he gives this Character, <q>That
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49930:29"/>
he was in Earnest an extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and among his many eminent and
all virtuous Qualifications, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
himself with Amours, nothing can
be more temperate or decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His
Descriptions of Love are within the
Terms of Honour; the Tendernesses are
solemn as well as soft; they move to
Pity and Concern, and go no farther.
In fine, like his Predecessor, he lightly
touches upon an amorous Theam; and,
to use our Author's ingenious Allusion,</q>
               <hi>He glides along like a Swallow upon the Water,
and skims the Surface, without dipping a
Feather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Next for <hi>Euripides,</hi> his Character a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
too with his Elder Brothers, even
to priding himself in Virtue and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
delivering great Thoughts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Language, and being drest more
like a Gentleman than a Player. His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
lies in the Perspicuity of his
Stile; in Maxims and Moral Reflection;
in his peculiar Happiness for touching
the Passions, especially that of Pity; and
lastly, in exhausting the Cause, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> upon the stretch of
Reason. And for Modesty he is intirely
in the Authors Favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He calls
Whoring Stupidness and playing the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49930:30"/>
Fool; and to be Chast and Regular is
with him, as well as with <hi>Aeschylus,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As much as to say, 'tis the
consequence of Sense and right Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, he singles out one frail Brother
of the Quill, <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> and finds a very
foul Blot in his Scutcheon, <hi>viz. Atheism;</hi>
and hereupon very passionately declaims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Topick, <hi>viz.</hi> upon his ridiculing
the Gods, and breaking in upon Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for several whole Pages. But as heavy as
the Atheist lies upon him, still he wipes off
the Imputation of Debauchery, assuring us,
<q>That as to the business of Love, <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>
always declin'd it. He never pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
up a Play with Courtship and Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
tho' he wrote nothing but Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 'Tis true, as to the Atheism of
<hi>Aristophanes,</hi> tho' it may appear somewhat
a Sin against the Athenian Light of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy:
It happen'd to be a Fault on the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
side, (at least in the Christian Scale)
when only against the Libertine Houshold
of Heathen Gods, where neither Infidelity
nor Apostacy were altogether so Capital.</p>
            <p>Now, as such were the Characters of the
Ancient Poets, and those the very Founders
of the Feast in the Theatrical Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49930:30"/>
in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Days,
and some Ages after them, I cannot but
once more repeat my Amazement at their
over-passionate Exclamations against the
Stage, especially upon the mistaken Topick
of Lewdness and Debauchery.</p>
            <p>After all this honest and faithful Review
of the Ancient Stage, taken even by our
kind Author himself, I fancy he has given
us some more substantial Reasons for the
Scriptural Silence against Plays, than all
these Fathers have done. For if such, by
his own generous Acknowledgment, was
the Stage Primitive State of Innocence; (a
Confession which we highly stand obliged
to him for, though like one of Sir <hi>Martin
Marral's</hi> Discoveries, considering how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it makes for his Cause,) I fear we shall
thank him for a Favour he never intended
us.</p>
            <p>If therefore, as I was saying, or rather
our Author has said for me, such was not
only the Innocence of the Heathen Stage,
under all the Restrictions of <hi>Chastity, Modesty</hi>
and <hi>Decency,</hi> not only from the native prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Authors, but also from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of Publick Authority; but even
such was the Merit (so I may call it) of
those Theatrick Representations so little
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49930:31"/>
tending to the Corruption of Manners,
That <hi>several of them were written with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
to speak in his own Language, <hi>enough
to transfuse and inspire a Spirit of Bravery,
so far from a Check, as to be rather an Excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Virtue.</hi> Here, upon all these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
even from our Author himself, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
still that as Stage-Plays are only Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Institutions, and Worldly Diversions,
and that that Objection shall be found no
Bar to this Plea of Innocence, as that I hope
we shall make out;) this then being the
Stage, and these the Plays that faced the
whole Travels of the Apostles; here's a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
substantial Argument for the Evangelical
Silence, in not one word against them; for
the Mouths of those Divine Oracles open'd
only to the Correction of <hi>Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it raise any part of an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against this Argument for their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Original innocent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Plays was sometimes Corrupted,
their Modesty Debauch'd, and Abuses crept
in amongst them, as this Author often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
against them; For as the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
themselves had their Censors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors
appointed to correct and punish
those Abuses, and to keep the Stage in the
bounds of Modesty, I hope the Christians
needed no particular Scriptural Precept in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49930:31"/>
that Case: The Divine Wisdom must then
have most truly had a low Opinion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to think they wanted any particular
Evangelical Light to follow, even where
the Ignorant Heathen had led before them.
And as to the more horrid Representations
of the Amphitheater, so frequent in the
<hi>Neronian</hi> Reign, in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> died;
here indeed there wanted no Evangelick
Command, to warn the Christian from
those Execrable Bloody Walls, where Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon Murder even in cold Blooded
Sport was made a Publick Entertainment;
The Divine Wisdom, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says,
had had a low Opinion indeed to think the
Christian could want a Heavenly Caution
of entring those Shambles of Humane But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>Besides, to shew how little the Dramatick
Poetry lay under the Gospel Censure, our
Author, (tho' upon another occasion,) is
pleas'd to quote that Text of St. <hi>Paul, Evil
Communications corrupt Good Manners,</hi> as the
Expression first of the Comick Poet <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
290 Years before Christ, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle. Here I would
ask whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> the most Learned of
the Apostles, in delivering the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God, would have incorporated the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Heathen Poet, that possibly had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49930:32"/>
been spoke a hundred times over on the
Publick Stage, by a Hireling Player, into
the Gospel of Truth, notwithstanding the
Morality and Innocence of the Expression it
self; had Stage-Plays in themselves, and that
in their worst capacity of Comedies, justly
lain under St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Character of them, <hi>viz.
That were they not otherwise highly Criminal,
the Foolery of them is egregious and unbecoming
the Gravity of Believers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For some other Instances of St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
Respect for the Poets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Acts 17. 28. In him we live and move
and have our Being; as certain of your own
Poets have said, for we are also his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring.</p>
            <p>In his Epistle to <hi>Titus, Chap. 1. ver. 14,
15.</hi> speaking of the People of <hi>Crete,</hi> he says
in the words of <hi>Epimenides</hi> the Poet.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. One
of themselves, even a Prophet of their own,
said, The Cretians are always Liars, evil Beasts,
slow Bellies: This Witness is true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Apostle has not disdain'd to
quote a Heathen <hi>Poet,</hi> nay, and honour him
with the Title of <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49930:32"/>Now therefore as the Spirit of God spoke
by the inspired Apostles, we may venture
to boast, it gives some Reputation to the
<hi>Poet,</hi> and sure a little Vindication of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of the <hi>Profession,</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
himself has spoke in the words of a <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and an <hi>Epimenides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to make a little farther Examination
into the Reason of this over-violent Zeal and
Vehemence of the Primitive Fathers against
the Stage. We are to consider the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Authority, <hi>viz. Theophilus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Minutius Foelix,</hi>
and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> so faithfully translated by
Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> lived all in the second or third
Century, in the Mourning <hi>Minority</hi> of the
<hi>Church of God,</hi> under the Heathen <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
For <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Christian
Emperor, began his Reign but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fourth Century. Had not
then those Primitive Fathers, with Stakes,
Gibbets, Cauldrons, Gridirons, Racks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
all before their Eyes, a just cause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against the Christian Inclination for
Plays, Delight and Pleasure at that time of
Day? Does the Son from his Fathers Death-Bed
go to the Musick-House? or the Widow
from her Husbands Funeral to the Dancing-School?
Was the Play-house a seasonable
Christian Diversion, possibly to come from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49930:33"/>
a <hi>Laurences</hi> Gridiron to a <hi>Thyestes</hi> Feast? I
may here joyn with <hi>Tertullian.</hi> 
               <q>In Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
Christian, our Time for Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not yet; ye are too craving and ill
manag'd, if you are so violent for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<hi>page 258.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, was it not a yet greater aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the ill timed Christian Fondness
for Plays, to herd, consort and mix with
their Tyrants, Persecutors and Murderers
the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in their Entertainments and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions?
And therefore is it to be doubted, but
that this unseasonable Inclination of the
Christians for Plays went a great way in the
<hi>Fathers</hi> Passionate Declamations against
them; and undoubtedly to check the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Fondness in that Case, push'd 'em up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the necessity of enlarging upon that stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of
Plays, where the weaker one, the <hi>Indecency</hi>
of seeing them, would not prevail?</p>
            <p>Nay, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> joyns the
<hi>Circus</hi> and the <hi>Theatre</hi> together, when he
says, <hi>They may not improperly be called the
Chair of Pestilence.</hi> Does not therefore the
bloody <hi>Gladiator, the profession of the Murder at
the Prize,</hi> as <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> calls it, the <hi>Secular
Games,</hi> and the <hi>Pantomimi,</hi> and all the rest of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49930:33"/>
the more Licentious and Barbarous Heathen
Entertainments, go a great way in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the more Innocent Plays,
whilst the <hi>Stage</hi> suffers with the Ill Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it keeps; all those horrid Diversions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the same time supported by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors? Nay, does not the
very Christian Horror of those Heathen
Tyrants, the Patrons of those Plays, go a
great way with these Fathers to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the <hi>Feast</hi> for the <hi>Founders</hi> sake?
And therefore is all this Vehemence, though
to a <hi>stretch</hi> of Argument, and the <hi>Racking</hi> of
Reasons against them, any thing to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at?</p>
            <p>Suppose we could parallel the same Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Case; were there, for Instance, any such
Diversion as Plays amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> would
not the <hi>Grecian Patriarchs</hi> be as tender of
the Christians mixing in that Diversion,
more especially if our <hi>Mahometans</hi> were like
their <hi>Heathens,</hi> a Spirit of Persecution? Why
then are all these Primitive Champions
brought down to Battle our Theatres, when
their whole Ground of Quarrel and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Complaint, is so Foreign to the
present State of the <hi>English</hi> Stage?</p>
            <p>Next, we'll examine the short Account

Can. 9.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have here recited his Authority of the
Councils of the Church at this full length,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49930:35"/>
as affording Matter for several serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
and weighty Considerations. First,
then it appears by the express words of the
Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the Comedies then
Acted, were <hi>Pagan Entertainments,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
perform'd by Pagans, <hi>viz. Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
and for certain were the <hi>Composition</hi>
of the Heathen Poets; for we have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
or mention of any Christian Poet that
compiled or wrote any Theatrical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations;
For had there been any such
Christian Author, his Name at least, if not
some of his Works would in all likelihood
have been transmitted to Posterity, as well
as so many of the Dramatick Labours of the
Heathen Poets: Besides, had there been any
such Dramatick Christian Writers, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the several <hi>Councils</hi> that prohibited the
<hi>Performance</hi> of Plays, and expresly forbid the
<hi>furnishing</hi> or <hi>dressing out</hi> of Shews or Plays,
would have much more particularly repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the more Capital Offender, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Compiler and Composer of such Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it being their equal Duty and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to crush the Egg as the Cocatrice.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, though Playing then stood
upon that Heathenish bottom, however the
Christians were apt not only to entertain
<hi>Comedians</hi> and <hi>Actors,</hi> but Personally them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49930:35"/>
to be Actors, nay, and in those very
Heathen Compositions.</p>
            <p>Now here was occasion of just Complaint
in those Divine Assemblies, the <hi>Councils</hi> of
the Church, against this Practice of the
Christians, were the matter of Playing it
self never so innocent. For much the same
Reproach (though not the same Apology)
lay against them, as the Jews threw upon
our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> for consorting with <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi>
and <hi>Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christianity in those Days was in its
Morning: The Sun of Righteousness had
not fully dispelled the Heathen Darkness and
Ignorance. The Christians had the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Heathen every where round them.
And as the great Work of calling in the
fulness of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was not yet perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it might reasonably give Offence to the
Fathers of the Church, and raise some sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of fear, that the Christian Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to intermix in the Pagan Diversions and
Vanities, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Plays,</hi> and those origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
too of an Idolatrous Foundation, might
give that Reputation or at least that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to Infidelity, as possibly might in
some measure retard the great Work of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Conversion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49930:36"/>Now as all these <hi>Councils</hi> commenced
from the beginning of the Fourth Century,
at, or after the Administration of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire was lodged in the Hands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes, those Primitive Royal Sons
of the Church, those Champions of the Faith
that would never be wanting in their utmost
Zeal and Industry to propagate the Gospel
of Truth: Here, I say, it will afford a
Matter of the nicest Speculation, <hi>viz.</hi> How
<hi>Players</hi> and <hi>Playing</hi> should lie under this
publick Censure of the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet
<hi>Acting</hi> it self continued unsilenced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppressed
by so many successive Christian
Emperors.</p>
            <p>That it kept all this while so unsuppress'd,
is plain and evident; otherwise, why so
many repeated Decrees of <hi>Councils</hi> against
them, if the occasion of Offence, <hi>viz. Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it self, had not continued? Nor can it
be supposed, had Playing been very much
offensive, or had but half the black Colours
Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has laid upon it, but that some
Ghostly Counsellors would have advised
those Emperors to such a Suppression of the
Stage; and undoubtedly they had listen'd
to such Advice. Their <hi>Power</hi> of putting
such Advice in Execution was indisputable,
and had the Argument been powerful enough
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49930:36"/>
to perswade 'em, without question the <hi>Will</hi>
would not have been wanting; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Christian <hi>Roman</hi> Empire would
never have faln short of the Heathen <hi>Plato</hi> in
his Common-wealth, in banishing the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
upon a full Conviction of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Duty to oblige them to such a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
At least, had the Lenity of those
Christian Emperors, who propagated the
Faith, not by Rods of Iron, but Beams of
Mercy, indulged their <hi>Pagan</hi> Subjects to
continue their Heathen <hi>Plays</hi> and <hi>Vanities;</hi>
nevertheless, 'tis highly to be supposed, they
had either used their own Imperial, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd
their Ecclesiastical Authority to
forbid that Liberty to their <hi>Christian</hi>
Subjects.</p>
            <p>But as nothing of all this was done, but
the open and publick Stage continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken,
in defiance of all this Holy Breath
against it; what can we in all Reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
but that these Christian Princes lookt
back to the fore-mention'd Father louder
Thunder against the Stage, as only a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Blast; the greatest Cloud that rais'd
all that Storm, the main Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Complaint, was dispell'd; for the
late <hi>Mourning,</hi> now <hi>Smiling Church,</hi> had
thrown off her Cypress, her Wounds were
all heal'd, and her Tears wiped away; and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49930:37"/>
thus that great Stage-Stumbling-Block, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>unseasonableness</hi> of Mirth and Diversion,
was removed. The Christians too now
joining in the Heathen Diversion, met their
<hi>Friends,</hi> not their <hi>Persecutors</hi> there. And
for the bloodier <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and all the other
lewder and more barbarous Theatrick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
they fell in course with the
Tyrants that supported them. Thus all
these highest Provocations of the Primitive
Christian Quarrel against the Theatres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and ended, and nothing but the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Dramatick Stage left standing; and that
to liable to all the Inspection and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Censors</hi> and <hi>Supervisors,</hi> upon any
Abuse or Corruption: How then must these
Christian Emperors look upon these Decrees
of the <hi>Councils,</hi> but as an over-warmth of
Zeal, a sort of a <hi>Iury-Presentation,</hi> past at
their <hi>Vacat Exiguis,</hi> not weighty enough to
found a State-<hi>Indictment</hi> upon? Nay, their
Sentence perhaps not worthy the Execution,
as pronounc'd by not altogether the proper
Judges of the Fact: A true Inquisition into
the Stage being more the <hi>States,</hi> than the
<hi>Churches</hi> Province. Those Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Doctors of their <hi>Councils,</hi> pass their
Judgment at too far distance; their Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
come least, or perhaps never into a
Play-house Walls; and therefore the full
Cognizance of the Matter, and the true
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49930:37"/>
Merits of the Cause, lay not so much in
their Reach.</p>
            <p>For these therefore, and whatever other
Reasons the Primitive Christian Government
was induced to continue the <hi>Stage;</hi> Is not
here one of the most convincing Arguments
for the present Establishment of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,
especially comparing the different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
between them? Our Plays are
no <hi>Heathen</hi> Compositions; our <hi>Authors</hi> and
<hi>Auditors</hi> profess one <hi>Faith;</hi> our Stage lies
under no Ecclesiastical Reprimand from the
<hi>Fathers</hi> of our Church: In short, we have
so many more favourable Aspects, and all
that Weight on our side, in ballance between
'em, enough to silence even Calumny it
self.</p>
            <p>And thus, as our Stage has so leading an
Example as the Primitive Christian Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to warrant its Foundation; as it has
received the Protection of Crown'd Heads,
it has sometimes had the Honour of their
Royal Presence at its Diversions too; and
what's yet greater, even Princes of the most
exalted Piety have been the Royal Guests
within those publick Walls.</p>
            <p>In a Sermon upon the Death of the late
QUEEN, preach'd by <hi>William Payne,</hi> D. D.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49930:38"/>
Rector of St. <hi>Mary Whitechappel,</hi> Chaplain to
His MAJESTY, Page 19 and 20. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
upon that copious Theme, the shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Piety of that truly Christian Princess,
we read as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q>She gave Patterns of Virtue not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
or fantastick, affected or unnatural,
such as we meet in the <hi>Legends,</hi> but what
are agreeable to Civil Life, and to all the
Stations of this World, what Christianity
and the plain Law of God require of us;
and those Things which they had not
forbidden, She did not think necessary to
forbid her Self. The undue Rigours and
Severities of some Indiscreet Persons have
done great Harm to Religion and Virtue,
by condemning those Things as absolutely
sinful, which are so only by Accident,
but in themselves innocent; such as
<hi>Dancing, Playing at Cards,</hi> going to <hi>Plays,</hi>
and the like. Our Admirable QUEEN
could distinguish here between Duty
and Prudence, between Unlawful and
Inexpedient. She would not refuse those
Common Diversions, nor use them too
much: She would not wholly keep from
seeing of Plays, as if they were utterly
unlawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49930:38"/>Here are two Christian Authorities, one
from the Theatre and the other the Pulpit,
of a contrary Opinion to Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> viz.
That Plays in themselves are an Innocent
Diversion.</p>
            <p>And here I must look back to one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Fathers against the Theatres.
St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> to oppose the Worldly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Stage, tells us how St. <hi>Paul</hi>
exhorts us <hi>to rejoyce in the Lord.</hi> He said, <hi>In
the Lord,</hi> not <hi>in the Devil.</hi> And St. <hi>Ierome</hi>
on the same Subject says, <q>Some are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the Satisfactions of this
World, some with the <hi>Circus,</hi> and some
with the <hi>Theatre.</hi> But the <hi>Psalmist</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
every good Man <hi>to delight himself
in the Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These Precepts of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> are indeed the highest Duty of
Christianity. But as we are but Men, 'tis
a Duty too weighty to lye upon Humane
Weakness, without any Intervals of some
lighter Alleviations of the Cares and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of Life. Were Life to be intirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between the <hi>Prayer-book,</hi> the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the <hi>Plough,</hi> Rejoycing in God is
that Exercise of Piety, requiring so Intent
and Exalted a Meditation, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Humane Nature would hardly be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49930:39"/>
able to keep up the Soul on so sublime a
flight, without flagging her Wing, and
Devotion so severely tyed to the Altar, I fear,
would make but a very lean Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>But both the <hi>Psalmist</hi> and the <hi>Apostle</hi> did
not extend this Command to Rejoyce <hi>only</hi> in
the Lord; no, their Commission reach'd
not so far, they neither did, nor could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
such a Precept, because their Lord and
Master, our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, would
have refuted them.</p>
            <p>For to give us an Instance, that Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Worldly Mirth and Rejoycing has
received a Warrant of Authority even from
Christ himself; we need but read how
Christ and his Mother were called to the
Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galiiee,</hi> where his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Miracles was turning Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Wine.</p>
            <p>Here we may Innocently and Modestly
presume to suppose, at this Marriage Festival,
when their Wine, as the Text expresses, was
drank out, that Cheerefulness and Mirth
went round with the Glass, not Spiritual
Mirth, for that wants not the Juice of the
Grape. And here undoubtedly our Saviour
would neither have been himself a Guest at
the Feast, or heightned the Mirth at the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49930:39"/>
Price of a Miracle, had either a Cheerful
Glass, a Sociable Rejoycing, or the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Delights of Life been Sinful and Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Nor can the End of this Miracle,
exprest in the Text, <hi>viz. The manifesting
forth his Glory, and</hi> making <hi>his Disciples believe
on him,</hi> be any Argument to weaken my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
For 'twere even Impiety to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
That our Saviour could want Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Opportunities of Exerting the God, to
need a <hi>poor</hi> Choice for the Ground of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
            <p>Next, let us examine one of the most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Offences of Dramatick Poetry arraign'd
both by the Philosophers, Fathers of the
Church, and the Son of the Church, Mr.
<hi>Collier,</hi> viz. <hi>The Raising the Passions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we'll begin with <hi>Tragedy. Tragedy</hi>
indeed does raise the Passions; and its chief
work is to raise <hi>Compassion:</hi> For the great
Entertainment of Tragedy, is the moving
that tenderest and noblest Humane Passion,
<hi>Pity.</hi> And what is it we pity there, but
the Distresses, Calamities and Ruins of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Loyalty, Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> &amp;c. represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some True or Fictitious, Historick or
Romantick Subject of the Play? Thus <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
like <hi>Religion</hi> by its <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more shining by its <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49930:40"/>
Impression we receive from <hi>Tragedy,</hi> is only
making us in Love with <hi>Virtue,</hi> (for Pity
is a little Kin to Love) and out of Love
with Vice; for at the same time we pity
the suffering Virtue, it raises our Aversions
and Hate to the Treachery or Tyranny in the
<hi>Tragedy,</hi> from whence and by whom that
Virtue suffers. How often is the good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
(as for Instance, the <hi>Iago</hi> in the <hi>Moor
of Venice,</hi> or the Countess of <hi>Notingham</hi> in
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>) little less than Curst for
Acting an Ill Part? Such a Natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Commiseration of <hi>Innocence</hi> does
Tragedy raise, and such an Abhorrence of
<hi>Villany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is truly the Entertainment
of Tragedy, we come on purpose to see
<hi>Virtue</hi> made Lovely, and <hi>Vice</hi> made Odious.
That Expectation brings us to the Play; and
if we find not that very Expectation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
instead of any satisfactory Delight
we receive, or any Applause we return, we
Explode and Hiss our Entertainment; the
Play sinks, and the Performance is lost, and
we come away with this Disrelish as to
think both our Money and Time ill
spent.</p>
            <p>'Tis true a Character that has not all the
Perfections of true Honour or Innocence,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49930:40"/>
nay a Vicious one sometimes may move
Compassion. But then 'tis not the Vice or
Blemishes in the Character that moves that
Pity. For Instance in the <hi>Orphan,</hi> we pity
the Vicious and Libertine <hi>Polydore</hi> that lyes
with his Brother's Wife. But when do we
pity him? When he's touch'd with that sense
and horror of his Guilt, that he gives up
his Life, (pick's a feign'd Quarrel with the
Injur'd <hi>Castalio,</hi> and runs upon his Sword)
to Expiate. 'Tis not the <hi>Criminal</hi> but
the <hi>Penitent,</hi> the <hi>Virtue</hi> not <hi>Vice</hi> in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
moves the Compassion.</p>
            <p>Thus we pity <hi>Timon of Athens,</hi> not as the
Libertine nor Prodigal, but the <hi>Misanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos:</hi>
When his Manly and Generous Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against the Universal <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of
Manking makes him leave the World and
fly the Society of Man; when his open'd
Eyes and recollected Virtue can stand the
Temptation of a Treasure he found in the
Woods, enough to purchase his own Estate
again: When all this glittering Mine of
of Gold has not Charm to bribe him back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a hated World, to the Society of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Flatterers.</hi> We pity the
<hi>Evandra</hi> too, his Mistress, not for the Vice
and Frailty in her Character, but for that
Generous Gratitude to the Founder of her
Fortunes, that she sells all she has in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49930:41"/>
World, and brings it all in Jewels to relieve
the Distresses of <hi>Timon;</hi> and what heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
our Pity, is, that she follows him, not
for a Criminal or wanton Conversation with
him: Nay, what's yet greater, she can quit
all the Vanities and Temptations of Life,
and with an equal Contempt of Jewels and
Gold, can embrace his voluntary Poverty,
eat Roots, drink Water, and dye with
him.</p>
            <p>However, if the pitying Part is not the
main Offence, there's another more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Danger from Tragedy. For as his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius
Foelix,</hi> upon that Subject, tells us,
<q>Sometimes a Luscious Actor shall whine
you into Love, and give the Disease that
he Counterfeits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himself is more at large upon
this Play-house Danger: For he concludes
his Book with this last Argument to prove
the Unlawfulness of Plays, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Were
the Stage in a condition to wipe off
all her other Imputations, there are two
Things behind which would stick upon
them, and have an ill Effect upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The first is their dilating so much
upon the Argument of <hi>Love.</hi> The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is Treated Home, and in the most
tender and passionate manner imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49930:41"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Love Representations,
oftentimes call up the Spirits and set them
at Work. The Play is Acted over again
in the sense of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and the first Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
becomes a Model. Love has generally
a <hi>Party within;</hi> and when the Wax is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
the Impression is easily made. Thus
the Disease of the Stage grows catching.
It throws its Amours among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and forms these Passions, when it
does not find them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I don't say the Stage Fells <hi>All</hi> before
them, and disables the whole Audience:
'Tis a hard Battle where none escapes.
However their <hi>Triumphs</hi> and their <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi>
are unspeakable. Neither need we
much wonder at the matter. They are
dangerously prepar'd for Conquest, and
Empire. There's Nature, and Passion, and
Life, in all the Circumstances of their
<hi>Action.</hi> Their Declamation, their Mein,
their Gestures and their Equipage, are
moving and significant. Now when
the Subject is agreeable, a lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,
and a passionate way of
Expression, make wild work, and have
a strong Force upon the Blood and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49930:42"/>I cannot well understand what Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
means (and I-fear, he don't over-well
understand himself,) in all this last Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.
But perhaps he design'd it more for
<hi>Rapsody</hi> than <hi>Reason;</hi> and so 'tis no great
matter whether it be <hi>Intelligible</hi> or not. For
all this <hi>Nature, Passion, Life</hi> and <hi>Action;
Declamation, Mien, Gesture,</hi> and <hi>Equipage</hi>
are purely the <hi>Actors,</hi> and by making such
wild work in the Blood and Temper, and
felling so many of the Audience before them,
plainly tells us, That these unspeakable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and Trophies, Conquest and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
are all the <hi>Actors</hi> and <hi>Actresses</hi> and the
Cupids Darts come all from their own
Eyes and Charms, and consequently the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
captivated Hearts are all their own;
the Enamour'd <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in the Pit, and the
Gay <hi>Ladies</hi> in the Boxes, are these Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Players</hi> most passionate humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>This <hi>unspeakable</hi> Play-house <hi>Victory,</hi> I am
afraid is a piece of News that wants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
For as to the <hi>Men-Players,</hi> I
dare swear for 'em, that all the Feminine
Trophies our <hi>Triumphant</hi> Young Fellows
of both Play-Houses can boast, is not enough
to buy them Sword-knots and Crevate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings.
And for the <hi>Ladies of the Stage,</hi>
with all the advantage of Paint, Plume, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49930:42"/>
Candle-light; I do not hear they are so very
over-stockt with Idolaters, or make any
such general <hi>Slaughter-work</hi> amongst the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
before them.</p>
            <p>But for once, we'll wave this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and screw his foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Rapsody to the Sense of his <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
viz.</hi> That the Charms of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit</hi>
whining <hi>Love,</hi> separate from the
Charms of the whining <hi>Lover,</hi> shall infuse
a <hi>True</hi> Love-sick Disease into the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis worth one's Pains to inquire
by what wonderful Operation, and by what
unaccountable Conveyance, this Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Disease must infuse the true Disease into
the Audience. First, here's <hi>Pygmalion</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
infinitely out-done; for the <hi>Pygmalion</hi>
here does not animate the Image, but the
Image the <hi>Pygmalion.</hi> But let that pass.</p>
            <p>How then must this Love-disease be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted!
why, thus. Here's a Young Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Actress on the Stage, we'll suppose, by
Virtue of the Attracting Graces of Carriage,
Movement, Address, Tenderness, Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and what not, shall make a Man
fall in Love. In Love! With whom?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49930:43"/>
not the Mistress of all these Attracting Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
No, that's the natural Way of falling
in Love, and that's none of the Operation
here. Those Graces that in any other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
but an Actress shall win Hearts for
her self, shall here have a quite contrary
Effect. You shall go off as cold as a Chaste
<hi>Ioseph</hi> to all these visible Charms and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that gave you the Fire, and be all in
a flame for some Body else. These are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
unspeakable Stage-Triumphs and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies!
Thus the Charms of one Woman
wins a Heart for another. I have heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of <hi>Celadon</hi>'s kissing his Mistress upon
another Woman's Lips, but that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this; He kiss'd his Mistress only
in Imagination, but here the Lover is Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
in true Earnest.</p>
            <p>Really the Ladies in our Boxes stand high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged to the Women in the Play-house,
and are in all Honour bound to support the
Stage. For instead of exercising any Dint
of Charms of their own to get Lovers,
they keep their Deputies on the Stage to do
the Drudgery of Conquest, and carry off the
Prize themselves.</p>
            <p>One thing I would willingly advise Mr.
<hi>Collier, viz.</hi> to sit Chair-man himself at a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49930:43"/>
Natural Philosophy Lecture, and read a
little Learnedly upon this unspeakable way
of catching the Disease of Love: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I am afraid 'tis such a weak-faith'd Age
we live in, that all his Metaphysical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
will hardly convince 'em of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Operation of Love.</p>
            <p>Besides, if his <hi>Minutius,</hi> and all the other
Primitive Doctors much of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
could plead Infallibility, and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
were Unquestionable: Nevertheless
they would hardly carry Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Cause.
For if whining Love is this unspeakable
Conqueror, and Love never whines but in
our Tragedies, where the Virtuous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress'd
Love is the Darling in the Play;
Consequently if a Man should catch the
Disease from a <hi>Iaffeir</hi> and <hi>Belvidira,</hi> or a
<hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Lavinia,</hi> or any such Character,
such an Infection would rather recommend
then condemn the Stage, not corrupt but
reform the Audience, by refining that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Passion, so depraved in this Age, from
Coldness and Libertinism, to Fidelity and
Virtue.</p>
            <p>Well, if the Infection from Tragedy
strikes not altogether so mortal, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the more pestilential Air of Comedy,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49930:44"/>
and search if possible, which way the more
fatal Poison enters there.</p>
            <p>First, then for the subject of Comedy,
'tis the Representation of Humane Life in a
lower class of Conversation; we visit the
Palace for Tragedy, and range the Town
for Comedy, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Follies, the Vices,
the Vanities and the Passions of Mankind,
which we meet with every Day. In short,
the Comedian, may join with the Satyrist,
<q>
                  <l>Quicquid agunt Homines, Votum, Timor,
Ira, Voluptas,</l>
                  <l>Gaudia, Discursus, nostri est farrago libelli.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But to confine our selves into as narrow a
compass as we can, under these three Heads,
<hi>viz. Folly, Knavery,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> we may not
improperly Rank the whole Characters in
Comedy.</p>
            <p>The Fools we may divide into three
Classes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cudden,</hi> the <hi>Cully</hi> and the
<hi>Fop.</hi> The Cudden a Fool of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
making; the Cully, of Man's making;
and the Fop, of his own making.</p>
            <p>For the first of these Fools the <hi>Cudden,</hi> the
Sr. <hi>Martin Marral,</hi> or the Sr. <hi>Arthur Addle, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49930:44"/>
I hope the Audience is in no danger of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Taint from these Characters in Comedy;
the <hi>made</hi> Fool may be a catching Disease,
but not the <hi>born</hi> one.</p>
            <p>For the second, one of the <hi>made</hi> Fools,
the <hi>Cully.</hi> Here's the least danger of a
Contagion that way; for that Disease is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cured than catch'd from the Stage. The
Country 'Squire or the Knight, the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
or the Bubble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either Cozen'd by
Sharpers, Spungers, Dicers and Bullies; or
Jilted by Jades, or snared into any other
Ruinous Folly of this Kind; In exposing
these Characters, the Stage does the Work
of a <hi>Philosophy School,</hi> it carries the whole
Force of <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Instruction</hi> to warn
unwary Youth from the Snares and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Debauchery. It points him out
the several Harpies that devour him, and
instead of taking Taint from the Stage, the
very sight of the Plague-spots not gives, but
expels the Contagion.</p>
            <p>For the third Fool, the Fop; this indeed
of all Fools is the most incorrigible. For
the Cudden wants no good Will to be wiser,
and would learn Wit if he were capable of
it. The Cully indeed is capable of being
taught Wit, but seldom learns it, till he has
too well paid for his Learning; sometimes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49930:45"/>
perhaps at no less Price than his Ruin, when
he buys the Knowledge of finding himself
a Chouse, by the same Experimental Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi>'s Painter learnt to
draw Battle-work from <hi>Musidorus, viz.</hi>
when his Hands were cut off. But of all
Fools the Fop is the blindest; his Faults
are his Perfections, whilst he looks upon
himself as the compleatest of Courtiers and
Gentlemen; and by that means perhaps, tho'
never to be cured of the Fondness he has
for his own tawdry Picture; however, in
all Places in the World he will never play
the <hi>Narcissus</hi> at the <hi>Theatres,</hi> nor fall much
in Love with his own painted Face, in a
Sir <hi>Courtly</hi>'s or a Lord <hi>Foppington</hi>'s <hi>Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass.</hi>
This I will positively say, He that
does not bring the Fop to the Play-house,
shall never carry it from thence. And in
all the Stage <hi>Fop-pictures,</hi> the Play-house
bids so fair for mending that Fool too, that
if the good Will fails, the Fault's not in the
Mirror, the Hand that holds it, or the Light
'tis sets at, but the perverse and deprav'd
Opticks that cannot see themselves there.</p>
            <p>As to the second Class, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Villain,</hi>
the <hi>Vsurer,</hi> the <hi>Cheat,</hi> the <hi>Pandar,</hi> the <hi>Bully,</hi>
the <hi>Flatterer,</hi> and all the rest of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Iniquity; there's so little Danger
from all their Stage-Pictures, that there's
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49930:45"/>
here no fear of playing the <hi>Narcissus</hi> in the
Glass; and therefore we'll pass to the lewd
Love-Distempers in Comedy; and see what
Mortality the more dangerous Contagion
and Malignity from these Counterfeit Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
may produce.</p>
            <p>First then, to shew how very little Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the Stage-Characters and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Whoredom and Debauchery carry
to the Temptation of the Audience, or the
Corruption of Manners; or to make Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
look lovely even to the very Practisers
of it: Let us consider, that, he that loves
Whoredom, loves the Harlot purely as the
Harlot, the Sin when it comes singly, in <hi>puris
naturalibus,</hi> with as little a Train at the
heels of it as possible. For no Man loves
the Levity and Fickleness of the Harlot, the
falseness of her Oaths and Tears, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusness
of her Vanity, the insults of her
Pride, or the mercynariness of her Lust.
Every Man, nay, the greatest Libertine
himself would have a Mistress, (if such a
Creature of that kind can be found in the
World) that brings Love for Love. The
Man that loves the Wanton, loves not the
Traitress nor the Hypocrite; The Syren may
be lovely, and her Musick pleasing; but we
are not over-fond of her Enchantments, her
Rocks nor her Quicksands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49930:46"/>The same Argument holds on the other
side: The <hi>Dalilah</hi> her self loves a Character of
Honour and Fidelity in her Paramour, not
the looseness of the Rover and the Libertine:
The finest Gentlemen, one of them in all
our Comedies; a <hi>Dorimant</hi> himself is no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tempting Character for a Young Lady
to fall in Love with. The veriest Wanton
of that Sex is as much for <hi>Monopoly</hi> as the
other; they care not for half Hearts, a
Gallant divided between a <hi>Lovet,</hi> a <hi>Bellinda,</hi>
and a <hi>Harriot.</hi> 'Tis true, we may see a
mad <hi>Florimel</hi> upon a Stage in Love with a
wild <hi>Celadon,</hi> for wildness sake; but that
<hi>Rara avis in Terris,</hi> is hardly to be found
off of the Stage.</p>
            <p>Now as the Lovers, I mean the vicious
Characters of Love, in our Comedies are
generally (I might venture to say, all of
'em) set forth with some of these foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Corruptions, <hi>viz.</hi> Levity, Hypocrisie,
Infidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we meet the Jilt, the Rover,
the Libertine, false Vows, false Oaths, Love
for Money, Treason for Love, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ther accumulated Sin, more than the bare
Wanton, in all of them: All these therefore
are so far from ensnaring or seducing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Auditor, those inviting Charmers off
of the Stage by what he sees presented upon
it; that they are rather the Objects of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49930:46"/>The Objects of his Aversion! Have a
care what you say: no, no, says Dr. <hi>Collier</hi>
at my Elbow, don't mistake your self
<hi>Lactantius</hi> his Testimony in his <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
Dedicated to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
shall confute that Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Debauching of Virgins, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of Strumpets are the Subject of
Comedy. And here the Rule is, the
more. Rhetorick the more Mischief, and
the best Poets are the worst Common-wealths-men.
For the Harmony and
Ornament of the Composition, serves
only to recommend the Argument, to
fortifie the Charme, and engage the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
Let us avoid therefore these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
least somewhat of the Malignity
seize us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, to answer both the Primitive
Dr. and the Modern one together, I fancy
some very good and substantial Reasons, and
Proof may be produc'd, That the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Composition, the Poet and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
may make these Amours of Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
Debauchery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a delectable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to the Auditor that hears them
upon the Stage; and yet neither recommend
the Argument, nor leave any Charm to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49930:47"/>
corrupt him, or Malignity to seize him;
but rather the quite Contrary.</p>
            <p>First then, why is the Jilt, the Strumpet,
or the Adultress, an Entertaining Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
in Comedy? Why! Because those very
Characters afford the most ample Matter
in the Conduct of the Play, to gain one of
the great Ends of Comedy, and that which
chiefly attracts the Audience thither, <hi>viz.
Mirth.</hi> It gives Occasion, Matter, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to create the Laughter of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The Jilt for Instance, with her Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Turnings, her Wheedles to draw in
her <hi>Cully,</hi> and her Artifices to Secure and
Manage him; The false Wife with her
Faunings and Flattery, to lull the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Jealousie. Her Starts and her Fears at
every Danger and Alarme, her whole Arts
to cover the Hypocrite; and her Surprize
and Confusion at her Detection and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
(for Comedy it self does that Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Justice to bring her to shame, if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punishment) as they afford plot
design, and contrivance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the
highest Jest of Comedy. And 'tis for that,
and that only Charme that these Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
find so general a Reception on the
Stage. And that this is truly the only
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49930:47"/>
Charme, is manifest from the success of
those Comedies. 'Tis not the Lewdness it
self in a Vicious Character, that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it to the Audience, but the witty
Turnes, Adventures and Surprizes in those
Characters that give it Reception. For
without this, the Play drops and dies.</p>
            <p>And to shew you, that a Vicious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
<hi>Quatenus</hi> as Vicious, is no Darling of
the Audience; but that the <hi>Mirth</hi> only that
it raises, is the Delight of Comedy; let an
Ingenious Author raise the same <hi>Mirth</hi> upon
a Virtuous Foundation, and that Comedy
shall be as hug'd a Favourite as the other.
For Instance in a Sr. <hi>Solmon Single</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Comedies, where the Love is all
Virtuous. In fine, 'tis the Wit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
not the Vice in the Composure,
gives Life to the Comedy. A dull Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of Vice or Virtue, shall be equally
Hist off the Stage. And tho' even Vice and
Debauchery in a Theatrick Representation
may find Applause, 'tis never the <hi>more</hi>
a Closet Darling for being a Stage one.
Nay rather one the contrary, much <hi>less</hi> the
Darling of the Closet. For the publick
exposure of Debauchery, with all her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
Wills, Delusions, Impostures and
Snares, has more of the Antidote than the
Poyson.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49930:48"/>There's a great deal of difference betwixt
likeing the Picture and the Substance. A
Man may be very well pleas'd with a Forest
work piece of Tapestry, with the Lyons,
the Bears, and the Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not
over fond of their Company in Flesh and
Blood; and confequently the very worst
Jilt may be the Minion upon the Stage, and,
as I said before, our Aversion off it.</p>
            <p>Nay, I dare be so bold, as to tell this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Gentleman, as highly as he Resents the
Cuckolding of Aldermen and Quality in our
Comedies, that I could find him Matter of
very good Instruction, from a Character of
this kind, in a very Ingenious Author,
though not much in Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Favour.
For Example, If the Reverend Gentlemen
of the Fur would be but half as kind to a
<hi>Play-house</hi> as a <hi>Pin-makers-Hall,</hi> and step for
Edification, but so far towards <hi>Westminster,</hi>
as to see the <hi>Old Batchelor;</hi> I doubt not but
an <hi>Isaac Fondlewife</hi> would be a very seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monitor to Reverend City Sixty, to
warn against the Marrying to Sixteen. Nor
can I think it such a scandalous part of the
Dramatick Poet; but rather a true Poetick
Justice, to expose the unreasonableness of
such Superannuated Dotage, that can
blindly think or hope, that a bare Chain
of Gold has Magick enough in the Circle to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49930:48"/>
bind the Fidelity of so unequal a Match, a
Match so contrary to the Holy Ordinance of
Matrimony; and an Itch at those Years
that deserves the severest Lash of the Stage.
And if an Author would pick out such a
Character for a little Stage Satyr, where can
he meet with it but amongst the City or Court
Quality? Such Inequality of Marriages are
rarely to be found, but under the Roofs of
Honour; for so Antiquated a Lover, (the
least he can do) must bring a Coach and Six,
to carry off such a Young Bride.</p>
            <p>One thing mightily offends this Divine
Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Modern Plays make
our Libertines of both Sexes, Persons of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and Quality, Fine Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Fashion, a fault utterly unpractis'd
by the Ancient Poets: <hi>For</hi> Terence <hi>and</hi> Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<hi>his Strumpets are little People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is so far from a fault in our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
that there's a necessity of those
Characters, and a Vertue in that Choice.
For as the greatest and best part of our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are Quality, if we would make our
Comedies Instructive in the exposing of
Vice, we must not lash the Vices at <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
to mend the Faults at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Instructive Design of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49930:49"/>
Play must look as well to the Cautioning of
Virtue from the ensnaring Conversation
of Vice, as the lashing of Vice it self. Thus
the Court Libertine must be a Person of
Wit and Honour, and have all the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
of a Fine Gentleman. (The Court
Ladies receive no Visits from Ruffians.)
Besides there needs no cautioning against a
<hi>Don Iohn;</hi> every Fool would run from a
Devil with a <hi>visible</hi> Cloven-foot. That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
therefore must have all the Face and
Charms of <hi>Honour,</hi> when it would seduce
<hi>Honour;</hi> and therefore 'tis those very Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
the Stage must present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Plain-dealer <hi>speaks very significantly
to this purpose, and very much justifies
this Choice of Characters for Plays.</hi> Who
betrays you, Over-reaches or Cheats you, but
your Friend? Your Enemy is not trusted with
your Affairs. Who violates the Honour of your
Wife, but your Friend? Your Enemy is not
admitted into your Family.</p>
            <p>Who therefore are those Dangerous
Friends of <hi>Quality,</hi> but their Bosome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation?
and who that Conversation but
their <hi>Equality;</hi> and therefore for an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Draught for Comedy, who so proper
to sit to her Pencil as <hi>Quality?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49930:49"/>Besides, Comedy opens a wrong Door to
let in a Taint of Lust. Lust is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
Thought and Meditation; not the
Child of Laughter. The Auditor must have
a much more serious Face than he wears at
a Light Comedy, to take so deep and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
an Impression.</p>
            <p>Nay, if we could suppose that the Jest
of a Comedy shall open his Laughing Mouth
so wide as to let down a Lust like a Witches
Ball of Pinns; or rather that a speaking I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in a Comedy shall have the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionary
Force upon us, as the <hi>European</hi>
Picture at the <hi>Mauritanean</hi> Princesses Beds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet,
that made her bring forth a White
Child; Yet still the Picture in Comedy,
like that in the Ladies Bed-Chamber, does
not hang long enough for any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionary
Impression: For besides twenty
other equally diverting Objects in the same
Comical Lantscape; here's the whole Stage
new furnish'd every Day; and a new Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Painting for the next Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>Venus</hi> yesterday is the <hi>Diana</hi>
to day, the <hi>Iuno</hi> to morrow, all a quite
contrary set of Imagery. And if the <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
the <hi>Gesture,</hi> the <hi>Equipage,</hi> have any
such dangerous Force, here's not one Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
one Day but what's quite alter'd the
next; and so Change upon Change, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:49930:50"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49930:51"/>
so that in the infinite Variety of the Stage,
here's no dwelling upon one darling Object
to run any such Danger of Infection: For
the whole Stage-Mercury is too volatile to
fix.</p>
            <p>But if the Stage had any such Magical
Power, (for no Natural one will reach it)
over poor weak Mortality to Enchant, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
Confound, or what else Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>
pleases; we'll try the Experiment but in one
Play: For Instance, we'll take one of the
loosest, and to answer the Temptation, one
of the loveliest of those Libertine Pictures,
Mr. <hi>Dorimant,</hi> we named before; and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ladies Love Proof against such a
Libertine Character; we'll suppose some
Young mad Spark as much Charm'd with
this lovely <hi>Dorimant,</hi> as this Divine Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
can fancy him, and consequently shall
catch the true Disease from this amiable
Counterfeit; pray which of all the <hi>Ignes
fatui,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Dorimant</hi>'s Character shall be
the misleading Fire? For here in one Play,
in the Presentation of poor three Hours, we
have, First, Mr. <hi>Dorimant</hi>'s Cooling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegu,
all his retreating Steps from the
tiresome Embraces of an old Mistress, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Lovet;</hi> next his start of Love, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<hi>en passant,</hi> into the Arms of <hi>Belinda;</hi>
and to conclude the Character, his last ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49930:51"/>
Passion for the Virtuous Mistress
<hi>Harriot.</hi> Now I say, to which of all these
three, shall this mad Sparks <hi>Tarantula</hi> dance?
(For to all three together is a little too mad
a Gallop:) If to the first: And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(to Copy from the Original) he goes
home weaned from an old Darling Sin,
and turns off some Bosom <hi>Dalilah;</hi> if our
Spark catches Fire from this part of the wild
<hi>Dorimant,</hi> I hope, our Ecclesiastical Censor
will sind no Sin in so harmless an Infection.
If to the second: If he takes Fire from <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimant</hi>'s
Frailty with <hi>Belinda;</hi> there indeed
he may want some Church-Buckets to
quench him; 'tis high time for all Hands
for his Conversion. But if he sums up the
Character, and Copies the whole reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rover, quits, like <hi>Dorimant,</hi> his old
sour Grapes and forbidden Fruit, for the
Charming Sweets of a Chaste <hi>Harriot,</hi> and
finishes the Picture in the Comedy, in an
honourable Wedlock Passion; then I hope
this Reverend Corrigidore of unruly Love,
will remit the Lash, and hold his whip
Hand.</p>
            <p>Thus you see what <hi>Boutefeu</hi> does Mr.
<hi>Collier</hi> make of a poor Player, that with
the Intoxication of a three Hours Tale of
Love, shall put a Man not only into a whole
Nights pain of it, but possibly to a total
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49930:52"/>
Corruption of his whole Mass of Blood,
and the very enflaming of an unquenchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Feavor. What <hi>Quixot</hi> Wind-mills can
an Enthusiast raise, and then Battle the
Gyant of his own Creation!</p>
            <p>The second of the two Things he has to
object against the Stage, is, <q>Their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
Revenge. What is more common
then Duells and Quarrelling in their
<hi>Characters</hi> of Figure? Those Practices
which are infamous in Reason, Capital
in Law, and damnable in Religion, are
the Credit of the Stage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this
Subject he tells you he had discours'd of
before,—<hi>viz.</hi> p. 67. Our Saviour (he
says) tells us we must forgive <hi>until se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
times Seven.</hi> That is, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be tired out of Clemency and good
Nature. He has taught us to pray for
the Forgiveness of our own Sins, only
upon the condition of forgiving others:
Here is no Exception upon the Repetition
of the Fault or the Quality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not dispute upon Our Saviours Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> but acknowledge it
possibly, the highest Characteristick of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and a Perfection that comes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to the Great Original of <hi>Mercy,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49930:52"/>
it. But to let my Reader see upon
what stress, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> enforces his Scriptural
Arguments, we'll Examine, what Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
must follow the Universal Stretch of
a Divine Precept.</p>
            <p>By these Divine Commands of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the Literal Extent of the Precept: In
the first place I must neither Sue in Law nor
Equity for the Recovery of a Just Right, or
the Reparation of any wrong whatever. For
the Prosecution of Law is directly opposite
to this Forgiving Doctrine.</p>
            <p>So here's <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> shut up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
Nay, if the precept of God obliges
me to the same Resignation of my Coat to
the Thief that has Rob'd me of my Cloak,
I am so far from Licens'd or Authoriz'd to
take that Christian Revenge against the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Prosecution of publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon him; that the very Christian
Judge, instead of Arraigning the Robber,
the Cheat or the Felon at the Bar, for the
Breach of our Humane Law; should rather
stand obliged to Arraign the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for the Breach of a Divine one. So
here's the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> shut up too. Nay here's
the very Law it self Arraign'd, as little less
then Antichristian for punishing that Injury,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49930:53"/>
which the express Law of God, even seventy
seven times over, obliges us to forgive. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this Author as bold a Sermonist, and
as hardy a Hero of the <hi>Rockost,</hi> as his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive
to Consideration</hi> has prov'd him; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
has hardly Courage enough to
Preach this Doctrine to the Gentlemen of
St. <hi>Stephens Chappel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, by this forgiving unrevenging Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
push'd home, here's <hi>Passive Obedience</hi>
and <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> set up with a Vengeance,
not only in submission to <hi>Soveraign</hi> Tyranny
to Lord it over us, but even to every little
Diminitive Arbitrary Thief and Ruffain,
the Lord and Master of my Purse, my
House, my Coat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for at this rate of
Forgiveness, here's a General Goal-Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<hi>Newgate</hi> Doors set open, Oppression,
Injustice, Theft, Rapine and Villany let
loose, and the <hi>Homo Homini Lupus</hi> at free
Discretion to Spoil, Ravage, and Over-run
the whole World, whilst the meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
resigning, forgiving Christian is the tame
bleating Sheep before him.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman Thief at this rate will
be as great as an <hi>Almanzor</hi> himself, and may
Plume in his Vanity.</p>
            <l>

            <p>In short, how can any Man of Sense ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
such rigorous Constructions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commands; as if the God of Concord
and Peace could set up a Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
utterly destructive, not only to all
Civil Government, but even to Human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
it self.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is almost as angry at the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as at the greater Sins of the Stage;
and passes his Vote for their Exclusion, even
for that Offence alone. But if he'll make a
fair distributive Justice to all other Vanities,
I am afraid he'll set up another Doctrine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as pernicious to Government as the
first. For if the Vanity-shop the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house

the Embroiderer, the Laceman, the
Featherman, the Ribband-Weaver, <hi>cum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis

one of all those Professions but is utterly
useless to the real wants of Life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
deals in the more dangerous Vanities;
for the Stage Vanities may only raise an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Tear or a Laugh or so; but these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49930:54"/>
ther Vanities are very often the unhappy
Nurses of Pride, a more capital Fault.</p>
            <p>I confess, a good stretch of this Argument
for the General Retrenchment of Vanities
would make a terrible City slaughter, and
almost as many Beggers as the stretch of
the other would Thieves: However, 'tis
but Dr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Preaching them another
healing Text, being a second <hi>Perswasive, to
Poverty,</hi> like his First, <hi>to Consideration,</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate

by assuring them, <hi>That the Poor shall inherit

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49930:55"/>
as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is running out of Sense,

               </p>
               <p>But to proceed with our Remarker,
<q>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Airy and Earthy Spirits
Discourse of the first state of Devils, of
the chief of their Revolt, their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Impostures. This, Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
(he says) very Religiously calls <hi>a Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way of Writing, which depends wholly on
the force of Imagination.</hi> Epist. Ded. What
then, is the Fall of Angels a Romance?
Has it no Basis of Truth, nothing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it but strength of Fancy, and Poetick
Invention! After he had mentioned Hell,
Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and given us a sort of Bible
Description of those formidable Things,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am surprized to hear him call it a
Fairy kind of Writing. Is the History of
<hi>Tophet</hi> no better proved than that of <hi>Styx;</hi>
Is the Lake of <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and that of
<hi>Phlegeton</hi> alike dreadful; and have we as
much reason to believe the Torments of
<hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Prometheus,</hi> as those of the
Devils and Damn'd? These are lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Consequences! And yet I cannot see
how the Poet can avoid them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49930:55"/>[Not see? no, 'tis impossible he should,
who so blind as—]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But setting aside the Dedication, the
Representation it self is scandalously irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> To see Hell thus play'd with
is a mighty Refreshment to a lewd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and a byassed Understanding; it
heartens the young Libertine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the well-wishers to Atheism, and
makes Vice bold and enterprizing; such
Diversions serve to dispel the gloom, and
gild the horrors of the Shades below,
and are a sort of ensurance against Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
One would think these Poets
went upon a certainty, and could demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
a Scheme of Infidelity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he runs on for almost Forty Lines
more, all upon this Head. I would not
have made so long a Quotation, only to
shew my Reader what a <hi>Iehu</hi> Champion of
Religion he is, and how fast and how far
he can drive at a breath. To give him his
due, he has a mighty Copiousness of Words;
and to do him right, in the use he makes of
'em, he's always as liberal as he is rich. I
remember an Author that tells us, <hi>Words
are the Wise Man's Counters, and the Fool's
ready Money.</hi> Now, if this Learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Arts and Language, shall be mistaken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49930:56"/>
in his Charge against Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Epistle
Dedicatory, and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Fairy Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
upon full Examination, instead of so
frightful a Goblin, should prove but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
harmless Spright, and consequently
all this effusion of Rhetorick should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally
thrown away in waste; However,
this plain dealing Author gives him that
comfort, <hi>viz.</hi> that his <hi>Silver Eloquence</hi> is all
current <hi>Sterling,</hi> and not gilt Brass.</p>
               <p>Well then, to give Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Fairys a
little Examination.</p>
               <p>Because Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> allusively, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
emphatically so, calls his description of
Hell, and discourse of Devils, <hi>&amp;c. a Fairy
way of Writing,</hi> and as such, <hi>it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the force of Imagination,</hi> that therefore
he says, (or means it) that the Subject is
Fairy Land he writes upon; that Hell is
but Phantom; the Fall of Angels, Romance;
and Damnation but Chimera; for a Fairy
way of writing, our Author tells you, can
be nothing but a <hi>History of Fiction,</hi> a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Imaginary Beings, such as never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Existence in Time or Nature.</hi> Good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
How perversly does this angry Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Scribble! If the Infernal Powers are
invisible, the Devils incorporeal Spirits, nay,
the very locality of Hell it self, and the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49930:56"/>
materiality of the avenging Flames, are
Things disputable amongst the most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Theologists. And if a discourse of Hell
or Devils, with this Gentleman's leave, is a
Subject that a Poet may presume to handle,
(his leave, indeed, we ought to beg in this
case; for if treating a <hi>Mahomet</hi> or <hi>Mufti</hi> too
boldly, by this Author's <hi>Innuendo</hi>'s is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of the true Divinity, who knows
but an intrusion into the Affairs of Hell, by
the same rate of Presumption, may be peep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum)</hi> his leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
first beg'd, if Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> may presume
to speak a word or two of Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as
there's scarce a Poet, either Divine or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
that has not presumed upon the same
subject;) pray let me ask this Theological
Critick, if a Poetical Draught or Imagery
of Hell and Devils, though drawn as near
the Life as the whole Bible Light can set
them, and done by the ablest Master skill
of Man, can be any thing but a piece of <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pencil Work,</hi> all the Colours, the Features,
all by the force of imagination. For how
can incorporeal and immaterial Beings be
set forth to the Eye of Human Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
without an Array of form and shape;
The Ghost must walk with a Body, the
Fiend with a cloven Foot, or something of
that kind; or the Apparition's lost: And
what's all these but a Fairy Creation of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49930:57"/>
in the very propperest Name he could
give it?</p>
               <p>Nay, in much the same kind of Language
does not the Scripture it self all along
speak of Almighty God? What is the <hi>Eye,</hi>
the <hi>Ear,</hi> the <hi>Hand,</hi> or the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the
common Scripture-Phrase, any thing more
than mere Notion; that Infinity and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence
whom the Skys cannot contain,
thus humbly drawn into that human like
Figure in Miniature, purposely adapted to
those short-sighted Opticks, the narrow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of Man.</p>
               <p>But to return to our King <hi>Arthur,</hi> after
above 20 lines of the serious Consideration
of Eternal punishment, and the frightful
State of the Damn'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us see, says
he, <q>how Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> represents those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Spirits, and their place of abode!
Why very entertainingly! Those that
have a true tast for Atheism were never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Regaled. One would think by this
Play, that the Devils were mere <hi>Mormoes</hi>
and <hi>Bugbears,</hi> fit only to fright Children
and Fools. They rally upon Hell and
Damnation, with a great deal of Air and
Pleasantry; and appear like <hi>Robin Good-fellow,</hi>
only to make the Company laugh.
<hi>Philidel.</hi> is called a <hi>Puling Sprite,</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49930:57"/>
why so? For this Pious Reason, because,</q>
                  <q>
                     <l>He trembles at the yawning Gulf of Hell,</l>
                     <l>Nor dares approach the Flames, least he should singe</l>
                     <l>His gaudy silken Wings.</l>
                     <l>He sighs when he should plunge a Soul in
Sulphur,</l>
                     <l>As with compassion toucht of foolish Man.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer is, <hi>What a half Devil's he?</hi>
                  <q>you see how admirably it runs all upon
the Christian Scheme? Sometimes they
are half Devils, and sometimes hopeful
Devils, and what you please to make
sport with. <hi>Grimbald</hi> is afraid of being
<hi>whoop'd through Hell</hi> at his return, for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying
in his business. It seems there
is great leasure for Diversion! There's
<hi>Whooping in Hell,</hi> instead of <hi>Weeping and
Wailing.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Author, you may observe, almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, lashes the Poets with a twig
of their own Birch; his Arguments are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where all high flights of Rapture, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Poetical Field of Fancy is a little too
much over-run with the Savine and Worm-wood;
the rankness of the Soil is most
Fruitful in those bitterer sort of Vegetives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49930:58"/>But in his last Remark, his Divine <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
as high as he generally flyes, is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
jaded. And perhaps his Railery in this
place has more of the <hi>Robin Goodfellow</hi> then
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s; and I am certain has more
reason to set us a Laughing. For I dare to
Swear, he is that particular Dissenter
from the General Opinion of every reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judge, upon this Quotation from Mr.
<hi>Dryden;</hi> that neither the Character of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidel,</hi>
though but Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s own <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Creation,</hi> or those <hi>Pious Reasons,</hi> as he
calls 'em, the before quoted Lines, have
any thing of that extraordinary Air of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santry,
to set either the Atheist agog, or the
Company a tittering. And here I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him once again to read <hi>Milton,</hi> and tell
us if his Paradise Lost has not character'd
the whole Body of the Apostate Angels,
animating each other into an Obstinacy and
Emulation in Wickedness, glorying in the
very cause of their Fall, their Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, though in the midst of their
Torments they suffer for't
<q>Better to Rule in Hell than Serve in Heaven.</q>
reproaching every Infernal faintness, daring
each other in every new and hardier insult
against God, and priding and pluming in
every success in their Machinations against
Hated Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49930:58"/>Nay, does not <hi>Cowley,</hi> in his Divine Poem

               </p>
               <p>Hitherto Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has only picqueer'd,

but he makes a pitcht Battle against the

               </p>
               <p>And what does he infer from all this;

God himself. <q>To what purpose does <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
appear, but in the shape of <hi>Iehovah!</hi>
Why are the incomnunicable Attributes
burlesqued, and <hi>Omnipotence</hi> applyed to
Acts of Infamy! To what end can such
horrible stuff as this serve, unless to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Notion, and extinguish the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Deity. The Perfections of God
are himself; to ridicule his Attributes and
Being, are but two Words for the same
thing. These Attributes are bestow'd
upon <hi>Iupiter</hi> with great Prodigality, and
afterwards execrably outraged. The case
being thus, the cover of an Idol is too
thin a pretence to screen the Blasphemy.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49930:59"/>Now to wash off this stain, for 'tis a

               <p>In what Form will your Almighty-ship be
pleased to transform your self to Night.</p>
               <p>You have need of all your Omnipotence, and
all your Godship.</p>
               <p>The Devil take <hi>Jupiter</hi> for inventing that
hard hearted merciless Knobbby Wood, a Crab-tree-Cudgel.</p>
               <p>Here indeed, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has furnisht him
(out of his own old Heathen Heraldry)
with <hi>Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Fate.</hi> But
as to the Creator of Nature, all the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Providence in his hand, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
described with the Majesty of the true
God, I can find nothing of that; But no
great matter, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> draws up his Plea
like a Bill in Chancery, 'tis not given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Oath</hi> nor <hi>Honour,</hi> and half <hi>Truth,</hi> half
<hi>Falsehood,</hi> is <hi>Secundum artem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now any man that reads this <hi>Almighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
and <hi>Godship,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> from the
Mouth of his familiar <hi>Mercury</hi> gives this
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> would swear that the Majesty of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49930:60"/>
the True God, was the least thought of in
this <hi>Amphytrion,</hi> a God-ship that his own
Pimp can wish at the Devil. Nay, though
an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> power has been ascribed to <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
by the Heathen Theology, yet Mr.
<hi>Dryden</hi> is so tender of offending any over
curious Christian, that he purposely Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesqnes
his titular Attribute to this <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyship,</hi>
to take off all shaddow of such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Besides, does not the Scripture over and
over give the stile of <hi>Gods</hi> to all the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idols,</hi> though but <hi>Stocks</hi> and <hi>Stones;</hi>
not that the Divine Inspiration in so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it in Holy Writ, could be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give it as their due, any more then
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> can be supposed to give <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
his <hi>God-ship</hi> as his due. And if from
Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> own Authority, the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God are himself, the same liberty
that may give him his Titular <hi>God-head,</hi>
may give him his Titular <hi>Perfections</hi> too.</p>
               <p>However, as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> sets up for a
Play-house Scavinger, he's resolved to sweep
cleanest where there's least Dirt. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is to understand, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is not
so much angry at Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>choice</hi> of his
Subject, as his <hi>Mismanagement</hi> of it: And
upon that Quarrel, he spends his Artillery
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49930:61"/>
against him in four long Pages together;
and to mend all Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Capital Faults
in his <hi>Iupiter.</hi> He tells us, <q>That <hi>Plautus</hi>
was the only bold Heathen that brought
<hi>Iupiter</hi> upon the Stage, he wrote upon
the same unaccountable design (his Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with <hi>Alcmena;)</hi> but <hi>Plautus</hi> his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of persuite are very different; his
<hi>Iupiter</hi> does not solicit in scandalous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
nor flourish upon his Lewdness,
nor endeavours to set it up for the Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Plautus</hi> had some Regard to the height
of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Character, and the Opinion
of his Country, and the Restraints of
Modesty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the Greek Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens,
they mention <hi>Iupiter</hi> in terms of
Magnificence and Repect, and make his
Actions and his Nature all of a piece, <hi>&amp;c.
Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Iupiter</hi> is always Great and Solemn,
and keeps up the port of the Deity. 'Tis
true, <hi>Homer</hi> does not Guard the Idea with
that Exactness, but with all, never sinks the
Character into Obscenity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, and for not following these Elder
Sons of <hi>Apollo,</hi> in his Treatment of <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> stands irreparably Condemned:
And to have fenced against all Vengeances
hanging over his Head, he should have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled
his Play by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Plan, <hi>viz.</hi>
He should have had <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>regard to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49930:61"/>
height of</hi> Jupiter's <hi>Character,</hi> that is to say,
given him every individual Attribute, and
twice as many more as he has given him
already; <hi>according to the Opinion of</hi> Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<hi>his Country,</hi> viz. with all the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heathens that Worshipped him
for their true supreme God. <hi>In all the terms
of Magnificence and Respect,</hi> with a Homage
as great as if we were the true God of
Heav'n in earnest, <hi>keeping up his whole port
of a Deity,</hi> &amp;c. pluming him with every
Feather of his whole God-head.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Iupiter</hi> thus Glorified, should set out
to Court <hi>Amphytrion</hi>'s Wise, <hi>viz.</hi> for a Nights
Lodging, <hi>in no scandalous Language,</hi> in all
the Softest Modestest Divine Courtship, <hi>no
sinking his Character into Obscenity,</hi> all
wrapt up so clean, <hi>his Actions and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
the Adulterer and the God, <hi>all of a
piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good gracious Heaven, has not this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast
the whole Zeal of an <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and bids as fair to succeed him in his
<hi>Moor-field</hi> Pallace? This is the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and Mr. <hi>Drydens</hi> the Blasphemous <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytrion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49930:62"/>How ingeniously Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> can out-blow
the Satyr in the Fable! Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytrion</hi>
is all a piece of Blasphemy for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
too much of the God to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and
has no way to mend that fault but by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him <hi>more</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Blasphemy of <hi>Amphytrion,</hi> nothing
but Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Absolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi>
can out-doe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here we have Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
on the top of the Letter without any
trouble of Inference or Construction. This
Poem runs upon all Scripture Names, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
suppositions of the true Religion, and
object of Worship. Here are no Pagan
Divinities in the Scheme; so that all the
Athestick Rallery must point upon the
true God. <hi>Absalom</hi> was <hi>David</hi>'s natural Son;
so that there's a Blot in his <hi>Scutcheon,</hi>
and a Blemish upon his <hi>Birth.</hi> The Poet
will make admirable use of this Remark
presently. This <hi>Absalom,</hi> it seems, was
very extraordinary in his Person and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> does not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know how this came about, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inquires of himself in the first place.</q>
               </p>
               <l>Whither inspired by a Divinier Lust,</l>
               <l>His Father got him with a greater Gust.</l>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49930:62"/>
                  <q>This is down-right Defiance of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God! here you have the very Essence
and Spirit of Blasphemy, and the Holy
Ghost brought in upon the most hideous
occasion. I question whether the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Despair of the Damn'd dare
venture at such Flights as these; they are
bejond Description. I pray God they may
not be bejond Pardon too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now are here only two unhappy Words,
that blow the Bellows to all this Fire, <hi>viz.</hi>
[Inspir'd] and [Diviner.] Inspire, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Verb, is so far from being only
appropriated to God, that scarce that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Passion, Love, Joy, or what not, nay,
a meer start of Fancy, a sudden lucky thought,
but shall be said to inspire a Man.</p>
               <p>Is this Gentleman, as sworn an Enemy to
all Poetry, as to the Dramatick, that he
willfully forgets, how the Poets upon all
occasions invoked their Muses to inspire
them. Nay, to go a little further, what
if the Devil himself has had his Inspirations
too, for as I take it, the old Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were of his Inspiring. The Spirit of
False-shood, as well as Truth, has had the
Inspiring power, without intrenching upon
the Prerogative of God. And though [Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner]
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49930:63"/>
is here made the Epithite to Lust, it
makes not all to his purpose; 'tis true the
Expression favours a little too much of the
Libertine; yet I defie all the Sophistry of
Malice it self to mount it up to Blasphemy,
or to make it bear any tendency to that
tremendous signification he has given it.
For does not this Man of Letters know,
that [Diviner,] though in the Comparative
Degree, is here infinitely less then the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
[Diviner] only comparatively to the
common Raptures of Lust. Had it been
Written [<hi>Inspired with a Divine Lust</hi>] it
might have given an overcurious Cynick
some Umbrage for so profane a Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet even then too it would not
have fully reacht the point, unless [<hi>A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>]
had been changed to the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
[The Divine.]</p>
               <p>But here as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has worded it,
and upon the subject he speaks it, if any
thing of a Deity was either meant or thought
of in this Inspiration, 'twas that of <hi>Venus:</hi>
And indeed, what can the Genuine Sense
of this poor Couplet honestly and fairly
construed mean, than that his Father In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
or Animated with a Diviner or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimer
Lust, got him with that more then
ordinary pleasure and transports, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49930:63"/>
(for 'tis not affirmatively said) to
that sprightlier Vivacity to the Generation
of his <hi>Absalom,</hi> that young Heir (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his supposition) might owe all those
Personal Graces and Beauties, and all that
innate Bravery, and the rest of the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Accomplishments the Poet has occasion
afterwards to give him.</p>
               <p>Here I must beg my Reader's Pardon,
that my honest Defense of Truth has forced
me upon this unseemly Explanation; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
again, this Distick carries but a lew'd
Idea along with it, but so far from a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against the Great God, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable,
as he fancies it, that I doubt
not but a profane Oath in his Name, is, of
the two, the greater <hi>Crimen laesae Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis
Dei,</hi> and that upon a fair Tryal in a
Court of Justice, the Mulct of two good
Shillings, or as many Hours in the Stocks
would be as much as our Law could well
give against him.</p>
               <p>Well, this Authot has the least reason of
Quarrelling with Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Fairy way of
Writing;</hi> his way of <hi>Commenting</hi> is so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, that all his own <hi>Fairys</hi> are <hi>Gyants,</hi>
whilst Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in this very Distict, is no
less then leading up the old Host of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49930:64"/>
and charging at the Throne of God
himself. At this rate of Remarking, I dare
not say, whither this Author be inspired by
a <hi>Puny</hi> or a <hi>full grown Sprite;</hi> But this I must
say, to come up to all the Heights of that
Christian Champion, he professes himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
he must have a double Portion
of Faith and Hope, to make up for his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitive
Talent of Charity.</p>
