            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMongſt all the Methods and Contrivances (ſince the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War) to ſupply the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that none ſhould prove ineffectual or uſeleſs, except the Fund given for eſtabliſhing a Land-Bank, ſeems ſomething ſtrange when conſidered: For ſince we live in a Countrey ſeated under the beſt of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, productive of all the Neceſſaries of Life, whoſe Native Commodities are the Foundation of the greateſt Trade and Commerce under Heaven, whereby numerous Families daily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at great and plentitul Fortunes: I ſay, for the Proprietors of ſuch a <hi>Canaan</hi> as this, either not to know, or if known, not to be able to eſtabliſh their Intereſt, muſt argue the greateſt Stupidity, or the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99463:3"/>
leaſt Induſtry imaginable. And it is plain to any intelligent Man, how the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Intereſt of Money has been like a Gangreen to many Eſtates, and has reduced them to a very mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and the difficulty of mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Land is now ſo great, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Legal Profits, (if the Summ to be borrowed be conſiderable) the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt have a Preſent made him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will condeſcend to look at the Title. This was a melancholly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Men of good Underſtanding, and good Eſtates, and therefore it needs not remain a Myſtery to ſo many, why the Parliament ſhould be ſo fond of a Land Bank, as to refuſe this Fund to the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> and give it to them, ſince the former is the moſt beneficial thing to the Landed-man that ever was projected, and the other profitable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a few Traders, who no doubt will confederate and unite their ſtrength to oppoſe any Contrivance which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to advance the Intereſt of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-man,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99463:3"/>
and to leſſen their own; for had the Land-Bank ſucceeded, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Intereſt of Money muſt in a litte time have been reduced to 3 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and Land conſequently have riſen in purchaſe proportionable to the fall of Money, which the monied and trading Men could not endure to think of, much leſs to have it brought about; for what could be more ungrateful than the thoughts of conſuming dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the time in their Trade, to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that Wealth, which when purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will acquire but the ſame Eſtate of Inheritance, as what is gotten in half the time, at the rate as Land and Money goes at preſent: For now it's every days experience, that a few years ſucceſs in Trade, renders Monied-men Maſters of ſo much Wealth, as enables them to purchaſe the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtates in the Kingdom; ſo that at this rate in ſome few years, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will invade the antient Gentry, and take away their <hi>Place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99463:4"/>
Theſe, and ſuch like Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were the cauſe why the Land-Bank met with ſo little Encouragement, and ſo ſtrong oppoſition, for when the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons would by no means be induced to lay aſide a Propoſition, ſo apparently advantagious to all Landed-men in the Kingdom, then an Exchequer-Bank was invented, either to hinder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt to protract time, and therefore the Projectors of it did not deſiſt from preſſing that forward, 'till it was twice caſt out by a diviſion of the Houſe; and notwithſtanding they were firſt beaten from their Out-works, yet they had a reſerve ſtill, hoping that if a Bill paſſed in favour of a Land-Bank, to get a mill-ſtone to be tyed about its Neck that would not fail of ſinking it, by providing that the Exchequer might iſſue out their Bills immediately for 150000 <hi>l.</hi> and for the reſt if the Bank did not raiſe it. And tho' this was readily conſented to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99463:4"/>
by the Houſe of Commons, that his Majeſty might have all Reſerves for raiſing the Money, yet the conſequence of this proved to be a dividing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as well as the Money, and made thoſe who were ſo fond of a Bank un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Exchequer management, to be very little concerned whether the other had ſucceſs or not; and then they who ſaw further into the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone than others, gave it out in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh whiſper, that the Bank would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to any thing, which diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged hundreds from ſubſcribing, which no doubt was the intent of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Another difficulty was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſo vaſt a Summ as 1282000 <hi>l.</hi> before they could be a Corporation; for if the ſubſcribing 500000 <hi>l.</hi> would have done, they would not have been obliged to ask nigh ſo large a Premium as they did, which (by the way) was not ſo extravagant as their Enemies repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to be, conſidering the ſcarcity of Money at that time, when moſt Men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99463:5"/>
valued a mill'd Crown as if it had been an ancient Medal of one of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; neither did they themſelves (whatever they pretended,) think it ſo, ſince they were of Opinion, that had it been complyed with, the Money could not have been raiſed; but it is an eaſie matter to find a ſtick to beat a Dog. All Scruples, tho' never ſo dark and nice, muſt be laid hold of, and all the weak Sophiſtry they were Maſters of, muſt now be furbiſhed up to attack the Land-Bank; but that imprudent and unreaſonable demand (as it was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was not ſo bold as welcome to ſome, who were glad of that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion to deny the Land-Bank; and had their Demands been but a fifth part of what they were, it's likely they would have been thought unreaſonable, for every Mole-hill ſeemed a Mountain, and they were lookt upon as ſuch as intended to raiſe a Rebellion rather than Money: And it was ſomething ſtrange, to ſee ſuch an indifferency to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99463:5"/>
thoſe who endeavoured to bring in ſuch a Maſs of Wealth; but it could not be the Money that was diſliked, but the Method of raiſing it; for the grand Debate was, Whether theſe Chimera's and <hi>Idols of Fancy,</hi> called E—Bils muſt do it or not, which at laſt being reſolved in the affirmative, 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for the firſt payment, which (by the way) is but 25 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> for the whole Summ) is thought ſufficient, and to ſpare, for ſuch as ſhall ſubſcribe their Money to the Land-Bank, (leſs than ever was offered when the baſe Money was currant, which People parted with without any conſideration of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that one would think that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal was rather made by way of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for their former extravagant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, than the utmoſt that could be afforded on ſuch an Occaſion. And it's Obſervable, when this gracions Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer would not bring forth one Penny, (as it was not likely it ſhould) the Commiſſioners were again ſent for, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99463:6"/>
it was the Opinion of moſt that were preſent, that heard the Queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, and the Anſwer they gave, that there would be an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when as the Event ſhewed there was nothing leſs intended, and that they were ſent for, imagining them illiterate enough to make illegal Demands, as asking their Premium upon the Salt-Fund, or to have Guineas taken at above 22 <hi>s.</hi> at laſt the gracious 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> is again offered, with a <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> tacked to it, this Method ſerved to get time, and was like throwing out a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to a Whale to play with, whilſt the Ship eſcapes; for by this dallying the Commiſſioners were diverted from thinking of any other means to raiſe the Money, which without doubt was the thing feared by ſome. And I cannot omit one Queſtion that was asked, and not being anſwered to their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, (as was pretended) was then alledged the reaſon they could not comply with our Propoſals, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99463:6"/>
was, <hi>What Security we could give of raiſing the whole Summ?</hi> a very pretty Queſtion, and which would without doubt put the Rogues to a Non-plus, and ought to be anſwered Poet <hi>Bayes</hi> his way, after a little-pauſing and ſcratching ones Head, to ſay, <hi>I gad I won't tell you;</hi> for if they ſhould have drawn out four or five of the ſtouteſt Fellows amongſt them, each worth 40 or 50000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſent for a Publick Notary immediately, and went forthwith to <hi>Noverint Univerſi,</hi> it's ten to one they would not be ſatisfied, or thought the Security ſufficient. I dare ſay they would not have taken the two Northern Crowns, nor any other brace of Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> for Security: And it was utterly impoſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this Demand, unleſs that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion had been put in time, that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, (who deſign'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe part of the Money) might have prevailed with the great Mogul to give Security to raiſe the Summ: Yet many People are of Opinion, that the beſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99463:7"/>
Security for the Money, had been to have given ſuch terms, as it had been the Peoples Intereſt to have ſubſcribed it; but every things runs counter when a thing is predeſtinated to Ruine and Deſtruction, the Project was hatch'd under an unlucky Planet, and was born like many other fooliſh things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, only that it might dye, and we ought to rejoice it fell ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, having ſo many great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemies againſt it.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is given why the Land-Bank was unfortunate, and that is, becauſe it was conceiv'd in ſin, and therefore that matter ought to be examined, for if ſo, it is no wonder it throve no better: And to prove this 'tis alledged, That the Parliament having incorporated a Society of Men, by the Name of <hi>The Governour and Company of the Bank of</hi> England, (mark the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Particle <hi>The)</hi> had debarred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Power of ſetting up another Bank, and therefore after the Bank of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99463:7"/>
               <hi>England</hi> had advanced their Money for the publick Good, (without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for their own Intereſt) and have ever ſince their incorporation been ſo uſeful to the Government, not only by lending their own money, but every bodies elſe they could lay hands on, to erect another Bank in prejudice of ſuch a one, and upon the breach of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith too, muſt certainly be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and wicked Action.</p>
            <p>Now if this be a Crime, it is not the firſt that Parliaments have been guilty of in that nature, having ſerved the Church of <hi>England</hi> the ſame ſauce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which all People muſt allow was by Law eſtabliſh'd, and was as much the Church of <hi>England</hi> as the other is the <hi>Bank of</hi> England, taking the word <hi>The</hi> in its utmoſt latitude. Neither can it be denyed, but that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been as ſerviceable to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Bank, and is much better calculated for ſo being, than this or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99463:8"/>
any other Bank can poſſibly be.</p>
            <p>And in truth, the Bank hath been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerviceable to the Subjects than the Government, for if we reflect on the Proceedings of the Bank for this laſt ſix Months, we muſt take the People to be in their minority, and to have choſen the Bank for their Guardians. It is well known, that the deſire of living above our Fortunes, has been an Epidemical Diſtemper to the People of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and eſpecially to the Gentry: Now the cure of this Diſeaſe is totally owing to the Bank, for their Pious and Paternal Care ought never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in diligently enquiring into Mens circumſtances, when they came for their Money, <hi>viz. What Family they had?</hi> what Children? what ſervants? and what other Neceſſary Expences they were obliged to ſupport, and ſupplyed them not according to their own extravagant demands, but with what was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Neceſſaries, not for the Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99463:8"/>
of Life. Now to do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the intereſt of theſe our Spiritual and Temporal Benefactors, muſt argue the higheſt ingratitude. But the Bank may be contented to run the ſame Fate with the Church, ſince it was as much the Intent of the Legiſlators to have but one Faith as one Bank.</p>
            <p>But here it will be ſaid by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Bank, that although the Conſequence of the Toleration will be ſetting up as many Churches as there are different Opinions amongſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet the Directors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> put all other Churches under Contribution, and receive Tithes from all, like the City Council, who muſt be fee'd though you make uſe of others. To this may be ſaid, that the Church have a Legal Right to Tithes, and can force People to pay them, which the Bank (to their Grief) have not, to force People to depoſite their Money; but if the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99463:9"/>
of Tithes had been as voluntary as putting Money into the Bank, it had been no more unlawful to eſtabliſh a Toleration than it is now.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps they will Object, that if the Church were really as ill uſed as the Bank, yet that is an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the Crime rather than an Excuſe, which is very true; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that either have been ſo ill uſed, or the publick Faith broke to either; for nothing paſſes in an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what is given by expreſs words, or ſomething neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. I ſuppoſe the Bank does not pretend that another Bank is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by expreſs words; and it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in Nature to make the particle <hi>The</hi> ſuch a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as to carry in its belly all the Caſh in the Kingdom, and to be deſtructive to all future Corporations and Bodies Politick. But I dare be bold to affirm, that if the Parliament

had ſuſpected this Particle to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but the <hi>20th.</hi> part of what is by ſome ſuggeſted, they would have ſent 100 Miles for a word, rather than have uſed it; and therefore it can be no Crime, <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> to ſet up another Bank.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Directors of the Bank of <hi>England</hi> were not blameable, for uſing all their Intereſt to hinder the Act from paſſing, yet when (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the oppoſition that could be made) the Act paſſed, and the King's Affairs, and the Affairs of all <hi>Europe</hi> in a great meaſure depending upon the Succeſs of it, then, I ſay, to appear ſo vigorouſly againſt it, and to ſtrain ſo hard as to bankrupt themſelves, rather than the Land-Bank ſhould riſe, ſavoured rankly of Malice and Self-intereſt. Neither can the Directors of the Bank of <hi>England</hi> be taken by any intelligent Man to be ſuch Patriots as they would have the World ſuppoſe them to be; but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99463:10"/>
I will detain you no longer in the Porch, but proceed to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made againſt the Gentlemen that propoſed and proſecuted the Land-Bank.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they undertook the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 2564000 <hi>l.</hi> at 7 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Intereſt, redeemable by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That contrary to their firſt Propoſals, they inſiſted upon an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Premium of 300000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they were not able to raiſe the Money upon the Premium they deſired, nor could give any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That they ruined the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Bank of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I propoſe to anſwer theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> through their Covetouſneſs and want of Underſtanding, ruin'd their own Credit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this Fund had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99463:10"/>
either to the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Exchequer</hi> alone, it could not have been ſo eaſily raiſed as by a Land-Bank.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there is no way to reſtore Paper-Credit but by a New Bank.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Objection is, <hi>That they undertook the raiſing of</hi> 2564000 l. <hi>at</hi> 7 l. per Cent. <hi>perpetual Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That neither the Gentlemen concern'd in the Land-Bank, or any Perſon, or Body of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>England,</hi> did, or could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo great a Summ; but when Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods were propoſed in the Houſe of Commons for raiſing this Money, they offered their Opinions, that it might be raiſed by a Land-Bank, and that 7 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> was ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as the Treaſury and Courtiers thought it might be beſt raiſed by an Exchequer-Bank, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by different Methods; and if they were miſtaken, (as I ſhall endeavour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99463:11"/>
to ſhew they were not) it is what the Treaſury were in their Exchequer-bank, and what any one elſe in probability would have been, conſidering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumſtances of the Kingdom when the Propoſals were made, and when the Money was to be raiſed.</p>
            <p>Second Objection. <hi>That they inſiſted upon an extravagant Premium of</hi> 300000 l.</p>
            <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> They were obliged to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Diſcouragement and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they met with in the Houſe of Commons, in the paſſing their <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in relation to Money and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit was very different when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were made, and when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was to be raiſed, and therefore they were obliged to enlarge their Demands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Difficulties they met with in paſſing their Bill were theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Members of the Bank of <hi>England</hi> were excluded from ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99463:11"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were not to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated upon a leſs Summ than 1282100 <hi>l.</hi> by which Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not one in ten would ſubſcribe 'till they were aſſured of being a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, eſteeming that Priviledge to be half their bargain, and fearing the Subſcriptions might not amount to that Summ; whereas if the Subſcribers had been qualified to be a Corporation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubſcribing 500000 <hi>l.</hi> that Summ had been ſubſcribed in three days, by the Commiſſioners themſelves, and the Members of <hi>Exeter-Exchange;</hi> and if they had been once entituled to a Corporation, there could be no doubt but the whole Money would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed afterwards, ſince it would be then a greater Encouragement to come in at <hi>Par</hi> than upon 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When they offered a Clauſe to their Act, to naturalize ſuch as would ſubſcribe 500 <hi>l.</hi> and had reaſonable Aſſurance from the Forreigners upon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99463:12"/>
the Exchange, that ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would bring in 400000 <hi>l.</hi> that clauſe being thrown out, the ſtock of the Bank of <hi>England</hi> advanced, and their Wagerers upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change offered odds againſt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Land Bank.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their Bill was delayed ſo long by the oppoſition it found, that they could not get their Commiſſion paſſed before the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> by which means it was left in the power of the Treaſury to refuſe or take the fourth part of their Subſcriptions in clipt Money, which was a particular hardſhip upon a great number of People, who avoided putting in their clipt Money upon other Funds, in hopes of ſubſcribing it, and making their firſt payments with it in this Bank; and reaſonably hoped ſince they paid to the recompence, to have their clipt Money made good to them as well as to others.</p>
            <p>And I believe it has been every
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99463:12"/>
ones Obſervation, that ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> and others, Oppoſers of the Land-Bank, would often inſult over them upon their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the Houſe of Commons, and ask them what was become of their Bank, tho' now they call them Jacobites, and threaten to impeach them, for not doing what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rendered impoſſible for them to do.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon I gave, was, the different Circumſtances of the Kingdom when the Propoſals were made, and when the Money was to be raiſed: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Guineas were taken at 30 <hi>s.</hi> and it was not known whether the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament would bring them down or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Paper-Credit was good, and the Bank of <hi>England</hi> and the Goldſmiths paid their Bills punctually, whereas at the time this Money was to be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both refuſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tallies were equal, or better
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99463:13"/>
than Money, whereas afterwards they were 20, 30, and 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcount, by which means People could make a much greater advantage of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and therefore would not ſubſcribe it upon the ſame terms as they thought before reaſonable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was hoped at firſt not above 60 <hi>per Cent.</hi> would be called in, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as afterwards by the Univerſal Fall of Credit, and want of Money, no one thought of paying leſs than the whole Summ ſubſcribed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There was an actual want of Money in Specie in the Kingdom, ſeven Millions in and out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer being rendered uſeleſs, by which means the Commiſſioners ſaw it impoſſible to get the Money ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and paid in Specie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſigned to take Tallies, good Goldſmiths Bills, and Bank Bills, and clipt Money by weight at a high rate for Subſcriptions, and ſo asked 300000 <hi>l.</hi> Praemium, believing it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99463:13"/>
would coſt them full as much to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſeveral Species aforeſaid for Money, which they propos'd to pay to the King.</p>
            <p>It is to be Obſerved here, (1.) If the 300000 <hi>l.</hi> deſired, had been granted to the Land-Bank, their bargain had not been ſo great as the Bank of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>'s; for the Bank of <hi>England</hi> having 100000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> they gave but 12 years purchaſe for their Fund; beſides, they had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them 4000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Whereas, if 300000 <hi>l.</hi> had been deducted out of this Fund, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had been 2264000 <hi>l.</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 179000, the Intereſt they were to receive makes near 13 years purchaſe; and I believe the ſcarceneſs and goodneſs of Money conſidered, when the Bank of <hi>England</hi> was raiſed, and when the Land-Bank was to be raiſed, any one but themſelves will believe that the latter deſerved at leaſt equal Encouragement; and it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99463:14"/>
the Parliament would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it, if they had forſeen the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have ſince happened.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Comiſſioners did not ask the 300000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Salt-Fund, but upon the Exchequer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which could not be paid them but by the Conſent of the Parliament, and ſo they left themſelves to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament whether they deſerved it or no.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At the time they asked thoſe Tallies on the Exchequer in general, it would have coſt 40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to diſcount them, which reduced their Demands to leſs than 200000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If their Terms had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, the greateſt part of the Subſcriptions would have been made in clipt Money and Plate, which would have been coined to encreaſe our Species of Money, and it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable would ſave the Nation next year near as much in the recompence for clipt Money, and Encouragement
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99463:14"/>
for bringing in the Plate as the Summ demanded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Exchequer has not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Money ſo cheap ſince.</p>
            <p>The Third Objection. <hi>That they were not able to raiſe the Money upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium they asked, nor could they give any Security to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Objection juſtifies them in asking the Premium refuſed; for it is very unjuſt to tax them for asking too much, and yet to confeſs it was not enough to induce people to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Money. However, I offer theſe Reaſons that it would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They Propoſed they might open their Books for Private Subſcriptions, not doubting within three days they might bring Hands for near the Summ to be raiſed, which was not thought fit to be granted to them, it being Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would be a Diſencouragement to the real Subſcriptions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they were ſent for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99463:15"/>
the Lords Juſtices, and were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>What Security they could give of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Summ?</hi> They Anſwered, <hi>That they computed the Commiſſioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Members of</hi> Exeter-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, <hi>would ſubſcribe</hi> 700000 l. <hi>that they believed they ſhould be able to bring in as much more by their Intereſt and dequain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and they thought it reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the whole Kingdom would ſubſcribe the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That they thought the Nature of the thing would admit of no other Security than what they offered, ſince it could not be expected that any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons would enter into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances to raiſe the Summ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was ſolely to their Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if they did not ſubſcribe to be a Corporation, ſince by the failure they would only entitle themſelves to 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the Exchequer, which no one would give 70 <hi>l.</hi> for, and therefore it is to be preſumed they would take ſuch care for their own ſakes, as not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99463:15"/>
to loſe 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of their Money; which if they did not, it would ſolely redound to the advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors of the Exchequer-Bank, who would have the Money that was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to circulate their own Bills.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When they became a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it cannot be doubted but the whole Money would be quickly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, ſince then the advantage of ſubſcribing would be much greater, (as I ſaid before) and it was not in the power of the Commiſſioners to hinder any one from ſubſcribing that thought it his Intereſt; but admitting the Subſcriptions would have ſtopt when they were qualified to be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, I believe moſt People are of Opinion now, that 1282000 <hi>l.</hi> would better ſerve his Majeſties occaſions, than nothing, though the Arithmetick of that time was, that half was leſs than none.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Objection is, <hi>That they ruin'd the Credit of the Bank of</hi> England:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99463:16"/>
and here theſe worthy Patriots make bold with the Parliament, and ſay, they broke their Faith with them, in ſetting up another Bank. <hi>I Anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are no words in the Act of Parliament, that directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly exclude the Parliament from ſetting up another Bank: The Act only incorporates a Body of Men to ſue and be ſued, which if it ſhould amount to a prohibitory Clauſe, excludes King and Parliament ever hereafter to grant a Corporation, ſince every Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſingle perſon, or number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>England,</hi> may lawfully do what theſe Gentlemen pretend to have the Monopoly of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Land-Bank was excluded from diſcounting Bills of Exchange, lending Money upon Pawns, dealing in Bullion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every thing elſe, but lending upon Land, and to the Government, and therefore could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be no diſadvantage to the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> who do not pretend to lend upon Land.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99463:16"/>
3. If the other Bank had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it's probable the Bank of <hi>England</hi> would have had more Caſh left with them than before, ſince it would have been the Intereſt of both Banks to have agreed, and then without doubt they might have divided the Goldſmiths profits between them, and ſo each Bank have more Depoſites than the Bank of <hi>England</hi> had before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the ſetting up a Land-Bank would be a Diſadvantage to the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> it was no injuſtice to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them, ſince the Parliament gave no Warrant to the contrary, and their bargain was great enough notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and greater than they thought was fit to be granted to the Land-Bank, who were to raiſe more than double the Summ, in leſs time, when the Difficulties were greater, and the Coin better; they had but 7 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> excluded from many Advantages the Bank of <hi>England</hi> had, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged beſides to lend 500000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99463:17"/>
at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> 0 <hi>d. per Cent.</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the eſtabliſhing the Land-Bank did encreaſe the Demands upon the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> it was cauſed by the unreaſonable oppoſition they gave to it; which failing of the Effect they propoſed, gave them that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation that always attends thoſe that are overcome, for the World had reaſon to believe they underſtood their own Intereſt beſt; and when they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wind up their whole happineſs in defeating the Land-Bank, and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not to be wondered if other People thought their Condition to be worſe then it was.</p>
            <p>That the Covetouſneſs and want of Underſtanding of the Bank of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was the Occaſion of their loſs of Credit; To prove which I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they left undone thoſe things which they ought to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have done thoſe things, which they ought not to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the firſt, They ought to have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99463:17"/>
foreſeen, that after the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Demands upon them would be greater than before, for admitting the World had as good an Opinion of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as ever, yet the neceſſity of People muſt call upon them for Money, for the whole Silver Species of <hi>England</hi> being ſunk in a day, they might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured all People would want Money for their ordinary occaſions; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opinion they had of their Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would call for it when they had demands, and therefore they ought to have made Proviſions to anſwer them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſhould have called in as many of their Bills as they could, whereas they iſſued out Bills till the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and how many ſince they ſtopt their payments is beſt known to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They might have bought Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas for Tallies and clipt Money, when Tallies were <hi>par,</hi> and clipt Money cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and Guineas playing between 22 <hi>s.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99463:18"/>
and 24 <hi>s.</hi> which they were three Weeks or a Month.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They might have called in their 40 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> either before or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and not kept Money in their Pockets which they owed to other people.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When they could not pay all their Demands, they might have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the difference which their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors gave to diſcount their Bills, ſince it is more reaſon the Debtor ſhould pay it than the Creditor.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They might have allowed the Intereſt they received, or at leaſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Intereſt, when they were not able to pay the Principal.</p>
            <p>To the laſt they Object, <hi>That they offered Tallies to any that demanded them, which was the Security they had.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It lyes upon them to prove, they ever offered any Tallies payable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three Months, but only ſuch as it was worth 30 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to diſcount.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99463:18"/>
2. If they had offered ſuch Tallies, it had not been ſufficient, ſince their Creditors did not truſt the Exchequer, but them, and expected their Money upon demand, as the Bank is liable by Law to pay it, or otherwiſe they would rather have put their Money into the Exchequer for Tallies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have receiv'd the Intereſt from the beginning, than let the Bank receive the Intereſt of their Money till they call for it, and then give them but part of that Security which they might have had at firſt, and upon ſuch Funds as the Bank thought fit to ſpare, whereas themſelves might have choſen their own Funds.</p>
            <p>If theſe Methods would not have fully anſwered their Creditors, at leaſt it would have given them the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of honeſt Men, and of doing all that they were able to do.</p>
            <p>Next I am to prove the Bank of <hi>England</hi> have done thoſe things which they ought not to do.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99463:19"/>
1. They extended their Credit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> and by that means run in debt more than they were able to pay, whereas it is very evident the Act of Parliament deſigned to confine their Credit to 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> which their Fund was anſwerable for, by obliging them not to iſſue out a greater Summ upon it; not imagining that they would evade the Act, by iſſuing out Notes, which bound not themſelves, nor was any ways Security to thoſe that accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. For it is not to be conceiv'd the Parliament deſigned they ſhould borrow any Money, but what they could give Security for, and not under the ſhelter of an Act of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive innocent People, who do not know a Corporation is not bound, but under their Common-Seal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they had thus evaded the Act, and were afraid to be called to account by the next Parliament, to ſweeten the Contrey-Gentlemen they promiſed to lend Money upon Land,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99463:19"/>
to any one that offered them good-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, which I hope they have more modeſty then to ſay they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and by that means have juſtly raiſed the indignation of the Nobility, and Gentry againſt them, who hoped to be eaſed from the Extortion of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners and Uſurers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They undertook a fooliſh Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to return Money for <hi>Flanders,</hi> by which they have loſt a Summ beſt known to themſelves, whereas it might have done better by the Merchants, whoſe Buſineſs it was, and who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it better. They alledge, they did it to ſerve the Government, but I think it will be hard to ſatisfie the World, that they were contented to loſe 80000 <hi>l.</hi> to ſave the King 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and therefore it will be rather account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Folly than Zeal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Within few days before the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> they gave Bills payable upon demand for clipt Money, whereas it is probable, the ſame perſons would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99463:20"/>
have been contented to have taken them payable ſix Months after, or elſe they need not have given them at all.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By their unreaſonable Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they gave to the Land-Bank, they rendered the raiſing of the Summ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ineffectual, and conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled themſelves, by not receiving ſo much Money as was appropriated to their own uſe out of that Fund.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Q<hi rend="sup">ry</hi>.</hi> Whether they did not addreſs themſelves to the Treaſury, to have their Bills refuſed in the Cuſtoms? if ſo, it was a great diminution to their Credit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To finiſh their ruine, they lent 200000 <hi>l.</hi> to the King, when they paid but 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> of their Debts, and ſome ſay to hinder the Land-Bank Propaſals from being accepted.</p>
            <p>Here I am aware I ſhall be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they did it out of Zeal to his Majeſty, and to ſerve the Government; this they think will juſtifie all their Miſcarriages, and protect them for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99463:20"/>
acting againſt the Rules of Juſtice and Prudence, therefore it ought to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. They have ſerved the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I grant it, but it was to ſerve themſelves; a Miſer would be as good a Friend; they have lent the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Money, but upon as great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as the Parliament allowed, and greater than they could get elſewhere.</p>
            <p>They have lent other Peoples Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and not their own, and at the ſame time refuſe to pay thoſe to whom it belongs; whereas if their Zeal for the Government had been as great as they pretended, they would have raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money in their private Capacities, and ſo lent what was their own, or at leaſt given their Creditors the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt they receiv'd, but inſtead of that they keep part of their principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in their hands, and what they have already called in for, they pay 6 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to themſelves, though they deny it to their Creditors.</p>
            <p>I will put them two Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99463:21"/>
1. If a Man robs another of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and lends it to the Government, will it juſtifie this Robbery?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether detaining a Mans Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from him, and lending it at Intereſt, without giving the Intereſt receiv'd, be not <hi>in foro Conſeientiae</hi> as bad as taking it from him?</p>
            <p>I believe if the Scene were changed from <hi>Grocers-Hall</hi> to <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet,</hi> we ſhall all be of an Opinion.</p>
            <p>I leave with a Goldſmith 1000 <hi>l.</hi> he gives me his Note payable upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I go to him ſix Months hence, and ask him for my Money, he tells me the Government was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and he lent them my Money; I tell him I gave him no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but finding my ſelf remedileſs, I ask him to allow me the Intereſt he receives, he refuſes it; I then ask him to give me his Bond, and Legal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, he refuſes that; I fancy if I ſhould pull him by the Noſe, I ſhould be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by moſt of thoſe Gentlemen that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99463:21"/>
are of another Opinion, in the caſe of the Bank of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing I have to prove, is, that if this had been given to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer alone, or to the Bank of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it would not have been ſo eaſily raiſed as by a Land-Bank. And firſt for an Exchequer-Bank.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Projectors themſelves propoſe 400000 <hi>l.</hi> always to lye ſtill to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate their Bills, (which is to be uſed to no other purpoſe whatſoever) which muſt be wanting upon the Salt-Fund, to anſwer His Majeſties Occaſions, or elſe muſt be raiſed upon another; and ſo 400000 <hi>l.</hi> muſt be raiſed extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, whereas the Land-Bank ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but three.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Demands upon the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſhould exceed the 400000 <hi>l.</hi> which it's likely they would, (every Body knowing their Stock) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer will be broke, and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Government ſunk; whereas the Land-Bank may be able to anſwer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99463:22"/>
all their Bills; or if they ſhould not, the Government will ſuffer no diſcredit by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Exchequer ſhould refuſe Payment, the Creditor has no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but upon 7 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> which he will not value at 70 <hi>l.</hi> whereas if the Bank ſhould refuſe Payment, he would have Remedy for his whole Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> If the Exchequer-Bank ſhould have Credit, Intereſt upon Land muſt be at 8 or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> For it is not to be imagined any one will lend upon Land at the uſual Intereſt, when he can have it upon demand, with 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> running Intereſt; and therefore ſuch a Bank can't be of as great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as a Bank that would raiſe the Land, and leſſen the Intereſt of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; for an Exchequer-Bank can be of no uſe to any one, but ſuch as have the management of the 400000 <hi>l.</hi> which may be made uſe of to lend his Majeſty upon Funds, and to circulate the Tellers Notes, which ſome ſay has been a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99463:22"/>
common practice, ſince they have ſet up the Trade of Banking.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Bank of <hi>England</hi> could not have raiſed this Summ as well as the Land-Bank; to illuſtrate which it muſt be examined, which way they could have propoſed to raiſe it, and that muſt be either 1. By iſſuing out Bills upon their Credit. 2. Or by opening their Books for New Subſcriptions.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt: I ſuppoſe they will not pretend to ſay, that iſſuing out two Millions and a half of Bills more, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon demand, would enable them the better to anſwer thoſe that were then out; and if they had opened their Books for New Subſcriptions, they muſt have let the New Subſcribers come in at <hi>Par,</hi> with their Original Stock, or not; and it is not likely they would do the former, ſince by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Bill in their Favour, their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal 60 <hi>l.</hi> being then valued at 90 <hi>l.</hi> might have been ſtock-jobbed to 150 <hi>l.</hi> And the letting New Subſcriptions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99463:23"/>
come in upon equal terms, muſt have reduced their ſtock to its Original Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; for no Man would buy it at more, if he could ſubſcribe at <hi>par;</hi> and if they had opened their Books for Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the Improved Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, no one but would rather ſubſcribe his Money to a New Fund, where he might come in upon equal terms, than adjoyn a real value with an imaginary one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But admitting they would have ſo much Self-denial to accept Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>par,</hi> yet by the Money they raiſe they muſt pay their Bills that are out already, as well as the 2564000 <hi>l.</hi> whereas the Land-Bank are to pay no more than they receive.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moſt People would rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to a New Bank, than one that has loſt its Credit.</p>
            <p>Therefore I infer, if it could not be raiſed by a Land-Bank, it could not be raiſed by this Fund.</p>
            <p>The next thing I have to ſhew, is,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99463:23"/>
That there is no way to reſtore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Credit but by a New Bank.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take it for granted, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will never go for Money, but when I can have Money for it upon demand; for no Man will part with ready Money for a Note, or take a Note for Money upon any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and therefore Paper can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reſtored, unleſs the Bank of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and Goldſmiths pay their Notes, or elſe another Fund is ſet up that can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Bank of <hi>England</hi> if they were diſpoſed to pay their Debts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly do it; their Money as it became due from the Exchequer, is not enough to anſwer 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of their Debts, and they can never have any Credit till they can anſwer all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which muſt require greater Summs then they have, or can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly get.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they had Money enough to anſwer all Demands, it is probable it would be all called from them; for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99463:24"/>
Reputation is ſo nice a thing, that if it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s once blown upon, 'tis rarely reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, eſpecially in a matter that ſo nearly concerns us, as parting with our Money; for it will be a hard matter to induce me to truſt one, that through Indiſcretion or Deſign has deceived me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It cannot be imagined that any one will bring in Money to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with them, for that is to pay in 100 <hi>l.</hi> and get 5 <hi>l.</hi> with a Weeks trouble when I want it again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The giving them a New Fund, is enabling them to cheat more People, for by the Monies that riſe upon it, they muſt not only purchaſe their Fund, but anſwer the Bills that are out before; and if their Creditors ſhould not be ſo good natur'd to ſtop their Demands, they muſt their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As to the Goldſmiths reviving Credit, I ſuppoſe no Man expects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from them, or that any thing will make them honeſt but a Catch-Pole:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99463:24"/>
And of the Exchequer-Credit we have had an Eſſay already, which with what I have ſaid of it before, is ſufficient, therefore I argue, that Paper Credit can be reſtored by no other means, than by a New Bank, and ſetling a Freſh Fund of Credit.</p>
