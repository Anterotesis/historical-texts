            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of an houſhoulde and familie: collected, framed and compoſed in the Latine tongue (after the order of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue) by the firſt Author Bartholomew Batty of <hi>Aloſtenſis</hi> for the vtilitie and profite of his brethren, children, and countrie men, whereof. I taking ſome good liking at the firſt viewe, ſetled my ſelfe therein, and would not giue it ouer, vntill ſuche time as I had throughly peruſed and diligently read ouer the ſame. And the matter being pitthy, pleaſaunt and profitable, bewrapt me in ſuch delight, that I could not chooſe, but beſtow the ſecond reading therof, &amp; ſo waded through againe with a more deep conſideration, care and diligence then before. Thus paſſing through the ſecond time I gleyned and gathered together certaine ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notes for mine owne better inſtruction and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine owne family. Of the whiche when ſome of my deare friendes had taken the viewe, together with the Booke, and alſo hauing good liking thereof, they beganne to perſwade me earneſtly, and that with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great reaſons, that it would be very profitable not only vnto my ſelfe, for mine owne priuate exerciſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge (but alſo vnto all Parents &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Maiſters and ſeruants old and young, of what eſtate, degree &amp; condition ſoeuer, being ignorant of the Latine tongue) if I would beſtow, not only the tranſlating therof. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo afterwards commit the ſame to the printing, that therby our countrie and countriemen (which are right deare vnto vs) might alſo reape ſome profite and commodity. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I thought my ſelfe farre vnfit for that purpoſe and not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly able to performe their honeſt &amp; earneſt requeſts nor to manifeſt the Authours iuſt deſerued praiſe, in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo fit a paterne for this our age &amp; time. Yet at the laſt aſwel for their importunacy, as alſo chiefly for the increaſe of mine owne knowledge, and to doe my countriemen
<pb facs="tcp:1210:3"/>
ſome pleaſure (after the example of others.) I haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very boldly to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt this matter. And as time would permit me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mine other daily exerciſes, haue brought the ſame to ſuch effect as may now appeare, without any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto the firſt Authour. I haue now diſfurniſhed &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him out of his owne rich robes and gallant garments, and haue apparelled him after the Engliſh faſhion, which though perhaps to ſome may ſeeme euill ſhapen, at the firſt ſight, and will alſo deeme, that the ſtuffe is not ſo fine, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and coſtly, nor ſet out with ſuch delicate deuiſes, picked points, and curious colours, as the worthineſſe of the thing doth deſerue, nor that I haue ſhewed my ſelfe ther in a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and skilful Artificer: yet is it good, wholſome and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and not of the courſeſt nor vileſt kind of ſtuffe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the baſeſt and ſimpleſt faſhion. So that ſuch as ſhall behold the ſound body and inward ſubſtance, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward ſhew, and ſhall endure the ſame vnto the end: ſhal find (no doubt) ſufficient matter miniſtred vnto them: to garde and defend them at all aſſayes from many miſhaps, ſharpe ſhowers, terrible tempeſts, iniuries and inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which otherwiſe for want therof, might more ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annoy them. And for that your worſhips are Fathers of many children (which I am perſwaded are dearly beloued vnto you) and maiſters of great families, wherof I knowe you haue care to be vertuouſly inſtructed, guided, gouerned and trayned vp in the feare of God. And becauſe this whole diſcourſe tendeth to the ſame purpoſe and effect, I haue thought it good to offer theſe my ſimple paynes and trauels vnto your woorſhips, as the preſent of a true and faithfull friend, which faine would haue offered you a better gift, if his power would haue extended thereunto. But herein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the examples of poore men in the auncient hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I am ſo much the bolder, euen for the very goodwill

And in my iudgement there is no man that coulde haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more wholeſome or better counſel concerning this matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is worthie of all men to bee followed. Not withſtanding I my ſelfe haue knowne ſume furious parentes a brode, which haue vſed to ſtrike and buffet their children about the face and head, and to lay vpon them like Mault ſackes with cudgels, ſtaues, forke or fire ſhouel, or whatſoeuer came nigheſt their handes, yea, and very often alſo, haue caſt them on the grounde, and ſpurned and kickt them like dogs, which maner of correcting I iudge is vtterly to bee deteſted and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, neither do I think it lawfull by any meanes that they ſhould vſe them after ſuch order. Wherefore I pray you tell vs, how ſhould they bee admoniſhed and perſwaded, that heereafter they doe not vſe and handle their children and ſeruants after ſuche raging, furious, and beaſtly maner.</p>

Notwithſtanding, if it may ſéeme profitable and neceſſarie to any, to ſende their ſonnes into Italy or Fraunce, to common ſtudies in their Vniuerſities, and to haue greater vnderſtanding and knowledge in the tongues and liberall Artes and Sciences.

much with them, ſo that it be done with great aduiſement, counſel, and conſideration (that is to ſay) if Parents ſhal firſt diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their children in the true knowledge &amp; reuerend fear of God, and that the ſame be ſurely ſetled, and moſt firmely fixed in their heartes, that it may not be eaſily remooued, and they caried away with euerie vaine blaſt of blaſphemous doctrine, and hatefull He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which ſhal ſoone be blowne aſwel into their outward eares, as alſo into their inward mindes, wherwith their hearts ſhalbe ſo infected, that both bodie &amp; minde ſhal ſoone be out of all good courſe. Wherof all the Patriarkes and Prophets had great regard, as we may reade in their Bookes, which haue moſt diligently and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taught and inſtructed their children in the feare of God, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde them of perilles and daungers, and diſcouraged them from the company and fellowſhip of wicked men, as wée may ſée by the example of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> which was alwayes kepte at home of<note place="margin">Gene. 42.</note> his father Iacob.

And therfore they haue often this prouerb in their mouthes: It is a neare collop, that is cut from their owne fleſh: So that the mothers loue is vnfained But theſe Nurſes vſe no true, but fained &amp; diſſembled loue, becauſe they are hirelings and ſo by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meanes: vrged to practiſe &amp; vſe their kindneſſe, for gaine and lucer ſake.

And therefore nature hath giuen to euerie liuing beaſt that bringes foorth young, power to nouriſhe and comforte the ſame, with their owne milke. And God by his great prouidence and inſcrutable wiſedome, hath prouided and giuen vnto women two breaſtes, that if it ſhoulde fortune at one trauayle, they ſhoulde be deliuered of two children, that then they might haue two fountaynes for their better nouriſhing. Great rare therefore muſt bée imployed, and paynes beſtowed, that the verie mothers them ſelues (as I haue ſayde) doe nouriſhe and bring vp their infantes with their owne breaſtes and mylke.</p>

Thirdly, they muſt alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor them with their labor, paines &amp; trauel (that is to ſay) they ſhal helpe, relieue and prouide for them, both with their bodies &amp; goods: and in no wiſe ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be oppreſſed with pouertie and miſerie when they growe aged. And children ſhall doe this, not onely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but alſo reuerently, and with great lowlineſſe of minde, as though this duetie and benefite, ſhoulde bée doone to God him ſelfe (as it is in very déed) &amp; they ought to be moſt thankful vnto God which hath thus preferred them to this worſhip and honour, and hath made them able thus to perfourme this duetie.</p>

               <p>Firſt, they are to bée honoured and reuerenced, for that God by them hath giuen vs both body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after wée are nowe borne, God by our Parents doth nouriſh vs, prouide all things neceſſary for vs, &amp; bring vs vp more tenderly then the Hen doth her chickins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they care and prouide that wée may bée baptized, and ingraffed into Chriſte, and ſo made the children of God, and heires of his celeſtiall kingdome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when now wée are growne vp, &amp; that it is time, that wée ſhoulde know, learne, and vnderſtand the worde of God, then the Almightie God by our parents, doth deliuer vnto vs that moſt pure &amp; excellent doctrine (that is to ſay) the ten Commandements, the Simbole or Créede of the Apoſtles, and the Lordes prayer. And beſides this, our Parents doe teache and inſtruct vs in good maners, and ſuch lowly &amp; gentle behauiour: to the end wée might become ſuch, as with whom all honeſt and godly men would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue their conuerſation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they doteach, or cauſe vs to be taught, ſom handiecraft, Science, Trade or Occupation, wherwith wée may honeſtly get our liuings, in that ſtate &amp; condition of life, vnto the which it ſhall pleaſe God to appoint vs: by them wée haue our Countrie, then the which nothing is more ſwéete or deare vnto vs: by them wee inioy the benefite of the lawes of our Towne, Citie, &amp; Common Wealth, then the which nothing is more to bée obeyed: by them wée receiue and inioy our Patrimony and inheritance, then the which nothing is more to bée wiſhed: Finally, what is it that wée doe not receiue by their meanes? So great paines and labour haue they in bringing vp their children, in framing, forming, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, nurturing and adorning them, that they are not able fully to perfourme their dueties, woulde they neuer ſo faine: And theſe be the chiefeſt cauſes, why God doth commaund vs to honour our Parents.

               <p>Although this ſentence hath no ſcruple or doubt, yet with all my hearte wil I gratifie theſe young ones concerning this thing: there is a like ſaying of S. Paul touching ſeruants, to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh after this maner: Seruants obey your bodily maiſters, with feare &amp; trembling, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſimplenes of your hearts, as to Chriſt<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. Coll. 3.</note> himſelfe, not with the eye ſeruice as pleaſing men, but as ſeruing the Lorde Chriſt. And if ſeruants ought to obey their maiſters, as the Lord God himſelf: ought not children much more to reuerence and obey their parents? But to the ende that theſe thinges may be the better vnderſtood, I will vſe a ſimilitude for the better capacity of children. Euen as the chiefe maiſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth his ſchollers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his vſſher, to teach, guide, and gouerne them in his abſence, to whom they owe the like reuerence for the time as to their maiſter And as the vſſher doth ſharply puniſh and correct their diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<note place="margin">Parentes are Gods vicars in earth.</note> if they offend, ſo doth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord God gréeuouſly puniſh thoſe children which do not obey their Parents: For he hath appointed parents to be his vſſhers in his ſtéede for the training vp and inſtructing of children. Now God is the chiefeſt workmaiſter &amp; vſſher, &amp; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are but meanes and inſtruments, by the which god worketh theſe things. Therfore parents are to be honored, loued, &amp; obeyed, becauſe God will haue it ſo, who puniſheth rebels, not as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men, but as railers of his will &amp; high maieſtie, wherfore I woulde haue good children héereby admoniſhed, leaſt that they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues to be drawne of the Diuel into the ſinne of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and rebellion.</p>

For it is certayne in the whole lawe there are added promiſes of rewards, which are beſtowed vpon the obedient, as is to be ſéene in <hi>Tobia</hi> which was bleſſed of his father, in Ieſu the ſonne of Mary which was ſubiect to his Parentes, and obeyed them euen to the death.

               <p>Nothing more willingly. Obedience in the ſcriptures general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is greatly allowed and eſtéemed, and chiefly that, wherein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes are to be honoured and obeyed: which the olde Fathers not vnfitly, haue called the mother of all felicitie. And <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaieth: <hi>Obedientiam meliorem eſſe victimis. <hi>Obedience is better than ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </hi> Obedience is a great good thing, and contrariwiſe: diſobedience is a wicked and outragious euill. A diſobedient ſonne (ſaieth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man) is a cruell murtherer of his Parentes, for that there is no ſorow or griefe in the whole courſe and life of men greater, than that which ariſeth of the calamitie and wickednes of children, ſuch as was of our firſt Parentes or of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Let children conſider of theſe thinges, that it may increaſe in them a greater and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care of obeying than heretofore.</p>

               <p>A like thing happened of one <hi>Cymon</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> whoſe loue and<note place="margin">Cymon.</note> pietie towards his Parents was ſo excéeding great, that the Lord God rewarded him wonderfully for the ſame (that is to ſay) with proſperitie and long life. For when his father <hi>Miltiades</hi> for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which hée had borowed out of the common treaſury, was caſt into priſon, there to ſuffer famiſhment except he could pay the debt
<pb facs="tcp:1210:76"/>
and hée nowe almoſt pined and withered away. <hi>Cymon</hi> to the end that hée might nowe deliuer and redéeme his father, beſought the Magiſtrates, that hée might bée kept in priſon in the ſtéed of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill hée coulde pay thoſe thirtie thouſand crownes into the treaſurie (for ſo much hée ought). <hi>Cymon</hi> was receiued into priſon, the father was ſet at libertie, who not long after died, héere (to mans iudgement) <hi>Cymon</hi> was like to periſh for the loue he bare to his father.

There is no doubt but that it was Gods prouidence, that <hi>Cymon</hi> ſhoulde bee deliuered. For by this example, God would ſhewe himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, to render vnto obedient and louing childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rewardes of their godlineſſe, albeit they be ſtrangers from the Chriſtian faith.</p>

But contrariwiſe, who ſo reſiſt the diuine worde of God, an vnhappie life, and that very ſhort, is ready to fall vpon them by and by, becauſe they haue diſobeyed the Lord of life. For theſe ſtubborne &amp; rebellious wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are vtterly forſaken of God, and ſo become théeues, robbers, and murtherers, to their owne ſhame &amp; confuſion.
