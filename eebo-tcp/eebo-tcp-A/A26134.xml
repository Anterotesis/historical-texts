            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRYAL AND EXAMINATION OF JOAN BUTS,
For being a Common WITCH and IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHANTRESS, before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton,</hi> Lord Chief Justice, at the Assizes holden for the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> and County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> on <hi>Monday,</hi> March 27. 1682.</head>
            <p>SHE was indicted by the name of <hi>Ioan Buts,</hi> late of <hi>Yoel,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> for that she being a common <hi>Witch</hi> and <hi>Inchantress,</hi> and not having the fear of God before her eyes, but moved by the instigation of the Devil, she did by her wicked and devilish Art, bewitch <hi>Mary Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and brought her into a languishing Condition; in which languishing Condition she continued until she died.</p>
            <p>She was indicted a second time, for that she being a common <hi>Witch</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantress,</hi> &amp;c. she not having the fear of God before her eyes, but guided by the Instigation of the Devil, she had by her wicked and devilish Art, bewitched <hi>Elizabeth Burrige,</hi> and brought her into a languishing Condition, &amp;c. To both which Indictments she pleaded Not Gulty; and for Tryal, put her self upon God and her Country.</p>
            <p>The Witnesses being sworn, the Parents of <hi>Mary Farmer</hi> swore, That their Child being taken ill in an extraordinary and violent manner, the Neighbours told them it was bewitched, and p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>swaded them to go to Dr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> which they did, and <hi>Bourn</hi> told them, That their Child was under an ill Tongue, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised them to save the Childs water, and put it into a Bottle, stopping it close, and bury it in the Earth, and to burn the Childs Clothes, assuring them, that then the <hi>Witch</hi> which had done her the hurt, would come in; and that accordingly they did so; and when the Childs clothes was burning, <hi>Ioan Buts</hi> came in, and sat her down upon a Stool, looking with <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> most frightful and gastly Countenance<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and being asked by a Woman that was there present, what she ailed? she answered,
<pb facs="tcp:50430:2"/>
She was not well, nor had been out in seven weeks before; why would you come out now then, said the Woman? I could not forbear coming to see you, said she; and with that, she threw down her Hat and tumbled down, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground, making a fearful and dismal noise; and being got up, she fell a cursing in a most horrid manner. To this purpose swore divers others, who were present at the same time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Burrige,</hi> who was one of the persons bewitched, swore, That going out of her Masters house in the evening, towards the Barn-door, she saw a Goose, or some such creature, coming towards her; whereat being much affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, she run in a doors, telling them what she saw; whereupon, her Mistris, with some others of the house, went out to see if they could see any thing; and being out, there were stones thrown at them from every side, and they could not see from whence they came; so that they were forced to retire into the house; and hav<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ng shut the door, the stones were thrown as fast in at the window, and yet not one Quarrel of Glass broken. Her Master swore, that she being in the middle of the Room, she suddenly screamed out, saying, Something is got into my back, when going to her, he pulled out a great piece of Clay from about the middle of her back, stuck as full of pins as ever it could hold. The Maid swore also, That going the next morning a milking, she saw <hi>Ioan Buts,</hi> bedagling her self among the Bushes; whereat being affrighted, she came home and told them, that she had met such a woman that used to come a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the house, she not then knowing her name; but they told her, it was Goody <hi>Buts.</hi> Her Master swore likewise, that sending her up stairs, to fetch him something out of a Trunk, she called out, Master, here is Goody <hi>Buts;</hi> but going up stairs with several others, they could not see her, but they saw several things in the Chamber move out of their places, there being no body near them; and that coming down stairs, an Andiron that stood in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, removed out of its place, and flying over their heads, fell down before them; and that the Maid crying out again, that something was got into her back, he took out another great piece of Clay, stuck as full of thorns as the other was of pins.</p>
            <p>Others swore, That they had divers times taken out pins from the Arms, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Mary Farmar;</hi> which was also proved by divers others that had seen them taken out.</p>
            <p>And one of the Evidences swore, that he heard her say, That if she had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched her, if all the Devils in Hell could help her, she would bewitch her.</p>
            <p>She pleaded, she was innocent, and that those things that were sworn against her, were not true. My Lord asked her, if she did not speak those words: she acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged she did: but my Lord, said she, I am a passionate woman, and they having urged me, I spake those words in passion, my Lord, but I intended no such thing.</p>
            <p>She said of one of the Witnesses, whose name is <hi>Hakeing,</hi> and reputed to be a very sober man, that he had given himself to the Devil Soul and Body. My Lord Chief Justice asked her, How she knew he had done so; to which not being able to give any answer, my Lord cheked, and told her that she must not abuse the Witnesses at that rate. There was in all about Ninteen or Twenty Witnesses against Her. And the Tryal was near three hours long. The Jury having been some time out, returned and gave in their Verdict that she was not Guilty, to the great amazement of some who thought the Evidence sufficient to have found her Guilty; yet others who consider the great difficulty in proving a Witch, thought the Jury could do no less than acquit her.</p>
