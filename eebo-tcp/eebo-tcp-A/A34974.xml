            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT cannot be doubted but <hi>your Majesty</hi> has
of late been a great Sufferer, in being forced
to hear frequent and loud <hi>Triumphs</hi> for a
supposed <hi>Victory,</hi> which, by a <hi>Court-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
scarce an hour long, the <hi>English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
<pb facs="tcp:49048:3"/>
Church</hi> at one blow, and without any
resistance, pretends to have a gained over <hi>the
Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your sufferings were much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
when you saw the immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
effects of that and several other <hi>Sermons</hi>
of the like stile, which, <hi>by concert,</hi> at the same
time proclaimed distruction to that very
<hi>Christianity,</hi> which first expelled <hi>Paganism</hi>
out of our Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Majesty</hi> has oftentimes heretofore
been wakened and affrighted with such <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmes:</hi>
But then the <hi>Trumpets</hi> were blown
by men whose Profession and <hi>Religion</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to renounce all humanity towards us,
and all respect to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Whereas this
last unexpected <hi>blast</hi> proceeded from those,
who, even but yesterday, promised us, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for our common sufferings, a security
from those our common Enemies, whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and rage we only apprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God forbid</hi> we should be astonish'd, as if
some strange thing hapned to us, to see our
<hi>Religion</hi> persecuted: It is impossible it should
be otherwise, because the great Enemy of Truth
and Charity wil never be reconciled to live
at peace with either. Yet when we see so
<pb facs="tcp:49048:3"/>
wonderful and so sudden a change in formerly
professed Friends, when not only the <hi>hands,</hi>
but the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> are become the <hi>voice</hi>
and <hi>hands</hi> of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our selves, can neither find nor suspect any
demerit to provoke our <hi>Protestant Friends</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us; nor so much as imagin, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they can gain by our ruine, but rather
an apparent harm to themselves: This being
a <hi>Case of suffering,</hi> for the entertaining
which we have no <hi>Pattern</hi> to prepare us, and
for mitigating which, all rational means are
uneffectual, we cannot forbid our selves a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to wonder at it: Yet this great <hi>Blessing</hi> we
may reap from it, that thereby we are even
forced to our own happiness, by having recourse
for comfort and deliverance to <hi>God</hi> onely,
who, when the World goes farthest from us,
Himself approaches nearest to us, and looking
fixedly on him, we shall discover, by his Divine
Light, how our <hi>unexampled</hi> ingratitudes
have extorted from him <hi>unexampled</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</p>
            <p>So many years of oppressions, and such vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes
in them, have not diminished, much less
changed the constancy of our affections to
Creatures; we have passionately loved the
<pb facs="tcp:49048:4"/>
World, even when it was bitter to us; When
<hi>God</hi> called us to <hi>mourning</hi> and penitential
humiliations, we dissembled the taking notice
of it: In the midst of persecutions we conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in pride and vain jollities with our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors:
Yet now we see how mercifully <hi>God</hi>
deals with us, lest our former miseries should
prove beginnings of eternal ones, he has
brought upon us these new and unfore-seen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
for a last Tryal whether <hi>his mighty
hand</hi> can <hi>humble us,</hi> or no. He has seen
that the <hi>fideli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> we perform'd to our Temporal
<hi>Governors,</hi> and the charitable assistance we
afforded to our fellow suffring <hi>Brethren</hi> we
perhaps expected should be recompensed by
them in this life. Therefore he will have
us continue the same <hi>Duties</hi> more cordially,
now that we know and see that <hi>himself</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must be our reward. Our complaints and
prayers (which are so far from mitigating,
that they rather incense some spirits against
us) he will force us to addresse to himself one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
which if we do as we ought, and mend
our lives under his correction, we shal certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pacify him, and, when he sees it for our
good, conciliate men to us also; since for this
last, which onely can be doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, we have no
<pb facs="tcp:49048:4"/>
lesse engagement than that of his own Word:
<hi>When the waies of a man please our Lord,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 7.</note>
he will convert even his Enemies to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> these reflections I can with much
more assurance represent to <hi>your Majesties</hi>
consideration, because, though hitherto the too
common in sensibility of <hi>Catholicks</hi> to <hi>God's</hi>
Visitations, has been much aggravated by our
neglect to follow so Christian an example of
humiliation, penitential austerities, contempt
of worldly vanities, and delight in solitary
retraits to converse with <hi>God,</hi> as your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
has afforded; yet it is now at last to be
hoped, that in the present dispersion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Pastors,</hi> if your <hi>Majesty</hi> could joyn
your <hi>Authority</hi> with your <hi>Example,</hi> they both
together would prove forcible means to invite
all <hi>Catholics</hi> to a serious compunction for
their former miscarriages, to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not only of the justice, but even merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of <hi>our Lord</hi>'s Visitations, to a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in suffring for <hi>him,</hi> and an expectation of
deliverance onely from <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never certainly did <hi>our Nation,</hi> nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
any other afford two <hi>Catholic</hi> Courts
such perfect <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> in which there
are <hi>two such Mistresses,</hi> of most peculiarly
<pb facs="tcp:49048:5"/>
               <hi>Christian,</hi> though seldom found to be <hi>court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
vertues;</hi> such are <hi>Humility, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Penance, zeal for true Religion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanimity
in Suffrings, assiduous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
Devotions, &amp;c.</hi> But in a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so perverse as this, it must be somwhat
more then <hi>Example,</hi> that can render these
<hi>vertues fashionable</hi> abroad also. Insensible,
vain, tepid, and negligent <hi>Catholics</hi> must
see themselvs reprehended by the severity of
<hi>your Majesties</hi> looks, and if need be, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>your</hi> charitable reproofs. Bravery and
curiosity of Attires, precious time mispent in
vain Conversations and Visits, magnificence
in entertainments, dissolution in dancing, &amp;c.
are justly to be esteem'd <hi>crimes</hi> unpardonable
in those upon whom the <hi>hand of our Lord</hi>
lies so <hi>heavy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no joy now seasonable, nor indeed
excusable among <hi>Catholics,</hi> but a <hi>Joy</hi> in
<hi>suffring</hi> for truth and fidelity; For we never
had, till now, so comfortable a refreshment to
our afflictions. It is now made evident that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur only <hi>fault</hi> is that which is our greatest
<hi>glory.</hi> We are threatned more severely then
ever, whilst we are declared most innocent.
In former <hi>Edicts</hi> for execution of <hi>Laws</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:49048:5"/>
principal motives were a care for <hi>safety of
his Majesties Person, and the security of
the State and Government;</hi> Withdrawing
of Subjects from their natural <hi>Allegiance;</hi>
contriving of Seditious and <hi>Treasonable
practises;</hi> maintaining of <hi>rebellious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
&amp;c.</hi> were <hi>formerly</hi> our pretended
crimes. Such was the <hi>stile</hi> in which <hi>the late
desolating Parliament</hi> represented to our
most <hi>Excellent King</hi> of glorious memory, a
necessity of persecuting and destroying his
most faithful <hi>Catholic Subjects,</hi> when, God
knowes, both His safety and security of the
Government was at the same time in design,
and shortly after in effect, destroy'd only by
the <hi>Representers</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Treason</hi> is left out of our <hi>charge:</hi>
Nor is there any apprehension of the least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from us to his <hi>Majesties Person</hi> or the
State: Nay, so publickly and constantly have
we asserted the innocence of our <hi>Religion</hi> in
the Point of <hi>fidelity</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> and such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questioned
proofs thereof have we given by
our actions, that the <hi>Honorable Peers</hi> of this
very Parliament were in an immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of mind to antiquate all the <hi>Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Laws</hi> against us: <hi>God</hi> Almighty
<pb facs="tcp:49048:6"/>
give repentance and pardon to the unhappy
<hi>obstructors</hi> of that <hi>grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet for all our innocence, <hi>Preachers</hi> must
be satisfied: They cry aloud their fears of the
<hi>increase of Popery;</hi> when as, for one new-professed
<hi>Catholic,</hi> who forsakes their
<hi>Churches,</hi> hundreds of all other <hi>Sects</hi> relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
both their <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi>
too. They impute as a Crime to <hi>us,</hi> what all
other <hi>Sects</hi> impute to them, and themselves
glory in, that <hi>we receive our Ordinations
from Rome,</hi> that is, that we are not a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Sect,</hi> but <hi>members</hi> of the true <hi>Catholic
Church.</hi> For if there be indeed a <hi>Catholic
Church,</hi> Ordinations must be derived into
particular Countries from a <hi>Common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
and Fountain, otherwise the Cement of
Union and <hi>Subordination</hi> is dissolved.</p>
            <p>But what esteem our <hi>former Princes</hi> had
of this pretended Crime, will appear by a late
example given by his <hi>Majesty</hi> of happy
memory;<note place="margin">Sanderson's Hist. pag. 349. out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the House of Commons, 1640.</note> He had graciously reprieved a <hi>Priest</hi>

found guilty, as being a Priest only; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>This, <hi>MADAM,</hi> is our condition:
A condition, though, according to the World's
estimation, to be bewailed, yet if we look up
to Heaven, it is a condition to be triumphed
in. Now we are sure a reward in <hi>Heaven</hi>
expects us, since we are thus recompenced upon
<hi>Earth.</hi> It becomes us all therefore, bending
the Knees of our Hearts, to give infinite
thanks to our <hi>gracious God,</hi> since it is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
and confessedly for <hi>him</hi> onely, and
the <hi>Catholic verities</hi> revealed by <hi>him,</hi>
for the <hi>unity</hi> of his <hi>Mystical Body</hi> and the

This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is now our onely crime, and
this I am now actually committing, and am
so far from being asham'd [<hi>except only of the
imperfect manner of executing it</hi>] that I
have assumed the boldness to desire and hope
your <hi>Majesties</hi> approbation and <hi>defence</hi> both
of the <hi>crime</hi> and <hi>criminal Person:</hi> it is our
whole common Faith, delivered by God
to the Church, <hi>that both</hi> at Court, <hi>and
all over the Nation, has been</hi> publickly
traduced; <hi>some</hi> Doctrins <hi>have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to be</hi> contrary to the honour and safety
of the State; <hi>others to be</hi> Doctrins of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
<hi>all of them to be</hi> Novelties <hi>and</hi> usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations;
<hi>our whole</hi> Catholic Church is
made to pass for a <hi>Sect,</hi> a separated <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
congregation;</hi> But from what other
<hi>Church,</hi> neither can our <hi>Accuser</hi> tell, nor
any one imagin.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the present temper of the Times,
and delay of an Adversary appearing, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
the <hi>Preacher</hi> to think his <hi>Sermon</hi>
un-answerable, not for any weight in his
proofs, but, because it may be in his power
to reply with an <hi>Instrument</hi> sharper than his
<hi>Pen.</hi> Notwithstanding, as <hi>Prudence</hi> did
justly restrain that impetuosity, which <hi>zeal</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:49048:7"/>
               <hi>Gods</hi> truth might move in the hearts of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi>
to retort this <hi>Cartel of Defiance,</hi>
which he has published against <hi>His Church:</hi>
so to remain utterly silent after so many <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impressions</hi>
of that <hi>Sermon</hi> in several
forms and after such diligent <hi>Translations</hi> of
it into <hi>forraign Languages,</hi> after that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
avidity with which so many thousand
<hi>Copies</hi> of it have been snatched out of the
hands of the Readers, and from the Stalls of
the Sellers, this would be a confession of our
own guilt, and a distrust in our Cause, as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as his challenge and provocation has been,
this would be indeed to be ashamed of Christ
and his truth <hi>before men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reason, shutting my eyes to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
frights or discouragements, I presumed
to undertake an <hi>Answer</hi> to his <hi>Allegations,</hi>
hoping that some others of my Brethren would
do it with greater efficacy and fruit, than I
dare promise to this imperfect work: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this resolution, I took the boldness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<hi>your Majesties Name</hi> in the Front,
being assured that nothing could be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
nor a greater refreshment to <hi>your</hi>
most tenderly <hi>Christian heart,</hi> (which bears
an equal share in this our common oppression)

then to see that <hi>Faith,</hi> which you valew above

confidently hope, demonstrated to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced

With this perswasion, I most humbly
beg leave to cast at your <hi>Majesties</hi> feet both
<hi>my self</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> which, as it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,

               <p>Of Doctor Pierce's Sermon
in General: What was
probably the inward design
of it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot forbid my self
to wonder that a Book
so universally esteem'd,
so often reprinted, and
not only reprinted in
our own, but transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into foreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
should yet
lye open to so many and so plain Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Not one period can I find that seems
to me Extraordinary; Not one Instance
but has long since been often objected
both with closer Reason and neater Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick:
So that now by experience, as well
as faith, I see 'tis true that the Scripture
sayes,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The Race is not to the Wise, nor the
Battle to the Strong, nor favour to men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49048:9"/>
of Skill, but Time and Chance happens to
them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And are we not come to a fine passe,
when not onely a dozen perhaps of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and subtilest Controversies in Religion
shall be crowded into a short Sermon; but
exprest with such vanity and affectation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic
and abstruse Phrases, as if the end of
Preaching were nothing but to talk an hour
of hard things in harder words? Ask the
great Auditory of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Ladies,</hi> that
heard this <hi>Doctor</hi> (Persons of clear and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
apprehensions, who like good sense,
though not delivered in Greek, who pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into the connection of Things, though
they have not mis-spent their lives in studying
Words) Ask that Illustrious and Noble As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
what they think of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the
Emperor <hi>Zeno;</hi> or of the itching to be as old
as the <hi>Iulian period</hi> begun before the <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plast.</hi>
Some of them perhaps may have
heard of the <hi>Palladium</hi> of the Conclave; but
for the Embroidery of the <hi>Theopneust Aholiab,</hi>
or the Antiquaryes <hi>Keimeliah,</hi> I believe the
Ladies at least, were a little puzled on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
how to understand them; yet if those
pompous Sounds were translated into plain
English, not one of them but would easily see
the sense, without other Dictionary than
their own Cabinet.</p>
            <p>3. As for the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s profession in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
Dedicatory, <hi>That his Resolution was,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49048:9"/>
the Sermon should never have been expos'd to the
World, had not his Majesty commanded it.</hi> I
readily beleeve him; for a Victory is easily
and very cheaply got, if a <hi>Controversie</hi> be to
be decided by a flourishing Speech, confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounc'd by a Person in esteem for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Sincerity, in a Place where none
must contradict, especially when he protests
<hi>he has Proofs unquestionable</hi> for all his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions.
But till those Proofs be examin'd,
the Conquest is only over the Hearer's <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
not their <hi>reason:</hi> It may be, (and I pray
God this <hi>Sermon</hi> was not meant so) a good
preparation to usher in the <hi>Calvinistical zeal</hi>
for executing severities on innocent Persons,
who sincerely abhor the crimes deserving such
Rigors, and the unchristian Principles, the
Fountains of those Crimes: that is, on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against whom the <hi>Law-givers</hi> themselves
have publickly professed they never intended
those punishments. This kind of Iustice he
may hope for from his Sermon, but a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conviction will never be the effect of it.</p>
            <p>4. Truly <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> must not blame us,
if we fear he had some such thoughts in his
mind, when he preached this <hi>Sermon,</hi> so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the style of <hi>Court-Sermons</hi> in the
times of his <hi>Majesty</hi> of glorious memory, and
of the late (as he styles him) <hi>immortal Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</hi>
But have we since those dayes deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
such a change in the Tongues and Pens
of any <hi>Protestants,</hi> especially the Clergy?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49048:10"/>
By what crimes? Is it because we have ever
since been ready, and are so still, unanimously
to sacrifice our Blood and Fortunes for <hi>his
Majesty,</hi> by which also their Church hath
been maintained and setled against all the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
enemies both of monarchy and
It? Methinks they might forgive us this fault,
both for past and future: For we shall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it again, if they do not take care, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
us, to prevent it.</p>
            <p>5. This suspition of ours is much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
when we reflect on that bitter passage in
his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory,</hi> where he sayes, <hi>I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my discourse, however innocent in it self,
will yet be likely to meet with many, not only
learned and subtile, but restless Enemies; men
of pleasant insinuations, and very plausible
snares; nay such as ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> apt, where they have
power, to confute their Opponents with fire and
faggots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is possible his <hi>Sermon</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<hi>fall into some such hands:</hi> But, unlesse
he will renounce all Charity, justice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
he must not impute particular
mens actions to <hi>Catholic Religion,</hi> and, for
their faults, expose us to the common hatred
and violence. Let all the received <hi>Canons</hi> of
the Church be searched, and if one be found
that justifies the shedding of blood simply on
the account of Religion, he may have some
pretence for such an indefinite odious reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon innocent suffering Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49048:10"/>
Let all the practises of the World be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and it will clearly appear, 'tis not
<hi>Catholick Religion</hi> that's chargable with these
Excesses, since in so many places both they
are not, where it is; and are, where it is not.</p>
            <p>And, though for some few of these later
Ages, the Civil Magistrates of some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have exercis'd a greater severity, then
an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iently was us'd; Yet now even they have
entertain'd a more calm and tractable Spirit,
and seem to hope by other Arguments suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to secure their Religion. However,
why must our <hi>England</hi> imitate the rigidest of
other Nations, against whom, for that very
reason, we so loudly exclaim; rather than
the moderate proceedings of those, who are
nearer us both in scituation, temper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest?
Why thus continually be harping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one string that jarres, and never touch the
rest that move in harmony?</p>
            <p>6. Our late unhappy wars have made the
<hi>Preacher</hi> and many others besides him <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</hi>
We appeal to their consciences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
if they would be pleased to speak,
as Persons of honour and integrity; Did
they in any Catholick Countries, even
<hi>ROME</hi> it self (though here much spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
for cruelty) ever apprehend any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for their opinions, or refusal to joyn in
the exercise of <hi>Catholick Religion?</hi> so they
would abstain from publick scandalous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
to the Church, they had freedom not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49048:11"/>
only with all quietnesse to enjoy their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
but civilly to justifie their Doctrines.
All expressions of kindnesse, tendernesse and
compassion they received from their <hi>Catholick</hi>
Opponents, but surely not the least hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that might imprint terrour in their
minds.</p>
            <p>7. Thus much may be permitted us to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in our own Defence upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
gives us by the <hi>Preacher;</hi> especially, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
we are the onely persons expos'd to
the publick hatred and rigour, though we
onely, of all the Dissenters from the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom, least deserve it: For;
we are no Innovators, but Professors of
the same Religion that made this Nation
<hi>Christian.</hi> A Religion, though now too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
decryed, yet in those times confirmed
by great Miracles, as even Protestants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge:
A Religion, which for almost
a thousand years was onely known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
here. When the <hi>Reformation</hi> entred,
though almost all Subjects were <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
yet seeing the change was introduc'd by a
Supream Authority, no opposition was
made to it by any other <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes,</hi> but <hi>Prayers</hi>
and <hi>Tears:</hi> Whatsoever <hi>Treasons</hi> have been
acted by a few wretched persons, even our
Princes themselves have acquitted the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of <hi>Catholicks</hi> thereof, and our Religion
from allowing them. There cannot be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
any <hi>Formes</hi> of professing or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49048:11"/>
due <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to our <hi>Kings,</hi>
but we are ready to subscribe them in the
same sense that the most learned <hi>Protestants</hi>
themselves ordinarily say they intend them.
Publick atttestations of our fidelity and
zeal, in serving and defending our Princes,
and even the Religion of the Kingdom (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
destroy'd by a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of all other
<hi>Dissenters</hi>) have been made in our behalf, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by some, who now are most sharp against
us: Yet after all this, of them who are not
able to alledge any one of these excuses for
themselves some are rendered in a capacity to
Triumph over our Suffrings; unrepentant
Traytors are among our Accusers; though
it is known, the thing which most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
them, is our fidelity; their Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
how false soever, are believ'd, and
they hope to become popular for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to destroy us.</p>

            <p>1. THe <hi>Doctours Sermon,</hi> for as much as
concerns us <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
a double Design. <hi>First,</hi> Confidently
enough to assert that the Doctrines in which
we differ are on our parts meer <hi>Novelties,</hi> and
that <hi>Primitive Antiquity</hi> both of <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>the four first General Councils</hi> stands clearly
for <hi>Protestants. Secondly,</hi> In consequence to
this, that not <hi>they,</hi> but the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is guilty of <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As to the first Part he exemplyfies in
these following Points of <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi>
which he saies are <hi>Novelties,</hi> and undertakes
to calculate the precise time of their Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
1. <hi>The Supremacy of the Pope. 2. The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49048:12"/>
infallibility of the Church. 3. Purgatory.</hi>
4. <hi>Transubstantiation. 5. The Sacrifice of the
Masse. 6. Communion under one Species.</hi>
7. <hi>Worship of Images. 8. The Scriptures and
publick Divine Service in an unknown Tongue.</hi>
9. <hi>Invocation of Saints. 10. The forbidding
Mariage to Persons in holy Orders.</hi> 11. The
allowing Divorce for other causes besides Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>3. Then concerning the other part of
his general Design about <hi>Schism,</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that a real <hi>Schism</hi> there is, but that the
<hi>cause</hi> of it came from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which
made erroneous <hi>Novelties, new Articles of
their Creed,</hi> which errours the Reformers
were oblig'd in conscience to reject, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
them they did by warrantable and <hi>legal</hi>
Authority: So that though they separated
from the then present visible <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet they
ought not to be called <hi>Schismatics,</hi> but that
Church is to be esteemed <hi>Schismatical,</hi> which
caused them to separate.</p>
            <p>4. This is in grosse the substance of what
in his <hi>Sermon</hi> he alledges against Her, that
heretofore was this Churches <hi>Mother,</hi> and a
great proportion of whose kindnesse she still
enjoyes, the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> Now
considering with what triumphing applauses
this <hi>Sermon</hi> was heard, and with what a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
greedinesse thousands of the printed
Copies have been bought up, even by those
that formerly have not been curiously inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49048:13"/>
after <hi>Court Sermons</hi> for any good they
meant the <hi>Preachers.</hi> Would not Protestants
themselves in their hearts condemn <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> if, being confidently perswaded,
(as truly for my part I am) that there is not
so much as one single allegation among all
his replenish'd <hi>Margins</hi> that reaches home to
a concluding proof of what he pretends to,
they should out of a treacherous fearfulnesse
be utterly silent, as acknowledging that now
they have a prostrated cause. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it be but onely out of fear of losing
their good opinion, somthing must be said
by us to acquaint him with his mistakes.</p>
            <p>5. Now in my <hi>Remarks</hi> upon this <hi>Sermon,</hi>
I will follow his own order before summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down: And both in the Points of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Schism</hi> I will select his <hi>Arguments,</hi>
adjoining to each Point respectively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>Quotations</hi> or Authorities of Fathers related
to in the Margins: And having done this, I
will sincerely discover the grounds upon
which I think I can Demonstrate, That he
has neither rationally concluded any of our
<hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> to have been <hi>Novelties,</hi> nor
freed his own <hi>Church</hi> from the just imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And, knowing very well what candor,
sincerity and charity <hi>Almighty God</hi> requires
from those who undertake <hi>his</hi> cause, and the
cause of his <hi>Church;</hi> I do here call Him as a
witnesse upon my Soul, that my purpose is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49048:13"/>
studiously to avoid all cavilling distorsions
either of <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or the holy <hi>Fathers,</hi>
and much more those falsly called <hi>pia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
fraudes,</hi> corruptions of either: And both in
my Answers and Objections, I will alledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what I am perswaded is both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and efficacious to conclude that for
which it is produced, that is, I will bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as a proof, which I for the present think
can be answered.</p>
            <p>7. I am inform'd that he in his <hi>Sermon</hi>
made the like <hi>Protestation.</hi> If he did, I am
very glad for his own sake, that he forbore
to print, what he then spoke: because though I
must not charge him with wilful sincerity, yet
I believe he will find by this short Paper, that
he did neglect to make use of his best judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and caution, which certainly, if ever,
was most requisite, in a cause so important,
especially it being to be debated by one that
professed to supply the place of God himself
in his own House, and who spoke to no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Person than the KING, <hi>God's own Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the subject whereof was nothing but
Controversies, and such as his Text neither

            </argument>
            <p>1. VVHat <hi>ground</hi> or motive the
<hi>Preacher</hi> had to renew the vain
brag of <hi>Bishop Iewel,</hi> derided by his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi>
and condemned by his <hi>Brethren,</hi> it will
be lesse difficult for us to imagin, than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sincerely to acknowledge. However,
that, both that <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>He</hi> are singular in
this matter of challenging the concurrence
of Antiquity for themselves, and imputing
<hi>Novelty</hi> to the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> we have a
<hi>cloud of Witnesses</hi> among the first <hi>Reformers,</hi>
both in grosse and by retayl, through all the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49048:15"/>
particular Points by him mentioned.</p>
            <p>2. In general let him consider what <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
writes:<note place="margin">Melanct. in 1 Cor. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Presently from the beginning
of the Church, the antient Fathers obscured
the doctrine concerning the justice of Faith, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
Ceremonies and devised peculiar Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pet. Mart. 1. devotis. p. 477.</note>
In like manner <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> affirms,
<hi>That in the Church errours did beg in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the Apostles times:<note place="margin">Id. ib. p. 490.</note> And that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after their Age men began to decline from
the Word of God:<note place="margin">Id. ib. p. 476.</note> And therefore so long as we
insist upon Councils and Fathers, we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be conversant in the same errours.</hi> In so
much as <hi>Beza</hi> had the arrogance to write
thus in an Epistle:<note place="margin">Beza Epist. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eol. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I have said more than once,
and I suppose not without reason that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the antient times of the Church, even those
immediately succeeding the Apostles with ours,
they had better Consciences, but lesse Knowledge:
On the contrary, We have more Knowledge, but
lesse Conscience. This is my Iudgement, &amp;c.</hi>
These are esteem'd as learned Writers as the
<hi>Reformation</hi> had; They spent their lives in
reading and examining Antiquity, and were
as willing to make it speak on their sides, as
the <hi>Preacher</hi> was: But as <hi>ill Consciences</hi> as they
had, they were convinced and forced pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to confess that the <hi>Fathers</hi> were against
them, and focus.</p>
            <p>And in particular Opposition to his
Claim of Antiquity, (like <hi>Bishop Iewels</hi> for
the first six <hi>Centuries) Doctor Fulk</hi> is so far
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49048:15"/>
from concurring with him or <hi>Bishop Iewel,</hi>
that he is so choleric at the suspition of
such a charge, that he addresses himself to
his Adversary in this civil language;<note place="margin">Fulk in Rejoynd. to Bristow. page. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
saies he, <hi>if he charge me with confessing
the continuing of the Church in incorruption for six
hundred years next after Christ, he lyeth in his
heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. One passage there is of that famous
<hi>Andreas Duditius,</hi> which truly I cannot read
without extream compassion and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the dreadful judgment of God, and
it may do <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> much good, if he
sadly reflect on it. Many years he had lived
in great esteem for learning and prudence, a
<hi>Catholick Bishop</hi> of <hi>Petscben</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> called
<hi>Quinque Ecclesiae;</hi> present he was at the frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi> But
at last falling in love with a <hi>Maid of honour</hi> in
the <hi>Queen of Hungaries Court,</hi> to marry her, he
quitted both his <hi>Bishoprick</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> This
poor man in his declining Age could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from confessing in a <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Beza</hi> his
unsatisfaction in his <hi>new Religion,</hi> vainly
hoping some either <hi>Cordial</hi> or <hi>Opiate</hi> for his
distressed Conscience, from one as deeply
plunged, and by the very same motives enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the same change. I pray observe his
words:<note place="margin">Andre, Duditius in Epist. Theol. Beza. 1.</note> [<hi>Si veritas est,</hi> saies he, <hi>quam veteres
Patres, &amp;c.</hi>] <hi>If that be truth which the antient
Fathers, by mutual consent have professed, it will
entirely stand on the Papists side: For if heretofore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49048:16"/>
any Controversies out of a beat of Disputation aros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
between the learned among them, an end was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
imposed thereto by Decrees of Councils or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Pope alone. But what strange people
have we among us? They are alwaies wandring,
toss'd with every wind of Doctrine, and being hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the main Deep, they are carried some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this way, sometimes another. If you would
inform your self what their Iudgment to day is
touching Religion, you may perhaps come to know
it: But what it will be to morrow on the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
neither themselves nor you can certainly
affirm:</hi> Thus <hi>Duditius.</hi> And what <hi>Cordial</hi>
against this scrupulous Melancholly does
<hi>Beza</hi> his good friend afford him? Take it
from himself:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> [<hi>Scio speciosum esse venerandae
velustatis nomen,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>I know the name of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Antiquity is very specious: But whence
shall we fetch the beginning of that Title, but
from the Prophets and Apostles? For, as for Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that come after them, if we will take their
own advice, we will believe them on no other terms
but as far as they shall evidently make good what
they deliver, out of the Holy Scriptures:</hi> That
is in effect, have but the Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and humility to prefer your own sense of
<hi>Scriptures</hi> before all the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils of
Gods Church,</hi> and then nothing, they say,
need to trouble you: <hi>Antiquity, venerable
Antiquity</hi> will be on your side: You may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
say of all your <hi>Adversaries Doctrins,
From the Beginning it was not so.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49048:16"/>
4. Many other <hi>Confessions</hi> of the like nature
might be added: but for brevity-sake I will
content my self with onely one more, and
that is (as it seems to me) a secret acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in her
publick Liturgy, directly contrary to the
<hi>Preachers</hi> pretension and applications of his
Text, by which she, after a sort, imputes
<hi>Novelty</hi> to her self, and confesses the <hi>Roman</hi>
to be that Church which was <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
In the Order for Morning-prayer
there are these Versicles and Responds.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>O. Lord save the King.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Common-Prayer-book.</note>
            </p>
            <p>R. <hi>And mercifully hear us when we call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>Endue thy Ministers with righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>R. <hi>And make thy chosen people joyfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>O Lord save thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>R. <hi>And bless thine Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then follows a <hi>Versicle</hi> for <hi>Peace.</hi> Now
these, as almost all the other <hi>Prayers,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
translated out of the <hi>Roman Office.</hi> But
that which ought to be observed, is, That in
the <hi>Roman Office</hi> there is a <hi>Versicle</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond</hi>
immediately following these, and going
before the <hi>Versicle</hi> for <hi>Peace,</hi> which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Church</hi> has studiously left out; and that is
this,<note place="margin">Memento congregationis tuae Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>V. Be mindfull of thy Congregation (O
Lord.)</p>
            <p>R. Which thou didst possess from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49048:17"/>
Now the ground why this special <hi>Versicle</hi>
or Prayer for the <hi>Church</hi> was left out, is not
so mysterious, but it may be very probably
guess'd at.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first Reformers</hi> did not love to put
God in mind of that <hi>Church</hi> which was <hi>from
the beginning:</hi> Or rather they were desirous
the People should forget the <hi>Church</hi> which
was <hi>from the beginning:</hi> They had rather no
Prayers at all should be made for the <hi>Church,</hi>
than for one that was <hi>from the beginning,</hi>
because apparently that could not be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Church of England,</hi> whose <hi>beginning</hi>
themselves saw.</p>
            <p>5. Notwithstanding such plain Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these Pillars of <hi>Reformation,</hi> yet the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
confidently stands (with a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and abatement) to <hi>Bishop Iewel's</hi>
Challenge: He indeed mentions 27. Points,
of which 22. are about circumstantial matters
touching the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and two more of
them [<hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Ignorance is the Mother
and Cause of true Devotion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
2. And that the Lay-people (if he
speaks of them in general) are forbidden to
read the Word of God in their own tongue,]
are Calumnies. The other are three indeed
of the Preacher's points, <hi>viz. 1. Supremacy of
the Pope. 2. Worship of Images. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayers
in a strange tongue,</hi> though the
only fault he can find in this last, is, That the
later Church hath adhered too close to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49048:17"/>
that the hath not varied in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of her Devotions from her Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
and, after <hi>A. D.</hi> 600. continued to
say her Prayers in the same Language she
did before. But then this <hi>Bishop,</hi> (as being
somewhat better experienc'd in Antiquity
than <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi>) had not the confidence
in this his Catalogue to reckon as Novelties
either the <hi>Infallability of the Church, Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints, Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>Prayer for the
Dead, Celibacy of the Clergy,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice of
the Mass.</hi> So much more courage had the
<hi>Preacher</hi> than even <hi>Bishop Iewel</hi> himself.
Well, between both, all <hi>antiquity</hi> is for them,
and nothing but <hi>novelty</hi> on our side. No
doubt but his admiring and believing <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>
assured themselves that some never-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-examined
Witnesses, some hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
or un-observed <hi>Records</hi> had been found
out by their learned and confident <hi>Preacher,</hi>
to justifie their deserted claim of Antiquity, I
mean by way of aggression, and not simple
defence. But when the <hi>Sermon</hi> is publish'd,
nothing appears in the <hi>Text</hi> or <hi>Margins,</hi> but
Assertions and <hi>Quotations</hi> an hundred times
before produced, and as often silenced, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which too (as he explains them) have
no regard to the publick received <hi>Doctrin</hi> of
the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> but particular Opinions
of some <hi>Catholic Divines,</hi> as much disputed
against by other <hi>Catholics</hi> as by <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. However to qualifie a little the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49048:18"/>
that many <hi>Protestants</hi> have of their <hi>new
Champion,</hi> or <hi>Hyperaspista,</hi> as he calls it, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must be said thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hundred and one time
to old allegations and new mistakes. And
first, whereas in all points now in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, he so often repeats, <hi>From the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it was not so;</hi> He did very well to fix a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and conception of this word <hi>Beginning,</hi>
or a distinct measure of time after which only
whatever <hi>Doctrins</hi> are broached, ought in his
opinion, to be esteemed <hi>Novelties; Novelties</hi>
of so great importance, as to justifie a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the <hi>external communion</hi> of all <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
both <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western.</hi> And that is
the time of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and so downward, till
the <hi>fourth General Council inclusively:</hi> This
he has don not out of a voluntary liberality,
but because <hi>an Act of Parliament</hi> obliges him,
wherein it is said: <hi>That such persons, (Laicks
or Ecclesiasticks) to whom Queen</hi> Elizabeth

by the express and plain words of the said Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scriptures, or such as hereafter shall be

judged to be Heresy by the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
with the assent of the Clergy in their
Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. By this <hi>Proviso</hi> it appears, that, though
in words the <hi>Doctor</hi> is more liberal to us than
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and other <hi>Sects,</hi> who will
call all things <hi>Novelties,</hi> which they think are
not in <hi>express Scripture,</hi> yet the <hi>Law</hi> would
have allow'd him a greater extent, for the
might have enlarg'd the time beyond the <hi>four
first General Councils</hi> to any succeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
that (in the Opinion of <hi>Commissioners</hi>)
judged <hi>Heresy by express Scripture,</hi> or to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> judging after the
same manner: but we are content with, and
thank him for his allowance.</p>
            <p>8. Only he must give us leave to propound
a few <hi>Questions</hi> upon this occasion;<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> As first,
Does he submit only to the <hi>four first General
Councils,</hi> because they had an Authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in them obliging him thereto? Or
because he judged their <hi>Decisions</hi> conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God's express word? If the <hi>former,</hi>
then he must inform us, why only <hi>four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
have such authority, which it seems the
Church lost as soon as the <hi>Fathers</hi> at <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
rose? If the <hi>later,</hi> then he deludes us, and
with <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Quakers,</hi>
&amp;c. makes <hi>Scripture</hi> alone in effect th <hi>Rule</hi>
of Reformation, and <hi>Protestants</hi> only the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi>
of that Rule: Because the <hi>Statute</hi>
tyes no further to any <hi>General Council,</hi> than as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49048:19"/>
that <hi>Council</hi> is believ'd to proceed according
to <hi>express Scripture:</hi> which, whether it does
or no, who must be Judge, <hi>Doctor Pierce?</hi> To
answer this Question well will be a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece:
I am sure his late <hi>immortal Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
found it a Task too hard for himself, as
shall be seen before we part: <hi>too hard</hi> I say to
resolve so, that any rational man can be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with.</p>
            <p>9. A <hi>second Question</hi> is,<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> Whether to judge
of <hi>Heresy,</hi> that is to determin authoritatively
what is <hi>Heresy,</hi> and what is conformable to
<hi>Scripture,</hi> be not an Act of <hi>Iurisdiction
parely Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Pastoral?</hi> (though it
seems to reside notwithstanding sometimes in
Lay-Commissioners, but ordinarily in the
<hi>Parliament</hi>) And this not being possible to
be denyed, then he must be further ask'd,
since by one of the 39. <hi>Articles</hi> it is affirmed,
That <hi>General Councils may and have err'd,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>English judge of Heresy</hi> (be it the
King, as in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th and
<hi>Edw.</hi> the 6th. or the <hi>Parliament also,</hi> as in
<hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi>) be <hi>infallible</hi> or no? If he
acknowledge it <hi>infallible,</hi> he must resolve us,
whether the <hi>Supreme Temporal Authority,</hi>
with the assent of the <hi>Clergy</hi> be <hi>infalli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le</hi> only
in <hi>England,</hi> or in other Countrys also as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Swedland?</hi> &amp;c. If the former, he must
shew what Promises our <hi>Lord</hi> has made to
<hi>England</hi> alone. If the <hi>later,</hi> then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that that may, and certainly will be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49048:19"/>
and contrary to <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
which <hi>England</hi> it self confesses is not <hi>Heresy</hi>
beyond Sea. But if no such <hi>Authority</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>infallible,</hi> then it will follow, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions,</hi>
made by it, do not oblige in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and by consequence in his Opinion
there is no <hi>Spiritual Authority</hi> on earth that

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49048:20"/>
abolished, and that only to be confirmed,
which God instituted from the <hi>Beginning.</hi>
But he little considers that our <hi>Saviours</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>It was not so,</hi> signifies, <hi>It was directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
to SO,</hi> as if he said, You allow Divorces,
<hi>ob quamcunque causam,</hi> in manifest opposition
to God's Ordinance from the Beginning,
who said, <hi>Whomsoever God hath joyn'd, let no
man put asunder:</hi> This is therefore a Novelty
necessary to be reform'd. Now, if the <hi>Preacher</hi>
would have made use of this, indeed, perfect
<hi>Primive Rule of Refermation,</hi> he by his <hi>Text</hi>
was obliged to have produced from the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
that is either in Scriptures, or in the
Fathers within the <hi>four first General Councils,</hi>
some expresse Authorities and <hi>Decisions</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to <hi>Roman Doctrines,</hi> which
he calls <hi>Novelties:</hi> He ought to have quoted
out of Holy Scriptures, or some Councils
or consent of Fathers, such sayings as these:
1. <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Successors never bad nor
ought to have any Supremacy of Iurisdiction.
2. The whole Church is a fallible Guide, not to be
relyed upon against our private sence of God's
Word. 3. There is no state after death in which
Souls may find refreshment by the prayers of the
living. 4. The body of Christ is not substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present on the Altar. 5. There is no true
Christian Sacrifice 6. Both Elements are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to the Sacrament. 7. All respect to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
is forbidden. 8. Invocation of Sains is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
9. The Scriptures must be given into all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49048:21"/>
mens hands, without any certain guide to interpret
them. 10. Prayers not in a vulgar tongue, though
interpreted, are abominable. 11. To forbid the
use of Mariage to Priests is a Doctrine of Devils.
12. To separate Bed and Board among maried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though when, without danger of their lives,
they cannot live together, is a practice condemn'd
by our Lord.</hi> And after all, 13. <hi>To break the
visible unity of God's Church, for Doctrines and
Practises not in themselves causing Damnation, but
onely said to be false, is the Duty of every good
Christian.</hi> Such sayings as these had been to
some purpose, they would have been perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to his Text; But no such appear. On
the contrary, it serves his turn to say again
and again, <hi>From the Beginning it was not so:
This is the burthen of his Song:</hi> If he can shew
that, because this is the first time, we hear or
read such a Doctrine (mentioned in any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
writer) as <hi>Origen, Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi>
therefore it is a <hi>Novelty,</hi> it was never in the
Church before, the saies somthing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>But, let me ask him, was there no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
at all in the Church before it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Or was there no Doctrine in the
Church but what was written? And again,
is all that's written in any Age still Extant,
and come to our hands? Or do those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who first writ it, say, That they, or
their times first introduc'd it? No: On the
contrary, they expressly declaim against <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49048:21"/>
Noveltie</hi> is their <hi>Prescription</hi> against all
<hi>Heresies;</hi> So that for them to bring into the
Church any Doctrines not heard of, or not
received before, had been to profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> and there would not have
wanted other Fathers that would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
such Innovations: Which yet was
never done to <hi>Origen</hi> or <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Doctrines mentioned by the Preacher:
Whereas for other Errors they were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proscribed. From whence 'tis evident,
that, through the whole <hi>Sermon</hi> there is a
palpable misapplication of the <hi>Text,</hi> and that
the <hi>Preacher</hi> has been injurious to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
in making his just condemnation of the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> a warrant for him unjustly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
his Church. Indeed, in all matters
left indifferent, and no way commanded
from the beginning, nor contrary to any
Divine Revelation, the Church of later
times may vary, as she thinks sit, either from
the practice, or injunctions of the former:
For example, supposing <hi>Celibacy</hi> of the
Clergy, (the 7th, Point the Doctor instances
in) had not been practised or mentioned
from the beginning; yet, if God had not
commanded the contrary, and the thing in it
self be feasible (of which more anon) the
Church of a later Age may lawfully enjoyn
it: The Rule therefore holds only for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith and Divine Revelation. In
which 'tis true, That the Later times may
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49048:22"/>
not vary from the former; But yet, neither
doth the Rule hold in these, as to the <hi>express
terms</hi> of every Proposition that is matter of
Faith, but only as to the sense and substance.
It is not necessary that <hi>ab initio,</hi> God the Son
should be declared in expresse terms <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi>
with the Father, which was first put
into the Christians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reed by the Council
of <hi>Nice:</hi> But only that that Doctrine can
be shewed <hi>ab initio,</hi> which is identified in sense
with this: Nor can I think the <hi>Doctor,</hi> upon
second considerations, will offer to gainsay
so plain a truth.</p>
            <p>But it is now time to Examin the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

            <p>2, <hi>In contradiction to this Usurpation, he
adds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 17.</note> But from the beginning it was not so. For
we find in Scripture the Apostles were equally foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations

as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saies,<note place="margin">Page 18.</note>

any one Bishop to affect over his Brethren a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Power and Iurisdiction is a most impudent
opposition both to the Letter and Sense of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s

that rule over the Gentiles exercise Lordship

of Universal Bishop,</hi> a wicked, prophane,
and blasphemous Title, importing that the times of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49048:23"/>
Antichrist were at hand, <hi>&amp;c. Further adding,</hi>
That if any one Bishop were universal, there
would by consequence be a failing of the universal,
Church,<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> upon the failing of such a Bishop: Which
is an Argument <hi>ad homines,</hi> not easily to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
whatsoever infirmity it may labour with in
its self, <hi>&amp;c. And upon that occasion he
makes an excursion about the</hi> Pope's infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<hi>and his falling into Heresie, &amp;c. nothing
to the Point. Lastly, He concludes, that</hi>
Whosoever shall read at large the many Liberties of
the Gallican Church,<note place="margin">Page 21.</note> and the published confessions
of Popish Writers for more then a thousand years
together, touching the Papal Vsurpations, and
Right of Kings, he will not deny that the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Pope is but a prosperous Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>3. This is the substance of his Discourse
upon this Point of <hi>Novelty, the Supremacy of
the Pope.</hi> In answering which he must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me, yet without any prejudice to the
Cause, yea rather for a better clearing of it,
not to bind my self to his Order: Assuring
him, in the mean time, that I will not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
omit any thing material, either in his
Reasoning or Quotations.</p>
            <p>1. And first in general, he must give me
leave to tell him, that by the Conclusion of
the foregoing Discourse, he has entirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervated
all that went before. For by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and asserting, <hi>That the Gallican Liberties
and Popish writings against Papal Vsurpations
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49048:24"/>
do demonstrate that the Supremacy of the Pope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
but a prosperous Vsurpation:</hi> He clearly shows
that his fore-mentioned Reasons do not
touch the Catholic Cause at all: He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
those Writers to have been <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics:</hi>
None can deny the <hi>French Church</hi> to
be a Member of the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi>
acknowledged for such by the <hi>Pope</hi> himself,
and professing a subjection to him, as to the
Supream Spiritual Pastor of God's Church:
Therefore it is evident that what they deny
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> is not simply his <hi>Supremacy in
Spiritual</hi> matters, (which is all that will be
required of <hi>Protestants</hi>) but an extending of
that <hi>Supremacy</hi> beyond what they conceive the
received <hi>Ecclesiastical Canons</hi> do warrant:
(and this the <hi>English</hi> may as well be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to do as the <hi>French.</hi>)</p>
            <p>4. To the end therefore he may no longer
mistake this so important an Argument, I
will clearly set down the <hi>Churches Doctrine</hi>
concerning this matter. This Doctrine is
contained in that profession of Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
by <hi>Pius</hi> 4. and extracted out of the
<hi>Council of Trent.<note place="margin">Sess. 25.</note> I believe that the Pope is the
Successor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and Vicar of Iesus Christ
on Earth: I acknowledg the Holy Catholic, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolic
and Roman Church, as the Mother and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
of all other Churches.</hi> And more largely
in the <hi>Decree,</hi> with great circumspection fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the <hi>Council of Florence,</hi> and subscribed
by the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Floren.</note> We do define that the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolic
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49048:24"/>
See and Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> does enjoy a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
through the whole world; And that the
Same Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
Prince of the Apostles, the true Vicar of Iesus
Christ, the Head of the Vniversal Church; the
Father and Teacher of all Christians; and that in
the Person of St. <hi>Peter</hi> he hath received from our
Lord Iesus Christ full power to feed, rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the whole Church in such manner as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in the Acts of Oecuminical Councils and
the holy Canons.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Decision</hi> of the Council of
<hi>Florence:</hi> The substance of the Doctrine of
which Decree, (by which the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is acknowledg'd to have a
Jurisdiction over all Christians, to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Canons</hi>) is so received
even in <hi>France,</hi> notwithstanding all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
Liberties, that whoever denies it, will
not be esteem'd a <hi>Catholic.</hi> See what Cardinal
<hi>Palavicino</hi> writes touching the Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> and his <hi>French Bishops</hi> proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this <hi>Point</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This Jurisdiction the Preacher positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denies both to the <hi>Pope</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>It to be an impudent opposition both to the
Letter and sense of our Saviours forecited precept,<note place="margin">Page 17.</note>
Mark</hi> 10. But I heartily with Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>
would look well on this passage of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
once more, and ask his own reason,
though he should not be able to exclude all
the fumes of passion from it; Is Ecclesiastical
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49048:25"/>
Authority in Superiors, and Subordination
of Inferiors forbidden in this Text? Will
one that calls himself <hi>a Regular Son of the
Church of England,</hi> by vertue of this Text
pronounce the Sentence of <hi>Decapitation</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own pleasant expression) upon
his own Church, whosoever passes for the
Head of it, whether his <hi>Majesty,</hi> or my <hi>Lord</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury?</hi> On the contrary, I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that (not the affecting, but) lawful
exercising a <hi>Supremacy</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
is so far from being <hi>an impudent oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this Precept,</hi> that it is establish'd by it.
For in this very <hi>Text</hi> expresse mention is
made of some that are <hi>great,</hi> yea some that are
the <hi>chiefest.</hi> And if he would have adjoyn'd
the next Verse to his Quotation, he would
have published to the most ignorant of his
Hearers of Readers his manifest abusing this
passage of Scripture: Our Saviour immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
adding,<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 45.</note> 
               <hi>For even the Son of man came not
to be ministred unto, but to minister.</hi> Surely he
will not deny, but that our <hi>Saviour</hi> had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
yea a <hi>Supremacy of Iurisdiction</hi> over
the Church, and only here proposes himself
as a <hi>Pattern</hi> of humility to be imitated by his
<hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Successors.</hi> And what were
the <hi>Apostles? Church Governors</hi> without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
How then are they to imitate their
<hi>Supream Governor?</hi> In renouncing <hi>Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
Did he himself do so? By no means.<note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 5. 6.</note>
But as <hi>he did not glorifie himself to be an High

Priest: But he that said unto him thou art a Priest
forever after the order of Melchisedech:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and humility, consistent very well with

of Universal Bishop. It is not

            </argument>
            <p>1. HIs main Position in his forecited Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
on this Argument is: <q>
                  <hi>That
a Supremacy of Iurisdiction challenged and
exercised by the Pope, as Successor of St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>is a visible usurpation ever since</hi> Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<hi>the Third, to whom it was sold by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
Phocas:</q> 
               <hi>that is, it began about the year</hi>
606.<note place="margin">A. D. 606.</note> never before that time having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in God's Church. To prove
this, all the foregoing Reasons and Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are produced by him: From this <hi>usurpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Authority,</hi> his <hi>English Church</hi> (forsooth)
hath made a <hi>Secession,</hi> as he demurely Phrases
it, and not from any Authority (if any were)
exercised by former <hi>Popes,</hi> especially during
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49048:26"/>
the times of the <hi>four first General Councils.
A Primacy of Order</hi> he is content to allow him,
but by no means <hi>a Supremacy of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whatsoever <hi>Authority</hi> then the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the Third by consent
of other Churches enjoy'd, especially till the
end of the fourth <hi>General Council,</hi> he must
grant is no usurpation, and therefore a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
rightful Authority, from which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a formal Schism, they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves. He will not surely say with
one of their learned Bishops, <hi>That they take
from the Pope his lawful Christian Authority,
and give that (only) to the King, not his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
and Antichristian.</hi> So that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy</hi>
between us is reduced to this precise
point, <q>
                  <hi>Whether before</hi> Boniface the <hi>Third's
time the Pope enjoyed a Supreme Iurisdiction
over the Catholic Church.</hi>
               </q> This he denies.
On the contrary I here engage my self not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prove he had it, but moreover, that not
the least degree or <hi>Iota</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> will be
impos'd on them to acknowledge, for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Communion of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi>
more than the very same that <hi>Pope</hi> Boniface<hi>'s
Predecessors</hi> within the times of the <hi>four first
General Councils</hi> confessedly exercised. I may
adde, that the <hi>new usurped Title,</hi> (as he says)
<hi>sold to him by</hi> Phocas, did not give him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he pretend to by it, any more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than himself and his Predecessors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

enjoy'd. And this is I be able to make
good, then not all the water in the Sea will
be able to wash off his Churches <hi>Schism</hi>
by his own confession.</p>
            <p>3. Before I shew what <hi>Supremacy</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor's
of <hi>Boniface the Third</hi> exercised in
the Church, it will be convenient to enquire
into the Bargain that, He says, <hi>Boniface</hi> made
with <hi>Phoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Patriark</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Iohn,</hi> out of
an humor of lightness and vanity, proper to
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> assumed the Title of [<hi>Episcopus
universalis,</hi> or <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

or <hi>Bishop of the whole World:</hi> A <hi>Title</hi>
that the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> had in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
given to <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> but which his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi>
like't not. Certain it is that <hi>Iohn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
little more by it, but to be a distinction
of honor and preference above the other <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Patriarks:</hi> For whilst he took that <hi>title,</hi> he
still acknowledg'd the <hi>Pope's Superiority,</hi> not
only of <hi>place,</hi> but <hi>authority</hi> over him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Bishop</hi> in a City, wherein the <hi>Emperor of the
world</hi> resided, he thought it not unbecomming
him to be called <hi>the Bishop of the world,</hi> as the
<hi>Emperor</hi> was the Governor. Perhaps indeed
his <hi>Successors,</hi> (if this ambition had been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approv'd, or but conn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>v'd at by the <hi>West</hi>)
would have endeavour'd to make it not a
meer empty <hi>Title,</hi> but would have invaded an
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49048:27"/>
               <hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Title</hi> might seem to
warrant. Hereupon <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> and after him
<hi>Pope Gregory the Great</hi> did vehemently resist
this foolish ambition of <hi>Iohn,</hi> though the
<hi>Emperor</hi> himself, to gain a dignity to his own
<hi>City,</hi> favor'd it in him.</p>
            <p>4. Now the <hi>Arguments</hi> that these two
good <hi>Popes</hi> made use of against him, did not
so much combate <hi>Iohns</hi> present intention
(though his meer vain-glory and affectation
of <hi>Novelty</hi> deserved to be repressed) as the
probable consequences of such a <hi>Title,</hi> which
might argue, that besides himself there were
no Bishops in the <hi>Church:</hi> For if he were the
<hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> and the whole world his
<hi>Diocess,</hi> since by the <hi>Canons</hi> there can be but
<hi>one Bishop</hi> in a place, it would follow that all
others were only <hi>Bishops in name,</hi> and by
their Character had no other office but as his
<hi>Substitutes</hi> depending on his will, whereas
the <hi>Apostles</hi> received their Office and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
immediately from <hi>our Lord</hi> himself: And
so their Successors, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> would never
acknowledge a receiving their <hi>Episcopal</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and right of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> from any but
<hi>Christ</hi> himself. For, as in other <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
whoever administers Baptism, whether an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
or an <hi>Heretic, Baptismus solius Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>est,</hi>
says Saint <hi>Augustin:</hi> And again, <hi>Peter
and Iohn</hi> (sayth he) <hi>pray'd that the Holy
Ghost might come on those upon whom they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
their hands, they did not give the Holy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49048:28"/>
Ghost</hi> (Acts 8.) They, as his <hi>Substitutes</hi> apply
the outward Element, but the inward vertue
of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is administred only by <hi>our
Lord</hi> himself. And as a Subject that receives
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> will
not esteem he derives that <hi>Authority</hi> from the
Person, who presents him the <hi>Letters patents,</hi>
or invests him ceremoniously in the <hi>Office,</hi>
but only <hi>the King.</hi> So though a particular
<hi>Bishop</hi> be ordained by a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> a <hi>Primat,</hi>
a <hi>Patriarc,</hi> or by <hi>the Pope</hi> himself, and <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
given him, they indeed are the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> to convey his Characters and
<hi>Authority,</hi> they assign him the place in which
he is to exercise that <hi>Authority,</hi> but the <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Authority</hi> it self <hi>Christ</hi> only gives him.</p>
            <p>5. Upon these grounds <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> thus
argues.<note place="margin">Pelag. 2 Epist.</note> [<hi>Vniversalitatis quoque nomen,
&amp;c.] Do not give heed to the name of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
that</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Constantinople <hi>hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
usurped, &amp;c. For none of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks
did ever make use of so profane a Title:
Because if</hi> [the Bishop of Rome] <hi>the Supreme
Patriark be call'd an universal Patriark, the
Title would be taken away from the rest. But
God forbid this should happen, &amp;c. It therefore</hi>
John <hi>be permitted to take this Title, the honor
of all Patriarks is deny'd, and probably he, who
is called Vniv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rsal, will perish in his error, and
there will not be found one Bishop in the state of
Truth.</hi> The very same arguments he knows
St. <hi>Gregory</hi> makes use of in several <hi>Epistles</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49048:28"/>
both to the Emperor, to <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which being already produc'd by him
need not be repeated. Yet for all this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pelagius</hi> nor St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their detesting this <hi>Title,</hi> did therefore
quit their right to the <hi>Vniversal Pastorship of
the Church,</hi> and their <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> over all both
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Patriarks</hi> too: nay they assert it
in these very <hi>Epistles,</hi> wherein they are most
sharp against that Title, as shall be shew'd.</p>
            <p>6. The reason of this, 'tis manifest, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
does not understand: therefore let him
not disdain to be inform'd. The like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that is observ'd in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
he may conceive, is observed in the <hi>Catholic
Church:</hi> that is, that the same person may be
both a <hi>Bishop,</hi> an <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and a <hi>Primat;</hi> I
will add also the <hi>Supreme head of the Church,</hi>
as the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is among <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esiasticks:</hi> [For as for <hi>his Majestys Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Ecclesiastical affairs,</hi> it is not in this place
to be treated of.] Now my <hi>Lord of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
is just like other <hi>Bishops,</hi> merely a <hi>Bishop</hi>
in his <hi>Diocese of Canterbury:</hi> He is likewise a
<hi>Metropolitan</hi> in his <hi>Province</hi> to visit all <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
in it, but he is not a <hi>Bishop</hi> in the other
<hi>Dioceses</hi> subject to him; for in them none have
<hi>Episcopal</hi> right but only the respective <hi>Bishops</hi>
themselves, which are not removeable by
him, unlesse they incur crimes that by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>
deserve it. Lastly, he is a <hi>Primat</hi> over
<hi>both Provinces,</hi> that is, the whole Nation, yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49048:29"/>
without prejudice to the other <hi>Metropolitan,</hi>
in whose office of <hi>Visitation</hi> and <hi>Ordinations</hi>
he cannot interpose; though he have a power
to summon him to a <hi>National Council,</hi> &amp;c.
And in this regard he may be stiled the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Pastor of England,</hi> and, by being so,
makes the <hi>Church of England</hi> to be <hi>one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church,</hi> which otherwise would have
<hi>two Episcopal heads.</hi> Yet if any one should
stile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him the <hi>Vniversal Bishop of England,</hi> it
would not be endured, because he can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Functions properly <hi>Episcopal</hi> in no other
<hi>Province</hi> or <hi>Diocese</hi> but his own. By conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this well, the <hi>Doctor</hi> may more clearly
apprehend how matters stand in the <hi>Catholic
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. For, though this <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Vniversal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
taken in some sense, might draw after it
such ill consequences, yet being apply'd to
the <hi>Supreme Pastor</hi> of God's Church, it might
innocently signifie no more but such a general
<hi>Superintendency,</hi> as the Scriptures allow to
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Canons of the Church also
have acknowledged due to his Successors, and
with such an innocent meaning (as this Title
was used long before in the 3d. <hi>Act</hi> of the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> without any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the same Council to <hi>Pope Leo) Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
the Third did accept it from <hi>Phocas:</hi>
yet having done so, it seems to me apparent
that he neither exercised nor challenged the
least access of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> by it more than
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49048:29"/>
himself and his Predecessors had enjoy'd.
And of this the Doctor himself shall be
Judge. If he can find any proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
let him produce it, and I will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
recall what I have said.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, as appears in the <hi>History</hi> of the

was in that Council an earnest and constant

not because these denied to the <hi>Pope</hi> an

for this they willingly acknowledged;
but they opposed this Title only as the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> in the <hi>Predecessors</hi> of

(for then <hi>General Councils,</hi> would be useless)

the ground of the necessity of it, which

since <hi>General Councils</hi> (the only abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

the inconvenience of the long absence of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>

which only both <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>Indefectibility</hi> is

            </p>
            <p>3. Certain it is, that the antient <hi>Fathers</hi>
thought so, as shall be shewed. And because
new opinions arising do naturally cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and contentions, from what causes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they flow, and contentions are apt to
generate <hi>Schisms,</hi> since likewise <hi>Ecclesiastical
Lawes</hi> are made to be observed every where, if
any particular <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>Independent</hi> of the
whole, there could be no remedy against <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;</hi>
hence it is, that the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> do
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49048:31"/>
assert the necessity of a <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> and
assign thereto these <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. Either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
or at least silence Disputes about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
2. In those which are called
<hi>majores causae,</hi> (as wrongful Depositions of
Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) either by <hi>appeals</hi> or <hi>consultations</hi>
to restore the Persons wrong'd, and punish
the wrong-doers. 3. To take care that
<hi>Discipline,</hi> establish'd by received <hi>canons,</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where observ'd. 4. To judge when
there is a necessity of convening in <hi>General
Councils,</hi> and thereupon to summon all <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
and, as far as the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>common
Spiritual Father</hi> may extend, to oblige <hi>Princes</hi>
to permit their respective <hi>Bishops</hi> to meet.</p>
            <p>4. These things thus premised, now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Proofs demonstrating, that, before
<hi>Boniface the thirds</hi> time, suck like <hi>Acts</hi> of a
<hi>Supream Authority</hi> were practised by his <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,</hi>
and submitted to generally in the
Church. I must not write a Volume, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will select a few examples in all Ages,
which will at least recompence the <hi>Doctors
Anti-quotations,</hi> and when he shall require it,
many, many more shall be added.</p>

The Apostolic See is inform'd that <hi>John</hi> Bishop of

can we read of any Synod esteem'd to be ratified,
which was not establisht on the Apostolic Authority.
Therefore whatever you have decreed in your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

            <p>Again his,<note place="margin">A. D. 494.</note> not immediate, <hi>Predecessor, Pope
Gelasius</hi> is a yet more full and convincing
witnesse to the <hi>Popes Vniversal Iurisdiction,</hi>
upon this occasion. <hi>Pope Felix</hi> the <hi>second,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. D. 484.</note>
who possessed St. <hi>Peters Chair</hi> next before

by <hi>Peter</hi> an <hi>Eutichian,</hi> whom the
<hi>Pope</hi> in a <hi>Synod of 42. Bishops</hi> excommunicated.
Moreover, upon the complaints of the same
<hi>Iohn,</hi> he cited <hi>Acacius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
to appear: And upon his contumacy excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
him likewise in this Form: <hi>Take
notice,</hi> saies he, <hi>that thou art deprived of Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
honor, and Catholic Communion, and moreover,
that thou art segregated from the number of the

Yet this <hi>Sentence,</hi> not having been, as the
former was, denounced in a <hi>Synod,</hi> some <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Bishops</hi> found fault with it. Whereupon
his next Successor <hi>Pope Gelasius</hi> justifies his

               <note place="margin">Felix 2. in Ep. ad Episc. Dard.</note>
he shews that when any <hi>Heretic</hi> has bin
once condemned by a <hi>Synod,</hi> (as <hi>Sabellius,</hi> &amp;c.)
there was need of convoking new <hi>Synods</hi> for
the condemning his Followers: And that
this was the case of <hi>Acacius,</hi> who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Timotheus, Bishops of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,
Eutychians,</hi> which Heresie had been
condemned in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> In
consequence whereto he adds these Words:
<hi>Neither do we omit to signifie, which the whole
Church all the world over knows very well, that the
See of the blessed Apostle St.</hi> Peter, <hi>has a power to
loose whatsoever things shall be bound by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of any Bishops whatsoever, as being the
Church which has a right to judge every other
Church, neither is it permitted to any one to censure
its judgment: Seeing the Canons have ordain'd
that appeals should be made to it from every part of
the World.</hi> Are these now marks onely of a

this the <hi>Emperor saies is Secundum veterem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem.</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>That the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

            </p>

<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters, but by the advice of

that if the Preacher will be ingenuous, they

of them it will not be necessary, I should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
exactly the Order of times in each of
them. And the first shall be a passage of the

               <note place="margin">A. D. 345.</note> This
<hi>Council</hi> was by <hi>Iustinian called Oecumenical,</hi>
because, though the <hi>Eastern Bishops</hi> departed

were never rejected by them.<note place="margin">Concil. Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. <hi>can.</hi> 3, 4.</note> In the third

upon a proposal made by the famous

Controversies between Bishops which could not
be determined in their own respective Provinces,
the person aggrieved might appeal to the Bishop

should make such an appeal, till the Pope had
determin'd the cause, it was not permitted that
another Bishop should be ordained in his place.</hi>
These Decrees the Council made <hi>to honor the

            </p>
            <p>12. Now at this <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> is said to have refused the
subjection to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which St. <hi>Augustin</hi>
requir'd of the <hi>British Bishops.</hi> For what

a stranger to his person, or authority, or his

The <hi>Canons</hi> of this <hi>Council</hi> are directed to the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the first <hi>Canon</hi> in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49048:39"/>
these words, <hi>First concerning the Paschal
observation of our Lord,<note place="margin">Conc. Arlat. can. 1.</note> that it be observed by
us upon one day and at one time through the
whole world; and that according to custom thou
wouldst direct Letters to all.</hi> And moreover
in the head of the <hi>Canons</hi> is inserted this <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary</hi>
of their Epistle, <hi>To our most holy Lord
and Brother</hi> Silvester, Marinus <hi>and the Synod of
Bishops assembled together in the Town of</hi> Arles:
<hi>We have signified to your charity the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by common Council, to the end that all may
know what they ought for the future to observe.</hi>
Here may be seen a <hi>Patriarchical council</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Decrees</hi> to the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> as being
the chief person from whom all Christians are
to receive information of what they ought
to believe and practise, and by whom no
doubt they were to be obliged thereto. In
which regard St. <hi>Martin, Pope</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi>
makes this the <hi>Popes</hi> most proper <hi>Title,</hi> that
he is <hi>Custos Canonum Divinorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. At this <hi>Council</hi> were present three <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
Representatives of the <hi>British Clergy,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borius
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>York, Restitutus Bishop</hi> of <hi>Loni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don,
Adelphius Bishop</hi> of (<hi>Maldon,</hi> called then)
<hi>Colonia Londinensium,</hi> with <hi>Sacerdos, a Priest,</hi>
and <hi>Arminius, a Deacon.</hi> And the <hi>Canons</hi> of
this <hi>Council,</hi> were by <hi>Restitutus</hi> brought into
<hi>Britany,</hi> saith <hi>Bishop Godwin</hi> out of <hi>Bale.</hi> By
which also it appears that neither the <hi>Pope</hi>
himself, nor his place and authority in the
<hi>Church</hi> were unknown, nor un-acknowledged
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49048:39"/>
by the <hi>Britains</hi> long before St. <hi>Augustines</hi>
days.</p>
            <p>15. And now it will be seasonable to answer
the <hi>Doctors</hi> great Objection grounded on that
famous 6<hi>th. Canon</hi> of the first <hi>Nicene Council,</hi>
by which he says, <hi>Every Patriarch and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is appointed to be chief in his proper Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese,<note place="margin">Serm. pag. 18.</note>
as the Bishop of Rome is chief in his.</hi> This
is now to be examin'd. The words of the
Canon are, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.] <hi>Let
the antient Customs be still in force in</hi> Egypt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conc.</hi> Nicen. 1. can. 6.</note>
Lybia, <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis, <hi>that the Bishop of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria
<hi>enjoy a Iurisdiction over them all:
In as much as such likewise is the custom of the
Bishop of</hi> Rome. <hi>In like manner both in</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
<hi>and other Provinces, let the [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]
priviledges be preserv'd entire to every Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. The true sense of this Canon will best
appear from the end for which it was enacted,
and that apparently was for the regulating
and composing disorders begun in <hi>Egypt</hi> by
<hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lycopolis,</hi> who rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refused obedience to the <hi>Patriark</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
presuming to ordain <hi>Bishops</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on him. This <hi>Scismatical</hi> attempt
the <hi>Council</hi> here represses, commanding <hi>that
according to the antient custom the Bishop of</hi>
Alexandria <hi>should have entire Iurisdiction
through all</hi> Egypt, Lybia, <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis; And
the Roman Bishop in his Patriarchat, and
may say in his Metropolitanship too is made
the Patern according to which this Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49048:40"/>
is framed not in regard of his plenary
right, and universal Jurisdiction in the Church
of God, which (I have shewed already, and shall
demonstrate the same yet further, even in the
times preceding this Council) is extended to
the whole world, and was exercised over the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Patriarcs themselves, But only of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and practice of his calling Synods,
correcting manners, and making ordinations
according to his Patriarkal and Metropoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Jurisdiction: for those words in the sixth
<hi>Nicene Canon, Similiter autem &amp; apud caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

not only Patriarkical authority, but Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
also is spoken of in this canon, and the

4. The <hi>other</hi> is extant in the same St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
who endeavour'd to peswade the <hi>Pope</hi>
to depose <hi>Marcianus</hi> a <hi>Metropolitan Bishop of

6. Having proceeded thus far, our last step
shall be to the utmost degree, the very <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
it self, our <hi>Lord</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</hi>
And here we will acknowledge what
the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctor</hi> saies, that all the <hi>Twelve Apostles
were equally foundations of the Churches building:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. page. 18.</note>
               <hi>That the same Authority which was first given to
St.</hi> Peter <hi>alone, sustaining the person of the whole
Church, was afterward given to the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
that as St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>saies, the same that
St.</hi> Peter <hi>was, the rest of the Apostles likewise
were [pari consortio praediti, &amp;c.] endowed with
an equal participation of honor and power. And as
St.</hi> Hierom <hi>affirms, that all Bishops in all places
whether at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Eugubium, [Canterbury
<hi>or</hi> Rochester] <hi>are of the very same merit,</hi> &amp;c.
But he will give leave to the Scripture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it self, and to the Fathers to interpret
both it and themselves. We grant therefore
that <hi>all the Apostles, and all Bishops</hi> their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
enjoy the whole latitude of <hi>Apostolic</hi>
and <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction,</hi> for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>internal, essential qualifications</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But for the external administration
there may be, and alwaies was acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a subordination and different latitude in
the exercise of the same authority both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> Let him not
find fault with this distinction; for they
themselves have occasion somtimes to make
use of it to the like purpose. <hi>Arch-bishop
Whitgift,</hi> in his Defence of the Answer to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49048:44"/>
Admonition, affirms, that <hi>Archbishops, quoad
Ministerium, do not differ from other Pastors, but
touching Government,</hi> page 303. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
page 386. Answering the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who equals the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Bishop with the Pope, he saies, <hi>that they are
equal quoad Ministerium, but not quoad polittam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Let him take therefore an example il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating
this at home. What Function,
what <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> can my <hi>Lord of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
exercise (I mean according to their
Tenets) which the meanest of his subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Bishops</hi> cannot perform? He can ordain
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests;</hi> So can they; the former
with him, the other without him. He can

can give the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by <hi>Confirmation;</hi> So
can they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He can assemble a <hi>Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;</hi>
They a <hi>Diocesan.</hi> He has a <hi>Canonical
Authority</hi> over <hi>Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. They over <hi>Priests.</hi>
He can absolve from <hi>Censures</hi> inflected by
himself; they can do as much. Yet nothing
of all this excludes him from enjoying a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
priviledge in the exercise of every one of
these <hi>Acts</hi> and Functions, or exempts them
from Subordination to him as their <hi>Superior,</hi>
yea, <hi>Supream Pastor, Supream</hi> not in <hi>Order</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> Certainly the <hi>Doctor</hi>
can easily apply this to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Successors,</hi> and
all other <hi>Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Now if the <hi>Fathers</hi> may be believed, is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49048:44"/>
was a <hi>priviledge,</hi> and a great one, that St
<hi>Peter,</hi> for the merit of his Confession, had
<hi>Christs</hi> own Title, as <hi>Christ</hi> was Governor of
the Church, given him, of being called a
<hi>Rock.</hi> For in the <hi>Syrian</hi> language, in which
our Lord spake, the words have no different
termination, as in the Greek or Latin, <hi>Petrus,
Petra;</hi> but the words were, <hi>Thou art Gepha</hi> (a
Rock) <hi>and upon this Gepha</hi> (Rock) <hi>I will build my
Church.</hi> It was a <hi>priviledge</hi> that <hi>Peter,</hi> neither
the eldest, nor first chosen <hi>Apostle,</hi> is alwaies in
the Gospel first reckoned, and expresly called,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the First. It was a <hi>priviledge</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a greater latitude of <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> when
after our Lord's Resurrection, St. <hi>Peter</hi> alone
had in the midst of the rest a Commission
given him of indefinitly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeding <hi>Christ's
Flock;</hi> And after the Descent of the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> was peculiarly appointed the <hi>Apostle</hi>
of the <hi>Circumcision,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> Yea that the <hi>Dedication</hi> of St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
Office was performed by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who by
immediate revelation was appointed to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the first fruits of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his house-hold,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>9. But, why among such Governors as the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> was any <hi>Supereminency</hi> of <hi>Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
given to one man? Certain it is, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was lesse necessity to provide against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
and dis-unions, then among the
<hi>Apostles;</hi> every one of whom was guided by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49048:45"/>
a <hi>Divine</hi> unerring light, by which they knew
all Truth, and replenish'd with the <hi>Spirit of

               </gap>:
Yet a <hi>Subordination,</hi> not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to them, was established among them,
for the succeeding Churches sake, which
without such order would in a very short
time become a meer <hi>Babel.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
saies,<note place="margin">Hierom. cont. Jovin. lib. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Church was built upon</hi> Peter: <hi>though
true it is the same thing is done upon others, and
that the strength of the Church equally rests upon
all. But among the twelve one is chosen, that a

be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. <hi>To the same purpose St.</hi> Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cypr. de unit. Ecclesiae.</note> 
               <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Sentence produced by the

<hi>Paul</hi>'s contesting with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and resisting him
to his face, argues that he did not acknowledge any
Superiority in him:<note place="margin">August. lib. 2. de Bapt. cont. Donat.</note> 
               <hi>Let St.</hi> Augustin, <hi>from St.</hi>
Cyprian, <hi>resolve us,</hi> You see <hi>(saies he to the</hi>
Donatists) what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath said, that the
holy Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom did shine forth so
great a grace of Primacy, being reprehended by St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> did not answer that the Supremacy belong'd
to him, and therefore he would not be reprehended
by one that was posterior to him. <hi>And he adds,</hi>
The Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath left to posterity a more
rare example of humility,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> by teaching men not to
disdain a reproof from inferiors; then St. <hi>Paul</hi> by
teaching inferiors not to fear, resisting even the
highest, yet without prejudice to Charity, when
Truth is to be defended.</p>
            <p>12. From all that has been said on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it will necessarily follow, that whatever
<hi>Superiority St. Peter</hi> enjoyed, and the <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
acknowledged, was the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49048:46"/>
only, a gift far more beneficial to us
then to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> He was, as St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
saies, <hi>Master of the World,</hi> not because his
<hi>Throne</hi> was establish'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> but receiving
from <hi>our Lord</hi> so supereminent an Authority,
he therefore made choice of <hi>Rome</hi> for his <hi>See;</hi>
because that being the Imperial City of the
World, he might from thence have a more
commodious influence on the whole Church.</p>
            <p>13. Upon which grounds, whensoever
the <hi>Fathers</hi> make use of the Authority of his
Successors, <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Hereticks</hi>
or <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> they consider that authority
as a <hi>priviledge</hi> annexed to the <hi>Chair of St. Peter,</hi>
and only for St. <hi>Peters</hi> regard to the <hi>Sea</hi> of
<hi>Rome.</hi> This is so common in the <hi>Fathers</hi>
writings, that I will not trouble him with
one Quotation. Indeed <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
when he would invade an equality [<gap reason="foreign">

in some sort with the <hi>Pope,</hi> did
wisely to mention only the <hi>priviledge</hi> of the
<hi>Imperial City,</hi> because he could allege no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretention for his <hi>Plea.</hi> But St. <hi>Leo,</hi>
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> St. <hi>Gelasius,</hi> &amp;c. produce their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
for their Supremacy from <hi>Tues Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus,
&amp; super hanc Petram,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>Pasce oves

of the <hi>Milevitan Council,</hi> writing to <hi>Pope
Innocent</hi> to joyn with them in condemning
the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> tell him their hope was those
<hi>Hereticks</hi> would more easily be induced to
submit to his Authority: Why, because of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49048:46"/>
the splendor of the <hi>Imperial City?</hi> No, but
because the <hi>Popes Authority</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. Ep. 92.</note> was [<hi>de Sancta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Scripturarum authoritate deprompta</hi>] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Authority of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>14. I might with reason enough, yet I
will not omit to take notice of <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi>'s
trivial reasonings <hi>against the Popes,</hi> (as he
calls it) <hi>pretended Headship;</hi> because such
being sitted to vulgar capacities, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
pronounc'd, do more mischief, then
those that have more shew of profundity and
weight. Thus then he argues: <hi>If the Pope
be head of the Church, then the Church must be the
Body of the Pope:<note place="margin">Serm. Pag. 20.</note> And if so, then when there is no
Pope, the Church has no Head: When there are
many Popes, the Church has many Heads: When
the Pope is Heritical, the Church has such a Head
as makes her deserve to be behe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever advantage the <hi>Doctor</hi> expects
from such a Discourse as this, it must flow
from a childish Cavil upon the word <hi>Head,</hi>
and whatever consequences he here draws
from thence against the <hi>Pope,</hi> may as well be
applyed to all kind of Governors, whether
Ecclesiastical or Civil: For they are all Heads
within their Precincts: A <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of
his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and a <hi>Bishop</hi> of his <hi>Diocesse.</hi> When
we call therefore the <hi>Pope, Head of the Church,</hi>
we mean that among all <hi>Governors</hi> thereof,
he is the <hi>Supream</hi> in the sense before declared:
He is a <hi>Head,</hi> but not so as <hi>Christ</hi> is in respect
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49048:47"/>
of his <hi>Mystical body,</hi> who by his <hi>Spirit</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
quickens and directs it. The <hi>Pope</hi> is
only an <hi>external, ministerial, visible Head,</hi>
and, as it were, <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, no question, the <hi>Doctor</hi> knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be our meaning: and by consequence
he knew that his inferences from thence were
pitifully pedantic, &amp; insignificant, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his <hi>Court-hearers</hi> and <hi>Country-readers</hi>
perhaps wonder there can remain a Papist in
<hi>England</hi> unconverted after such a <hi>Sermon</hi> has
been publish'd.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>When there is no Pope,</hi> says the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Church wants a Head.</hi> It is granted:
For sure he does not think it is a part of our
Faith to believe Popes are immortal. But yet
for all that the Papacy is immortal: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is not dissolv'd: Succession is not
interrupted. It is a Maxim in our Law that
<hi>Kings dye not,</hi> that is, the Regal Authority
lives, though Kings in their particular persons
dye: Nor is there any substantial difference,
as to this point, between hereditary and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Monarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in this sense we may
say, that Popes dy not, nor Bishops: Partly
because when a Bishop or the Pope dys, at
least his Jurisdiction remains in the <hi>Chapter</hi>
or <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Electors.</hi> Hence it is that in <hi>St.</hi>
Cyprian we read <hi>Epistles</hi> of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi>

There has been oft times a long <hi>vacancy</hi> in
the <hi>Apostolic</hi> See, as well as in <hi>Dioceses</hi> and
<hi>Kingdoms.</hi> After the death of <hi>Pope Fabian</hi>
(before there were any <hi>Christian Emperors)</hi>
the <hi>See</hi> was <hi>vacant</hi> for above a years space:
yet neither did <hi>St. Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>St. Augustin,</hi> when they objected

neither did any old <hi>Hereticks</hi> make use
of such an argument to invalidate the <hi>Popes
authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. But what shall we say to the <hi>Doctors</hi>
next inference, in a case of <hi>Schism? when there
are many</hi> Popes, <hi>then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> says he, <hi>the Church</hi> is
become a Monster <hi>with many Heads.</hi> But he
is deceived. As when, after the death of a
<hi>King,</hi> several pretenders to the <hi>Crown</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
there is still by right but one <hi>legitimate
Successor:</hi> all the rest are <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Tyrants.</hi>
It is so in the Papacy.<note place="margin">Cypr. Epist. 76.</note> In that case <hi>St. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Rule holds, <hi>If the Church be with</hi> Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<hi>it was not with</hi> Cornelius, <hi>who by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ordination succeeded</hi> Fabian. Novatian
<hi>therefore is not in the Church, nor can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
a Bishop</hi> (of <hi>Rome.</hi>) Or if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
to which of them the right pertains,
so that some Nations adhere to one Head, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

to another: it is a great calamity: but
yet the <hi>Church</hi> remains, though wounded,
yet not wounded to death: <hi>A General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
cures all.</p>
            <p>17. If the <hi>Pope,</hi> (according to <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi>
his supposition) <hi>should</hi> prove an <hi>Heretic,</hi> he
infers very improperly, <hi>that the Church ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
such a Head as makes her deserve to be beheaded:</hi>
For in that case, the <hi>Pope</hi> is so far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
a <hi>Head,</hi> that he is not so much as a
Member of the <hi>Church,</hi> but is deprived not
only of the <hi>Administration,</hi> but also the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church,</hi> as other <hi>Heretical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
are: So that then there is a pure <hi>vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
I shall not be so severe as to take notice
of the unhansom (not to say unmannerly)
terms the <hi>Doctor</hi> uses in expressing the last
branch of this Objection.</p>
            <p>18. Thus much concerning the <hi>Doctors</hi> first
pretended <hi>Novelty</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> the
<hi>Popes primacy.</hi> Now whether my asserting that
<hi>Primacy</hi> or his denying it to be a <hi>Novelty,</hi> and
whether his <hi>proofs</hi> or mine are more conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I leave to the Readers consciences. He
will excuse my dilating on this Point, because
therein I follow his own example,<note place="margin">Epist. Ded.</note> for he tels
<hi>his Majesty, He has spoken most at large of the
Popes supremacy</hi> and his reasons given for such
Largenesse shall be mine too, though I believe
we shall have different meanings, yet without
equivocation, even when we deliver our <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
in the same words. For i. <hi>I also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

the Popes supremacy to be the chief, if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hinge on which does hang the stress of</hi> (more
than <hi>Papal) the Ecclesiastical Fabrick,</hi> as being
the <hi>Cement</hi> of the <hi>Churches unity.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 2. Because it
is a point wherin</hi> (say I likewise) <hi>the Honor and
safety of his Majesties Dominions are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi>
His meaning is, that no danger is to be
apprehended for <hi>England,</hi> but only from that
Point. I am sure, on the contrary, that whilst
such a <hi>Primacy</hi> purely spiritual was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> here was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
torn in pieces with <hi>Schisms,</hi> nor poyson'd
with Heresies: The <hi>Throne</hi> was never in the
least danger upon that account; never was a
Sword drawn for or against it. Some few
little more than Paper-quarrels hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Roman Court,</hi> about
matters, not of Religion, but outward Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests:
in which generally the <hi>Pope</hi> had the
worst at last: But the <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of these
<hi>Dominions</hi> were far from being prejudiced.
The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> always have been, and stil
continu as jealous and tender of their <hi>temporal
Regalities,</hi> as ever any Princes were: yet they
account it one of the most sparkling Jewels of
their <hi>Crown,</hi> that they call themselves <hi>the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
[and most devoted] <hi>Sons of the Catholic
Church.</hi> The acknowledging the <hi>Spiritual
Primacy</hi> of the chief <hi>Pastor</hi> they find a greater
honor and defence to them than many Armies
would be: because it preserves peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in that Kingdom, not by the terror of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49048:49"/>
Swords drawn and Muskets charged in their
Subjects faces, but by subduing their minds
and captivating their consciences to <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Obedience.</hi> And let <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
without a Spiritual Authority, which
may have influence on the hearts of Christian
Subjects, all their <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> too
will prove but shaking Bulwarks for suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>19. But we must not yet leave this passage
without considering it a little better. He saith,
<hi>That in the point of the Popes Supremacy of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
the honor and safety of his Majesties
Dominions are most concern'd:</hi> his meaning is,
that it is both <hi>dishonorable</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to
his <hi>Majesties</hi> Dominions, that any of His
Subjects should be permitted to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
such a <hi>Supremacy.</hi> I would I could
oblige the <hi>Doctor</hi> by any <hi>exorcisms</hi> to discover
sincerely the inward thoughts of his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject. But, having no such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
at so great a distance, I must be content to
argue the Case with him once more, because
it is a passage, that reflects not only upon the
honor of <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> but the safety of
all <hi>Professors</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>20. He cannot be ignorant, how often and
how earnestly <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> here have
protested their renouncing any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the least degree of <hi>Temporal
power</hi> or Jurisdiction as of Right to belong to
the <hi>Pope,</hi> over any Subject of his <hi>Majesties;</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49048:49"/>
It is therefore meerly a pure <hi>Spiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
that they acknowledge in their <hi>Supreme
Pastor.</hi> Is this now dishonorable? Is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe?
To whom? To all <hi>Supreme Princes,</hi>
whether <hi>Catholics,</hi> or not? For <hi>Catholic
Princes,</hi> they protest against this Opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of dishonor or danger; If only then to
other <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>States</hi> which are dissenters
from, and enemies to Catholick Religion,
then <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Diocletian</hi> had reason and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
on their sides, when they persecuted a
<hi>Religion dishonorable</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire:</hi> For evidently, neither St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
nor any other <hi>Apostle,</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> but were,

in the guilt, for which he desires the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics

that they will not so much as allow him any

like may be said of <hi>other Sects,</hi> which though
they are not guilty of the <hi>Presbyterian tyranny,</hi>

or Kingdom, that a purely Spiritual authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should be acknowledged in <hi>him,</hi> to whom
this whole Kingdom from its first conversion
to Christianity together with the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world submitted it self as to their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Pastor?</hi> And is it <hi>Honorable,</hi> that the
<hi>same authority</hi> should be granted to more
than twenty of <hi>his Majesties</hi> own <hi>Subjects?</hi>
Again, is it <hi>unsafe</hi> that <hi>Canonical obedience</hi>
for <hi>Christian Vnity's</hi> sake should be professed
to <hi>one Venerable Prelat</hi> a 1000. miles off, and
is there <hi>no danger</hi> in making the same <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to so many at home, who, besides their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
authority,</hi> have a right to concur in the
enacting and executing <hi>Civil laws</hi> too; and

who, we see, can either exalt or depresse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            <p>2. To resolve such Questions, as these,
but also so to resolve them as becomes a <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel of peace</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> would be a
subject worthy the stating in a <hi>Court-Sermon.</hi>
But it must be don without transgressing the
precise limits of the <hi>question,</hi> that is, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the state of <hi>Catholic Religion</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
and practised, for example, in <hi>France,
Venice, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. with the reformed
Religion in <hi>England;</hi> the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy of the former with that of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and then judging whether of the two
bring more security and honor to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and are more effectual upon the <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
of <hi>Subjects</hi> to breed them up in peace
and obedience. For my own part, simply <hi>as a
Catholic,</hi> my desire and prayers are, that Gods
divine truth may prevail in all our hearts,
but so prevail by those wayes of Charity, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Justice and Piety with which it first
conquered the World. And <hi>as a Subject of
the Crown of England</hi> my Prayers are, that we
may be all united in the profession of that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Religion, which more perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for some Ages. 5. Yea, the whole Church

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rse,</hi>
he will sure acknowledge that all
Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Christianity agree in this, that each
of them has both a <hi>Rule</hi> of their Faith, and
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> also: But in both these there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
among them. To the <hi>Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
Anabaptists, Quakers, Socinians, &amp;c.</hi>
the only <hi>Rule</hi> is the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> But both
<hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>English Protestants,</hi> though they
acknowledge <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> to be their
only <hi>Rule,</hi> yet they admit certain universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received <hi>Traditions,</hi> besides expresse <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But as for the <hi>Guide</hi> from which we are
to learn the true sense of this <hi>Rule,</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
among the said Sects is far greater,
and more irreconcilable. The <hi>Socinians</hi> will
have Scripture interpreted onely by private
<hi>reason,</hi> a <hi>Guide</hi> evidently <hi>fallible,</hi> and therefore
not to be imposed on others. The <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
Anabaptists, Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
too, pretend to an <hi>Infallible Guide, Gods Holy
Spirit;</hi> but with this difference, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> rationally
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49048:53"/>
acknowledge that this <hi>Guide</hi> is only to direct
those that have it, and perceive they have it,
but cannot oblige other men that have it not,
nor can be sure they have it. Whereas
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> by an unexampled <hi>Tyranny</hi>
(at least in <hi>France</hi>) do oblige themselves and
their Posterity to a Profession, that by a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Illumination</hi> they are taught to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Canonic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> from <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal,</hi>
and by the same <hi>Guide</hi> to justifie all
the Doctrines by which they dissent from all
others: And moreover, by a most senslesse
inhumanity, will impose a necessity on all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to belie their own Consciences, and
acknowledge the same <hi>Guide;</hi> though they
have never wrought any Miracles, which
certainly are necessary to oblige others to
believe and follow the internal Guidance of
that <hi>Spirit</hi> to which they pretend.</p>
            <p>4. As for Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> and the generality of
<hi>English Protestants,</hi> (I speak of them now, as
hitherto they have bin, for what they must be
hereafter, neither they nor I know a special
Guide of theirs, beyond <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi>
for the finding out the sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
judging of <hi>Traditions</hi> received by them, is
the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> or <hi>foure first General
Councils:</hi> But since those ancient Fathers
are now past speaking, and their Writings are
as obnoxious to <hi>disputes</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
themselves, a speaking Judge of the sense of
all these, I suppose, is their <hi>Ecclesiastical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49048:54"/>
or <hi>Bishops,</hi> when <hi>Synods</hi> are dissolved:
but principally those that are to make, and
determine the sense of <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi>
And upon these grounds they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged to behave themselves different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to several adversaries. For against <hi>Sects</hi>
that went out from them, they use the help
of <hi>Catholick</hi> weapons, the <hi>Authority of the
Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch, Councils, &amp;c.</hi> But against <hi>Catholics,</hi>
they (renouncing the Authority of the present
Church in her Supremest Councils, of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which the times are capable, and (in
the interval of Councils) in the major part of
the Governours thereof united with him,
whom themselves acknowledge the prime
<hi>Patriark</hi>) will make use of a kind of private
spirit or reason; or the judgment of a most
inconsiderable number of <hi>Church-Govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs,</hi>
going against the whole Body of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and their chief Pastor, but this, as to
assent only, where it likes them, and so will
be their own selves Judges of what is the
sense of Councils, Fathers, Scriptures and all:
And great difficultie they often find how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
being accounted <hi>Papists,</hi> when they
speak to Sectaries, and being even <hi>Fanaticks</hi>
when they Dispute with <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
And truly the <hi>Doctors</hi> whole <hi>Sermon,</hi> is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
meerly <hi>Fanatick:</hi> For though he florish
with Greek and Latin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quotations of Fathers
joynd to Scripture, which they do not; yet
since there is no visible Judge talk'd of in it,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49048:54"/>
but himself, that is able to speak; What is
this but <hi>private spirit,</hi> having little measure
of the gift of Tongues more than <hi>Quakers</hi>
have? So that let them preach as much as
they will, the result of all Dispute between
them and us must come to this, <hi>Whether their
last speaking Iudge in</hi> England, <hi>or ours in the
whole Catholic Church, deserves better to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
and rely'd on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It cannot be deny'd but that there is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Truth</hi> in all these Sects. The <hi>Guide</hi>
which each of them respectively layes claim
to, is a justifiable Guide, though being alone
not sufficient. For 1. To exclude <hi>Reason</hi>
from guiding us, would be to become Beasts.
2. To exclude <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> from directing us,
would be to cease being <hi>Christians.</hi> 3. To
renounce the <hi>Testimony of Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of <hi>General Primitive Councils,</hi> would
be an arrogant temerity unpardonable.
4. And last of all to deny a judging deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
power to the present visible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
I mean those Governors and Synods
which are Superior, in respect of all other
Governors or Synods Inferior, would be to
make all <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> justifiable.
Therefore not any of these <hi>partial Guides</hi> must
be neglected: Yet unlesse they all concur,
that which we take to be <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and the <hi>sense of the Primitive Church</hi> may
deceive and mis-guide us.</p>
            <p>6. Now, it is only the Roman Catholic
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49048:55"/>
Church, whose <hi>en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re</hi> Guidance proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from
all these, and the effect of which Guidance
in full satisfaction to each mans Soul, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
peace in Gods Church: which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
cannot possibly flow but from a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all these Guides. Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics
admit <hi>Reason</hi> to judge of the sense of
Scripture, (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do:) but they
give due bounds to Reason, nay they silence
it quite, when it would presume to judge of
incomprehensible Mysteries, and reject them
because <hi>Philosophy</hi> cannot comprehend them.
When Reason has found out the sense of
Scripture, they with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and
even <hi>Fanatics,</hi> acknowledge it is <hi>Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
that moves the Soul to assent thereto,
and embrace the verities contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
directing their actions accordingly.
But because the Devil can transform himself
into an Angel of Light, neither can there be
any Guide more dangerous then false Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
they conclude that all such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Inspirations are indeed Diabolical Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
which are prejudicial to Honesty,
Virtue, Piety, and the common Rules of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
both Spiritual and Civil; All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations
which which incite private, uncommissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
persons to reform either Churches or
State; all that nourish Factions or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
in the Common-wealth: All that
beget <hi>Pride,</hi> and an opinion of self-sufficiency,
or an humor of censuring others, especially
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49048:55"/>
Superiors. In a word, whensoever <hi>the spirit
of single Prophets</hi> refuse to be <hi>subject to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the Prophets,</hi> that is, Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
such Inspirations in Catholic Religion
are rejected, detested, and sent back to the
Infernal Father of them.</p>
            <p>7. Moreover, Roman Catholics do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and confidently appeal to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, the four first General Councils,
and the holy Fathers. But universal experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
demonstrating it impossible, that any
writing can end a Debate between multitudes
of persons interessed, and therefore not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
or indifferent, <hi>their last recourse</hi> is to
the <hi>present visible Church;</hi> which cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
her sense to us in any other way then as
she is represented by her <hi>Pastors</hi> out of all
Nations, that is, by a <hi>General Council.</hi> All
Catholics, submiting to this Council, not
their tongues only, but also their judgments,
by following the Church thus with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
shew, that they are guided both by <hi>Reason,
Inspiration,</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Primitive Fathers.</hi>
Hence St. <hi>Austin</hi> sayes, <hi>We receive the Holy
Spirit if we love the Church, if we rejoice in the
name of Catholics, and in the Catholic Faith.</hi>
And elsewhere, <hi>[Contra rationem nemo sobrius,
&amp;c.] No sober man will admit an opinion against
Reason, no Christian against Scriptures, no lover
of peace and unity, against the Church.</hi> And this
only is the Guide that we say, and presently
will demonstrate to be <hi>infallible.</hi>

8. Now, that the <hi>final Decision</hi> of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in Faith, can only be expected from
such a Guide, and consequently that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
under pain of damnation, are obliged
never to contradict this Guide, and alwaies to
assent when it requires, we are taught, not
by Reason only, but God himself also, and
this in the Law of <hi>Moses. The whole Nation
of the Iews,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Augustin) was as it were
one great Prophet;</hi> the policie of their Church
was the Scheme of the Christian, to the
twelve Princes of their Families answer'd the
twelve Apostles, to the Seventy Elders
the Seventy Disciples, to the several Courts
of Judgement, our Ecclesiastical Synods, to
the great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> a general Council, and
to the High Priest, our Supreme Pastor. Now
for our present purpose, the Ordinance that
God made in the Jewish Church for deciding
Controversies about the Law, ran thus, <hi>If
there arise a matter too hard for thee in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Deut. 7, 8, 9.</note> &amp;c.</hi> (that is, as we find in 2 <hi>Chron.

and Commandment, Statutes and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then shalt thou arise and get thee into the
place which the Lord thy God shall chuse: And
thou shalt come to the Priests and Levites, and
to the Iudge that shall be in those dayes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and they shall shew thee the sentence of
Iudgement, and thou shalt do according to the
sentence which they shall shew thee, &amp;c. Thou

and will not hearken to the Priest,
or unto the Iudge, even that man shall die, and
thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those words in this passage [<hi>unto the Iudge
that shall be in those daies</hi>] <hi>Ainsworth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ainsworth in Deut. 17. 9.</note> out
of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> observes, that if the high
<hi>Synedrion</hi> had determin'd of a matter, &amp; after
another <hi>Synedrion</hi> rose up, which (upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
seeming good unto them) disannulled the
former Sentence, then it was disannull'd, and
Sentence passed according as seemed good to
<hi>those later;</hi> So that the <hi>present Authority</hi> was
alwaies to take place, and no <hi>Appeals</hi> to be
made from it. For if any Disputes against
the Sentence of <hi>living speaking Iudges,</hi> upon
any pretence whatsoever, either of a private
exposition of the <hi>Law,</hi> or the Authority of
preceding <hi>Rabbies</hi> were allow'd, there would
never want Contentions and Schisms in the
<hi>Synagogue.</hi> And observe that in this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was implyed an assent or submission of
Judgment: For otherwise it would be against
Conscience, in case the party continued in a
contrary opinion of the sense of the Law. It
is just so, and alwaies has been so in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church:</hi> The present Superiors living
and speaking must conclude all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
their Interpretation of Scripture and
Fathers, their Testimony of Tradition must

particular Persons or Churches, it must also

the Penalty of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> or cutting
off from the Body of Christ, which answers
to a Civil death in the Law.</p>

Infallibility are the words of Truth, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the <hi>promises of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Eternal

               <hi>Truths</hi> necessary or expedient to be known:

yet he may be in a sort <hi>omniscient</hi> within a

ignorance or error in teaching such special
verities as God will have him know, and has
promised he shall faithfully teach others.
Our Saviour, as man, was certainly infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and as far as was requisite, omniscient too:
So were the Apostles likewise, whose wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<hi>Protestants</hi> acknowledge both to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>
and to contain <hi>all Truth</hi> necessary to
Salvation. Good Doctor, do you think it a
contradiction that God should bestow an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
as to some things, on a Creature?
What did our Saviour give St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he
said, <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not?</hi>
Thus the Doctor, may see what a trifling Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
he has made against Gods Church.</p>
            <p>12. Now, the <hi>infallible promises</hi> of <hi>our
Lord</hi> to his Church, by vertue of which she
has alwaies been believed to be in our sense
<hi>infallible,</hi> follow: At least as many of them
as may suffice for the present purpose. 1. <hi>Our
Saviour</hi> has promised his Apostles,<note place="margin">Math. 28. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That he
would be present with them alwaies to the end of the
World:</hi> Therefore since not any of them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd
that age, this infallible promise must be
made good to their <hi>Successors.</hi> 2. He has
promised that <hi>When two or three of them meet
together in his Name,<note place="margin">Math. 18. 20.</note> he will be in the midst of them;</hi>
Surely to direct them. Therefore much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49048:58"/>
more when the whole Church is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatively
assembled about his businesse
onely. 3. <hi>He has promised that he will lead
his Church into all Truth;</hi> at least all that
is necessary or but expedient for them to
know.<note place="margin">Math. 16. 18</note> 4. He has promised, that <hi>Against
his Church, built upon St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the Gates
of Hell</hi> (that is Heresie, say the Fathers)
<hi>shall not prevail:</hi> Therefore it shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
free from <hi>Heresie.</hi> 5. He has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that,<note place="margin">Math. 18. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Whoever shall not obey his
Church, shall be</hi> (cut off from his Body)
<hi>as a Heathen and a Publican:</hi> Therefore
<hi>Anathema's</hi> pronounced by his Church are
valid. Our Lord indeed speaks of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
made by a particular Church in
quarrels among Brethren: Therefore if
Disobedience to such Decisions be so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
punished, what punishment may
we suppose attends such as are disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

(call'd by the Apostle, <hi>The Pillar and

13. All these Texts and Prmises we by
the example of the Holy Fathers and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Tradition, produce as firm Grounds
of an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Universal Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,
which has an influence over the

               </gap> requiring much more than an
external submission, which yet is all that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
will allow to the most authentic gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils. We hope now <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi>
will not fly to <hi>Mr. Chillingworths</hi> miserable
shift, and say that all these <hi>Promises</hi> are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conditional and depending on the piety of
Church-governors: For this is contrary to
the assertion of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which from
these <hi>Promises</hi> argues invincibly against all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics</hi>
and <hi>Schismatics,</hi> who might otherwise,
on <hi>Mr. Chillingworths</hi> ground, alledge (as
the <hi>Donatists</hi> did) that the Church by the
sins of some had lost all her Authority, and
that Gods spirit was transplanted from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves. Nor yet that he will use the
plea of several other Protestant Writers som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more discreet, who are willing to allovv
those Promises absolute, and to belong also
to the Guides of the Church som or other,
that they shall in all ages continue orthodox,
but not alvvayes to the more superior, or to
the greater bodies of these assembled in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
(because, thus, they see their cause will
suffer by it.) But this plea also is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying;
For whenever the superior and
subordinate Church-Officers, or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Courts shall contradict or oppose one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
here the superior questionlesse is to be

promises, where they cannot possibly agree to

            <p>14. These promises now being <hi>Yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
the <hi>Doctor</hi> must not seem to make our
Lord passe for a Deceiver, but apply them
to his English Protestant Church, since he
will not allow them to the Catholic, for to
some Church they must be applyed. But let
him consider withal, he must condemn St.
<hi>Gregory,<note place="margin">Geg. M. l. 1. Epist. 24.</note> who professed that he venerated the four

(which is more dangerous) the <hi>Act of

the <hi>Fathers</hi> in those <hi>Councils</hi> did pronounce
many <hi>Anathema's</hi> against all those that would
not submit to a belief of such and such <hi>Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of theirs, in some of which were new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. Now I ask <hi>Doctor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49048:59"/>
Pierce,</hi> were those <hi>Anathema's</hi> lawfull? were
they valid? Or will he say, those first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
(to which he professes assent) usurped
an Authority in this, not of right belonging to
them? If those <hi>Anathema's</hi> were valid, then
the <hi>Councils</hi> had a just authority to oblige
Christians to an <hi>internal belief</hi> of verities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by them, as the sence of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and this, under the penalties of being
separated from Christ: And can any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
but such as <hi>is infallible</hi> lay such an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon Consciences under such a penalty?
But, if those <hi>Anathema's</hi> were illegal and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
then were the <hi>Fathers</hi> both of those <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
and of All others, who still followed the

Millenary opinion, the one that interpreted
the reign of <hi>Martyrs</hi> with Christ for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years, in base, sensual pleasures, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
and women: This was the Doctrine
of the unclean <hi>Heretick Cerinthus,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi>

deservedly detested by the Church. But there
was another Opinion, that the <hi>Martyrs

validly under the penalty of being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from Christ, since it is manifest that she
so proposes the said particular Doctrins, not
in her Councils onely, but universal practise,
wherein her Infallability is with an equal

having some reason to doubt that in
case any of his <hi>Novelties</hi> be omited, he, or
at least some of his over-credulous <hi>Readers</hi>

               <note place="margin">Serm. p. 8.</note> which he says, <hi>We
have from</hi> Origen, <hi>or at the farthest from</hi>

<hi>mend the matter by deriving it from</hi>
Virgil, Tully, <hi>or</hi> Plato<hi>'s</hi> Gorgias.</p>
            <p>3. It would have been a great courtesie
both to his <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Readers,</hi> if he had
inform'd them why he singled out a specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Point touching <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of far greated importance, because
obliging to Practise also, which is <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

doubtlesse does not want a <hi>Mystery:</hi> And he
must give me leave to answer his <hi>Novelty</hi> of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> by speaking scarce any thing at all
of it, but only telling him nakedly the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Doctrin about it; and by insisting on the
confessed Antiquity, <hi>Apostolic Antiquity</hi> of
<hi>Prayer for the Dead;</hi> which being cleared, I
defie all his learning and skill, unlesse he can

It is not in vain that the Apostles have instituted
this Law, That during the celebration of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

more expresly in another place,<note place="margin">Id. hom. in 1 Cor. c. 15. v. 46.</note> 
               <hi>We must</hi>
(saith he) <hi>give our help and assistance to sinners
departed, by our Prayers, Supplications, Alms, and
Oblations: For these things were not rashly and
groundlesly devised: Neither is it in vain, that in
the Divine Mysteries we make mention of these
who are dead; and approaching to the Altar, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
our prayers for them to the Lamb placed there
who took away the sins of the World: But we do
this to the end that some comfort and refreshment
may come to them thereby. Neither is it in vain
that he who assists at the Altar at the time when the
dreadful Mysteries are communicated, cries out,
Pray for all that are dead in Christ, and for those
who celebrate their memorials. For were it not
that such commemorations were profitable to them,
such things would not be spoken. For the matters
of our Religion are no sport: No, God forbid.
These things are perform'd by the Order and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Gods Spirit.</hi>

10. True it is, that antiently in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Liturgies a commemoration was made
even of the greatest Saints, yes, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were made for them: But yet not such
prayers as were made for the imperfect. But,
since all future things may be the subject of
our prayers, it may become our charity to
pray for accession of glory to Saints already
glorified, but which at the Resurrection
shall be in a yet better State. And therefore
when St. <hi>Austin</hi> saies, <hi>It is an injury to pray for
a Martyr, since we ought rather to commend our
selves to his prayers:</hi> he means such prayers,
as we make for imperfect Christians, that is,
for remission of their sins, refreshment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>11. Now, tho' some such prayers extant
in the Holy Fathers did regard the day of
Judgment, and the glory ensuing; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that they thought, to some Souls a
present refreshment did accrew in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
condition, is evident both by the
foresaid Testimonies, and many more that
may be added: As where St. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would never cease his Intercessions for the
Soul of the dead Emperor? till he found a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
by them. This is so apparent both

would be no absurdity if we should confesse,<note place="margin">Spal. l. 5. cap. 8.</note> that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49048:66"/>
some lighter sins which have not in this life
been remitted</hi> (quoad culpam) <hi>as to the guilt
or fault, may be forgiven after death, and
this somtimes a little after the departure of the
Soul, &amp;c. by vertue of the Churches interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It cannot be denied, but that there
are among the Holy Fathers great varieties of
Opinions touching some particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
regarding the state of Souls after
death, and at the present some differences
there are between the Roman and Greek
Church. In which notwithstanding it will
appear to any who will compare them, that
the Roman Doctrin is far more moderate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable,
and approaching to the grounds
of Protestants, than that of the Eastern
Church. But however, it is without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,
that all Churches who professed
Christianity before the Reformation, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
unanimously in the practice of praying
for the Dead, so as to beg forgiveness of
sins, a bettering of their state, an asswage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their sufferings, &amp;c. Which practise
they esteem not a voluntary offering, but a
duty, to a necessary performance of which,
charity obligeth all Christians. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
English Protestants cannot be excused
for their neglect of this duty, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the Doctrin upon which this
Practice is grounded, is not mentioned at all
among those Points which they account No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49048:66"/>
in the Roman Church. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the more learned among them have
and do, though not in expression, yet in sense
agree with Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> conceding in his
Reply to <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <hi>—That for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
doth he not mean here, for offering the
Christian sacrifice of the Holy Eucharist for
them, for what is more manifest in Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

is to be said against it. No man can deny, but
it is very antient.</hi> Since then the Church
cannot be thought, from the most antient
times thereof, to have offered up to God all
her prayers in all ages <hi>pro defunctis</hi> in vain,
methinks I cannot here, but in this respect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
commiserate the condition of those poor
Souls, who depart hence un-owned by that
Church, and without any share in her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(which only like a true Mother, is so sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
and carefull a Supplicant not only for
her living, but also deceased children) and
who, after a life here not so well spent, seeing
themselves going hence only with an inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
repentance, &amp; an unperfect reformation,
and very unprepared to be immediatly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in that place of bliss, and glorious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
into which no impure thing shall enter,
yet are content rather to lose the benefit of
the daily prayers and oblations for them of
this careful Mother, than to render themselves

And surely much more uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49048:67"/>
must such a death be, that is void of the
hopes of any such assistance, than theirs is,
who, departing hence in the bosom of the
Church, and in this blessed communion of
Saints with the request of St. <hi>Austins</hi> dying
Mother in their mouth,<note place="margin">Aug. Conf. l. 9. c. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Illud vos rogo, ut ad
Domine altare memineritis mei: This I beg of
you, that at the Altar of our Lord ye make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me:</hi> are sure to enjoy the last
aid of this pious charity, and also the yet more
efficacious sacrifice of the Altar to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
offered to God in their behalf.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Lastly, to omit particular Quotations out
of the antient</hi> public Liturgies <hi>of the</hi> Church,
<hi>that of St.</hi> Iames <hi>acknowledged by the</hi> second
General Council, <hi>that of</hi> St. Basil, St. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
&amp;c. <hi>in every one of which are expresse
prayers and oblations for the Dead, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pardon of their sins, refreshment of their
sufferings, &amp;c. I will conclude with a full
convincing Testimony of St.</hi> Augustin,<note place="margin">Aug. Ser. 32. de verb. Apost.</note> 
               <hi>whose
words are these,</hi> That by the Prayers of the
Holy Church, and saving Sacrifice, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by Alms expended for their Souls, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Brethren are helped, that God may deal
with them more mercifully than their sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
not to be doubted. For this the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church observes as a Tradition of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that for those who are dead in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Body and Blood of our Lord, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
should be made, when at the holy Sacrifice
their Names are in their due place rehearsed,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49048:67"/>
and that it should be signified that the Offering is
made for them. And when out of an intention
of commending them to Gods mercy, works of
Charity and Alms are made, who will doubt
that these things help towards their good, for
whom Prayers are not in vain offered to God?
It is not therefore to be doubted but that these
things are profitable for the Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet only such
as before their death have lived so, as that these
things may profit them after Death. <hi>And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. Enchirid. c. 110.</note>
For Martyrs the Sacrifice is offered
as a thanksgiving, and for others as a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>14. The Doctor cannot but know in his
Conscience, (for he is no Stranger to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)</hi>
what a great Volume may be written
to confirm this: And that not one expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be quoted against it. Therefore
whereas he said without any ground, that
<hi>Tertullian borrowed from Montanus;</hi> I would
ask him, From whom did he borrow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of this charitable duty to the <hi>Dead,</hi>
but from the <hi>Heretie Aerius?</hi> Nor is this to
be considered as a voluntary courtesie don
them, which without any fault may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
On the contrary <hi>St. Epiphanius</hi> will tell
him,<note place="margin">Epiph. l. 3. haer. 75.</note> 
               <hi>the Church does these things necessarily,
having received such a Tradition from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
And <hi>St. Augustin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de cur. pro mort. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>we must by no means
omit necessary Supplications for the Souls of the
Dead: For whether the Flesh of the dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
lye here, or in another place, repose ought to
be obtained to his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49048:68"/>
15. If these Souls were believ'd to be in
<hi>Heaven</hi> would it not be ridiculous? If in <hi>Hell</hi>
would it not be impious to offer the dreadful
Sacrifice, to make Supplications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be at
charge in Alms for the obtaining them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
pardon of their sins, refreshment of
their sufferings, a translation into the region
of Light and peace, and a place in the bosom
of <hi>Abraham?</hi> But if they be neither in Heaven
nor Hell, where are they then? He cannot deny
a third place, unless he thinks them anihilated:
He will not say that third place is <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
because the Church calls it so. But suppose
the Church dispence with him for the Name; I
would to God he would accept of such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation;
one pretence of <hi>Schism</hi> would
quickly be removed.</p>
            <p>16. To conclude; If all the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of
the Church, all the <hi>Fathers</hi> have not credit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with him to perswade that this is no
<hi>Novelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet greater <hi>Antiquity</hi> for it he may
find in the <hi>Iewish Church:</hi> an expresse Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for which we read in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees:</hi>
He will say it is not Canonical: at
least let him acknowledge it not to be a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:</hi>
and however, the universal <hi>Tradition</hi>
and practise of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> will justifie it.
From the Jews no doubt <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed this
Doctrin, and from <hi>Plato Cicero,</hi> and from
both <hi>Virgil.</hi> Nay even natural reason will
tell him, that Heaven, <hi>into which no unclean
thing can enter,</hi> is not so quickly and easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49048:68"/>
to imperfect Souls, as to perfect: nor have
we any sign, that meerly by dying, sinful li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
becom immediatly perfect.</p>
            <p>17. To fill his learned Margins, he quotes
certain <hi>Contradictors</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> as the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rochester, Polydor Virgil, Suarez,</hi> and
<hi>Thomas ex Albiis;</hi> but since both <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
himself and all his Contradictors agree with
the Church, in contradiction to the Preacher,
that <hi>there is a Purgatory;</hi> what other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could he have to mention them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlesse
it were that his <hi>Readers</hi> might see what his
<hi>Hearers</hi> could not, that he was resolved to
pretend, but was not able indeed to produce
any thing to purpose against the Catholic
Church?</p>

               <p>Of Transubstantiation, or a Substantial

            </argument>
            <p>1. THe three next supposed <hi>Novelties</hi> of
the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> all regard the
most holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi> That blessed <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
which was instituted to be both a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
and instrument, to signifie and to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Vnity,</hi> is, by the cunning of the Devil,
and malicious folly of men, becom both the
work and cause of <hi>Dis-union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Touching this Subject the first of the
three <hi>Novelties</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> says is <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. p. 9.</note>
               <q>So far from being from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
that it is not much above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years old,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 23, 24.</note> that it was first beard of in
the Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> For in Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi>
the Second's time the submission of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49048:69"/>
                  <hi>Berengarius</hi> imports rather a <hi>Con</hi>—then
Transubstantiation. <hi>But evident it is, That
it was never taught by our Saviour,</hi> since he
in the same breath wherewith he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<hi>This is my Blood,</hi> explain'd himself
by calling it expresly <hi>the fruit of the Vins.</hi>
and there needs no more to make the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
ashamed of that Doctrin, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who says, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for one body to be locally in more
places than one: From whence <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
angrily infers, that it equally implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
for one body to be so much as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
in more places than one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>In order to the giving some satisfaction
touching this matter, I will, as before, set
down the</hi> Churches Doctrin <hi>concerning this
most holy</hi> Sacrament, <hi>which will extend it self
to all his</hi> three <hi>pretended</hi> Novelties. <hi>In the</hi>
Profession of Faith <hi>compiled by</hi> Pope Pius <hi>iv.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Profess. Fid. Pii 4.</note>
               <hi>out of the</hi> Council of Trent <hi>it is said,</hi> I profess
that in the Masse there is offered to God a true
proper and propitiatory Sacrifice for the living
and Dead: And that in the most holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Eucharist there is truly and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
the Body and Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the
Soul and Divinity of our Lord Iesus Christ:
and that there is a Conversion <hi>(or Change)</hi> of
the whole Substance of Bread into his Body, and
of Wine into his Blood: which change the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church calls Transubstantiation. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
I confess that under one of the Species alone
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49048:70"/>
whole and entire Christ, and a true Sacrament
is received.</p>
            <p>4. And if he will needs have it so, let it be
granted, that the Latin word <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
begun commonly to be received among
<hi>Catholics</hi> at the <hi>Council of Lateran:</hi> Though
there was a Greek expression exactly import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] as old as his <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
that is, in the time of the first <hi>General
Council.</hi> But for God's sake let not a new
word drive him out of God's Church, as the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> did the <hi>Arians.</hi> He may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
with <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> that the Church
only says, the change made in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>is usually called Transubstantiation:</hi> So
that on condition he allow a real Substantial
change, the word it self shall not hinder us
from being good Friends.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Doctor</hi> sees now what our Church
holds concerning this Point. She delivers her
mind sincerely, candidly, ingenuously. But
if I should ask him what his Church holds, it
would cost him more labour to give a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Answer than to make ten such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>6. There are among <hi>Christians</hi> only <hi>four
ways</hi> of expressing a <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the
<hi>Sacrament.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That of the <hi>Zuinglians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
&amp;c. who admit nothing at all real here;
<hi>The Presence,</hi> say they, is only figurative or
imaginary: As we see Bread broken and
eaten, &amp;c. so we ought to call to mind that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49048:70"/>
that <hi>Christs Body</hi> was <hi>crucified,</hi> and torn for
us, and by Faith (or a strong fancy) we are
made partakers of his Body, that is, not his
Body, but the blessings that the offring his
Body may procure. 2. That of <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>English Divines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Cor. cap. 11. 24.</note> who usually say, as <hi>Calvin</hi>
did, <hi>That in the holy Sacrament our Lord offers
unto us not onely the benefit of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
but the very Body it self in which he
dyed and rose again:</hi> Or, as <hi>King Iames, We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

Catholics do;<note place="margin">Casaub. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

[Of which it seems he thought that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics
were not.] So that this <hi>presence</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a <hi>Substantial presence,</hi> but after a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
manner: A presence not to all, but to the
worthy receivers: Offred perhaps to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
but only partaken by the worthy:
A <hi>presence</hi> not to the <hi>Symbols,</hi> but the <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Soul</hi> only: Or if (according to Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi>) in some sence the <hi>Symbols</hi> do exhibit
the <hi>very Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in them what they exhibit, at least not
before the actual receiving. 3. Of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi>
who hold <hi>a presence of Christs Body</hi> in
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> as real, proper and substantial
as <hi>Catholics</hi> do, but deny an exclusion of
<hi>Bread.</hi> For <hi>Bread,</hi> say they, remains as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but to and with it the Body of our Lord
(every where present) is in a sort hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
united: Yet some among them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>reverence</hi> is to be exhibited to Christ,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49048:71"/>
though indeed substantially present. 4. That
of <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> whose sense was let down
before; whereto this only is to be added,
That believing a real conversion of Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Lords Body, &amp;c. they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged, in conformity to the Ancient
Church, as to embrace the Doctrine, so to
imitate their practise in exhibiting due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and worship (not to the <hi>Symbols,</hi> not to
any thing which is the object of sense, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi>
slander them; but) to <hi>our Lord</hi> himself
only, present in and under the <hi>Symbols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Now three of these four Opinions,
that is, every one but that of <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
speak intelligible sense: Every one
knows what <hi>Zuinglians, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholics</hi> mean: But theirs (which they
call a Mystery) is Indeed a <hi>Iargon,</hi> a <hi>Linsey-Wolsey
Stuff,</hi> made probably to sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with any
<hi>Sect</hi> according to interests: They that taught
it first in <hi>England,</hi> were willing to speak at
least, and, if they had been permitted, to
mean likewise as the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them, but the <hi>Sacrilegious Protectour</hi> in
<hi>King Edwards daies,</hi> and afterward the <hi>Privy
Council</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeths,</hi> found it for
their wordly advantage, that their <hi>Divines</hi>
should, at least in words, accuse the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> for that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which themselves
believed to be true. But now, since the last
Restitution, if that renew'd <hi>Rubrick</hi> at the
end of the <hi>Communion,</hi> be to be esteem'd <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49048:71"/>
then the <hi>last Edition</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi>
in this Point is meer <hi>Zuinglianism,</hi> to which
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themselves, if they are true
<hi>Calvinists,</hi> will refuse to subscribe. Thus
the <hi>new Religion of England</hi> is almost become
the <hi>Religion of New England.</hi>

               </gap> remains now that I should by a few
authorities justifie our <hi>Catholic Doctrine</hi> of
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or <hi>real substantial Presence,</hi>
to be far from deserving to be called a <hi>Novelty</hi>
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our hundred years standing. By <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Doctrine,</hi> I mean the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
not of the <hi>Schools,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> delivered by
<hi>Tradition,</hi> not <hi>Ratiocination:</hi> Not a <hi>Doctrine</hi>
that can be demonstrated by human empty
<hi>Philosophy.</hi> On the contrary, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
assorted, that all such pretended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
are not only not concluding,
but illusory, because that is said to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by reason, which <hi>Tradition</hi> tells us is
above reason, and ought not to be squared
by the Rule of <hi>Philosophy:</hi> The <hi>presence</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is truly real and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial,</hi>
but withall <hi>Sacramental,</hi> that is <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,</hi>
inexplicable, incomprehensible. It is
a great mistake among Protestants, when
they argue that we, by acknowledging a
<hi>Conversion</hi> by <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> pretend to
declare the <hi>modum conversionis.</hi> No; that is
far from the <hi>Churches,</hi> or the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi>
thoughts. For by that expression the onely
signifies, the <hi>change</hi> is not a matter of <hi>fancy,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:49048:72"/>
but <hi>real,</hi> yet withal <hi>Mystical.</hi> The <hi>Fathers,</hi>
to expresse their belief of a <hi>real conversion,</hi>
make use of many real changes mentioned
in the Scripture, as of <hi>Aarons Rod into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
of water into wine, &amp;c.</hi> But withal they
adde, That not any of these Examples do
fit, or properly represent the <hi>Mystical change</hi>
in the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> Sence or Reason might
comprehend and judge of those changes, but
<hi>Faith</hi> alone must submit to the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblenesse
of this. When Water was turn'd
into Wine, the eyes saw, and the Palat tasted
Wine, it had the colour, extension, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality
of Wine; But so is it not when <hi>Bread</hi>
by <hi>consecration</hi> becomes the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi>
For ought that Sence can judge, there is no
change at all: <hi>Christs Body</hi> is present, but
without <hi>locality:</hi> It is present, but not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally,
as natural bodies are present, one
part here, and another there. The <hi>Quomodo</hi>
of this presence is not to be inquired into,
nor can it without presumption be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.
This is that which the <hi>Church</hi> calls
a <hi>Sacramental, Mystical presence.</hi> But, that this
presence is real and <hi>substantial,</hi> a presence in
the <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Elements,</hi> and not only in the
mind of the worthy <hi>receiver,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi>
unanimously teach: And indeed if it were
not so, none could receive the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ
unworthily,</hi> because according to Protestants,
it is not the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but meer Bread
that an impenitent Sinner receives: And St.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49048:72"/>
               <hi>Pauls</hi> charge would be irrational, when he
saies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note> such <hi>An one receives judgment to himself
in that he does not discern the Body of our Lord.</hi>
Besides, if the change be not in the <hi>Elements,</hi>
but in the <hi>Receivers Soul,</hi> what need is there
of <hi>Consecration?</hi> What effect can <hi>Consecration</hi>
have? Why may not another man or woman
as well as a <hi>Priest,</hi> administer this <hi>Sacrament?</hi>
What hinders that such a <hi>Presence</hi> may not be
effected in the mind every Dinner or Supper,
and as well when we eat flesh, and drink any
other Liquor besides Wine at our own Table,
as at that of our Lord.</p>
            <p>9. Now, whether their Doctrine or ours
be a <hi>Novelty,</hi> let <hi>Antiquity judge.</hi> If I should
produce, as he knows I may, hundreds of
Testimonies that by conversion a change is
made of the <hi>Bread</hi> into the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>
into the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> he would think to
escape by allowing a change to be made, but
only in the <hi>Act</hi> of worthy receiving. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will onely make use of such <hi>Authorities</hi>
as demonstrate this change to be made before
communicating; that it remains, when the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> is reserved, and that immediately
after <hi>consecration,</hi> before any participation of
the <hi>Symbols,</hi> both the <hi>Priest</hi> and People did
perform an act of <hi>Adoration</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be really and <hi>substantially,</hi> though <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>

what a crime was it esteem'd in the <hi>Primitive

point with a brief Answer to the <hi>Doctors Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. Whereas therefore he says, <hi>It is evident
that Transubstantiation wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> never taught by
our Saviour, since in the same breath wherewith
he pronounced these words,</hi> This is my Blood, <hi>he
explain'd himself by calling it expresly the Fruit
of the Vine.</hi> On the contrary I do confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounce it to be evident, that those
words were neither spoken by <hi>our Lord</hi> in
the same breath after the <hi>Consecration</hi> of the
<hi>Chalice,</hi> nor had they any regard to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
'Tis true they are mentioned by St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> after the <hi>Consecration,</hi> but he knows
that in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who promised to write <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
those words are mentioned before any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
began, and the occasion of them is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49048:74"/>
evidently the eating of the <hi>Paschal Supper</hi>
&amp;c. For this is his <hi>Narration: When the
hour was come he sate down,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 14, 18.</note> and the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
with him. And he said unto them with
desire I have desired to eat this Passeover with
you before I suffer. For I say unto you, I will
not any more eat thereof until it be fulfill'd in the
kingdom of God. And he took the Cup and gave
thanks, and said, Take this and divide it among
your selves, For I say unto you I will not drink
of the fruit of the Vine, until the kingdom of
God shall come.</hi> Now after all this follows his
own <hi>last Supper,</hi> the <hi>Mystical consecration</hi>
and <hi>communion</hi> of his <hi>blessed Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
For the Text thus continues, <hi>And he took
Bread saying,<note place="margin">lbid. 10. 19, 20.</note> This is my Body, &amp;c. likewise

the Doctor than this which himself cites:
for what can be clearer, if before Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the fruit of the Vine?</hi> then that what he drank
after was not of the fruit of the Vine? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, though our Lord should have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it, after <hi>Consecration, the fruit of the Vine,</hi>
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the other <hi>Symbol Bread:</hi>
this does not argue against a Change in
their nature; For <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod, after
it was changed into a <hi>Serpent</hi> is call'd a

            </p>
            <p>13. Is not now the Doctor's Insincerity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
his insincerity even in the Pulpit? has
he not palpably mis-inform'd <hi>his Majesty</hi> and
so illustrious an Auditory? And though he
should still continue to prefer St. <hi>Matthews</hi>

St. <hi>Luke</hi> writes cannot possibly be applyed to

the Chalice to every guest: Drink all of this, <hi>saies
he.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks as well of drinking the
Mystical Blood, as eating the Body of Christ.</p>
            <p>2. To the substance of what is here alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
we readily subscribe. We acknowledg
our <hi>Saviour</hi> instituted this Mystery in both
kinds: That the <hi>Apostles</hi> received it in both
kinds: That St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks as well of <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
&amp;c. That most commonly in the Church
till a little before the times of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49048:77"/>
               <hi>public Celebration</hi> of these <hi>Mysteries,</hi> the people
communicated in both kinds: All this we
agree to.</p>
            <p>3. But the general <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church,
at least from his <hi>beginning,</hi> will not permit us
to yield, that the receiving in both kinds was
esteem'd by the Church <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>essence</hi>
of the <hi>Communion,</hi> or integrity of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of Christs Body and Blood, or that
it is fitly called by him <hi>a half Communion,</hi>
when deliver'd and receiv'd only in one kind.
On the contrary, we appeal to Dr. <hi>Pierces</hi>
own Conscience, whether, if we should yield
this, we should not be overwhelm'd with the
<hi>Depositions</hi> of the most ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> against
us: As evidently appears in <hi>Communions</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
practised <hi>under one kind</hi> only, and this
upon many occasions: As during the times
of persecution in <hi>Domestic Communions</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These things thus premised (which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Truths, and cannot by the Preacher be
deny'd) since he will needs make a quarrel
with the Catholic Church upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> he
must necessarily take upon him to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
1. Either, that these <hi>Communions under</hi>
one <hi>species,</hi> allowed and practised on so many
occasions in the Primitive times, were <hi>half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,</hi>
sacrilegious Transgressions of the
Institution of <hi>our Lord,</hi> contrary to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> conspiring with the <hi>Heresie of
the Manichees,</hi> &amp;c. And doing so, he will
contradict himself, whilst he pretends <hi>half
Communions</hi> to be a <hi>Novelty</hi> since their times.
2. Or, if these Practises were justifiable, and
that the Church had warrant and authority
to do as she did, he must prove that such an
<hi>Authority</hi> could be extended only to <hi>private
Persons</hi> or <hi>Fanilies,</hi> and by no means to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Congregations:</hi> That the same was a <hi>whole
Communion</hi> in a <hi>Chamber,</hi> and but a <hi>half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in a Church:</hi> That a <hi>sick man,</hi> or one
<hi>at Sea,</hi> &amp;c. broke not the institution of <hi>Christ</hi>
whilst he communicated under one kind, but
did break it when he was in health or upon
firm ground.</p>

And that the change which is made in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Protestants (who would not have separated
from her <hi>Communion;</hi> if she had given them
leave to break our <hi>Saviours Institution</hi> only
privatly) will renounce her, because she thinks
and knows that a privat <hi>House</hi> and a <hi>Church</hi>

            <p>7. Nay further, <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi>'s task does
not end here: for though he should be able to
prove all this, yet if this be one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,

he cannot justifie that <hi>separation</hi> till they

surely he will not esteem <hi>Schism</hi> a matter so

when they themselves are not concern'd. Now,
that such a <hi>dispensation</hi> may possibly be had,
does appear, in that the <hi>Church</hi> by a <hi>General

8. As for us <hi>Catholics,</hi> we are bread up to
the <hi>Orders</hi> established by <hi>Gods Church:</hi> And
being assured that our Lord will not forget
his <hi>Promises,</hi> and consequently his Church
shall never mislead us to our danger, we do
not think it our duty to question the <hi>Churches</hi>
prudence, or set up a <hi>private Tribunal</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
her Lawes: We are not sure we know
all the Reasons that induced the <hi>Council of
Constance</hi> to confirm a practise almost gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
introduced by custome before. Yet
some Reasons we see, which truly are of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great moment for that purpose, to wit,
the wonderful encrease of the <hi>numbers</hi> of
<hi>Communicants,</hi> and wonderful decay of their
<hi>Devotion:</hi> From whence could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
very great dangers of irreverences and
<hi>effusion</hi> oft-times of the <hi>precious blood</hi> of our
Lord, considering the defect of providence,
and caution to be expected in multitudes, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sensible of Religion.</p>
            <p>It is probable likewise that the <hi>Heresie of
Berengarius,</hi> who acknowledged no more in
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than the meer <hi>signs</hi> of the <hi>body</hi>
and <hi>blood</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> might induce the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi>
publickly to practise what the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church</hi> did privatly, to the end they
might thereby demonstrate, that though
they received not both the <hi>Signs,</hi> yet they
were not defrauded of being partakers of all
that was entirely contained under <hi>both</hi> the
<hi>Species,</hi> which was <hi>whole Christ,</hi> not his <hi>body</hi>
only, but also his <hi>blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. 20. de Civ. D. cap. 10.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the fancy which Protestants have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
against the term <hi>Sacrifice, Oblation, &amp;c.</hi>
proceeds from a mistake of the true sense in
which the <hi>Church</hi> intends it; for ordinarily
the conception of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> is supposed to
import an <hi>immolation,</hi> shedding of blood,
killing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no such matter appearing
here, but only a commemoration of a former
real immolation and <hi>shedding of Christs blood,</hi>
therefore generally among all <hi>Sects,</hi> divided
from the <hi>Church,</hi> the title of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> will not
be endured.</p>
            <p>5. To prevent therefore for the future
such a mis-understanding, let them be pleased
to take notice that all the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the
<hi>Law</hi> were shadows and <hi>types</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi>
of <hi>our Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Legal Priest-hood a type</hi>
of <hi>his Priest-hood:</hi> But above all other <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
and functions of <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> those were
most lively figures of our <hi>Lord,</hi> which were
perform'd on a certain day, only once every
year, for the sins of the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
In the solemn celebration of which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
besides the immolation of it on the
<hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> alone was appointed to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49048:81"/>
carry of the blood of that <hi>Victime</hi> into the
<hi>most holy place</hi> within the <hi>Veile,</hi> and there to
sprinkle it before the <hi>Propitiatory</hi> or <hi>Mercy-Seat.</hi>
This is that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
especially applies to our <hi>Lord,</hi> and shews that
Christ, as a <hi>Victime,</hi> was once, and but once
immolated on the <hi>Altar of the Cross</hi> for the
sins of all mankind: And that for the merit
of his obedience to the death even of the
<hi>Cross,</hi> he was raised from death, and made a
<hi>Priest</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> a <hi>Kingly
Priest,</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi> who had power given him in
Heaven and Earth, to apply the merits of his
own <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> And that the proper function
of his <hi>Regal Priesthood,</hi> was the entring with
his immolated <hi>Body</hi> into the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi>
the highest Heavens, there appearing before
his heavenly <hi>Fathers Throne,</hi> and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that most precious <hi>Victime</hi> to him.
This <hi>function</hi> of <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> far more august
than the immolation, he does, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
exercise to the end of the World.
By vertue of this he is made <hi>Head of the
Church,</hi> he has the power of sending the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. and hereby he perfects <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And withal, knowing of what infinite
value and vertue this function of his <hi>Priest-hood</hi>
is, he has been pleased to execute, as it
were by <hi>proxy,</hi> the same function on Earth,
that himself immediately performs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
For which purpose he has instituted
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49048:82"/>
               <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> to be not only his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
but <hi>Substitutes</hi> and <hi>Vice-gerents</hi> on Earth,
giving them power to consecrate, and by
cosecrating to place upon the <hi>Altar</hi> that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> which was immolated on
the <hi>Cross,</hi> and is now present before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven. This <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> they <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
this they <hi>offer,</hi> this they with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>participate.</hi> It is not a Sacrifice of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molation,
in that mistaken sense, for nothing is slain,
the Victime suffers nothing: It is
but a <hi>Commemorative Sacrifice of Immolation:</hi>
But it is, in the most proper rigorous sence,
<hi>an Oblation,</hi> the very same, of the very same
<hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> that <hi>our Lord</hi> now offers in
Heaven: And the same vertue it has, the same
effects it produces, <hi>propitiation, remission of sins,
participation of the graces of Gods holy Spirit,
and all blessings both spiritual and temporal.</hi> So
that in a word, as under the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Legal
propitiation</hi> was said to perfected by the
<hi>High Priests offring the blood in the most holy
place:</hi> So by this <hi>Oblation</hi> of <hi>Christs bood</hi> in
the <hi>Heavenly Sanctuary, perfect Redemption</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
obtained, and by the <hi>Commemorative Oblation
of the same body and blood by his Priests</hi> in our
earthly Sanctuaries, an application of the
benefit and vertue of that <hi>only meritorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
once offered on the <hi>Cross,</hi> is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
unto us for remission of our sins, and
the donation of all other benefits, spiritual
and temporal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49048:82"/>
7. In regard of this sublime function of the
<hi>Priest</hi> it is, that the <hi>holy Fathers</hi> exalt his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
before that of <hi>Princes,</hi> yea even of <hi>Angels:</hi>
in this regard they call the <hi>oblation</hi> it self the
most dreadful <hi>Mystery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> at which the <hi>Angels</hi>

            </p>
            <p>3. <q>To make a step further, Let it he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that at the same time you saw before
you several Pictures of several Persons in a
contrar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> manner regarded by you, as of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> of our <hi>late Severaign</hi> and
<hi>Bradshaw:</hi> Or put case you had in one
hand a <hi>Bible,</hi> and in the other the infamous
story of <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> does not your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense and reason tell you, that such Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
or Books force upon you quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thoughts and affections, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
those Pictures or Books not simply
considered, but as representing such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and containing such matters? Which
thoughts being just, and not at all harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to you, and withall almost impossible to
be avoided, I cannot find any reason why
Reason should forbid them: I am sure <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense</hi> will not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. <q>If then it be according to reason, and
common sense, and likewise unavoidably to
admit such different thoughts: will not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
also warrant you to express outwardly
by words or actions, whatever you may
without any fault think inwardly? For my
part I cannot imagin any scruple in this. If
then I may and must think reverently or
contemptuously of the <hi>Objects,</hi> I may as well
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49048:85"/>
speak, or behave my self externally after
the same manner to them respectively; For
whatsoever is ill or good in words or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is so likewise in thoughts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. <q>Now to shew that such thoughts or
affections regard not the Persons only but
the Pictures also as representations of such
Persons, ask your own heart and you will
find that you would not place <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s
picture, or the <hi>King</hi>'s in an unclean, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
place. If any one should spit upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, your heart would rise against
him, and tempt you to strike him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which
it would not do, if the same contemptuous
usage were shewed to the picture of <hi>Iudas</hi>
or <hi>Bradshaw.</hi> Now this is so naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
in the hearts of all Mankind, that in all
<hi>Kings Courts</hi> a respect and outward mark of
reverence is requird to the <hi>Chamber of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
or <hi>Chair of State:</hi> and a refusal of it,
much more a contemptuous behaviour,
would be criminal. To apply this to the
forementioned <hi>Books:</hi> You could not bring
your reason to permit you to tear out a leaf
of the <hi>Bible</hi> for an unclean use, as you could
without the least remorse do to the <hi>story of
Pantagruel</hi> or <hi>Aesop's fables..</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>6. <q>Let us now consider what kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
this is that we expresse to such <hi>Images.</hi>
Comparing the Images of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and our
<hi>Sovereign</hi>'s together, we find that a respectful
regard is had to both, and a contemptuous
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49048:85"/>
usage of either would displease us: Yet it is
not the same kind of respect: For St. <hi>Peter's</hi>
Image we consider as of a man that puts us
in mind of Heaven ann Heavenly things, one
highly favour'd by <hi>Almighty God,</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>Courtier</hi> in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and one that
by his writings and example has been a great
instrument of promoting our eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
We do not so esteem of every <hi>good
King.</hi> Therefore to shew the difference of
our respect to each, we would choose to give
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s picture a place in our <hi>Oratory,</hi> and
the <hi>Kings</hi> in our <hi>Gallery.</hi> But what Names
to give these different respects is not easie to
determin. It is plain, that which is given
to the <hi>King's</hi> picture is purely a civil respect.
But what shall we call that which is given to
St. <hi>Peters?</hi> If we say it is <hi>Religious,</hi> you
will quarrel, as derogating from <hi>God.</hi> Let
us therefore call it a <hi>sacred Veneration,</hi> or
<hi>honor:</hi> For since all things, that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
on purpose to mind us of God, of
Heaven, and the salvation of our Souls, we
call <hi>Sacred,</hi> this Name may well be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to such a Picture. But moreover, because
there are not invented such variety of
Names as there are things, and there are far
fewer sorts of outward <hi>postures</hi> of our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys</hi>
denoting respect, than there are <hi>Names</hi>
or <hi>Words:</hi> Hence it comes to passe that
when we would expresse a <hi>Civil</hi> and a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi>
yea a <hi>Religious</hi> respect, we are forced to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49048:86"/>
to use the same outward behaviour of <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
kneeling,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi>
which we do to <hi>God</hi> himself:<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 20.</note> Yea
we find in the <hi>Scripture</hi> Kings <hi>adored,</hi> and a
prostration of Bodies paid to them. Yet
for all this no man will suspect that thereby
any dishonor was intended to <hi>God,</hi> or the
<hi>Honor</hi> due onely to him was paid to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>7. <q>In the next place let reason and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense give judgement of the distinction
between the respect that may be paid to the
Picture of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that which ought
to be paid to Himself, in case he appear'd
to us glorified as he is. <hi>A Divine respect</hi>
we pay to neither, though sometimes we use
such postures as we do when we pray or
worship <hi>God.</hi> It is then a <hi>Sacred Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
only: But yet there are some expressions
of respect which we would use to the Person,
that would be ridiculous to the Picture, as
reverently to speak to him, to beg his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God for us, to ask a Question, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>8. <q>Our <hi>last Enquiry</hi> shall be into the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of regard (if any there be) to <hi>our
Saviour's Picture</hi> and <hi>St. Peter's,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
representing to us him that is both <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Man,</hi> the later meerly <hi>Man.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we shall find that the regard to both
the Pictures is of the same species and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, only <hi>Sacred:</hi> because a Picture
we never look upon, but as an instrument
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49048:86"/>
to put us in mind, or to call to our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
an object: And therefore it being of our
own framing, is not capable of any respect
beyond that which is due to so material, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
a thing, what ever the object repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by it be. True it is, that the internal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and thoughts occasionally raised in
our minds will be infinitely different, for we
shall think upon <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Adoration, Love,
Resignation</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> due to <hi>God</hi> only:
Not so of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> But the Pictures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
will be treated by us as Sacred Pictures
only, that deserve a respect proportionable:
And since it is eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they are capable of a
sinful dis-respect, consequently a due respect
may be paid to them. I say (<hi>may) not alwaies
ought to be:</hi> For then it would never be fit to
put on ones Hat, &amp;c. in a Room where
there hangs a <hi>Crucifix.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>9. <q>To sum up briefly our meaning in this
whole matter: We find minds too apt
to be distracted from meditating on Divine
things: Therefore we help our selvs by such
as will call to our memories, and fix our
thoughts upon objects good for our Souls:
Such are holy <hi>Pictures</hi> both in times of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and out, we find this benefit by them.
Being such <hi>sacred</hi> things, we must renounce
our reason, if we deny a respect may be due
to them: But by honoring with an outward
regard a Picture, we intend only to give a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
what respect we beat to the person
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49048:87"/>
or holy thing represented: And though for
want of variety of postures, we shew some
part of the same outward Reverence to the
Pictures of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>our Lord,</hi> yet that
signifies, we only <hi>venerate</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Saint,</hi> yet a Creature, but that we <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
Christ, as God:</hi> And no man that sees or
knows us, can think otherwise. So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be a fin to show outwardly what we
are oblig'd to think inwardly, there is not
the least fault committed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>10. <q>And now (Mr. <hi>Bagshow</hi>) give me leave
to acquaint you with your mistakes. First,
this respect called by the <hi>Church, Honor</hi> and
<hi>Veneration,</hi> which we affirm may be payd to
<hi>Sacred Images,</hi> you call <hi>Worshipping of Images,</hi>
meerly to make in odious to your ignorant
<hi>Proselites;</hi> For <hi>worship</hi> is commonly taken to
be that honor which is due only to <hi>God,</hi> and
which we abhor to give to Images. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
You give it an other name more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
calling it <hi>Idolatry, such as God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in the worst of Pagans.</hi> Once at least in
your life speak your Conscience: Do you
think, or only suspect, that we <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics</hi>
worship <hi>false</hi> Gods, and <hi>true Devils?</hi> Do
we consider our <hi>Images,</hi> as they did their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi>
to which by <hi>Magical conjurations</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
an evil Spirit to do wonders, and to
extort <hi>Devine worship</hi> from the seduced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Taketheed <hi>Sir,</hi> how you persist in so
unjust a Blasphemy against <hi>Gods Church</hi> A
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49048:87"/>
time will come that you will be called to a
strict account for it: It concerns you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make some reparation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>11. <q>But after all this take notice that the
<hi>Catholic Church,</hi> though it declare that such a
veneration may fitly be given to holy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as common reason, and human nature
cannot chuse but allow: Yet it commands
none to afford them even so much. You may
be a <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> all you life, and never
be obliged to perform any external respect
to an <hi>Image.</hi> There is not in <hi>Catholic Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi>
a <hi>Groom</hi> or <hi>Kitchin-Maid</hi> so ignorant,
but would rather burn an <hi>Image,</hi> then afford
it any honor due to <hi>God</hi> only. And shall
those that think thus, and do only what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
reason generally approves, and cannot
hinder, be esteem'd and publisht by you <hi>the
only Christians in the World, fit to be thrust out
of all Christian Kingdoms, and executed as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
though otherwise they be acknowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>most
faithful, peaceable men, and obedient
Subjects? Are you not afraid of, <hi>In quo judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
judicaveritis, judicabimini?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>12. <q>You see <hi>Sir,</hi> how sinee you will not
admit of Authorities to justifie the Belief and
Practise of <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense and reason, I have complyed with
you: And now in one world tell you, that
you must never hope to make any sober man
believe that <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> or
even faulty in the matter of Images, till you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49048:88"/>
can demonstrate, 1. That it is unlawful to
make use of our seeing faculty to put us in
mind of <hi>God.</hi> 2. That he dishonors the
<hi>King</hi> that shall with reverence, bare headed,
and in a kneeling posture receive a <hi>Letter</hi> or
<hi>Mandate</hi> that com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> from him. 3. That it
is a contempt of God to go through a
Church with ones head uncovered. 4. And
that it is unlawful and irreligious to make
a scruple of using a Leaf of the <hi>Bible</hi> in the
house of Office.</q>
            </p>
            <p>13. <q>For a Farewel, I will conclude this
Point with a Story, the truth whereof seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Gentlemen, Protestants</hi> too, in this <hi>Town</hi> are
able to justifie. In the Year 1651. a devout <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
Friar,</hi> being appointed to preach in the
<hi>Great Dome at Padua,</hi> the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> present,
and having been informed that among his
Auditors there were some <hi>English Protestants,</hi>
who in discourse had earnestly objected (as
you do) <hi>Idolatry</hi> to <hi>Catholics:</hi> He therefore
that he might encounter such a scandal, made
choice of the Doctrine concerning <hi>Images</hi>
for the subject of a great part of his <hi>Sermon.</hi>
And when he came to that Point, holding in
his hand a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> he could his hearers, That
that <hi>Image</hi> did in one glance lively represent,
even to the most ignorant beholder, <hi>our Lord
Iesus, God and Man,</hi> and almost all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of his most bitter and accursed
death, so patiently and willingly suffered
for us. Thereupon with great Passion and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49048:88"/>
Rhetoric he magnified the love of our Lord
hanging on the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oss, earnestly pressing his
Hearers to return a proportionable <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Duty</hi> to him. And during this Discourse,
he often, with great reverence and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of affection embraced and devoutly kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <hi>Crucifix.</hi> Having said much to this
purpose, after a little pause he pursued his
Discourse, telling them he could not believe
or suspect that any one who had heard and
seen what he had said and done, could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
imagin that he had any intention to
<hi>dishonor</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> by that which he had done
to the <hi>Crucifix</hi> which represented him, much
lesse that he adored it, as if he thought it <hi>a
kind</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he put his trust in it, as
expecting any good from it, as if (he knew
not what) <hi>Divinitie,</hi> Vertue or <hi>Sanctitie</hi> was
in that carved piece of wood. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
because he had heard that such a
scandalous imputation was by some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswaded
persons laid on the <hi>Church,</hi> he
would then and there undeceive them.
Thereupon he spit upon the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> threw
it scornfully to the ground, and trampled
it under his feet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>14. <q>You see, Mr. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> what kind of
<hi>Idolaters</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> are. Against this <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
let us see what expresse <hi>Scripture</hi> you
can produce. This is the great <hi>crime</hi> for
which there can be no expiation but <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Imprisonments,</hi> and <hi>Gallowses.</hi> Now if
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49048:89"/>
what hath been here said give you no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
in case you have a mind to reply,
do not practise your old way of snatching
a phrase or expression out of a single <hi>Author,</hi>
a <hi>School-man</hi> or <hi>Controvertist,</hi> making the

and in Greek, a Tongue most known to Eastern

Nations: And afterwards were translated into
the Dalmatick by St.</hi> Hierom, <hi>into the Gothick
by</hi> Vulphilas, <hi>into the</hi> Arminian by <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,

            <p>2. Truly the <hi>Doctor</hi> has, if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
made choice of a very proper season
to renew a quarrel against the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
upon this Point, and to endeavour the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<hi>his Majesty</hi> in it, as if the calamities
already hapned, both to the Royal Family,
and the whole Nation, were either too little,
or not to be imputed chiefly to that Error.
He, and all <hi>Christendom,</hi> has seen the blessed
effects that this prostituting <hi>Scripture</hi> to the
passions and lusts of the rude and common
people of all Conditions, Ages and Sexes,
has wrought the last twenty years in this
<hi>Kingdom.</hi> What was it but <hi>Scripture</hi> (as it
was used, and of which ill use themselves
were the first causes, and hereafter will never
be able to prevent) that justified Discontents
against the <hi>Government,</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical;</hi>
that put <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Guns</hi> into
the hands of <hi>Subjects</hi> against their <hi>Kings,</hi>
and all that were faithful to them; that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
the entire frame of the Kingdom; that
encourag'd men to Plunder, and all manner
of Rapines; that Arraign'd and Murther'd
our last most Excellent <hi>KING,</hi> that endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
his now living <hi>Son,</hi> our <hi>most gracious
Kings</hi> life, and forced him into a long neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitous
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49048:90"/>
banishment; that has revived and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
strength to old and new <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi>
to the astonishment of Man-kind,
some of which are no where else to be seen,
and the rest in no where place so venomous, as in
<hi>England:</hi> Let but the <hi>Doctor</hi> remember how
much mischief the perverse interpretation of
this one Text, which none but the ignorant
could mistake, produc't in this Nation:
<hi>Having a form of godlinesse, but denying the
power thereof</hi> How did this ring in their ears,
and stir them up to reject and hate all set-forms
of Prayer! How, with this Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
often repeated, and industriously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
and zealously apply'd by the holy
Lecturers, were their very hearts set on fire
to burn the grand Idol of the Common
Prayer Book! And yet, after all this, the
<hi>Doctor</hi> makes or renews quarrels with the
<hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> because she is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
by imitating them, to give a birth from
her bowels to such mischiefs as these.</p>
            <p>3. Yet cannot be deny'd, that <hi>Doctor
Pierce</hi> was subtile, for having a design (in
recompence of the service <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
have done them) to expose them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rage of all these <hi>Monsters,</hi> he could not
make choice of a subject more proper for his
purpose than this, in which alone they were
all interessed, not for the good they reap by
<hi>Scripture,</hi> but because without it, they would
not have the advantage to do half so much
mischief.</p>

               <hi>Wherein</hi> (the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul) there are

of his Subjects, most especially of the lower

thereby grown and increased in diverse naughtie

fallen into great Divisions and Dissentions among

from the new light of the Scriptures, you
may see the very Opinions, as the Bishops
collected them in <hi>Fox, pag.</hi> 1136. un-own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by any sober Protestant or Christian.
A thing perhaps not unworthy the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration of the present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
who have seen the like effects in these

            <p>5. But as for other <hi>Lay-persons</hi> of better

judgement and capacities, and of whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from <hi>Novelties</hi> sufficient proofs can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>our Ecclesiastical Governors</hi> are easily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
entreated, yea, they are well enough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to exhort them to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
themselves in their vulgar Tongues, and are
forward to assist them in explaining diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and resolving doubts that may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr.</p>
            <p>6. And now let <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> speak his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
if he dare do it; Is not this way of
managing the Consciences of Christs Flock
and this prudent dispensing of <hi>Scripture</hi> very
desireable, yea actually in their hearts here in
<hi>England,</hi> that it may be in practise among
them? But it is now too late: Their <hi>first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi>
found no expedient so effectual to
call followers to them out of <hi>God's Church,</hi>
as by wastfully powring this <hi>Treasure</hi>
into their hands, and accusing the <hi>Church</hi>
for not doing so, not fore-seeing, or not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if, in future times, that which was an
instrument of their Schism, from the true
<hi>Church,</hi> would be far more effectual to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
<hi>Schisms</hi> from their false one. For the
making an ill use of <hi>Scripture</hi> by ignorant or
passionate <hi>Laicks</hi> is not altogether so certain
or probable to follow in the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi>
where men are bred up in a belief and most
necessary <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Submission</hi> even of their
minds to her <hi>Authority</hi> for the delivering of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49048:93"/>
the only true sence of <hi>Scripture:</hi> Whereas in
such <hi>Churches</hi> as this, in which not any one
Person ever was or can be perswaded that the
sence of <hi>Scripture</hi> given by them can challenge
an internal assent from any, or that it may
not without sin be contradicted; to give the
Scripture indefinitly to all who can read or are
willing to hear it read, without a Guide
to tell them the true sense which they are
bound to believe, is to invite them to ascend
into <hi>Moses Chair,</hi> which such Reformer's
themselves have made empty and vacant for
them.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>second Part</hi> of this pretended <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi>
concerns <hi>Public Praying in an unknown
tongue:<note place="margin">Serm. p. 9.</note> which,</hi> says he, <hi>may be fetcht indeed as far
as from</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great</hi> (that is, ever since
this <hi>Nation</hi> was <hi>Christian:) But is as scandalous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to the plain sence of Scriptures,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> as if
it were done in a meer despight to</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 13.
<hi>&amp;c. And, besides</hi> Origen, <hi>it is confess'd by</hi> Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
<hi>and</hi> Lyra, <hi>that in the Primitive times the
public Service of the Church was in the common
Language too. And as the Christians of</hi> Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,
Habassia, <hi>&amp;c. and all Reformed parts of
Christendom have God's service in their vulgar
tongues, so hath it been in divers places by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
first had from the Pope himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. I will acknowledge to <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctor Pierce,</hi> that
this is the only Point of <hi>Novelty</hi> (as he calls it)
of which he discourses sensibly, and as it were
to the purpose: But withall I must tell him, it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49048:94"/>
is, because he mistakes our <hi>Churches</hi> meaning.
For he charges the <hi>Catholic Religion,</hi> as if one
of its positions were, That Gods publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ought to be in an unknown Tongue, or
as if it forbad people to understand it. And
truly if it were so, we could never hope to be
reconciled with that passage of <hi>Scripture</hi> out
of <hi>St. Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 13, &amp;c. <hi>But all</hi> this is
a pure mis-understanding. Therefore I desire
him to permit himself for once to be informed
how the matter stands in this <hi>Point</hi> with the
<hi>Roman Catholic Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. We <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> (I.) do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times the
<hi>Public Service</hi> of God was (generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
perform'd in a Tongue better understood
than now it is, yet not then for many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Countries in their vulgar, or native, or
best understood tongue; For it is evident by
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> that in <hi>Afric</hi> it was in the <hi>Latin
tongue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Doctr.</note>
not in the <hi>Punic,</hi>

                  </gap>ta Epist. ad Romanos.</note> which yet was the
only <hi>Tongue</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi> understood. So the
Liturgy of St. <hi>Basil</hi> was used in the Greek
Tongue in most parts of the Eastern Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
And yet it appears as well out of later Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
as out of the <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. &amp;c. 14.
<hi>v.</hi> 11. That Greek was not in those antient
times the vulgar tongue of many of those Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Countrys, no more than Latin was of the
Western. 2. We professe it was not, nor yet
is the intention of the <hi>Church</hi> that the <hi>Public
Devotions</hi> should therefore be in <hi>Latin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49048:94"/>
it is not vulgarly understood: but this
has hapned as it were by accident, besides
her intention, and onely because the <hi>Latin
Tongue,</hi> in which it was first written, by revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of times and mixture of <hi>Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in <hi>Europe,</hi> has been corrupted, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be a so commonly understood Language
by unlearned people; for indeed probably it was
never so well understood, as that other native
Language which they used before it, or with it.</p>
            <p>10. Matters standing thus, yet the <hi>Church</hi>
does not think fit to change with the times,
but continues <hi>Gods publick Service</hi> as it was at
first: And this we may conceive she does.
1. <hi>Because</hi> no example can be found in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently-established
<hi>Churches,</hi> that any of them
changed the Language of <hi>Gods public Service</hi>
entirely. The <hi>Greeks</hi> now use the Antient
<hi>Masse</hi> of <hi>St. Chrysostom</hi> written in <hi>pure Greek,</hi>
as much differing from the Vulgar, as <hi>Latin</hi>
from the <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> &amp;c. The like may
be said of the <hi>Syrian, Cophtites,</hi> &amp;c. among
whom the <hi>Mass</hi> is celebrated in the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
far from being vulgarly understood.
Yea, the <hi>Iews</hi> continue their <hi>Devotions,</hi> to this
day, in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> understood by few among
them. 2. Because, though the <hi>Latin</hi> be not
now in any place a <hi>vulgar Language</hi> yet
there is no Language so universally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in <hi>Europe</hi> as that: And a great
fitnesse there is that the most <hi>Public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
should be in the most <hi>public Language,</hi> in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49048:95"/>
which all Nations may joyn every where.
And by those who most frequently recite the
<hi>Divine Service</hi> in the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> viz.
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and other <hi>Religious</hi> (for whose
proper use a great part of this <hi>Service</hi> was
composed) the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> is well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
3. Because the <hi>Latin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ongue</hi> now that it

danger of being innovated. Whereas <hi>vulgar
Languages</hi> almost in every age become un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
or at least sound very unpleasing in

Knave of Iesus Christ,</hi> yet this was once the
English Scripture; Nay more, within this
<hi>twenty years</hi> we find many words and phrases
have quite changed their former sense: So that
all Nations must be ever and anon altering
their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> to the great danger of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the <hi>Churches</hi> belief; And (which is not

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:49048:95"/>
are to be despised, rather than so to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Apostles Doctrin.</hi> But what is his
<hi>Doctrin?</hi> For I evidently perceive the <hi>Doctor</hi>
has not well search'd into it, much lesse, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply'd it. The <hi>Apostle</hi> says. <hi>If I pray in
an unknown tongue, my Spirit prays, but my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
receives no benefit, &amp;c. And how can
an unlearned Person say Amen to such Prayers?</hi>
In which passage seems involved a tacite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
at least of publick Prayers in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue. All this is granted: but yet
with this exception mention'd by the <hi>Apostle</hi>
himself, <hi>unless either he that prays, or some other

to charge the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> with a <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

ought to have examin'd better her <hi>doctrin</hi> and

them, the Holy Synod commands all Pastours
and all that have care of Souls, that during the
celebration of Mass, they should frequently either
by themselves or others, expound some part of
those things which are read in it; and among
other things let them explain the mystery of this
most Holy Sacrifice, especially on Sundays and
Feasts.</hi> The <hi>Preacher</hi> here may see that the
<hi>Church</hi> does not make such a secret even of
the most sublime Mysteries of her Office, as <hi>the
Court</hi> believ'd upon his report.</p>
            <p>12. Likewise between this speaking in an
unknown tongue, mention'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the Churches publick Latin Service, there is
this great disparity, that this later is always
a known Language to several of those present,
if not to all, and there are alwayes those who
understandingly say, <hi>Amen.</hi> And again being
a known set-form in one set-language, recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
continually the same according to the
Feast, those who are ignorant of it at first,
need not continue so, but by due attention,
and other diligence may arive to a sufficient
knowledge at least of the chief parts thereof,
they having also in their <hi>Manuals, Primers,
Psalters,</hi> &amp;c. ready translated both the Psalms,
Hymns and Prayers, &amp;c. and there being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Books both in English and all vulgar
languages, that expound the Church-service
even to the meanest capacity. Neither is the
Latin tongue, by reason of its affinity with
many vulgar tongues, and of the constant use
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49048:96"/>
hereof, a language unknown to such a degree
in Catholick Conntries, as our English Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imagin it, and therefore is so much scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized:
Neither is there the same motive
for some dispensation of a change in those
places, as perhaps would be in a Country less
acquainted with the Latin, and of a Language
more remote from it. Yet our venerable
<hi>Beda</hi> in his History saith,<note place="margin">Bed hist. l. 1. c 1.</note> That in his time
to these Northern Languages of ours, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
Scotch, Britans, Picts, the Latin
Tongue, by perusing the Scriptures, was made
common to them all.</hi> The usual Language
therefore wherein the Scriptures were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his times was Latin, and by this that
Tongue rendred common, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
even to these Northern people.</p>
            <p>13. Besides all this, several Popes, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks,
&amp;c. have approved the Translation of
the Missal, &amp;c. into the vulgar Languages,
as Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">Hist. Boem. cap. 13.</note> who was induced
thereto by a Miracle related by <hi>Aeneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
(afterward Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Second) like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth, <hi>Balsamon,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To conclude, since the Doctor confesseth
that Popes have given leave to some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that the Divine Office should be in a
vulgar Tongue, he ought not to have made
a Quarrel of this to a Separation, till it
could be shewed, that their first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

by way of impetration, to obtain all blessings

beneficial to all, but that some Duties and
qualifications on our part are necessary both
that his <hi>Merits,</hi> and the benefits of his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
should be effectually applyed unto us.
3. Among these Qualifications we are to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
not only our own Prayers for our selves,
but mutual Prayers for one another: which
therefore we may beg from one another, as

               <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
&amp;c. 4. Because the more holy any
person is, the more effectual will his <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
be with God, therefore we may beg
of known <hi>Saints</hi> their Prayers to God for
us with greater hope of successe. 5. Such
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49048:98"/>
begging of Prayers is farr from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Superstition</hi> or <hi>diminution to Christ's
honor,</hi> since holy Persons (living or dead)
are not invocated as <hi>Donors</hi> but Fellow-beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
with God for us. 6. Though a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
may be saved who prays to God alone,
and requests not the prayers of others, yet
to refuse the assistance of those, whose
Prayers God more willingly hears, is a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
at least of using all means helpful to us.
7.<note place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 23. in Genes.</note> Neverthelesse we say with Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
God will bestow salvation much rather

for us: And we are much more safe by our

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s merits.
For the prayers and supplications of Saints have
indeed very great force with God in our behalf,
but it is then truly when we with penance and
humiliation beg the same thing also of God.</hi> And
therefore saith the same Saint, <hi>Knowing these
things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>let us neither neglectingly contemn the
prayers of Saints, nor cast our selves wholly upon
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whatsoever hath been hitherto said, may
indifferently be applied as well to <hi>Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
as to <hi>Saints alive:</hi> If the Prayers to <hi>Saints</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
be prejudicial to the merits &amp; interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Lord, so is the beging of the prayers
of those alive: If one be unlawful, so is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
nay, most certain it is, that if both be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49048:99"/>
lawful, the prayers of <hi>Saints</hi> departed will be
incomparably more effectual, and therfore will
better deserv to be made use of, than the other.
Therefore, notwithstanding most of the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>Protestants</hi> against the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> touching <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
do prove full as much against Prayer to
the Living, and therefore are evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding:
Yet those, who are most learned
and sober, and will not wilfully mistake <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Doctrin,</hi> do free us from all imputation
of <hi>Idolatry, superstition,</hi> or doing injury to
<hi>Christ,</hi> and reduce the Controversie to a short
point: For they question not whether the
<hi>Saints</hi> pray in general for us, but rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
acknowledge it; yea they will not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
deny but they may and do pray perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
for their former known acquaintance, as
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> believ'd his <hi>Mother</hi> did for him:
Likewise they will grant that though they be
in Heaven, they may either by Gods reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or by relation from <hi>Angels</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the Prayers made to them by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
on earth: and that supposing such a
knowledge, they will become Intercessors for
them in particular.</p>
            <p>6. But, you'l say, since there is no general
certainty, that they understand our Prayers
or wants, or interesse themselves in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
necessities of the living, Therefore
though it be not unlawful, as prejudicial to
the honor and duty we owe to <hi>God,</hi> to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49048:99"/>
them in particular, yet it may be call'd
unlawful, in regard it is uncertain.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Scruple, Catholicks</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the <hi>Church</hi> by no <hi>Decision</hi> hath declar'd
that the <hi>Saints</hi> generally hear all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
prayers of us on Earth: And consequently
that it is not any <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> to believ
they do so: Yea, several moderate <hi>Catholics</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to say peremptorily that it is so; yet in all
<hi>Catholics</hi> Opinion this does not, nor ought
to hinder them from acknowledging that the
practise of <hi>Invocating Saints</hi> by name, is very
beneficial to us, though they should have no
particular knowledge of your Prayers.</p>
            <p>7. And the grounds to prove this to be
rational are these, <hi>First,</hi> Because though it
were so that the <hi>Souls</hi> of glorifi'd <hi>Saints</hi> did
not hear our prayers, or know our particular
necessities, yet at least, it is certain the <hi>Holy
Angels</hi> are continually present with us on
Earth, and that it is by them we are defended
from the <hi>Divels</hi> malice, who otherwise, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such a wonderful strength exceeding
ours, would destroy us all in our sins.
Now, since <hi>God</hi> does not ordinarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his power immediatly in natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor substract his universal influence on
his Creatures, it cannot be imagin'd (since
the <hi>Devils</hi> will not be hindred by any Law
or prohibition) by what other power, but
that of <hi>Angels,</hi> they should be restrained
from executing their malice against us. Adde
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49048:100"/>
to this, that <hi>History</hi> tells us <hi>Magicians</hi> have
the <hi>Divels</hi> alwaies ready to come at their call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Why then should not <hi>Angels</hi> be witnesses of
our actions, and especially our prayers,
which, as the Scripture saies, <hi>They offer as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to God,</hi> being alwaies assistant in the
houses of <hi>Prayer.</hi> This being supposed, we
are not to imagin that those holy Spirits
stand upon <hi>niceties,</hi> and will not do any good
unlesse particularly call'd upon: But on the
contrary, will be charitably officious in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and delivering us, whensoever we implore
the assistance of any of their fellow Citizens.
And it is upon this matter that St.<note place="margin">Aug. l. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

far it may be extended, <hi>viz.</hi> their faculties
of seeing, hearing, and operating, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since the Ascension and Glorification of

saith he, <hi>that there should be assigned to every

(tho' in a higher degree,) as also some special

9. Again, though there were no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, that even the <hi>Angels</hi> are present
to us, and execute the things we pray for,
yet the practise of <hi>Invocating Saints</hi> ought not
to be neglected; because, considering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable

Addresses were made to, and many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miracles perform'd by the <hi>Intercession of
Saints,</hi> especially <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which <hi>Miracles</hi>
were shew'd rather in the places, where those
<hi>Martyrs</hi> were particularly honour'd, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49048:101"/>
where their <hi>Reliques</hi> reposed, then in others;
and upon those, who <hi>Invocated</hi> their <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>

which are demonstrative proofs that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and <hi>Invocation</hi> of them are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Civ. Dei. l. 22. c. 8.</note> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> relates that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Miracles which were done at <hi>Hippo,</hi>
the Seat of his <hi>Bishoprick,</hi> at the <hi>Memory</hi> of
St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and that within the two first
years, after some part of his <hi>Reliques</hi> were
brought thither from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Orosius,</hi>
was so great (who also caused them to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled,
and for <hi>God's</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> glory, to
be recited to the People the next Festival af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were done, of some of which also he
was himself an eye-witnesse) so great I say,
as that those that were registred amounted to
near 70. (whereof he sets down a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number in that 8<hi>th.</hi> Chapter) and those
done at <hi>Calama</hi> to a far greater number. <hi>It
is not yet two years since the memorial at</hi> Hippo
Regius <hi>was erected, whereas the Books delivered
in to us concerning these miraculous effects (yet
many other, as we are most certain, not being given
in) even to the time when I am writing this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to some seventy. But at</hi> Calama, <hi>where
the Memorial was set up sooner, and the Books
brought faster, they are incredibly more in number.
At</hi> Uzala <hi>too, a Colony adjoyning to</hi> Utica, <hi>we
have been witnesses of sundry things of note done
by the same Martyr; whose Memorial was erected
there by Bishop</hi> Evodius, <hi>long before ours.</hi> And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49048:102"/>
St. <hi>Theodoret</hi> also, (who was a member of
the 3<hi>d.</hi> and 4<hi>th.</hi> General Council) speaks of
the peoples frequent repairing and presenting
their requests to the Martyrs for so many
Miracles received by them on this manner
—<hi>Neither do we resort hither once or
twice, or five times in a year, but frequently
in them we keep our Festivals, yea, oftentimes for
many daies together, we sing Lauds and Hymns
to the Lord of these Martyrs. Where such as are
in health petition the Martyrs for the continuance
thereof; such as are sick petition them for health,
&amp;c. Not conceiting that they approach to Gods,
but praying to these Martyrs of God as Divine
men, invocating and petitioning them for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
with God. And that such, who have
devoutly and faithfully invocated them, do obtain
their requests, those several guifts do witnesse,
which such, obliged by their Vows, do bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being clear evidences of their unfeigned cures.
For some hang up their Tablets of eyes, some of
feet, others of hands, made of gold or silver. These
things therefore exposed to the view of all, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the driving away of their diseases: These
I say do demonstrate, what the power of those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
is, which are buried there,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
whom, tho' some of the Reformed
(upon a negative Argument, because <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>
mentions not this Book amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but so he omits some which <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadius</hi>

of this Book, yet <hi>Rivet</hi> is more candid,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49048:102"/>
saying,<note place="margin">Rivet. Crit. Sacr. l. 4. c. 21.</note>

addita esse malim dicere, quam de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thore
dubitare.</hi> And lastly, St. <hi>Gregory
Nyssen</hi> speaks thus on the same Subject
—<hi>After one hath thus delighted his eyes
with the building, he desires further to approach
the Monument it self, believing the very touching
thereof to bring a benediction and hallowing along
with it. But if any be suffered to take away any
of the dust gathered from off the Martyrs Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
such dust is taken for a great guift, and
this very Earth laid up as a precious Treasure.
But if at any time such a happinesse befalls any, as
to have the priviledge to touch the Reliques, how
earnestly such a thing is to be wished and desired,
being the reward of much importunitie, they know
well, who have sought and obtained it. For then
they view and embrace this body, as if it were alive
and fresh; apply it to their mouth, their ears, and
the other Organs of all their Senses: Moreover,
powring out tears of du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and affection upon the
Martyr, as if he appear'd to them sound and entire,
they offer up their humble prayers, that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
as an Advocate for them, begging of him
as a Courtier of Heaven, and invocating him, as
one that can obtain any thing he pleaseth. To what
Prince is there such honour given?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. In the third place I will adjoyn fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expresse Testimonies out of the ancient
Fathers, all living within the <hi>Doctors</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
times, and shewing the lawfulnesse
and usefulnesse of this practise of <hi>Invocating</hi>
the glorified <hi>Saints.</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49048:103"/>
Thus then saies St.<note place="margin">Basil. Orat. 40. Mart.</note> 
               <hi>Basil: Whosoever is in
any pressure, let hin fly to the assistance of these
Martyrs: And again, whoever is in a state of joy,
let him pray to them: The former, that he may be
delivered from misery: The latter, that he may be
preserved in prosperitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrys. Homil. 66. ad pop. Antioch. &amp; Hom. 26. in 2 Corinth.</note> Thus St. <hi>Chrysostom,
The Emperor, who is cloathed with purple, takes a
journey to visit these Sepulchres</hi> [of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul</hi>] <hi>and laying aside his pomp, presents
himself to make supplication to them, to the end
they may intercede to God for him, be whose Temples

to the same purpose,<note place="margin">Ruffin. Hist. Eccl. l. 2. c. 23. Ambr. de vid.</note> of the same <hi>Emperor,</hi>

We ought to pray to the Martys, whose Bodies seem

us not therefore be asham'd to employ them as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors

this Father.<note place="margin">Hilar. in Psal. 129.</note> Thus St. <hi>Hilary, It is
not the nature of God, but our infirmitie that stands
in need of the Intercession of Angels: For they are
sent for the benefit of those which shall inherit Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
God himself not being ignorant of the things
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49048:103"/>
which we do, but our infirmitie needing this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a spiritual intercession for the imploring and
obtaining for us</hi> (what is good for us). In
which Testimony so much is clear, that the
Angels know our necessities, &amp;c. And this
is sufficient to infer the lawfulnesse of reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
them also to intercede for us. To these,
many more Testimonies may be added out of
other holy Fathers, as likewise the actual
Prayers to Martyrs made and recorded by St.
<hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi>
St. <hi>Ephrem, Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Prudentius,</hi> &amp;c. To which, I hope, Dr.
<hi>Pierce</hi> will forbear to return the usual evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all these are but Rhetorical Apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe's:
Since other expressions of the same
Fathers, <hi>viz, That they are well perswaded that
those Saints to whom they addresse these Requests,<note place="margin">Nazianz. Orat. de 8. Athan. Basil. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have an inspection from Heaven on their affairs.
That they do relieve the necessities of those who
supplicate to them. That the people make addresses
to these heavenly Courtiers, as to those who obtain
guifts from God when they please. And that if
the Lamb be every where, these Saints which are
with the Lamb, ought to be believed to be any
where,</hi> (or every where) as they please:
Since, I say, these expressions do not consist
with such a pretence of their invocating
them only in an empty flourish; And since
this is a put-off too vain, to get any credit
with sober men, to say that such grave and
holy Bishops, when preaching to the people,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49048:104"/>
would make petitions to these Saints to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their Rhetorick, and yet without any
cautioning their hearers, that they did it in
such a manner; which, if done seriously,
would have been an injury to God, to Christ
our Redeemer, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
lastly, since the <hi>Doctor</hi> may find <hi>Vossius</hi> and
<hi>Forbes,</hi> for some of them at least, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this evasion.</p>
            <p>11. To these Testimonies, I may adjoyn
the expresse confessions of <hi>Protestants,</hi> That
<hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> was commonly in use in
the Greek Church long before the 3<hi>d.</hi> and
4<hi>th. General Councils.</hi> For which, besides the
confession of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chem. exam. Conc. Trid. p. 3. de Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. S. S. Vossius Disp. 2 Thes. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Vossius</hi> also is clear,
whose words are; <hi>About the year of Christ,
370. those to whom the care of instructing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was committed, did by their practise lead them
to invocate the Saints departed. And indeed, in
the Greek Church the first, or at least very near
the first of those which gave such Examples were</hi>
Basil, Nyssen, Nazianzen: <hi>And in the West, at
the same time,</hi> Ambrose of Millain, <hi>a diligent
Reader and Imitater of the Greeks, followed the
same custom.</hi> Now, since Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> professes
so ready a submission to the Judgment of the
four first <hi>General Councils,</hi> and must grant,
that several of these Fathers, whom <hi>Vossius</hi>
acknowledges to have been Patrons of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and to have used it even in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assemblies, (for which they were never
censured) did precede many years two of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49048:104"/>
these <hi>General Councils;</hi> I would gladly know
if such a Question had been made before the
third or fourth Council, concerning <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints,</hi> as was, before that of <hi>Trent,</hi>
Whether he can perswade himself, that those
Fathers would not have justified such Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for lawful in those Councils, which
they practised as lawful out of, and before
them, and would not have produced at least
as high a stating of that Point, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> did? And indeed a particular
knowledg and agency of Saints deceased in
in human affairs seems to be acknowledged
in the fourth <hi>General Council,</hi> and Invocation
in the third Person:<note place="margin">Act II. Conc. Chalced.</note> Whose words are, <hi>Let</hi>
Flavian <hi>be had in everlasting memory: Behold
Vengeance,</hi> [i. e. on his murderers.] <hi>Behold the
Truth!</hi> Flavian <hi>lives after death! Let</hi> Flavian
<hi>the Martyr pray for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. It remains in the last place, that an
<hi>Answer</hi> be given to the only <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gument</hi> out of
<hi>Antiquitie,</hi> produced by the <hi>Doctor</hi> against this

saies he,<note place="margin">Serm. pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>St. Augustin denies invocation of Saints
to have been in his daies:</hi> And his only proof
that he does so, is from those words of his,
<hi>The men of God</hi> (that is Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s departed) <hi>are
named indeed in their due place and order, but they
are not invoked by the Priest who Sacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. To this passage, our Answer it,
1. That sure the <hi>Preacher</hi> had forgot he was
to reckon, presently after, <hi>the Sacrifice of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49048:105"/>
Masse</hi> among <hi>Novelties,</hi> introduced after the
<hi>fourth General Council,</hi> when he produced
this <hi>Testimony</hi> that expresly proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
Here is a <hi>Sacerdos</hi> brought in, and here
he is brought in both praying and <hi>Sacrificing</hi>
and yet, saies the <hi>Doctor,</hi> no such thing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Christian Sacrifice.</hi> Or, if a Sacrifice, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> perhaps of <hi>praise</hi> and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
But St. <hi>Augustin</hi> will contradict
him, who as hath been said, calls this indeed
<hi>a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving in regard of glorified
Saints commemorated in it: but a Sacrifice propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
in regard of the faithful departed with some
stains of sins remaining,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The same thing St. <hi>Augustin</hi> means here
(i. e. <hi>That Saints are not soveraignly invocated
by way of Sacrifice, as the Supream Donors and
Fountain of all good that descends to mankind,)</hi>
is taught by the Catholic Church even where
she professes Invocation of Saints in the same
sense as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> allows it, that is, as of
our fellow-members and citizens, making ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
intercessions for us to this Supream
Deity to whom we Sacrifice. For thus saies
the <hi>Council of Trent,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. cap. 3.</note> Although the Church be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to celebrate Masses somtimes in the honour
and memory of Saints; yet she does not teach that
the Sacrifice should be offered to them, but to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
who has crown'd them: And hence it is that
the Priest is never wont to say, O</hi> Peter, <hi>O</hi> Paul,
<hi>I offer this Sacrifice to thee, but to God, to whom he
gives thanks for their Victories, and implores their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49048:105"/>
patronage, that they may vouchsafe to intercede for
us in Heaven, whole memory we celebrate on earth.</hi>
A part of which <hi>Decree</hi> is taken out of <hi>S.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de Cir. D. l. 8. c. 37. &amp; lib. 20. cont. Faust. M. c. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
himself in the same Treatise quoted by the <hi>Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> could not possibly have made
a worse choice of a place from whence to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
a <hi>Testimony</hi> (as he would have us believe)
denying <hi>all Invocation of Saints,</hi> whenas in
the <hi>two Chapters</hi> of the same Book immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preceding this, many stories are largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to certifie the great good that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
had found by the intercession of <hi>Saints,</hi>
and all this, whilst in their <hi>Oratories</hi> they
begg'd their intercession.</p>
            <p>4 Perhaps he will not yet be content:
but with Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>
               <note n="|" place="margin">Resp. ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog. c. 1. page 46.</note> will urge, it is
not here said by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> That the Saints
are not Sacrificed to, but that they are not so
much as invocated at the Altar. And if it
be unlawful to invocate them there, it will be
as well unlawful any where else. Hereto it
is answered, That all this, taken in a right
sense, is granted. For first, To this day in
the Masse there is no kind of Invocation of
Saints; yea more, according to the Council
of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Conc. Carth. cap. 23.</note> till the Consecration be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
there are no Prayers directed to the Son
of God, nor to the Holy Ghost, but only to
God the Father. 2. But this argues not
that (if the Church had so order'd it) it
might not have been lawful even at the Altar
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49048:106"/>
to have Invocated the Saints by such an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Invocation or Compellation as the
Church has determined, which is only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Card. Perron [prier pour prier]</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
them to pray for us: As even in the Masse
it self, the Priest requests the Assistants, saying,
<hi>Orate fraires, ut meum ac vestrum Sacrificium
acceptabile fiat apud Deum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ord. Missae.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom the
people Answers, <hi>Suscipiat Dominus Sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
de manibus tuis, &amp;c.</hi> 3. But as for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
sort of Invocation, which St. <hi>Austi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
only intended in this passage, and which he
calls <hi>Culium latriae,</hi> this is only due to God,
and without impiety cannot be made to
Saints: And thus St. <hi>Austin</hi> writing against
<hi>Faustus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aust. cont. Faust. l. 20. c 21.</note> the <hi>Manichean,</hi> fully justifies what he
saith in this passage.</p>
            <p>5. But after all this, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> allows
Invocation of Saints in an inferior way, do
but examin only these places in him—c. 4.
<hi>De curâ pro mortuis</hi> (a Book which he wrote
in Answer to a <hi>Quere</hi> of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Whether
it doth benefit any one after his death to have
his body buried in the Memorial of some
Saint)—<hi>When as</hi> (saith he) <hi>such conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the living are looked after</hi> [that is, of
burying their Friends in such sacred places]
<hi>whereby their pious affection may appear to their
Friends. I see not what advantages may accre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
[hereby] <hi>to the dead, except this; that whilst they
call to mind where the Bodies of those who are dear
unto them are laid, they with their Prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49048:106"/>
them to the same Saints, as it were to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
that by them they may be helped with our
Lord, which also they might do, although they could
not inter them in such places.—Whensoever
therefore the minde recounts, where the body of
some dear friend lies buried, and streight the place
occurs renown'd for the name of some Martyr, the
devotion of him, who thus remembers and prayes,
forthwith commends this beloved soul to the same
Martyr.</hi>

            <p>—<q>There was here in <hi>Hippo</hi> (saith

Tailor by Trade. He had lost his Cloak,
and had nothing wherewith to buy him
another. He prayed with a loud voice, to

here among us is very famous, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apparel
him. Some scoffing young men
by chance being near hand, over-heard him,

2. Indeed if the prohibition of <hi>Mariage</hi> to
some certain states of men or women be <hi>the
Doctrin of Devils,</hi> the <hi>Preacher</hi> has reason
rather to seperate himself from a Church that
enjoyns such a <hi>Diabolical vertue</hi> as <hi>Continence,</hi>
than from a wife that will not permit it, and
who perhaps and therefore a great influence
upon his zeal, more warm in this <hi>Novelty</hi> than
any of the rest. Though it is not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him, but esteem'd meritorious to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet let him take
heed how he blasphemes the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who, in
the same Epistle out of which the Doctor
quotes his <hi>Doctrin of Devils, forbids marriage to
Widows,</hi> who had consecrated themselves to
our Lord's service: <hi>Younger Widows refuse</hi> (says
he) <hi>for when they have begun to wax wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 11, 12.</note> they will mary: Having damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

The same is taught by St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
St. <hi>Hierons, Fulgentius, the fourth Council of
Carthage,</hi> (at which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was present)
&amp;c. And it is not contradicted by any one
<hi>Antient Doctor,</hi> nor any, except antient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reties,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49048:109"/>
Iovian, Vigilantius,</hi> &amp;c. And this surely
will suffice to demonstrate it, no <hi>Novelty</hi>
in God's Church, much lesse that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
a <hi>Doctrin of Devils,</hi> to <hi>forbid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>
to Persons consecrated to God's service.
Forbid it; I say, not the <hi>Gnosticks, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi>
&amp;c. forbad it, as an unlawful thing in it's
self, but only as an impediment and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a spiritual Vocation. Now whether <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
are esteem'd by the <hi>Preacher</hi> to be more
nearly and perfectly consecrated to the <hi>Divine
service,</hi> by the Office of <hi>Deaconesses,</hi> then
men by <hi>Priesthood,</hi> 'tis expected he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p>3. But for better clearing of this <hi>Point,</hi>
touching the <hi>prohibition of Mariage to persons
in holy Orders, &amp;c.</hi> in charity I must suppose
the Doctor will not professe the <hi>Heresie of
Iovinian,</hi> who taught that <hi>Virginity does not
excel Matrimony.</hi> An Heresie so contrary to
reason, that (as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> tell us) <hi>it was
presently extinguished and never could attain to
the deceiving so much as one Priest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. in. Haeres. 82.</note> This <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
formally contradicts St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaching
thus,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 34.</note> 
               <hi>There is difference between a wife and a
Virgin, The (Virgin) unmarried woman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for the things of our Lord, that shew ay be
holy both in body and spirit: But she that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
careth for the things of the world, how she
may please her husband.</hi> Which saying of the
<hi>Apostle</hi> certainly at least declares <hi>a state of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity</hi>
and continency much more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49048:110"/>
to promote the service of God and keep
the mind fixed on spiritual and heavenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
than <hi>a Married state,</hi> encombred
with worldly cares, and carnal appetites.
Thus much I doubt not will by the <hi>Preacher</hi> be
granted.</p>
            <p>4. But now the Question must be, whether
<hi>Eunuchism for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that
is, a perpetual abstinence from Marriage and
all carnal lusts may lawfully be by Priests, &amp;c.
made the matter of a Vow? That it is a
<hi>Council of Perfection</hi> is evident from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
speech, <hi>Qui potest capere, capiat.</hi> But
upon supposition that Continency is a special
<hi>gift of God, not bestow'd on all,</hi> and that it
is infinitely difficult for any one certainly to
know he has this <hi>Gift:</hi> for these and such like
reasons the <hi>Roformed Churches,</hi> in opposition
to the <hi>Roman Catholic,</hi> have generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the practice of such <hi>Vows,</hi> at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
as extending it self generally to any
whole <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>state</hi> of men, and especially
an Obligation imposed on them to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>5. On the other side the <hi>Roman Catholic
Church,</hi> though she acknowledges <hi>Continence</hi>
to be a special <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and that there may
be some difficulty to attain and preserve it, yet
esteems not these to be grounds sufficient to
relinquish the obligation of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>libacy in Priests,</hi>
&amp;c. which she submitted to from the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
Beginning,</hi> that is in the primitive times
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49048:110"/>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> at least within the <hi>four first
General Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It is granted then, that <hi>Continency,</hi>
(that is an ability to abstain (not from all
motions of Concupiscence but) from putting
in execution all motions, either by a voluntary
morose delectation in them, or much more
by outward unclean practises of them) <hi>is a
Gift of God,</hi> a fruit of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and
cannot by natural means be obtained so as to
be practised in obedience to him. But so are
all Christian vertues: So is <hi>Faith,</hi> so is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
so is <hi>Charity,</hi> all which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>we vow in our Baptism.</hi> And why do
we vow a practise of those <hi>vertues</hi> which are
pure <hi>Gifts of God?</hi> Because we are assured
the same God, who commands that <hi>Vow,</hi> will
not be wanting to supply strength to perform
it, in all those that sincerely beg those <hi>Gifts</hi>
of him by earnest Prayers made in Faith, and
by avoiding all known, and possible-to-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoided
impediments to the practise of those
vertues.</p>
            <p>7. But it will be said, that great difference
is to be made between that <hi>Continence</hi> which
is a <hi>Christian vertue</hi> necessary to all;<note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> a
<hi>Continence</hi> from all unlawful Lusts; and such
a <hi>Continence</hi> as is now treated of, which is an
<hi>Abstinence</hi> from Marriage, that is from the
lawful Remedies of unlawful Lusts, which
<hi>Abstinence</hi> is so far from being necessary to all,
that it is no more than a <hi>Council</hi> to those that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49048:111"/>
aspire to perfection, which are but few, even
in the opinion of the <hi>Roman-Church.</hi> This
<hi>Abstinence</hi> certainly is a <hi>far more special</hi> Gift of
God, say they, and not too easily and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be presumed on.</p>
            <p>8. All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Sol.</note> this likewise understood <hi>cum grano
Salis,</hi> is acknowledged by us. Yet withall
<hi>Protestants</hi> know that even this <hi>Abstinence</hi>
from <hi>Marriage,</hi> or from exercising the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acts in Marriage is a <hi>Gift</hi> bestowed on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many, and in some cases necessary to almost
every one. For otherwise it would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawful for Parents to keep their children
unmarried after the time they are capable,
and thereby to expose them to unlawful lusts,
since it seems they are not sure they have such
a <hi>Gift:</hi> it would be unlawful for <hi>Merchants</hi>
and <hi>Travellers</hi> to make long voyages abroad,
and leave their Wives at home deprived of the
necessary lawful <hi>Remedies</hi> against <hi>Lust</hi> and
Temptations to which they are exposed. All
<hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Colledges</hi> ought to be repealed,
which forbid <hi>Marriage</hi> still to all <hi>Fellows,</hi> and
heretofore to all <hi>Presidents,</hi> upon penalty of
forfeiting their whole subsistence. A long
Sickness inflicted by God on either of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Couples, would be far more dangerous to
their Souls than their Bodies, so as if such an
Abstinence, as is now spoken of, were such
an extraordinary <hi>Gift</hi> of Perfection, <hi>England</hi>
would have more <hi>Saints,</hi> or more <hi>Adulterers,</hi>
&amp;c. than she is aware of. And here good <hi>Doctor</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:49048:111"/>
I desire you tell me a thing that perhaps you
have not thought on, yet will easily perceive
its meaning assoon as you think on't. What is
the reason that the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
marry not till they are above thirty years
of age? Can they abstain all that while, when
their passions are stronger, and their reason
weaker, and then, after so long a Continency
begin to plead 'tis impossible for them to hold
any longer, unlesse they had the gift of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
which God bestows not on every one?
shall I give you my Conjecture? I doubt they
force themselves to live single till they have a
Benefice, and then, assoon as they can maintain
a wife, they get one: is not this meer hypocrisie
to talk of Marrying out of tenderness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to allay their Concupiscence, when
the danger is almost all past; and make no
provision to prevent the sins of the unrulyest
part of their age? Methinks they should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marry earlyer, when they may justly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their Chastity, before they have tryed
themselves; or live longer Batchellors, when
they may prudently hope by the grace of God
to persevere after so much experience of their
continency.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Catholicks</hi> therfore, though they confesse
this <hi>continence</hi> to be a <hi>special Gift of God not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on all,</hi> because all do not use the means,
yet resolve it is such a special gift as is denyed
to none, who rightly seek it, and conceive,
it also may be made the matter of a vow by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49048:112"/>
those, who have a steddy purpose to use the
necessary means to attain and conserve it,
and by those who by humble and due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
themselves, are perswaded that God
calls them to a state of greater <hi>Perfection,</hi> and
being in that state depend on his grace for
performing their <hi>Vow,</hi> seeking his assistance
by constant <hi>Prayers,</hi> watchfulnesse, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
penitential austerities. Now those
may be confident they are called to such a
state, either in a <hi>Monastical</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical
Profession,</hi> who betake themselves thereto, not
out of any worldly respects, for gaining a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
or preferment, or other temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations,
but purely to avoid the tentations,
solicitudes and distractions of the world and
flesh, and to devote themselves more to the
service of God, and advancing their <hi>Souls</hi> in
vertue and piety. In this state of <hi>Perfection,</hi>
and in complying with this <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
those, who duly undertake that state,
may as undoubtedly promise to themseves
Gods assistance whilst they use the means to
obtain it, as generally all Christians may after
the vow of <hi>Baptism.</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> writes
thus,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. 131.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> vow'd, <hi>as having the matter in</hi>
his own power: And yet he beggs withall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f God
that he may perform what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e vow'd. Here is
the devotion of one that vows: here is the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of one that prays. Let no man presume on his
own strength, as if he were able of himself to
perform what he shall vow. He that exhorts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49048:112"/>
thee to vow [saying <hi>Vovete &amp; reddite</hi>] <hi>the
same God helps thee to perform what thou hast
vow'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. If then it be lawfull for private persons
to vow <hi>Celibacy,</hi> surely it is lawful for the
Church to enjoyn it: her Doctrin being, <hi>That
Goddenies not the gift of Chastity to them who ask
it aright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Trid, Sess. 24. Can.</note> 
               <hi>nor suffers us to be tempted above what
we are able.</hi> Which Doctrin is the ground
why the Church enjoyns Celibacy to Priests:
So that <hi>Chastity</hi> is called a <hi>special Gift,</hi> not in
this sence, as it all men, though using what
means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oever, are not capable of it: But it is
such a <hi>Gift</hi> as many men never actually receive
from God, because they do not use the means:
and such a <hi>Gift</hi> as few also will endeavour to
use the means to attain, because these means
are harder than those by which other <hi>Gifts</hi> may
be attained. That the undertaking by <hi>Vow</hi>
such a life of Chastity, and abstinence from
<hi>Marriage,</hi> yea in Marriage it self, has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
commended, and practised in Gods

says confidently, That St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and

manifestly the word of God, saying, upon
the Apostles words, If any widows how young
soever have vowed themselves to God, &amp;c.
and afterwards shall go to secular Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
they shall according to the Apostle have
damnation: because they dared to make void
the vow of Chastity made to God. The
Centurists affirm it to be manifest by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that in those times men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to have too much liking of the Profession
of Virginity: for he says, Let Virgins consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to whom they have consecrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>11. And as for the <hi>Doctrin of Devils</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Preacher, he may do well to sit him
down and consider the words of the Apostle,
and the comments of the Fathers on them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better. First he will find the Apostle, in
his opposing those, who in the latter times
should forbid to marry, and command to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from meats, to argue against them thus:
That every Creature and Ordinance of God is
good (according to Gen. 1. 31. &amp; 2. 23, 24.)
and therefore, being sanctified first by the word
of <hi>God</hi> and Prayer, may lawfully be used. (See
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.) which plainly shews, that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> means such Apostates as abstain from,
or prohibit Marriage and Meats as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49048:113"/>
unlawful and unclean and contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Which thing can neither be objected to
the antient nor modern Church-practise, using
abstinence from some meats for the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body, not for any uncleanesse in
the food, and not forbidding Marriage to any
single person absolutely, but only upon his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
undertaking such an employment, with
which they imagin a married condition not so
well to sute. In which case, if necessary absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from Marriage be a fault, the Apostle
himself may seem to comply with it in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of his forementioned concerning the
Widows, 1 <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it manifest by experience, that this prophecy of
the Apostle was most eminently fulfilled in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons of these latter times (whom these
Fathers even in these points most vehemently
resisted) they affirming downright all Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
especially with reference to procreation of

by them in such manner to use their Wives, as
to avoid this: See <hi>S. Aug. De Morib. Manich.</hi>

may collect from the following Testimonies.
Therefore not to insist upon the generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd

<hi>Matrimony,</hi> (of a dispensation from which not

was forbidden, 1. By the <hi>Second Council

<hi>Whereas Relation was made of the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence

which if they do not, let them be removed from
their Ecclesiastical Office. As for other inferior

it was no other, nor ought to have been put in
<hi>practice</hi> upon other grounds then the <hi>Christian
Divorce,</hi> allow'd by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that is, for

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> there might follow that <hi>Divorce, a
second Mariage</hi> by either of the parties, whether
innocent or guilty: Yet not upon every cause

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Iews practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

only <hi>propter turpitudinem,</hi> for some notorious
uncleannesse extreamly distastful. Now, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
such <hi>permission,</hi> which was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>for the hardness of Iewish hearts,</hi> their Divorce
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or any other cause, and especially their second
<hi>Marriage after it,</hi> was not excused from sin, but
only from a legal punishment: And the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
motive was, left worse effects, as poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or any other way of murdering, &amp;c. should
be practised by the discontented party, in case
a total separation might not be permitted.
<hi>This Supremest Degree</hi> of Jewish Separation
(or <hi>Repudium</hi>) does not intirely dissolve the
<hi>Matrimonial Contract,</hi> which being consummate
of its own nature i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> indissoluble; for the
parties, being by Matrimony become <hi>One flesh;</hi>
and one Principle of a new stock, cannot by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49048:119"/>
any <hi>following</hi> act or accident, but only <hi>Death,</hi>
become two again, so as to be in the same ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
as they were before they were married<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And for this reason the <hi>Iews,</hi> though permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to marry afterward, yet sinned in so doing
against the primary Precept of God. <hi>Those
whom God hath joyned, let no man separate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Much lesse does the <hi>second species of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
or the proper <hi>Christian Divorce</hi> dissolve
this tye. The only lawful cause of which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
is by our <hi>Savior</hi> allow'd, and by the
<hi>Catholic Church</hi> acknowledged to be <hi>Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
(that is indeed, <hi>Adultery:</hi>) under which are
likewise comprehended, as our most learned
Doctors say, other more grievous sins of <hi>unn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Lusts.</hi> And the reason why only such
sins may (not must) cause such a perpetual se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is, because they alone are directly
contrary to <hi>Conjugal Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> By this separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whensoever it is caused by the crime of
the one party,) neither of them, (not the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
party) are permitted to betake themselves
to a second Marriage: for then they could no
be reconciled but by a new <hi>Marriage:</hi> And here
the <hi>Preacher</hi> may do well to consider what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> who, against our <hi>Saviours Law</hi>
(as all Antiquity, and the practice of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Reform'd Church</hi> interpret it) contends for
the lawful Marriage of the innocent party, so
teaching formal <hi>Adultery.</hi> This separation
for such a legal cause is perpetual, that is, the
innocent persons may deprive the others of
the right they have over their bodies, and are
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49048:119"/>
in a free condition even after the faulty persons
repentance, whether or no to receive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into their former condition: Neither
can it be imputed to the innocent person, if the
criminal should by such a separation fall into
the sin of adultery.</p>
            <p>7. The other two <hi>Separations</hi> (not <hi>Divorces</hi>)
one whereof is only [<hi>a toro</hi>] from the <hi>Bed,</hi> the
other from <hi>Cohabitation</hi> also, may be made for
other causes, besides <hi>fornication.</hi> As for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
infectious diseases; for almost irreconcileable
quarrels, for attempts of killing or wounding
one another, &amp;c. Such Separations are not so
perpetual as <hi>Divorces,</hi> each of the parties being
bound; assoon as these impediments of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
conversation are removed, to return, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to a <hi>Matrimonial Amity</hi> and <hi>Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
And till then, I would ask the <hi>Doctor,</hi>
whether he have the courage to admit into his
Bed, or even his house, a Serpent not only full
of venom, but ready and attempting to kill him
with it? Or if he have not this courage, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will acknowledg such a separation so
necessary, even to the preservation of life, to be
a <hi>Divorce</hi> damnable, because not for <hi>fornication?</hi>
What he will answer, I know not; But what he
must, if he go about to maintain his Assertion,
I am certain will be very irrational.</p>
            <p>8. Let him reflect on the practise of his own
Church, where he cannot but have heard of
the common distinction of Divorces <hi>A Vinculo
Matrimonii, &amp; à mensa &amp; toro:</hi> these two are
both allow'd in <hi>England:</hi> now I ask the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
of which does our Saviour speak? If he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49048:120"/>
say of the first, then clearly the Husband of an
Adultresse may marry again; which is contrary
to the Law: if he say of the second, still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
contradicts his own Law, which every day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
a separation for other Causes, besides that
of Fornication. Can we believe the Doctor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read the ordinary Cases wherein Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orses
are granted, as <hi>Pre-contract, Fear, Frigidity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity?</hi>
&amp;c. all which dissolve the very
Marriage it self, and yet in all these the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was valid, till actual divorce, and the
children shall bear the Fathers name, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
his lands, if there never happen an actual
divorce; this the wise men of our Nation do,
and never think they <hi>open a way to rebel against
Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> Something like this, for the second
branch of the distinction,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> 
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> himself does,
and sure he cannot be <hi>opposite to the will of our
Saviour; If,</hi> says he, <hi>the Vnbeliever depart, let
him depart, a Brother or Sister is not subject in
such cases,</hi> that is, the Innocent may remain
separate: and why may not the laws of a Nation
regulate that liberty, which the Apostle allows
to every private Person? or why may not a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

the laws of a particular Nation? Thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

but <hi>damnation</hi> is by the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally
denounced as the portion of all.</p>
            <p>4. The true <hi>Reason</hi> whereof may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the example of all other <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi>
whatsoever. The greatest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
a Subject can commit against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49048:122"/>
is an actual attempt, or rather the
attempt executed, by which <hi>Monarchy</hi> is
disolved: Inwardly to condemn the <hi>Laws
of such a Government,</hi> to entertain <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
which if put in practise, would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
Subjects from their due Obedience,
is an offence of an high nature, but the
actual <hi>cantonising</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the
raising in it <hi>Courts, or Iudicatories</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on, and opposite to the <hi>Common
Tribunal</hi> of the Country, is the utmost of
all crimes: both the <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>Seduced</hi>
are not only deprived of the priviledges
belonging to good Subjects, but pursued
by Arms as the worst of all <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is so in <hi>God's Church;</hi> The main
thing our <hi>Creed</hi> teaches us to believe of it,
is its <hi>unity,</hi> without which it is not a

like expression hath St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There are very few <hi>Heresies</hi> (that
is, only such <hi>Errors</hi> as are formally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to those very few verities or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> without an explicite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
whereof no man can be saved) which
do in themselves, simply, as false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
universally destroy Salvation: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if they have the <hi>formality of Heresie</hi>
joyned to them, and be maintained with
a knowledge that they are contrary to the
sence and authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> then
they have involved in them something of
<hi>Schism,</hi> or at least they are in an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
disposition to <hi>Schism,</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
all <hi>Heresies,</hi> though in Points of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
less important, are damnative. But
<hi>Schism</hi> alone, though there be no <hi>Heresie</hi>
joyned with it, immediately divides from
the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and consequently from
<hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>7. But may not <hi>ignorance</hi> excuse the guilt
of <hi>Schism?</hi> No: on the contrary in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it aggravates it. For though <hi>Pride</hi>
and <hi>Malice</hi> be far greater in the <hi>Leading
Schismaticks,</hi> persons of wit and learning:
yet <hi>ignorant souls</hi> and ideots seem more to
contradict human reason; because the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49048:123"/>
more ignorant they ought to know they
are, and being confessedly no <hi>Pastors,</hi> the
more ought they to submit their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Authority, and consequently
the preferring their own conduct; or the
conduct and direction of particular men
or Churches, before the <hi>universal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Church, the excommunicating
(as it were) the whole Church of God,
the esteeming all Christians, both <hi>Pastors</hi>
and <hi>Flocks, as Heathens and Publicans,</hi> is a
presumption so contrary to human nature
and reason, that their want of learning is
that which will most condemn them. I
speak not now of persons absolutely <hi>ideots,</hi>
who scarce know there are any other <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
or any other <hi>Church</hi> then their own,
who pretend not at all to pass their
judgements on other Religions; but know
only what their <hi>Pastors</hi> teach them, having
no ability, by reason of their condition,
to examine <hi>Scriptures</hi> and Churches: For
such no doubt, may by their simplicity
and absolute invincible ignorance, escape
the malignity of <hi>Schism.</hi> But I speak of
inferiour Tradesmen, of Gentlemen and
Gentlewomen, who have a capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly instructed, and better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that spiritual authority to which
they owe their subjection, and yet who, by
their own perversness, become trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> take upon them to
judge of the sence of them, both for
themselves and their <hi>Pastors,</hi> &amp;c. Such as
these no doubt have drunk in the very
gall of <hi>Schism,</hi> by usurping an authority,
which express Scripture sayes belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Pastors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Some learned persons (particularly
<hi>Doctor Steward)</hi> attribute much to the
temper of the <hi>English Church,</hi> which he
sayes is like St. <hi>Cyprians, Neminem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demantes,
aut a communione separantes:</hi>
and this alone they suppose will exempt
<hi>Protestants</hi> (as it did St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) from the
imputation and penalty of <hi>Schism,</hi> to
which other violent <hi>Calvinistical Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi>
are more obnoxious. But the case
is not the same: This indeed did exempt
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> because as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes,
the Church had not then decided the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
to whose decision St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would
certainly have submitted. The case of
Protestants is evidently different. If a
<hi>Province</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had withdrawn it self
from the publick civil authority, would
this excuse serve them to say, <q>
                  <hi>We do
not intend to quarrel with those that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in obedience to the King, we mean nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him nor them any harm, they shall be
welcom to come among us, if they will, we
will be good friends, we will not meddle with
their doings: But we will be govern'd only
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49048:124"/>
by our own Laws and Magistrates</hi>
               </q> &amp;c? I
believe not: Their civility in their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
will not change the Title of their
crime, nor free them from the <hi>punishment
due to it:</hi> it may perhaps qualifie the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
resentment; but the <hi>civillest Treason</hi> is
<hi>Treason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Being to examine the <hi>Doctor's Plea,</hi>
touching the Point of <hi>Schism,</hi> I thought
requisite to premise this consideration of
its heynousness, that both he and my self
also, should consider it as the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of all other, in which the least mistake
will prove mortal. I will add a bold word,
and undertake to justifie it: Though it
were far more probable that the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> had been guilty of <hi>Innovation</hi> in
all the Points mentioned by the <hi>Doctor:</hi> yet
since by the <hi>Protestants</hi> confession those
<hi>Points</hi> are not <hi>fundamental,</hi> their voluntary
separating themselves from her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
will be in God's esteem very <hi>Schism.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>How the Preacher vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to excuse his Church
from Schism. Of the Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and Synods. The breach
of their Subordination, is the
cause of all dis-unions and
Schisms. The unappealable
Authority of general Councils,
acknowledged by Antiquity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. <hi>IN this point of</hi> Schism, <hi>to the end
the</hi> Doctor <hi>may clear</hi> Protestants, <hi>and
lay the weight of so great a crime on the
Catholick Church, he argues thus,</hi> Since
besides corruptions in practice (which yet alone
cannot justify separation) there were in the
Roman Church so many corruptions in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49048:125"/>
likewise intrenching on Fundamentals,
the Schism could not be on the Chruch of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands
side, which was obliged to separate,
so just a cause being given, but on theirs,
who gave the cause of the separation? Now,
that particular Nations have a power to
purge themselves from corruptions without
leave from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears 1. By
the concession of the most learned Popish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
2. From the ancient practise of the
Kings of England, who were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
3. Likewise from the Codes and Novels of
<hi>Justinian,</hi> the capitulare of Charlemagne,
and the endeavours of two late Emperours.
4. From the examples of the Kings of <hi>Juda.</hi>
He concludes, that had the Pope been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his Primacy of Order, they would
never have cast off the yoke, which never had
been put upon their necks; whence appears,
sayes he, that the Vsurper made the Schism.
<hi>This is the substance of his</hi> Discourse.</p>
            <p>2. In answering this, I will proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this method. 1. I will shew
out of Antiquity, from the example of all
orderly Governments, from evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
&amp;c. what <hi>obedience</hi> every Christian is
obliged to perform to <hi>Church Governors,</hi>
in the obstinate refusal of which, consists
<hi>Schism.</hi> 2. I will apply this to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
controversie, between the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> I will consider the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of his allegations, and leave it to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49048:125"/>
any indifferent mans conscience to judge
whether they are sufficient to justifie the
<hi>separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Touching the <hi>first Point,</hi> I take it for
granted, that we both agree that our
Lord has placed in his Church, <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Governours,</hi> to continue by a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
succession, to the end of the world:
And that the exercise of their <hi>Authority,</hi>
consists partly in proposing <hi>Doctrines</hi> to be
believed, partly in making Laws for <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
and <hi>Order.</hi> And that the Doctrines
are to be no other, then such as either are
expresly, or at least, in their immediate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<hi>Principles,</hi> contained in <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:</hi>
no innovation, no change must
be in them; whereas orders for <hi>Discipline</hi>
may, according to the prudence of the
Church, sometimes admit alteration.
Likewise I believe, we agree that this
lawful Authority of <hi>Church Governours,</hi> or
<hi>Bishops,</hi> may be differently exercised, that
is, either by their single persons, or in
conjunction with others, meeting in <hi>Synods
Diocesan, Provincial, National, Patriarki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and Oecumenical:</hi> The Authority of
which <hi>Synods,</hi> is by degrees respectively
encreased, according to the quality of
them; the lowest degree among these,
being <hi>Diocesan,</hi> and the <hi>Supream</hi> unappeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
authority being in <hi>Oecumenical Synods.</hi>
To deny this in gross, is to make them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49048:126"/>
ridiculous <hi>Conventicles;</hi> and the more
<hi>plenary</hi> they are, the more dangerous and
destructive of <hi>unity</hi> will they be, if they
may be repealed by others less <hi>plenary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Thus far we agree; but when we
come to a precise declaration of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that Authority, by both sides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on in the general, here we begin to
differ; wherefore to the end, indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Readers</hi> may be enabled distinctly, to
view and judge on which side Justice and
Truth lies; I will, besides what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been said of <hi>infallibility,</hi> plainly set
down the <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> concerning
this matter, with the exceptions, which
the most learned Controvertists of the
<hi>English Church</hi> have interposed against it.</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">Clem. Constit. l. 6. cap. 14.</note> There is in St. <hi>Clements Constitutions,</hi>
a saying, that to <hi>every Bishop is entrusted

                  </gap>] the Episcopal Office Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally.</hi>
In like manner St. <hi>Cyprian says,
[Episcopatus unus est, cujus a singulis in
solidum pars tenetur] The Episcopal Office is
but one,<note place="margin">Cypr. l. de. unit. Eccles.</note> of which every Bishop holds his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in common.</hi> The meaning of which
speeches is not, that every particular <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
is, in regard of his Jurisdiction, an
<hi>Oecumenical Bishop:</hi> But since the Church
in general is truly and perfectly <hi>one Body,</hi>
each <hi>Bishop</hi> in it is so to administer his
Charge, as that he must have an eye to
the whole.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49048:126"/>
               <hi>Dioceses</hi> and <hi>Provinces, &amp;c.</hi> are not to be
esteem'd as so many <hi>Secular Principalities</hi>
independent and absolute, which can
publish <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> without any
regard to their <hi>Neighbours</hi> profit, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
It is not so in the <hi>Church;</hi> But
every <hi>Bishop,</hi> in executing his <hi>Episcopal
Office,</hi> ought much more to be sollicitous
of the general <hi>Vnity,</hi> Peace, and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> than of his
own <hi>Diocese:</hi> So that if any <hi>Law,</hi> Custom,
or Doctrine in it be discordant from,
but especially if it condemn what is by
<hi>Law</hi> in force in <hi>the Province, Patriarchat,</hi>
or much more the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> such
a <hi>Law</hi> ought not to be made, or being
made, ought to be Repealed.</p>
            <p>6. As for the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Bishops in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
particularly in declaring <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
(for in that we are at present principally
concern'd) Such Authority may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to extend it self either to the <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-ward-contra-Profession</hi>
only, or to the
<hi>inward assent, &amp;c.</hi> Between which two
there is a great difference.</p>
            <p>7. The common received <hi>Catholick
Doctrine</hi> teacheth, that whereas in <hi>General
Councils</hi> (the only Tribunal which is by
all acknowledg'd to be infallible) there
may be either, 1. A <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary
Doctrines,</hi> which formerly before
such <hi>Declaration</hi> did not evidently and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49048:127"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niversally appear to be <hi>Traditionary:</hi>
2. Or a <hi>Decision</hi> of <hi>Debates</hi> about clear
and immediate <hi>Consequences</hi> of such
<hi>Doctrines.</hi> In both these the <hi>Church</hi> is
<hi>infallible,</hi> Infallible I say (not to enlarge
Disputes beyond the present exigence) at
least in all points any way necessary to
our Salvation; and this grounded upon
those sure Promises of our Lord made to
these Guides of his Church mentioned
before, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. 11, 12. And hence such
both <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Decisions</hi> are to be
not only not contradicted, but submitted
to by an internal assent; the undiscover'd
refusal of which assent, though it doth
not render the refusers <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the
judgement of the <hi>Church,</hi> as upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
or refusal of assent would (for
<hi>Ecclesia non judicat de internis:</hi>) Yet since
such <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Decisions</hi> are alwayes
attended either with express, or at least
imply'd <hi>Anathemas</hi> to contrary Doctrines,
the contrary internal Judgments are <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Of the acknowledged <hi>Infallibility</hi>
of the Representative Church in <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
of <hi>Traditionary Doctrines,</hi> we have
sufficient Testimonies from <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
St.<note place="margin">Athan. Ep. ad Epict. Epiph. Haer. 77.</note> 
               <hi>Athanasius,</hi> quoted also by St. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
professes, That <hi>he wonders how any

of such Councils cannot be changed
without errour;</hi> Therefore they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,
and in our sense <hi>infallible.</hi> Nor
can there be any doubt, but those <hi>matters
defin'd,</hi> were Ancient and Traditionary
Doctrines.<note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 162. id. lib. 4. de Trin.</note> And St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes, <hi>The

and after by the <hi>Donatists,</hi> says,
<hi>That for that Doctrine</hi> (which was truly

but St. Cyprian not: Why?</hi> Because it was
<hi>permitted to the former Fathers and Bishops
to debate, and, without breaking Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to determine oppositly to one another in
Provincial Councils: Till in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
the true Orthodox Doctr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Authority</hi> (says he) <hi>St. Cyprian, if it had
been declared in his time, would without any
doubt at all have believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. In the next place, as touching <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of <hi>Controversies</hi> about (not expressly
<hi>Traditionary Doctrines,</hi> but) clear and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
consequences of such <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
it is absolutely necessary oft-times, for
the Church to make such <hi>Decisions;</hi> for
otherwise the <hi>Devil</hi> would have power to
undermine a great part of our <hi>Faith,</hi> if
permission were given to maintain freely,
any thing that does not appear to any
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49048:128"/>
one expresly, either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or in
<hi>Tradition.</hi> Thus, many of the <hi>Articles</hi> of
the <hi>Nicen, Constantinopolitan,</hi> and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian
Creeds,</hi> are only the clear and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Consequences of express <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which <hi>Articles,</hi> in the <hi>Terms</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were there conceived, were not
absolutely necessary to be believed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the arising of <hi>Heresies,</hi> forced the
Church further to explain the <hi>Faith.</hi>
And hence it is, that the Enlargements
and clearer Explanations of our <hi>Faith,</hi>
in many <hi>Doctrines,</hi> otherwise not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be so generally known, must and will
encrease to the worlds end, in case <hi>New
Heresies</hi> arise.</p>
            <p>10. Now such <hi>Decisions</hi> are truly <hi>de fide,</hi>
or objects of our <hi>Faith:</hi> For though it
be most certain, that the <hi>Church</hi> neither
hath, nor pretends to have any <hi>New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations;</hi>
of Christian verities, but the
same <hi>Faith</hi> which was delivered by the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> is still the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and no more: There are no Additions
made, no <hi>new Articles</hi> invented: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the same <hi>Articles,</hi> by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Heresies</hi> arising, may in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times be further explained, and the
<hi>Truths</hi> implicitely involved in them may
be discovered.</p>
            <p>In like manner, some <hi>Traditionary points</hi>
convey'd by the general practice of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49048:128"/>
Church, when they come to be question'd
or denyed by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> are often expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
declared in <hi>Councils</hi> to be <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
by which Declaration, there is no
new thing taught, but that which was
formerly involved, is more clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
and that which was taught by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is declared by words, and that
which was known to the learneder part of
Christians, becomes extended to all:
Thus the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Purgatory, Prayer for
the Dead, Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. have
been in later <hi>Councils</hi> made <hi>Articles,</hi> not
<hi>de novo,</hi> (as the <hi>Doctor</hi> misapprehends) but
they are lately testified to have been so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
believed; and so are all other new
decisions of later Councils, Points of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Faith, either in themselves explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or in their necessary principles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely.
And if, after such decisions of
Councils, there ariseth a new obligation;
that none can dissent from them without
incurring the guilt of Disobedience, so
was there before an obligation of non-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
from the same Points without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into Error; and that in a matter of
Divine Revelation. Such Points were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
matter of faith, if we would believe,
in those particulars, what was Divine
Truth; though now indeed more necessary
matter of our faith, out of the obedience
also and submission that we owe to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49048:129"/>
Church's judgement; to which judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we could have no obligation, before
she declared it. Neither can this be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
when ever the Church is by new risen
Errors necessitated to state or declare such
a Divine Truth, but that such a new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
will arise to Christians, in relation
to Her, of believing it; else to what end
does the state it? Which obligation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a restraint of our former liberty indeed,
whereby we might then believe an error
in divine matters, without the guilt of
disobeying the Church; but this restraint
is much for our benefit in our knowing
and holding some truth now, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we did not formerly, and that in a
time, when we are in more danger, from
Seducers, of falling into the contrary Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
And now behold, these necessary
decisions are called the Church's new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith; this is her chief accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the same clamour now raised by
the Preacher against the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
for this matter, as was anciently <hi>by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
against the first General Council,
who cryed out against the new Article
and word <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> which was not
found in their former Creed; as was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>by the Nestorians</hi> against the third
General Council, and <hi>by the Eutychians</hi>
against the fourth. And therefore, why
may not the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49048:129"/>
return the same answer to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
as the fourth General Council, which
he professeth to allow, did to the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians?</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Conclus. <hi>of the Synod</hi> ad Marcianum Imperat.</note>
—<hi>A not-much-discussed expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the faith is sufficient (say they) for
the benefit of sincere Believers. But for those
who endeavour to pervert the true Doctrine,
'tis necessary to make opposition to all those
things which they erroneously broach, and to
provide fit remedies to their objections. For
if all would willingly acquiesce to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the</hi> [Nicene] <hi>Faith, and would
disturb this clear way of Piety with no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
it were meet, for the posterity of the
Church, to excogitate</hi> [in their Councils]
<hi>no new additions. But because there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that decline from this right line, through
the crooked paths of error, we are confirained
with new discovery of truth to reduce them,
and to refute their straying opinions with
wholsom additions</hi> [i. e. to the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church.] <hi>Not, as if we
were ever seeking out some new thing tending
to Godliness, as though the former faith were
defective, but that we may seek out those
things which are judged salutary and beneficial
in opposition to those things which are innovated
by them.</hi> Thus that Council, whose
words clearly demonstrate, that Councils
may define, not only traditionals in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, but any new conclusions
which are necessarily and evidently deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49048:130"/>
from them. And here let the equal
Reader judge, whether the Doctor hath
more reason to complain of the Councils
new Articles, or the Council of his, and
his Predecessors new Errors. Out of
which evil yet, the wisdom of God, in
the several ages, brings this good (as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius</hi>

scandalized at the divisions and novelties
of opinions that arose amongst Christians)
that by occasions of Heresies <hi>the Orthodox
dogmes are more accurately polished, and more
entirely compiled, and that by this means the
Church every day increaseth in knowledge:</hi>
i. e. by having the explicite Articles of
her Faith more and more enlarged. As
we see how much even in early times the
<hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed (by the springing up of
several Heresies in those days) had enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Apostolick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. All these Declarations and Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
framed by General Councils, we <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks</hi> do esteem our selves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the assent unto, which is far more
then not to contradict. And this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is founded on the <hi>Infallible Authority</hi>
which we acknowledge in the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> derived from the promises of
<hi>Christ, whose Spirit shall lead her into all
Truth:</hi> The denial of which assent we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to be <hi>formal Heresie:</hi> and an open
contradiction to which Authority; is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Schism.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49048:130"/>
12. This we are taught concerning our
<hi>Duty</hi> and Submission to <hi>General Councils.</hi>
And hereto we must add, that considering
the present distracted state of the <hi>Christian
world,</hi> and especially the Schism pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
persisted in by the Eastern Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks,
who live under the Tyranny of the
Turk, and therefore will never probably
be permitted to convene for the general
Union of Christendom, it is almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
impossible that such <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
should now be assembled with all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
as the <hi>four first</hi> were, wherein all
the <hi>five Patriarks</hi> were present, at least by
their <hi>Deputies.</hi> Yet, notwithstanding all
this, we cannot without infidelity doubt
that <hi>God</hi> will be wanting to his <hi>Church</hi> to
preserve it in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Vnity.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> cannot be
expected, as was during the times of the
<hi>Roman Empire,</hi> the Supremest that can
now be had, ought to have the force and
vertue of obliging, which the former ones
had; the <hi>Anathemas</hi> of it must be as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid;
the <hi>Decisions</hi> of it as much to be
submitted to, and a renunciation of its
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> as heynously <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
as of any <hi>Council</hi> that ever went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Therefore <hi>Doctor Bramhal, Lord
Primate of Armagh,</hi> in the <hi>Preface of his
Reply</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that he submits himself to the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49048:131"/>
Church, that is, to <hi>a free General
Council,</hi> most rationally adds this clause,
or <hi>to so General, as can be procured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. Thus of <hi>General Councils.</hi> As for
inferior subordinate <hi>Councils,</hi> though their
<hi>Decrees</hi> touching <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> for
<hi>Discipline</hi> are not unappealable, yet an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
in both these respects, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on <hi>Christians</hi> living respectively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Precincts. The <hi>Decisions</hi> of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synod</hi> are to be internally assented
to, except they be evidently erroneous, or
contradictory to those of a <hi>Superior Synod,</hi>
so that without <hi>Schism</hi> they cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
contradicted. Yet the same <hi>Decisions</hi>
may be annulled by a <hi>Patriarchical Synod:</hi>
And all by an <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> of which alone
all the <hi>Decisions</hi> and Laws are <hi>irreversible,</hi>
because there is no Authority upon earth
superior to it, and in all <hi>Governments</hi> an
inferior Authority can never reverse what
hath once been established by a Superior,
especially if that establishment hath been
actually submitted to: For, if a <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Synod</hi> could annul the formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Acts</hi> of a <hi>National,</hi> or a <hi>National</hi> of a
<hi>Patriarchical,</hi> there must of necessity follow
a Dissolution of all Government and <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
as to the whole Catholick Church,
yet we profess in our Creed, <hi>Vnam Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicam</hi>—Add
to this, that in all <hi>Synods</hi>
the <hi>Major part</hi> alwayes must decide: so
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49048:131"/>
that the fewer, however they may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
the better or more learned, must
submit to them: These likewise all use of
meetings and consultations will be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.</p>
            <p>14. This <hi>fundamental Rule of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Vnity</hi> is the only true, uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Touch-stone,</hi> by which a judgement is to
be made concerning <hi>Schism;</hi> If <hi>Doctor
Pierce</hi> can furnish us with a better, let it
be produced: but that being impossible,
he must give us leave to make use of this
to examin the cause between the <hi>Roman
Catholick Church,</hi> and all other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
that call themselves <hi>Reformed.</hi> But
indeed it is lost labour to apply such a <hi>Rule</hi>
as this to any <hi>Calvinistical, Independent,</hi> or
<hi>Fanatick Congregations,</hi> because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
both all such <hi>Laws,</hi> and the whole
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of those that made
them: Therefore (leaving them to
the severe judgement of him who said,
<hi>Where are those my enemies that will not
have me to rule over them?<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note>)</hi> I will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Controversie,</hi> as the <hi>Preacher</hi> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, between the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> and
<hi>English Protestant Churches,</hi> I say [<hi>as he
hath stated it</hi>] because being to treat of
<hi>Schism,</hi> he hath given the right notion of
it, and not mispent time and paper, as
some others have done, with vain discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of an <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External separation,</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:49048:132"/>
&amp;c. as if there were no danger in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Schism</hi> or dividing of Communion,

            </argument>
            <p>The foresaid <hi>fundamental Rule</hi> of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>That no Laws can validly
be repealed by an Authority Inferior to that, by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49048:133"/>
which they were Enacted,</hi> is a Rule not now
invented to serve our present purpose, but
written in the hearts of all mankind, that
consider what Government is; and it is,
as to <hi>Church-matters,</hi> particularly taken
notice of by St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the Order that is in the Church,
and which alone can keep it in unity;
<hi>Particular Writings of Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de Bapt. cont. Donat. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 3.</note> saies he, <hi>if
any Error be in them, may be corrected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more learned, or by Synods; and Synods
themselves assembled either in Provinces, or
Regions ought without any tergiversation to
yield and submit to the Authority of Plenary
Councils; and oftimes former Plenary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
may be corrected by other following Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This most Irrefragable <hi>Rule,</hi> is that
by which <hi>Schism</hi> may most certainly, and
undeniably be discovered. And therefore
though in gross it be admitted by <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
(I mean the wisest and most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them) yet out of a necessity of
maintaining the grounds of the <hi>English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
they put such restrictions &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to it, as utterly take away all use
of it. For whereas S. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to reside in
<hi>plenary</hi> or <hi>general Councils,</hi> because he <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
implies, that such <hi>Councils may be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
they therefore take the <hi>liberty</hi> to reject
them, at least in <hi>decisions</hi> in their esteem of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49048:133"/>
less importance, and by that means altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inervate their Authority: Not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that in case the <hi>Decisions,</hi> which he
saies, may be mended, should regard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>belief,</hi> which perhaps, upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consideration, may be expressed more
commodiously, and so, as that they may
be less liable to misconstruction; yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to any particular men or
Churches to correct them, but onely to
succeeding Councils of equal Authority.
To demonstrate this, I will here set down
what Authority learned <hi>Protestants,</hi> such
as <hi>Doctor Field,</hi> the late <hi>Arch-Bishop Lawd,
&amp;c.</hi> acknowledg in general Councils, and
withal, how they circumscribe the same
Authority.</p>
            <p>3. These agree, that the Universal
Church is infallible in fundamentals:
Hence says the Archbishop,<note place="margin">Archb. <hi>Lawd,</hi> Conser. Sect. 37. Numb. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The visible
Church hath in all ages taught that unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
faith of Christ in all Points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi>
Doctor White <hi>had reason to say this,
&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. ib. sect. 21. n. 5.</note> Again, <hi>The whole Church cannot uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
erre in absolutely fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
therefore it is true also that there can
be no just cause of making a Schism from the
whole Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Again, quoting <hi>Kickerman,</hi>
he saith, <hi>That she cannot erre, neither in the
Faith, nor in any weighty point of Faith.</hi>
And from <hi>Doctor Field</hi> he asserts,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>That she
cannot fall into Heresie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That she may
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49048:134"/>
erre indeed in superstructions and deductions,
and other unnecessary Truths, from her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
or other weakness. But if she can erre
either by falling away from the Foundation
totally, or by heretical error in it, she can
no longer be holy: (for no Assemblies of
Hereticks can be holy:) And so that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Creed,</hi> [I believe the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church] <hi>is gone. Now this holiness,</hi>
saith he, <hi>Errors of a meaner allay take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. sect. 33. a. 14.</note> The same <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
likewise acknowledges, <hi>that a General
Council</hi> de post facto <hi>is unerrable:</hi> that is,
when the <hi>Decisions</hi> of it are received and
admitted generally by <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Thus far goes the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Doctor Field, Doctor White,</hi> &amp;c. But
being necessarily obliged to maintain the
separation of his own <hi>Church</hi> from the
<hi>Roman, &amp;c.</hi> he (treating of that point) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
most enormously the Errors of the
<hi>Church</hi> in non-Fundamentals; for then,
forgeting his former phrases of unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>curiosities, unnecessary subtilties, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Doctrines,<note place="margin">Id. Sect. 21. n. 5.</note> to which her curiosity or
weakness, may carry her beyond her Rule,</hi> he
saith,<note place="margin">Id. Sect. 37. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The Roman Church held the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
literally, yet she erred grosly; dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erously,
nay damnably in the exposition of some
of them: That she had Errors, though not
Fundamental, yet grating upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c. Now what he speaks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:49048:134"/>
is manifest, must as well be applied
to the <hi>Eastern Church too;</hi> and so to the
whole <hi>Church Catholick</hi> at <hi>Luthers</hi> discession,
for most of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> found fault with
by <hi>Protestants</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
see to have been, and still to be
taught by the <hi>Eastern,</hi> &amp;c. with an accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of other Errors, from which the <hi>Roman</hi>
is free.</p>
            <p>5. Hitherto these <hi>Writers</hi> speak of the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
<hi>The Church,</hi> say they, <hi>cannot Erre
in Fundamentals; She may Erre in non-Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals:</hi>
But who is to discern between
<hi>Fundamentals</hi> and <hi>non-Fundamentals?</hi> And
who is to judg of the <hi>Churches</hi> Error
in <hi>non-Fundamentals?</hi> Doctor <hi>Field</hi> will
tell us to this purpose,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church cap. 5. p. 666.</note> 
               <hi>That no particular
man or Church, may so much as profess pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
that they think otherwise then has
been determined in a general Council, except
with these three limitations. 1. Vnless he
know most certainly the contrary to what the
Church has determined. 2. If there be no
gainsaying of men of worth, place and esteem?
3. If there appear nothing that may argue an
unlawful proceeding.</hi> And the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>
briefly to this effect,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lawd</hi> Sect. 33. con. 5. n. 1.</note> states the Point:
<hi>That General Councils, lawfully called and
ordered, and lawfully proceeding, are a great
and awful representation, and cannot erre in
matters of Faith, upon condition. 1. That
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49048:135"/>
they keep themselves to God's Rule, and not
attempt to make a new one of their own.</hi>
2. <hi>And they are with all submission to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by every Christian, where Scripture, or
evident demonstration come not against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. These are their limitations, and sure
it was a very great necessity, that forced
such wise and learned men, to grant so
licentious a liberty, for annulling what
ever hath been, or shall be determined by
the Supream Tribunal in <hi>Gods Church.</hi> A
liberty never heard, or thought of from
<hi>Doctor Pierces beginning,</hi> I am certain. A
liberty manifestly destructive to all their
own <hi>Articles, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
For sure they will not say, that these
are of more sacred and inviolable <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
then those of the whole <hi>Church:</hi> Do
none pretend to know most certainly the
contrary to those determinations? or do
none of <hi>worth, place,</hi> and <hi>esteem,</hi> gainsay
them, when all the Christian world Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd,
and non-Reform'd, except a little
portion of <hi>England,</hi> absolutely reject them?
Lastly, does nothing appear, that may argue
an unlawful proceeding in <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>Eighths</hi>
first Reformation, or K. <hi>Edwards,</hi> or Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths?</hi>
But there was no possible avoiding
the concession of this liberty, apparently
ruinous to themselves; because they have
usurped it against the whole Church, could
not refuse it to any that would make use of
it to destroy their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49048:135"/>7. Let us here briefly examine these
<hi>Grounds,</hi> laid by the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi>
1. <hi>The Church is unerrable in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
but subject to error in non-Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi>
2. <hi>The Decisions of General Councils,
are to be observed, where Scripture, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Demonstration come not against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. In these <hi>Assertions</hi> is included a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
not denied by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> That
even among Doctrines determin'd by the
Church, there are some which are in
themselves <hi>fundamental,</hi> others not so:
but yet withal those <hi>Doctrines</hi> which in
themselves are <hi>not fundamental,</hi> being
once determin'd by the Church, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be assented to by all <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
to whom they are so represented, for in
those circumstances, Obedience is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demental
duty. But though <hi>Catholicks</hi>
allow this distinction in general, they
withal profess, it is impossible for any
particular persons of themselves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
among all the <hi>Churches Decisions,</hi>
and say, <hi>this</hi> or <hi>this</hi> Point is necessary and
fundamental, the others not. And the
reason is, because the terms <hi>Necessary,
Fundamental, &amp;c.</hi> are relative terms when
applied: for that is necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and known by one, which is not so
by another: Many <hi>Doctrines</hi> are <hi>necessary</hi>
to <hi>Churches</hi> for their well ordering, which
are not so to any <hi>single persons, Parishes,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49048:136"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this reason all Decisions of the
Church are sacred to them; no permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to question any of them is allow'd:
and by this means the <hi>Church</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>unity,</hi> and by assenting to all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions,</hi>
they are sure never to dissent from
those that are <hi>necessary.</hi> Whereas <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
taking a liberty of discerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>fundamentals</hi> and <hi>non-fundamentals,</hi>
and of dissenting in <hi>non-fundamentals</hi> at
least, wherein they think the <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
may be <hi>fallible</hi> (though they have
no Rule by which to judg so) are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a certainty of dis-union, exposed to
errours even in <hi>fundamentals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The <hi>ground</hi> upon which those learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Protestants</hi> conclude a <hi>fallibility</hi> even in
the <hi>universal Church</hi> as to <hi>Doctrines not
fundamental</hi> [besides the manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of their own Church] is because
the end why <hi>Christ</hi> made such promises of
leading his Church into all Truth, was,
lest <hi>the Gates of Hell should prevail against
her,</hi> which can be done only by <hi>Heresies</hi>
against fundamental Doctrines: and
therefore God's assistance for other
Points not <hi>fundamental,</hi> is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
on.</p>
            <p>10. But, though this <hi>Position</hi> in general
were allow'd them, That the Church is
fallible in <hi>unnecessaries,</hi> this will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them for dissenting from the <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:49048:136"/>
in any particular Doctrines actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by a General Council. Themselves
acknowledge that all dissenting even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
is unlawful without a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
that the Church hath actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
erred in such and such Doctrines. But
which way possibly can any particular,
person, or Church, arrive to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration?
It must be by producing
express <hi>Scripture,</hi> or universal <hi>Tradition,</hi>
formally opposite and contradictory to
what the universal Church hath declared.
Who can think, who dares believe, that
those supreme <hi>Guides</hi> of all Christians,
who were by our Lord placed in the
Church, and graced with such promises,
who are the only <hi>Guardians</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self, and only unappealable
<hi>Iudges</hi> of the sense of it, should conspire
to propose Doctrines formally and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
contrary to express Scripture or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
demonstration? And as for <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Tradition,</hi> there can be no <hi>Iudge</hi> of
it, but the whole <hi>Church:</hi> particular
persons, or Churches, are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of making such a judgment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in opposition to the whole
Church.</p>
            <p>11. It were happie therefore, if <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
considering the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and the necessity of unity in the Church,
would allow but as much submission to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49048:137"/>
the <hi>Supreme Tribunal</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> as
<hi>God</hi> obliged the <hi>Iews</hi> to perform to their
<hi>Sanedrim,</hi> to which no such Promises were
made. For then, though <hi>in Thesi</hi> they
did affirm the Church to be <hi>fallible,</hi> yet
they would acknowledge, that not only all
declaration of non-assenting is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but an internal assent is of necessary
obligation to every one of her Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>12. Let them seriously consider the
passage of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> in which <hi>God commands the</hi> Jews
<hi>under the penalty of death, to obey whatsoever
sentence should be pronounced by the present
Iudges of those dayes in any Controversies
touching the Law.</hi> This Precept argues
that the <hi>Supreme Council</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> was
infallible in Fundamentals. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
God had promised that <hi>the Scepter
should not depart from</hi> Judah,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> 
               <hi>nor a Law-giver
from between his knees till Shiloh</hi>
(that is the <hi>Messias) came.</hi> By vertue of
which <hi>Promise</hi> the <hi>Iewish Religion</hi> could
not fail in <hi>Fundamentals:</hi> and the effect
of this <hi>Promise</hi> was manifestly performed:
For as to the outward pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> it was alwayes
continued, in so much as our <hi>Saviour</hi>
himself enjoyned Obedience to all the
Commands of those <hi>who sate in</hi> Moses <hi>his
Chair.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> I say as to the outward practises
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49048:137"/>
of it: For in the Spiritual sense of it,
the <hi>Iewish Ecclesiastical Magistrates</hi> were
horribly perverted, so far as to oppose
and Murder the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself, typified
therein; But now <hi>Shiloh</hi> was already
come, and God's promise of Indefectibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
rested in this New High Priest, and
his Successors.</p>
            <p>13. Notwithstanding all this, yet Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
might creep in about <hi>non-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> confess, when they
suppose a future <hi>Sanedrim</hi> might annul
the <hi>Decisions</hi> of a former Council; in
which case the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>later</hi>
must take place, and without all tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
be obeyed. So as though they, being
indeed in such things fallible, should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
any thing contrary to the true sense
of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> were under the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
penalty obliged to obey them, which
obedience required a submission of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and internal assent to such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
that they were agreeable to God's
Law, because it would be utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to obey any commands of men, which
the Subject believed to be contrary to
God's Law. Now the reasonableness of
this Command of God appears in this,
That it was a less evil and inconvenience
that some <hi>Legal Precepts</hi> of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
should be transgressed, than that
Contentions and Disputes should be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49048:138"/>
14. From this pattern <hi>Protestants</hi> may
be instructed, that though they should
allow a <hi>General Council</hi> no more obliging
Authority, than the <hi>Iews</hi> did to their
<hi>Sanedrim,</hi> which was infallible in <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi>
but subject to Error in <hi>non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi>
they can never have a warrant to
Dissent from any Decisions of such a
Council, but ought to submit their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment to them. For, since it is
impossible they should have any demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
proofs that such <hi>Councils</hi> have
<hi>de facto</hi> erred, I mean in matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
all other inferiour Judgments,
all only <hi>probable</hi> Arguments against them,
ought to cease; the Judgment of the
whole <hi>Church</hi> rendring all contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
altogether improbable. So that
though (upon their Supposition that the
<hi>Church</hi> in non-fundamentals is <hi>fallible</hi>)
she should have erred in such not-much-concerning
<hi>Decisions,</hi> and by consequence
their assent would be erroneous, yet that
small incommodity would be abundantly
recompenc'd with the most acceptable
vertue of <hi>Obedience,</hi> humble submission of
Judgment, love of Peace and Unity which
accompanies it. Besides, that both <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Errour</hi> in such things lyes only on
the Churches, and not at all on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:49048:138"/>
15. But since <hi>Protestants</hi> find an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
difficulty more than <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
to submit their Judgments to <hi>Authority,</hi>
and are apt to think all their opinions and
perswasions to be certain knowledges;
Let it be supposed that their first <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
not being able to perswade themselves
to renounce their Opinions, should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
have been excommunicated by the
Church: In this case they ought to have
suffered such Censures with patience, and
not voluntarily forsake her Communion;
and much less ought they to have set up,
or repair to an <hi>Anti-communion:</hi> For that
was in the highest degree a <hi>Formal
Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. In all this discourse touching
the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of separation from it; I do not
mean a <hi>Church of one denomination,</hi> no,
not the <hi>Roman,</hi> as such, for so we ascribe
not <hi>Infallibility</hi> to her: But I intend
the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> which we call <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick,</hi> because all true <hi>Orthodox
Churches</hi> (an union of which, constitutes
the Universal Church, acknowledge the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> to be the Root of their
Unity. Therefore <hi>Protestants,</hi> in vain, seek
to excuse their separation, upon pretence
it was onely from the <hi>Roman,</hi> not from
the <hi>Vniversal Church:</hi> because, 1. A <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
from the external Communion of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49048:139"/>
any one true <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> for Doctrines which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held by other Churches in communion
with that Member, is indeed a separation
from all Churches; which is manifestly
the case of the <hi>English separation.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is evident, that the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, really separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>a toto mundo.</hi> A thing which <hi>Calvin</hi>
confesseth in an Epistle of his to <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi>
in these words, <hi>Nec non parvi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>For it doth not a little concern us,
that not the least suspition of any discord risen
among us, descend to posterity: For it were a
thing more then absurd, after we have been
constrained to make a discession from the whole
world, if we, in our very beginnings, should also
divide from one another.</hi> And which <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
also confesseth in several places,
<hi>cap. 5. sect. 55. As for the external Communion
of the visible Church,</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have,
without scruple formerly granted, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
did forsake it: that is, renounce the
practise of same observances, in which, the
whole visible Church before them, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</hi>
And <hi>sect. 56. What do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi>
(saith he) <hi>from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence, but that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no visible Church, but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
[where note, that he must affirm not
only corruptions in manners, but also in
Doctrines and Lawes, for from several of
these, he will not deny <hi>Luther</hi> to have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49048:139"/>
made a discession] <hi>Luther forsaking the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Communion of the corrupted Church,
could not but forsake the external communion
of the Catholick Church. Well, let this be
granted; what will come of it? That</hi> Luther
<hi>must be a Scismatick? By no means.</hi> I say,
it is evident (as these confess) that the
pretended Reformed <hi>Churches really sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
themselves from the whole world,</hi> that
is, from that holy Catholick <hi>Church</hi> which
we believe is to continue so in every Age:
Since not one Church upon earth antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to their separation, can be found out
with which they are joyned in external
Communion, not one which has Laws, or
Governors in common with them, not
one that will joyn with them, or with
which they will joyn in publick <hi>Offices,
Lyturgies, Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Synods.</hi> The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Church</hi> doth not pretend a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Churches manifestly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
as the <hi>Armenian, Coptite, Abissine,
Nestorian, Iacobite, Georgian Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
And for the <hi>Grecian,</hi> the <hi>Reformers,</hi> at
their first separation, were actually divided
from her; and sure they will not say, that
by separation from the <hi>Roman,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>ipso facto</hi> in communion with the
<hi>Grecian;</hi> or if they would say so, the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
would protest against them, as we see
their <hi>Patriark Hieremias</hi> did, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:49048:140"/>
17. And that is but a very ineffectual
<hi>Salve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Bramhall.</note> which a late <hi>learned Protestant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in his discourse of <hi>Schism,</hi> insists upon,
when, seeing clearly the <hi>English Church</hi>
could not pretend a <hi>Communion</hi> with any
other Ancient Churches in the world, he
therefore claims priviledges of the <hi>English
Church,</hi> equal to those ancient ones of
<hi>Cyprus;</hi> which was a <hi>Church</hi> independent
of all other, and exempted from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the <hi>Eastern Patriark of Antioch:</hi>
For though this pretention could be made
good, which is impossible, yet this would
not serve their turn, considering the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Church,</hi> ever since her Conversion,
acknowledged her self a Member of the
<hi>Western Patriarchate:</hi> But though she had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
such a priviledge, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
it, who will say the <hi>Cyprian
Church,</hi> (because exempted from certain
Acts of <hi>Patriarckical Iurisdiction,</hi> as <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
Visitations,</hi> &amp;c.) could therefore
independently of all the world, frame or
change <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or be excused
from subscribing to the <hi>Decisions</hi> of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>1. HAving shew'd the indispensible
obligation of even an internal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> acknowledge
due to the <hi>Decisions of General Councils,</hi>
as being infallible, and which <hi>Protestants</hi>
ought also to perform, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
such an infallibility to extend
only to Doctrines Fundamental; since
the Church her self hath not declar'd
which of her Decisions are Fundamental,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49048:141"/>
and which not, for she hath affixed <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas</hi>
to many, which in themselves are
not Fundamental, and hath said only,
<hi>si quis dixerit</hi> (not) <hi>si quis non crediderit,</hi>
concerning Doctrines which are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably
<hi>Fundamental</hi> and necessary: We
will now examine the foremention'd <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations</hi>
or cases in which it is said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons or Churches may and
ought to be dispensed with for yielding
an assent to <hi>Decisions</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi>
touching matters not Fundamental, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for not contradicting them; which
limitations have been fixed by <hi>Archbishop
Lawd, Doctor Field,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. In the first place, <hi>An assent even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
say they, <hi>is to be given indispensably
to all Decisions of General Councils touching
such Doctrines (only) as are Fundamental,
or Points of necessary Faith, because so far
and no farther their Infallibility extends.</hi>
But who shall, or can judge what Points
are or are not of <hi>necessary Faith</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all particular states of men or
Churches, when the Church her self hath
not made any distinction between them,
and perhaps cannot? Surely <hi>Prudence,</hi> and
a most necessary care of our own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by continuing in the Unity of the
Church, would dictate to us, that since the
Church is as to Fundamentals infallible,
and therefore cannot mislead us to our
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49048:141"/>
danger, there can be no safety but in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to all her <hi>Decisions,</hi> as if they
were of necessary Faith, for only by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, we can be sure not to err in neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Points, and we shall be certainly free
from all danger of <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Secondly, <hi>As to Decisions made by
General Councils of Doctrines not necessary</hi>
(if we could find them out) <hi>the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
assent,</hi> say they, <hi>is due, except in two
cases.</hi> i. <hi>Vnless Scripture or evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
come against them, whereby we know
most certainly the contrary to what they have
determined, in which case it is unlawful to
assent, yea it is permitted rather to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and separate.</hi> But let any Christian
mans conscience judge, whether this be
to be admitted as a fitting, respectful, or
even possible supposition, that the whole
<hi>Church</hi> should conspire to frame Decisions
in matters of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> against
which express Scripture or evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
can be produced. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
being admitted, who shall be judge,
whether that which is pretended to be a
Demonstration, be really one, or no? Or
whether a person do know most certainly
the contrary to what the whole Church
hath decided? None can judge of the
thoughts of another: So that upon these
grounds, whoever shall say he is certain
the Church hath erred, must be believed,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49048:142"/>
or however cannot be found fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for his renouncing obedience to the
Universal Church. What <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
writing or disputing against <hi>Episcopacy</hi> or
other Doctrines of this Church, will
doubt to say, that he does most certainly
believe and know such <hi>Doctrines</hi> to be
Errors? And if he say so, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mostrate,
that he does not think so? And
if he think so, he may question, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
and make parties to reverse all the
<hi>Laws,</hi> Decisions, &amp;c. both of the <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>God's Church</hi> too, by the <hi>Archbishop's</hi>
warrant; for he taking notice (<hi>page</hi> 245.)
that such an Objection will be made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
it thus, <hi>That a General Council</hi> (he
means <hi>another</hi> (General Council) <hi>must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
whether it be a demonstration or not;</hi>
Hence it will follow, 1. That when any
one cries a Demonstration, he cannot be
reduced to obedience till another <hi>General
Council</hi> be called. 2. But if <hi>another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council</hi> must decide it, why hath not
the <hi>last General Council,</hi> which he disobeys,
decided it? Or if this may not oblige
him, why should the next? But this is not
yet judged to be dispensation enough;
For according to the foresaid limitations,
<hi>One may be excused from assenting to Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of General Councils, about Points not of
necessary Faith, in case they be gainsaid by
men of worth, place and esteem:</hi> So that if
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49048:142"/>
any such persons do contradict <hi>General
Councils</hi> (whether in or out of the Council,
He mentions not) ignorant men may
lawfully join with them, and in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
esteem all other Pastors of God's
Church to be of less worth, place or esteem.
What a broad Gate, yea how vast a breach

                  </gap>ymnuus,
Mr. Prinn,</hi> the <hi>Rump Parliament</hi> to have
been persons of <hi>worth, place</hi> and <hi>esteem?</hi>
At least the generality of <hi>England</hi> once
thought them so, and themselves chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
those Titles, and whilst they were
the strongest, enjoy'd them. To what
miserable straits a necessity of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the <hi>English Separation</hi> reduced such
wise and learned men?</p>
            <p>4. In the <hi>third place,</hi> according to the
same Writers Position, all manner of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions</hi>
made by <hi>Councils,</hi> both in necessary
and unnecessary Doctrines, cease to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory,
<hi>in case something appears that may
argue an unlawful proceeding in the Council,
out of passion, interest, want of liberty,</hi> &amp;c.
But still who shall be judges of <hi>Councils</hi>
proceedings? Among <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when
there are perhaps suspicions of some irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
proceedings, yet if the <hi>Points</hi> deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
be embraced by the particular <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49048:143"/>
Churches,</hi> generally speaking, they
then have the force of unquestion'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Doctrines.</hi> But as for those, who
are enemies to <hi>Councils,</hi> in which their
Doctrines have been condemn'd, such will
be sure to charge them with unlawful
proceedings. For did not the <hi>Arians</hi>
urge that <hi>Plea</hi> against the <hi>Council of Nice?</hi>
The <hi>Nestorians</hi> against that of <hi>Ephesus?</hi>
The <hi>Eutychians</hi> against that of <hi>Chalcedon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This clause in all probability was
put in to exclude the Authority of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> against the proceedings
of which therefore, very loud and very
unjust clamors were made by <hi>Protestants,</hi>
imputing especially to the <hi>Court of Rome</hi>
many policies and attempts either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidate
the Fathers of the Council, or
to induce them to favour, and enlarge the
<hi>Grandeurs</hi> of the <hi>Pope.</hi> But who ever shall
unpassionately read the <hi>History</hi> of that
<hi>Council,</hi> compiled by the most learned and
<hi>eminent Cardinal Palavicino</hi> from authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<hi>Records</hi> yet extant, will be satisfied.
1. That the liberty of the <hi>Bishops</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
straitned by their own respective tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<hi>Princes,</hi> and not by the <hi>Roman
Court.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Pope</hi> was so far from
gaining an access to his <hi>Authority,</hi> that
when a far greater number of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
would have concurr'd thereto, the <hi>Pope</hi>
himself forbad it, meerly because the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49048:143"/>
               <hi>French Bishops,</hi> inconsiderable for their
numbers, did joyn to oppose it.</p>
            <p>6. But there is no necessity that <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
should trouble themselves with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Apologies</hi> for that <hi>Council.</hi> 1. Because
all the Doctrines of it, opposed by <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
as <hi>Novelties,</hi> were manifest in the
general Writings and Practise of the
<hi>Western Church</hi> long before that <hi>Council;</hi>
and most of them in the <hi>Eastern.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are now actually embraced by
all <hi>Catholick Congregations,</hi> as <hi>Declared
Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> in which case by
the <hi>Archbishop</hi>'s own Concessions, they are
to be esteem'd <hi>infallibly true.</hi> 3. Because
the principal Doctrines, censur'd in the
<hi>Preacher's Sermon,</hi> had been expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
by former either <hi>General,</hi> or at
least <hi>Patriarkical Councils,</hi> admitted in
this Kingdom: as <hi>Transubstantiation, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Images, Prayers not in a vulgar
tongue, Communion under one Species, Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy
of Priests, the universal Iurisdiction of
the Pope, &amp;c.</hi> 4. And lastly, because, in
condemning the <hi>Protestant Doctrines</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to them, the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Council
of Trent</hi> are found, even by<note n="*" place="margin">See the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Edition of that Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation and Adoration of the Eucharist,</hi> pag. 324, &amp; 326.—Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Masse, that it is a Propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> p. 544, 545, &amp; 738.—Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness &amp; Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in one kind,</hi> pag. 324, 325, 519.—Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Purgatory; the Lawfulness of Invocation of Saints,</hi> and of <hi>Veneration of Images,</hi> p. 799, 803.—Concerning <hi>the Lawfulness of not using some part of the Divine Service in a vulgar Language,</hi> p. 573, 574.—Concerning <hi>Priests not Marrying;</hi> and <hi>the universal Capacity of the Gift of Chastity;</hi> and <hi>the Lawfulness of Vowing it,</hi> p. 783, 747, and likevvise, p. 678, 679.]</note>

               <hi>In Queen
Elizabeths time</hi> (saith he) <hi>before the new
Bishops were well setled</hi> [I need not mind
the Reader here, that all her former
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49048:144"/>
Bishops, save on, had deserted her] <hi>and
the Queen, assured of the affections of her
Clergy, went that way to work in Her
Reformation, which not only her two Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
but all the godly Kings and Princes in
the Iewish State and many of the Christian
Emperours in the primitive times had done
before her, in the well ordering of the Church
and People committed to their care and
government by Almighty God. And to that
end she published her Injunctions,</hi> Ann. Dom.
1559. <hi>A Book of Orders, 1561. Another of
Advertisements, 1562. All leading unto the
Reformation, with the Advice and Consent of
the Metropolitan, and some other Godly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
who were then about Her</hi> [these were
those newly Ordained, the former Bishops
being ejected] <hi>by whom they were agreed
on, and subscribed unto, before they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to Her. But when the times were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
setled, and the first difficulty of her Reign
passed over, she left Church-work to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Church-men, who, by their place and
calling, were most proper for it; and they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met in Convocation, and thereto autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
as the Laws required, did make and
publish several Books of Canons, &amp;c.</hi> Thus
that Doctor; the sum of which is, That
the Queen, finding no foundation to
build upon, because all the Innovations
begun by her Father and young Brother,
had been utterly demolished by her Sister
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49048:145"/>
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and withal perceiving the
main Body of her Clergy, as well as her
Bishops, except such as the caused to be
made <hi>de novo,</hi> to be generally averse from
her proceedings, was fain to do all the
Ecclesiastical work her self, assisted with
some of her New Bishops, without the
Concurrence of any Synodal Authority;
till, having first by her Orders sufficiently
purged the Clergy, she saw, she could se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
now do Church-work by Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>9. But Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> Hist. l. 9. p. 54.</note> is more punctual in
delivering the retail of these her first
proceedings, which he extracted out of
the authentick <hi>Synodals,</hi> 1559. He tells
us then, That in the beginning of her
Reign, the <hi>Queen</hi> called both a <hi>Parliament</hi>
and a <hi>Convocation of the Clergy:</hi> Which
<hi>Convocation</hi> unanimously persisted in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
not to forsake the old Religion
restored by <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and publickly
declared against such an intended <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
Particularly the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy</hi> composed certain <hi>Articles</hi>
of Religion, which they tendred to the
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and the Bishops in the Name of
the whole Clergy, presented them to the
<hi>Lord Keeper.</hi> The said <hi>Articles</hi> were these
five, 1. <hi>Of the real substantial presence of
our Lord's body after Consecration. 2. Of
the non-remaining of the substance of Bread
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49048:145"/>
and Wine. 3. Of the Propitiatory Sacrifice
in the Masse. 4. Of the Supreme Spiritual
Iurisdiction of the Pope. 5. That the power
not only of defining, but even treating and or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dering
of Ecclesiastical matters touching Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline pertains only to Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Pastors, and not at all to Lay persons.</hi> A
little after this, during the same Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
there came from both the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities</hi>
a <hi>Writing</hi> signed by a <hi>Publick Notary,</hi>
by which they both signified their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
to the aforesaid <hi>Articles,</hi> only
with a little alteration of the last.</p>
            <p>10. I have thought fit to annex here
the very words of that Convocation, as
Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> transcribed them out of the

in that Power, which by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
[in his Book] is challenged on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Clergy, the Reformation could
not have been brought to pass, and grants,
<note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. p. 251.</note> that secular power gave force to that
which was done contrary to the Rule,
wherein the Unity of the Church consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But yet justifies the Reformation thus,
<note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 273, &amp;c.</note> He saith, that as the power of the
Church (obliging Christians to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions)
is a Law ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
for the Unity and edification of the
Church, &amp;c. So, also there are abundance
of other Laws given to the Church, by our
Lord and his Apostles: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if by injurie of the times, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
(of the Church) become contrary to
these Lawes, [given by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles];
or if those, whom the power of
the Church is trusted with, shall hinder
the restoring of such Lawes; (of Christ
and his Apostles) the Soveraign Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christian, may and ought to suppress
their power, (though he grants this their
power to be an Ordinance of the Apostles,
necessary to the Unity of the Church);
that so their power may be committed to
such as are willing to submit to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Ordinance of our Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49048:147"/>
A thing (saith he)<note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 275.</note> throughly
proved, both by the right of Secular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in advancing Christianity with penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and in establishing the exercise of it,
and in particular, by all the examples of
the pious Kings of Gods people, reducing
the Law into practice, and suppressing the
contrary thereof. Thus Mr. <hi>Thorndicke</hi>
takes this way of freeing the <hi>English</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from Schism, upon the just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
power of the secular Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all, or most of his Clergy, when he
judgeth them to teach or practise against
the Doctrine of our Lord and his Apostles.
But all this while, he never so much as asks
the question, what if the Prince be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in these Doctrines which he calls of
our Lord and his Apostles; Or be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in what the Ancient Church, and
primitive times have delivered for such?
And what if all the Clergy which he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
be in the right? Nor this, What if
our Lord hath committed this to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and Successors of the Apostles, to judg
and decide for ever (when any doubt or
dispute ariseth) what are the true Lawes
of our Lord and his Apostles? Or, what
ancient Tradition hath delivered to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
for such? But he discourseth so,
as if the Christian Prince were herein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
when yet he supposeth, that all
his Clergy may be herein deceived: As
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49048:148"/>
if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> understood the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ancient Tradition, aright in
these Lawes, whilst her Bishops and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
erred in both, till she had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulded
them. Is not this a strange way
to justifie a Church-Reformation?</p>
            <p>For the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> it shall be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to by and by,<note n="‖" place="margin">Chap. 23. n. 7.</note> and as to what he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
concerning the power of Kings, it is
by no means denied, that these have Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
proper to them, to command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
from all their Subjects, and that
as well from a Clergy-man, as any other,
to the Lawes of Christ and his Apostles
with the civil Sword, and with temporal
penalties (a Supremacy to which the
Church layes no claim). But when any
doubt or controversie ariseth, what, or
which these Lawes be, (as there was in
the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign
in many points) Secular Princes as well as
others, are Sons of the Church, and are
to learn this from the Expositions of their
Spiritual Fathers, the Church-Men. I
mean that body of them, which hath the
just and Superior Authority of deciding
such controversies. And let this suffice to
shew the legality of the first proceedings
of the Reformation, in opposition to the
unanimous Votes of the whole Clergy, or
of those therein, who clearly had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive
power of Ecclesiastical Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49048:148"/>
either concerning the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or Truth of ancient Tradition.</p>
            <p>12. Then comparing this Reformation
with the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> in regard of
worldly or carnal interests, let any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
man judge between them. Was
not the liberty obtained by King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, to bring into his Bed, a new

            <p>13. By what hath been hitherto said ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
but even too clearly, how that <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Rule of all Government</hi> and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
was utterly neglected in <hi>England,</hi>
at the time that the pretended <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was contrived and executed. Here is
a new and thorow moulding of a Church,
both a <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Discipline, called</hi> a
<hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein all the <hi>Synodical Acts</hi>
of this Church, since Christianity entred
among us, are as to any obliging power
by their Authority reversed: wherein all
the <hi>Decisions</hi> of <hi>Patriarchical Councils,</hi> yea
of <hi>Oecumenical Synods</hi> are call'd into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination;
all their Laws, so far as
seemed meet reform'd, the whole regard
that <hi>England</hi> had to all other <hi>Catholick
Churches,</hi> as a <hi>Member</hi> of the whole, is
utterly broken by one National Church:
Nay not so much, but by one luxurious
King, by one Child, and by one Woman,
even when the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi>
protested against it. And yet after all
this,<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> if <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> may be believed,
<hi>thus to reform was to write after the Coppy
which had been set to the Reformers in his
Text, by the blessed Reformer of all the
World; which was so to reform as not to in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>novate,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49048:149"/>
and to accommodate their Religion
to what they found in the Beginning:</hi> In the
mean time accusing the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
(as he expresseth it, but indeed the <hi>whole
Catholick Church,</hi> as he must, and as others
grant) <hi>of not only horrible corruptions in point
of Practise, but hideous errors in matters of
Faith too, &amp; such as trench upon Foundations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. But the <hi>Preacher</hi> must not expect his
confident asseveration without proof can
seduce the judgement of any considering
man to believe him against evidence and
experience.<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> Nothing is more plain then
that the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by observing
the foresaid <hi>Fundamental Rule,</hi> is and will
be eternally free from danger, either of
<hi>causal</hi> or <hi>formal Schism.</hi> And as plain
it is, that no Churches can be separate
from the <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> but by
transgressing that <hi>Rule:</hi> For if <hi>Diocesan
Churches</hi> and Synods would submit to
<hi>Provincial;</hi> and <hi>Provincial</hi> to <hi>National,</hi>
and these to <hi>Patriarchical,</hi> and all to <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical,</hi>
how could Unity be dissolved?
But on the contrary, if subordinate <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
shall take on them to reverse the <hi>Acts</hi>
and <hi>Decisions</hi> of <hi>Superior ones,</hi> especially
of <hi>Oecumenical;</hi> how can <hi>Schisms</hi> possibly
be avoided? And with what shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can any particular <hi>Churches</hi> thus
breaking <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Orders, charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Churches</hi> with <hi>Schisms,</hi> because they
will not break them too?</p>

produced by the <hi>Preacher</hi> to
justifie their <hi>Separation</hi> to be no <hi>Schism;</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:49048:150"/>
he sayes,<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> That <hi>by the concessions of the most
learned Popish Writers, particular Nations
had still a power to purge themselves from
their corruptions, as well in the Church as in
the State, without leave had from the See of

those Writers concede such a <hi>purgation</hi> as
their first Reformers <hi>administred</hi> to this
Kingdom? not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>against</hi>
the consent of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor only
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the whole Catholick
Church? A <hi>Purgation</hi> from the whole
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> in any thing they
judged fit to be rectified, that by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi>
had been received and in force ever since
the Nation was <hi>Christian:</hi> and by which
they declared themselves Members of the
whole <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
from the beginning of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he will not be able to produce one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
either of <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> except
profess'd <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (such as the Emperors
<hi>Constantius, Valens, Zeno,</hi> &amp;c.) that ever
made any Laws to repeal any Doctrines
declared or Disciplines established in the
Church. The <hi>Purgations</hi> conceded and
executed by <hi>Princes</hi> truly Catholick was to
extirpate all <hi>Innovations</hi> in Doctrine, all
transgressions of Discipline that swerved
from the Decrees and Ordinations of the
Church, and no other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:49048:151"/>
2. Surely the <hi>Doctor</hi> doth not think
<hi>Christian Princes,</hi> as such, cease to be sons
of the Church, they must be saved as well
as their Subjects, and therefore are not
dispensed from that speech of our Lord,
<hi>Qui vos audit, me audit.</hi> They are not <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
but Sheep. Yet <hi>Catholick Religion</hi>
obliges us to acknowledge, that their <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
power extends it self to all manner of
causes, though purely <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> so as
to make use of the <hi>Civil Sword</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
even their <hi>Ecclesiastical Subjects</hi>
to perform that duty which either the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Divine Law (according to the
Churches exposition thereof) or the Laws
of the Church require. Such a power, yea
a <hi>Supremacy</hi> in such a <hi>Power</hi> we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be in <hi>Princes.</hi> But withal we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find either in reason or Antiquity any
ground to apply to Princes that <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
which our Saviour only gave to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and their Successors [<hi>Sicut misit me
Pater,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>As my Father sent me, so send
I you: Receive the holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Teach all
Nations,</hi> &amp;c. No promise hath been made
to <hi>Princes,</hi> that <hi>God's Spirit shall lead them
into all Truth,</hi> any other way, then whilst
they follow the direction of their <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Pastors,</hi> to whom only that <hi>Promise</hi>
was made.</p>
            <p>3. Nay, that very <hi>Argument</hi> by which
he would assert his cause, is a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49048:151"/>
against him. He sayes, and that very
truly, <hi>Our Kings are as much as any in the
world,<note place="margin">Serm. pag. 33.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they hold their Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
immediately from God, without any
dependence on any other authority on earth.</hi>
The like must be said of other <hi>absolute
Princes</hi> too. Now this <hi>independency</hi> of
<hi>Princes</hi> demonstrates, that the regulation
of their power in Ecclesiastical matters,
must of necessity be made according to
an Authority and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> purely <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
common to them all, which is in the
Church. For otherwise, being <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
and absolute, they may perhaps be
able to preserve a kind of Unity in their
respective Kingdoms, by forcing from
their Subjects an Obedience to a <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Church-policy</hi> framed by themselves,
contrary to the Law of the Catholick
Church: But how shall the <hi>whole Church</hi>
be preserved in Unity by this means?
Other <hi>Princes</hi> are independent as well as
they; and therefore may frame a Religion
which they may call <hi>Reformation,</hi> as well
as they: So that if there be not a <hi>spiritual
Director</hi> and Ecclesiastical Laws common
to them all, and submitted to by all, what
will become of <hi>Vnity?</hi> Which of these
<hi>Independents</hi> will make himself a <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
on another? Shall there be <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archicall,</hi>
or <hi>General Councils of Kings</hi> meet
together? Who shall summon them? In
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49048:152"/>
such <hi>Royal Synods</hi> there must be order:
which of them shall challenge a <hi>Primacy,</hi>
even of <hi>Order? Doctor Pierce</hi> may see what
consequences naturally and unavoidably
flow from his <hi>Positions.</hi>

(for the Emperor <hi>Zenos</hi>

were all regulated by the Law of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

&amp;c] We ordain and command that the holy
Ecclesiastical Rules declared and established
by holy Councils shall obtain the force of
Laws: For their Doctrines we receive as the
Holy Scriptures themselves, and their Rules
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49048:152"/>
we observe as Lawes. Add again, to shew
that the Laws, enacted by him, touching
Ecclesiastical matters, were intended not
as <hi>Acts</hi> of an absolute <hi>Ecclesiastical Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>
but as consequences of the Churches
Authority,<note place="margin">Id. in Authent. ut Cler. ap. prop. Ep. 10. Conven.</note> he saies, <hi>Our Lawes disdain not
to follow the holy and Divine Rules</hi> (of the
Church). These were indeed Lawes of
<hi>Reformation,</hi> fit for glorious <hi>Princes,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Sons of the Church, to make but
surely very incommodious patterns for
the <hi>Preachers</hi> purpose.</p>
            <p>5. What the late Emperours, <hi>Fardinand
the first,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian the second</hi> did,
neither his <hi>Sermon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. <hi>pag.</hi> 34.</note> nor <hi>Margin</hi> tell us, but
onely that something was done, which
he, it seems, thought for his advantage;
I'le tell him what it was: Their <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
in <hi>Germany</hi> were grown very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
yet not so, but that they made a shew
of hearkening to some composition. Those
worthy <hi>Emperors,</hi> for peace sake, made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
consultations with learned and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> (some indeed too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
as <hi>Cassander,</hi> &amp;c.) how the Church-<hi>Doctrines</hi>
and <hi>Ordinances</hi> might be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Hereupon divers expedients were
proposed, Treatises written, &amp;c. by which
the <hi>Emperors</hi> were in hope debates might
be ended, But how? By betraying the
present Churches Faith? By renouncing
the <hi>Popes Iurisdiction,</hi> or consent to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position?
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49048:153"/>
Far otherwise; For when they
saw no agreement would please the <hi>Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Electors</hi> and their <hi>Divines,</hi> but such as
was derogating from the Authority of the
<hi>Supream Pastor,</hi> and prejudicial to the
Lawes of the Church, they surceased all
motions of reconciliation; rather chusing
to expose themselves to all the dangers
that might come from their arms and
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>6. Touching <hi>the many Kings of England,</hi>
as he sayes,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in <hi>Popish times,</hi> whose actions
in his opinion, <hi>shewed, that the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
belonged especially to them in their
Kingdom:</hi> His Margin, indeed, quotes the
Names of fourteen of our <hi>Kings</hi> since the
<hi>conquest,</hi> as if he would have the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the pure <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
six hundred years old: But what
<hi>Reformations</hi> were made by any of them,
either in Religion or Church-Discipline,
neither I, nor himself can shew, except
by the last King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who
was indeed a Reformer of the new fashion.
'Tis true, the former <hi>Kings</hi> had frequent
quarrels with the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> touching
<hi>Investitures, procuring of Bulls for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
causes belonging to the Kings Courts,
usurping a disposal of Bishopricks, and other
Benefices,</hi> &amp;c. But what is all this to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>
Such debates as these, he may see
at this day, between the <hi>Roman Court,</hi> and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49048:153"/>
the <hi>Kings of France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. in all which,
commonly the Pope is but little a gainer;
yet, notwithstanding all these, he will not
sure deny, but that the Kings of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Spain;</hi> and 'tis as certain, that all
those former Kings of <hi>England,</hi> except
one, were perfect <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> not
any of them ever did believe, that their
<hi>Supremacy</hi> could allow them to alter the
Religion of their Fore-Fathers: even
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for all his <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
never pretended so far.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cokes</hi> 5. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</note> Of this I
dare accept, as Judge, even Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> himself,<note place="margin">Balsamon.</note> and <hi>Balsamon</hi> likewise, though
a malicious <hi>Schismatick,</hi> therefore the fitter
to be quoted by him; yet all he sayes is,
That the <hi>Emperor has an inspection over the
Churches, that he can limit or extend the
Iurisdiction of Metropolitans, erect new ones,
&amp;c.</hi> which, whether by the ancient
Lawes of the Church, he can do or no,
is little for the <hi>Preachers</hi> purpose: I am
sure he is not able to prove it, or if he
could, it is a Reformation which will not
serve his turn.</p>
            <p>7. His last <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Reformations</hi>
made by Princes, is that of the <hi>Kings of
Iuda,</hi> in which indeed <hi>Religion</hi> it self was
Reformed. But withal, the Doctor may
do well to take notice. 1. That those
<hi>Kings</hi> are no where said to have reformed
all the <hi>Priests,</hi> or the <hi>High Priest,</hi> or not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49048:154"/>
to have found him as Orthodox as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.<note place="margin">See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> cap. 29. 4. 12. 16. <hi>Ibid.</hi> cap. 34.</note>
2. They are not said to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the people against the <hi>Priests.</hi> 3. Or
without the <hi>Priests.</hi> 4. Yea in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we read, they were by the <hi>Priests</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in their Reformation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bishop Andrews,</hi> who was willing to
make as much advantage of this example
against the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ti. p. 365.</note> as might be,
says only, that those <hi>Kings</hi> did reform <hi>citra</hi>
or <hi>ante, declarationem Ecclesiae,</hi> but he saies
not, <hi>contra.</hi> And, to make good his <hi>citra</hi> or
<hi>ante,</hi> hath only the strength of the <hi>weakest</hi>
of all Arguments, a <hi>Negative,</hi> thus, <hi>There
is recorded no such Declaration of the Church
in Scripture,</hi> ergo <hi>there was none.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of which argument is much more
visible, if applied to such a short History as
that of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a relation of so many hundred years,
and chiefly of the actions of Kings, not of
the Clergy.</p>
            <p>8. It cannot indeed be denied, but that
in such publick changes, the Power of
<hi>Kings</hi> is more Operative and Illustrious
then of the <hi>Priests,</hi> because their <hi>Civil
Sword</hi> awes more than the others <hi>Spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and therefore no wonder, if their part in
such Reformations is more spoken of, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in so very short a story. But
certainly,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> according to Gods Institution,
<hi>the Priests lips are to preserve knowledge, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49048:154"/>
it is from their mouths that</hi> (Kings) <hi>are to
learn Gods Law,</hi> and what they are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<hi>because they are the Angels of our Lord.</hi>
Now, for <hi>Reformations,</hi> or other <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Ordinances</hi> made by such <hi>Kings</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. who, besides a <hi>Regal
Authority,</hi> were <hi>Prophets</hi> likewise, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
inspired and so employed by God,
I suppose the Doctor will not draw such
into consequence, to justify the actions of
a <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth, the <hi>young child
his Son,</hi> or <hi>youngest Daughter;</hi> no Prophets
surely.</p>
            <p>9. To these <hi>examples alleged</hi> by Doctor
<hi>Pierce,</hi> but very insufficient to justify the
<hi>English Reformation,</hi> I will in the last place
take notice briefly of one great motive,
which, as he sayes, set on work the <hi>English
Reformers (of happy Memory); which was
their observing that in the Council of Trent,<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</note>
the Roman Partizans, were not afraid to
make new Articles of Faith, commanded to
be embraced under pain of Damnation, as
it were in contempt of the Apostles Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi>
Gal. 1. 8.</p>
            <p>10. But to omit his contradictions,
charging us with <hi>hideous errors in Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note>
which yet he dare not say are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,<note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note>
lest he ruine his own Church:
To omit his uncivil language to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of that Council, persons of too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a quality, to be called, by a little
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49048:155"/>
Doctor, <hi>contemners of the Apostles denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,

               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his commending the first English Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,

Did not our first Reformer consult

involved in all the Romish Errors concerning
those Articles wherein</hi> (saith he) <hi>we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this day from the Pope:</hi> And for
the <hi>Two</hi> others of the Doctor's <hi>Points,</hi>
1. <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> in an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue,
And, 2. <hi>Infallibility;</hi> himself confesseth
the <hi>first</hi> of these to have been in <hi>Gregories</hi>
time; For thus he,<note n="*" place="margin">Serm. pag. 27.</note> 
               <hi>The Publick Prayers
of the Romanists have been a very long time
in an unknown Tongue, even as long as from
the time of Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great.</hi> And
the <hi>second</hi> he must grant to have been
pretended to before <hi>Gregory,</hi> in that the
Preacher allows the proceedings of the
Four first General Councils; for these
required several Points not before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to be believed by all Christians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and also inserted
them into the body of the Christian
Creeds. Which thing the Doctor some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
thinks unreasonable, that any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Authority should assume to it self.
For surely upon this ground it is, that he
condemns the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to make new Articles of Faith,
though they have put none such in our
Creeds.</p>
            <p>13. By which it appears, that this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and all the severity practis'd against
us in consequence of it, might as justly
have been preach'd and executed against
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49048:157"/>
our first <hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
the <hi>Monk,</hi> as against us. And if
against them, then against the <hi>Vniversal
Church</hi> both <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western;</hi> since it
is evident that in St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time they
were in perfect Unity both for Doctrine
and Discipline; And consequently, if
such pretended <hi>new Articles</hi> can justifie
the <hi>English Separation</hi> from the present
Church, the same Separation ought to
have been made from the <hi>universal Church</hi>
above a <hi>Thousand years</hi> since. I might go
higher, but this is even too too much.
That man surely must have a prodigious
courage, who dares venture his <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Eternity</hi> rather upon <hi>Scripture</hi> interpreted
by an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi>
than by the Authority and consent of the
<hi>Vniversal Church</hi> for so many Ages.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this so important Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of <hi>Schism</hi> by a closer <hi>Application,</hi>
which may afford more light to discover

               <p>Of Causal and Formal Schism

The manifest Innocency of the

            </argument>
            <p>1. FIrst, As to the <hi>Preacher</hi>'s so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Causal</hi> and
<hi>Formal Schism,</hi> it is borrowed from the
<hi>late Archbishop:</hi> The former member
whereof only he applies to the <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> Church, the later to no body:
He must give me leave to propose to his
Consideration a Saying or two of St.<note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Augustin,</hi>
thus writing to the <hi>Donatists, Si
possit, quod fieri non potest, &amp;c.</hi> If any could
have, which really he cannot possibly, a just
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49048:158"/>
cause for which he should separate his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from the Communion of the whole
World, How do you know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d again
in the same Epistle, <hi>There is the Church
where first that</hi> (Separation) <hi>was made
which you after perfected, if there could be
any just cause for you to separate from the
communion of all Nations. For we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
assured that no man can justly separate
himself from the communion of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
because not any of us seeks the Church
in his own Iustice or Holiness</hi> (as you <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi>
do) <hi>but in the Divine Scriptures,
where he sees the Church really become, as
she was promised to be, spread through all
Nations, a City on a Hill, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it
is, that the same <hi>Saint,</hi> though he wrote
several Books against the special <hi>Doctrines</hi>
of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> yet whensoever he treats
of their <hi>Schism,</hi> he never meddles with
any of their <hi>Opinions,</hi> but absolutely
proves their <hi>Separation</hi> unlawful from the
Texts of Scripture, and Promises of
Christ, which are absolute and uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional:
So that the alledging <hi>Causes</hi> to
justifie <hi>Separation,</hi> for which there can be
no just one, is vain and fruitless; And
this way of Arguing is far more forcible
against <hi>English Protestants,</hi> than it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Donatists,</hi> because all their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Writers acknowledge the Church of
Christ was, and alwayes will be unerrable
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49048:158"/>
in <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> and this as she is a <hi>Guide:</hi>
And further, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is either
this Church, or at least a true Member of
it.</p>
            <p>2. But Secondly, whatever becomes of
this <hi>Distinction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> his concession is, <hi>That
really a Formal Schism there is between us:</hi>
nay more, that the Protestants made the
<hi>actual departure,</hi> and indeed they must put
out their eyes, who see it not. The <hi>visible
Communion</hi> between the now <hi>English
Church,</hi> and all other in being before it
beyond the Seas, is evidently changed and
broken. The same <hi>Publick Service</hi> of
God, which their first <hi>Reformers</hi> found in
God's Church all the World over, they
refuse to joyn in, for fear of incurring
sin: Most of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where formerly in force, they have
abrogated, and without the consent of
any other Churches have made new: they
were formerly Members of a <hi>Patriarchical</hi>
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which they esteem'd the only
<hi>Orthodox Vniversal Church</hi>) to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this <hi>Common Body</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
themselves subject: And a
denial of subjection to the Common Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of this Body, and especially the
<hi>Supreme Pastor,</hi> they judged to be a formal
<hi>Act of Schism:</hi> Lastly, the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church they formerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
as of Divine Authority, <hi>Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:49048:159"/>
only ancient and <hi>Primitive:</hi> Now
they called <hi>Apostatical Novelties.</hi> Any
of those changes conclude a <hi>Schism</hi> on
one side or other, but all of them more
then demonstrate it. A <hi>Schism</hi> then there
is, therefore one of the parties is guilty
(not of causing, but) of being <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
properly, formally, <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
Now would it not be hard for the <hi>Doctor</hi>
to speak his conscience, and declare once
more at Court, which of us two are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Schismaticks?</hi> It could not indeed
be expected he should answer as a <hi>young
maid</hi> did to my <hi>old Lady Falkland,</hi> when
she asked, if she were a Catholick? <hi>No
Madam,</hi> (said she with a low curtesy) if it
please your Ladyship, I thank God I am a
Scismatick; but withal, his tongue would
not readily pronounce <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
to be <hi>Schismaticks</hi> from the English,
Reformed <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That which is opposed to <hi>Schism,</hi> is
<hi>Catholick Communion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">August. Collat Carth. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>We shew,</hi> saith Saint.
<hi>Augustine, by our Communion, that we have
the Catholick Church.</hi> Therefore in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Schism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. pag. 32.</note> one while to talk of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
of Doctrine, or of making a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
from a Church, twelve hundred years
since, &amp;c.</hi> and perhaps, charging us with
<hi>causal Schism:</hi> And on the other side, to
acknowledg that the actual departure was
indeed theirs, yet they are not <hi>Scismaticks,</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:49048:159"/>
they <hi>left the errors of Catholicks,</hi>
rather then them: Is indeed to act the
very part of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who, as Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> sayes, <hi>affirmed that the word</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<hi>was not derived from the universality
of Nations,<note place="margin">Aug. Brevic. Collat. lib. 3.</note> but from the plenitude of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that is, from the integrity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
And in another place, writing to
a <hi>Donatist, Thou thinkest</hi> (says he) <hi>that thou
hast spoken acutely,<note place="margin">Epist. 48.</note> when thou interpretest the
Name Catholick, not of Vniversal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but of observation of all Precepts, and
Divine Mysteries.</hi> And hence it was that
the <hi>Donatists</hi> call'd their Bishops, <hi>Bishops of
Catholick Verity,</hi> not of <hi>Catholick Vnity,</hi>
as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says in the same <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I desire to know, whether before
their Reformation, our Church was <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi>
or it began afterwards so to be?
If it was so before, where was that Church
from which we separated? no where on
earth sure: And by consequence either a
separation may be from no body, or the
whole Church failed, <hi>the gates of Hell</hi>
(contrary to our Saviours promise) <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against it.</hi> Again, if our Church
became <hi>Schismatical,</hi> after their deserting
us, because she would not immitate them,
or because she would communicate
with those who held such Doctrines; then
it will follow (since the Church that was
then, did in this, nothing vary from it's prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49048:160"/>
in a former age) that a
Church remaining the same without any
alteration at all, may be the only true
<hi>Church of Christ</hi> to day, and the <hi>Synagogue
of Satan</hi> to morrow. These are Riddles
unconceivable.</p>
            <p>But, to demonstrate that, even in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
opinion, we are not <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
there needs only this Proof, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>Protestants,</hi> yea even <hi>Hugenots,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that Salvation may be had in
Our Church; which no man, charging us
with <hi>Schism,</hi> can say, if he knows the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Schism;</hi> how grievous and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
a crime it is, that cuts off from
the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. On the other side, That the crime
of <hi>Schism</hi> is truly and only to be charged
on them (besides the visible marks of <hi>leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Communion, changing Government, Laws,</hi>
&amp;c.) may be demonstrated thus. There is
no particular true Church, which is a
Member of the Catholick, but thereby
hath a power validly to <hi>excommunicate</hi> all
those that desert her Communion, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
her Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whoever are so
excommunicated by her, are esteem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
by all other Catholick
Churches. So that, if another <hi>Bishop</hi> or
Church, after information of this, shall
receive them into their Communion, that
<hi>Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ipso facto</hi> incurs <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:49048:160"/>
himself. Which excommunication,
being according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> is valid and ratified in Heaven.
Now suppose an <hi>English Bishop</hi> should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
one of his Subjects for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
renouncing <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> and
<hi>Ordination,</hi> and the person so excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
should adjoyn himself to a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in <hi>Scotland, France,
Holland,</hi> &amp;c. They would no doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him: and being so received, he is,
even in the <hi>Bishop's</hi> own judgement, in as
undoubted (though not so straight) a way
to Heaven, as he was before: because the
<hi>Bishop</hi> himself acknowledges <hi>Presbyterian
Congregations</hi> to be true <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
of God: so that by their Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
he is not cut off from Christ, but
from preferments only. The late <hi>Act of
Vniformity</hi> doth far more validly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> then all their
Bishops Courts.</p>

must be to endeavour to procure it. Our

If there be not any proof of faithfnl <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>

their Ordination from <hi>Rome:</hi> and

they will think even the Church of

the Separation (that hath bred so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wars, and so much licenciousness both
in faith and manners) upon points which
your selves confess are not fundamental;
and now you solemnly protest to continue
it without complying in the least diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between us. Go now, and close
your Sermon with a few soft words—
<hi>Your arms are open to embrace, &amp;c. your
hearts are wide open to pray to God to bind
up the breaches,<note place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> &amp;c. of his divided, defiled,

you'l not stir an inch towards the peace

you so gloriously talk of. If this be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
remember, Doctor, the woes that
attend it, if not, express your self so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
hereafter that we may not suspect
it. For my part of all the faults in a
<hi>Sermon,</hi> to that of dissembling I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
a <hi>Vitinian hatred,</hi> as you learnedly
call it.</p>
            <p>Much more moderate were <hi>Vives</hi> and
<hi>Cassander,</hi> whom you commend for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of some abuses in the Church
(among other Authors which you there
cite, jumbling Protestants and Catholicks
confusedly together) for after all their
zeal they dyed quietly in her bosom, and
did not, like you, tear in pieces the seam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Coat of our SAVIOUR, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all terms of peace, unless every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of yours be satisfied to a tittle.</p>
            <p>I remember too a dogged word you
gave us,<note place="margin">Pag. 7, 8.</note> not far from the beginning of
your Sermon; where after you had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
up <hi>Socinians, Antinomians, Ranters,
Solifidians, Millenaries, Reprobratarians,
&amp;c.</hi> (a fine Peal to make a Pulpit ring) to
all which you yield more antiquity then
any will allow your Reformation, you pass
them over with the gentler names of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
and Usurpation, but when you come
to the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> you immediately grow
high and rage, and resemble them to the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> &amp;c.—blind and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49048:164"/>
Passion! Do you not see abroad a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and learned portion of Christians in
Communion with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and are they no better than <hi>Mahometans?</hi>
Do you not see, in your own Country,
and at Court too, Persons so qualified,
that you should blush at your own unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerliness
to compare them to <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If <hi>their chief quarrel be against the

Crowns, and making Decrees with a non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante

been more seasonable five or six hundred
years since. But surely they know <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Princes</hi> are wiser now, and the <hi>Court of
Rome</hi> too. This needs not be the least
hindrance to a <hi>Reconcilement:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by a <hi>Reconcilement</hi> this <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Kingdom</hi> would receive from the <hi>Court of
Rome,</hi> only what <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. find
extremely advantageous, both to the
<hi>honour</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of their Churches and
States. And as for <hi>Decrees</hi> with a <hi>non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante,</hi>
he mistakes the terms of <hi>Apostolick
Constitutions,</hi> by which is intended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
not made by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but
former <hi>Popes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> And touching the Decree
of the <hi>Council of Constance</hi> in his <hi>Margin,</hi>
let me ask him a Question or two: Do not
<hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> use sprinkling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of dipping, <hi>non obstante</hi> that our
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49048:164"/>
               <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> instituted it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?
Do they not think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to communicate <hi>fasting, non-obstante,</hi>
that our <hi>Saviour</hi> instituted the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
after Supper? Do they not without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
eat <hi>Black-puddings, non-obstante</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
gave a command to the contrary?
All this they do, because they think these
things not <hi>essential</hi> or <hi>unalterable,</hi> but left
to the prudence of their particular
Church: Let them permit therefore the
same liberty to a <hi>General Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here give me leave to insert some
few Citations concerning the Protestant-acknowledgments
of the Authority of
Councils.<note place="margin">Act. Mon. pag. 1288.</note> Mr. <hi>Ridley</hi> sayes, <hi>Councils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
represent the Vniversal Church, and
being so gathered together in the Name of
Christ, they have the promise of the Gift and
guiding of the Spirit into all Truth. Doctor
Bilson</hi> plainly confesses,<note place="margin">Perpet. Gov. p. 372, 373.</note> 
               <hi>the Presence and
Assistance of the Holy Ghost for Direction of
General Councils into all Truth;</hi> And after
fairly sayes,<note place="margin">Pag. 374.</note> 
               <hi>The Fathers in all Ages, as well
before as since the Great Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>have
approved and prastis'd this of Councils as the
surest means to decide Doubts.—Hooker</hi>
professes,<note place="margin">Pref. to Eccl. Pol. pag. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The Will of God is to have us do
whatever the Sentence of judicial and final
Decision shall determin, yea, though it seem
utterly to swerve from what is right in our
opinion.—Their Authority</hi> (General

Councils) <hi>is immediately deriv'd and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
from Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Potter.</hi> pag. 30.</note> sayes <hi>Potter.</hi>—And
if Doctor <hi>Peirce</hi> agree with these his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I might say Fathers, in this Point,
I shall not easily fall out with him about
it, but rather endeavour a further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
by offering this fair Proposal; I
will not require of him to hold that the
Fathers meet in Council to make questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matters of Faith, for those they
were taught from their Childhood; but to
consult about their adversaries proofs,
and what arguments should be alleadged
against them; to consult how to express
the Catholick Doctrine in such words as
might best instruct the people, and prevent
Hereticks from abusing them; Hence it
was St.<note place="margin">Athan. in Ep. de Syn.</note> 
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> said, <hi>We meet here, not
because we wanted a Faith,</hi> i. e. were incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what to hold, <hi>but to confound those who
go about to contradict the Truth.</hi> Which
Rule, if Councils observe, I think the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
would scarce refuse to obey them; and
our only difference in this point, I hope,
is, he thinks they do not observe this Rule,
and I think they do.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Preacher's boasting. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks

Conditions necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be Observed by the
Doctor, in case he Reply. Of
the Name Protestant.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THus I have gone through, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
(except to those who love
to be contentious) sufficiently, all the
pretended <hi>Novelties</hi> imputed by Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>
to the Roman Catholick Church; I have
likewise brought to the <hi>Test</hi> all the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
made by him, either to excuse the
<hi>English Churches Separation</hi> from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick,</hi> or at least to perswade us
not to call it <hi>Schism:</hi> And it seems to
me, I have demonstrated him unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49048:166"/>in both. Nay more, (which is a
great misery, if he would consider it
with that seriousness, which <hi>Eternity</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
I think I have prov'd that the
fearful crime of <hi>Schism</hi> will lye heavie
upon his <hi>Church,</hi> though he had shew'd all
the Points by him mention'd, to be <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties.</hi>
And having done this, I must
say with St. <hi>Augustin, Vtinam verba ista in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuderim,
&amp; non effuderim.</hi> But consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the present temper of this Age, I
doubt, I shall have reason to fear, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the same holy Father's expression,
lest, <hi>when I beg them to afford their ears,
they should make ready their teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. However I hope the <hi>Doctor</hi> will no
more be believed with any reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
(as he doth in his <hi>Sermon</hi>) of <hi>one
remarkable infirmity in the Popish Writers,—They
ever complain we have left their
Church,<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> but never shew that</hi> Iota <hi>as to which
we have left the Word of God, or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
or the yet uncorrupted and Primitive
Church, or the Four first General Councils.</hi>
Truly, this Speech of his seems to me so
vain, and rash, and shameless a boast, that
I cannot but blush for him, when I read
it, and tremble for him when I see <hi>Truth</hi>
so little consider'd by a <hi>Preacher,</hi> sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Person, as he pretended.</p>
            <p>3. But perhaps I understand not his
phrase of [<hi>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wing that</hi> Iota <hi>as to which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49048:166"/>
they have left, &amp;c.</hi>] If he mean we have
not demonstrated their deserting <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
or, that we believe not, even since we
have seen their <hi>Answers,</hi> that our demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
are unanswerable; there are
extant whole <hi>Libraries</hi> of our <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
sufficient to overwhelm him. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
before he say so again, let him
enquire out and consider a Book, written
by <hi>Simon Vogorius,</hi> Counseller to the
<hi>French King,</hi> entituled, <hi>An Assertion of the
Catholick Faith out of the Four first Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical
Councils, and other received Synods
within that time.</hi> Or even, let him review
what is quoted against him here<note n="‖" place="margin">Cha. 17. Sect. 10.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
one of his own Points, <hi>Celibacy
of the Clergy,</hi> out of the Four first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and several other, as ancient, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Councils. Before all which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
there is found an Injunction of it as
high as <hi>Calixtus</hi> his dayes about <hi>A. D.</hi> 220.
which also Doctor <hi>Peirce</hi> mentions.<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> Doth
not this prohibition of the Priests from
Marriage amount <hi>to the magnitude of an</hi>
Iota <hi>with him?</hi> How comes it then to be
one of his <hi>Grievances</hi> in this <hi>Sermon,</hi>
and that under no milder a phrase than
<hi>the Doctrine of Devils?</hi> Or will not such
Antiquity pass for Primitive, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<hi>Antique enough</hi> (to use his words)?
Unless he will shrink up Primitive Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
from the 6th Age to the 4th, from
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49048:167"/>
the 4th to the 3d. (where few Writings
being extant, less of the Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Customs can be shewn in
them) Or from the 3d to the 1st Age
and the Apostles times (as the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
in the Plea of Antiquity, treat the
<hi>Prelatists.</hi>) For on this manner even the
most learned of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers,
when they are straitned with proofs, are
wont to retire. So Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
made a bold challenge to be tryed by
Antiquity for the first 600 years.</p>
            <p>But after many hot Encounters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Controvertists, and after An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
better discover'd to the later Pens
on the Protestant Party than to the first,
<hi>A. Bp. Lawd,</hi> more cautious, contracts the
Protestants Challenge somewhat narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Fathers of the first 400 years, or
thereabouts, <hi>The Protestants</hi> (saith he<note n="‖" place="margin">Sect. 28. p. 217</note>)
<hi>offer to be tryed by all the ancient Councils
and Fathers of the Church within the first
400 years, and somewhat further.</hi> And,
since the <hi>A. Bp.</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> makes
his Plea of Antiquity yet shorter, <hi>viz.</hi> for
the Fathers of the first 300 years; <hi>For the
particular Doctrines</hi> (saith he<note n="‖" place="margin">Of Schism, c. 8. sect. 7.</note>) <hi>wherein
we are affirmed by the Romanists to depart
from the Vnity of the Faith, we make no
doubt to approve our selves to any that will
judge of the Apostolical Doctrines and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the Scriptures, and consent of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49048:167"/>
first 300 years, or the Four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi>—And
again, <hi>We profess</hi> (saith
he<note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. c. 9. sect. 7.</note>) <hi>to believe so much, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by all the Reasons, and Authorities,
and Proofs from Scriptures, or the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Writers, those of the first 300 years, or
the Four General Councils.</hi> Where by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Four first General Councils,
he means only to the bare <hi>decisions</hi> of these
Councils in matters of Faith concerning
our Saviour and the Holy Ghost, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
himself also to the Authority of
those Fathers, who flourished in the time
of these Four Councils, and sate in them.
For, though the last of these Councils was
held in the middle of the 5th Age, yet he
claims a tryal by the Fathers only to the
end of the 3d Age. Again, by this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Writers of the Three first
Ages only, he bars most of the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and all those that are more large
and Voluminous, from bearing any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against Protestants, and leaves scarse
half a score Authors of Note now extant,
and several, writing only some short Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
or Epistles, whereby they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to try all the Doctrine and Discipline
of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>4. But these were timorous Souls that
would fain be thought to deal civilly with
antiquity; let us hear two or three bolder
spirits, that speak plain and freely: What

antiquity, as</hi> Joshua <hi>was with the old
and mouldy bread of the Gibeonites;</hi> and the

What says <hi>Acontius?<note place="margin">Strang. li. 6. pag. 296.</note> Some of us are come
to that, that they will fill up their Writings
with the Authority of the Fathers, which I
would to God they had performed with pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
success, as they hopefully attempted
it, &amp;c. I onely think this custome is most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and altogether to be eschewed.</hi> What

quote all day long upon this Subject)
what sayes the Patriark of Protestancy,

                     <hi>Luth.</hi> in Act. Apost. ca. 15.</note> There never was any one pure Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
but either added something to the faith
or substracted.</hi> And now, what shall we say
our selves in this confused variety? Against
some of our Adversaries, we must cite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
or else we do nothing; against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if we cite all the antiquity that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<hi>shewed it,</hi> as to stop their mouths, or to force
them to confess and repent of their fault, then

party to another, as long as the dissention lasts

Quakers, &amp;c</hi> who (after all their <hi>Books,
Canons, Acts of Vniformity,</hi> &amp;c. which those Sects

               </gap> it belongs to
them, who have thus divided themselves, not

clearly, that there is such a discession from
those Scriptures, Fathers, and Councils, by that
former Church (which they deserted) not in
an <hi>Iota</hi> but in some grand principle of our
Faith, which admitted no longer safety to
them in her Communion; because the <hi>Roman
Catholic Church</hi> is in <hi>possession:</hi> and, by our

            <p>7. The Doctor is likewise to consider, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
if, <hi>ex super abundanti,</hi> we should yield so far
as out of <hi>Antient Records</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
to alledge any <hi>Proofs</hi> to enervate their

they can produce from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity
evident demonstrations</hi> against <hi>us,</hi> they are not
so much as <hi>probabilities:</hi> all this by their own
confession. For, as has been shew'd, they lay
it for a ground, and acknowledge the <hi>Catholic
Church</hi> (of which according to their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
the <hi>Roman</hi> is at least a Member) to be in all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49048:170"/>
               <hi>fundamental Points</hi> infallible: and that in all
other Points, now in debate, which are not
<hi>fundamental,</hi> it would be unlawful for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches to professe any dissent from
her, without an evident demonstration, that
she has actually and certainly erred in them;
yea moreover, that she will admit none of the
Dissenters into her Communion, except such as
(though against their Consciences and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
will subscribe to her Errors; Errors so
heynous, as to deserve and justifie a separation.</p>
            <p>8. These things premis'd, my last care
must be to provide, that, in case a <hi>Reply</hi> be
intended to this <hi>Treatise,</hi> it may not be such
an one as may abuse the world. The <hi>Preacher</hi>
must consider it is not such another blundering
<hi>Sermon</hi> that will now serve his turn to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
so much as to any <hi>Protestant,</hi> who

Therefore that he may know, what
<hi>Conditions</hi> are necessary to render an <hi>Answer</hi>
not altogether impertinent and insupportable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I here declare, that, in case he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
a confutation of what is here alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by me to disprove the charge of <hi>Novelti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
by him laid on the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> and
the excusing of <hi>Schism</hi> in his own, he will be a
betrayer of his own Soul, and the Souls of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
those that rely on him, unless he observe the
Conditions following.</p>
            <p>9. The first is, since if <hi>Protestants</hi> have in
truth an evident <hi>demonstration</hi> that the <hi>Roman
Doctrins,</hi> for which they separate, are indeed
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49048:170"/>
such pernicious <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>Novelties,</hi> we readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant they are not obliged to subscribe
them; And it being supposed by the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
&amp;c.</hi> that, without such a certainty. it
would have been unlawfull for <hi>Protestants</hi> to
question or censure such former <hi>Doctrins</hi> of the
Church; The <hi>Doctor</hi> is bound, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
him to declare expresly. as in the presence
of Him, who is. <hi>Supreme Head of the Church,</hi>
and will revenge severely all calumnious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
of it, that he is demonstratively
<hi>certain,</hi> that in all these <hi>Points,</hi> charged by
him on the <hi>Church</hi> of later times as <hi>Novelties</hi>
and <hi>Errors</hi> introduced since the <hi>four first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
she is manifestly guilty: and that nothing
appears in this, or any other <hi>Catholic book</hi>
of his Acquaintance, which deserves to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
so much as a <hi>probable proof</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For my part I here protest on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, that I find not any one concluding
allegation in his <hi>Sermon,</hi> nor believe there can
any be produced; which can warrant him to
make such a Declaration.</p>
            <p>10. The <hi>second Condition</hi> is, That in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he professe he can or hath demonstratively
proved by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Primitive Antiquity,</hi>
the main grounds, upon which they pretend
to justifie their <hi>separation</hi> to be no <hi>Schism,</hi> to
wit, these. 1. That the <hi>universal Church,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in a Lawful <hi>General Council</hi> may in
<hi>points of doctrin</hi> not <hi>fundamental</hi> so mislead the
<hi>Church</hi> by <hi>errors,</hi> that a particular Church,
&amp;c. discovering such <hi>errors,</hi> may be obliged to
separate externally. 2. That a particular <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

or a <hi>Congregation Diocesan</hi> may lawfully

                  </gap>
Council</hi> may do the like in regard of a <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical,</hi>
or any of them, in regard of an <hi>Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
formerly accepted and admitted. If these <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ous</hi>
he <hi>Innovations,</hi> as in our perswasion they
are, it is clear they destroy all possible <hi>unity:</hi>
If they be not, let some demonstrative
<hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> be produced out of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triquity,</hi>
that a reversing of such order and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
has been practised and approved in
the Catholic Church. 3. That a <hi>particular
Church, &amp;c.</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> can
judg what <hi>Doctrines</hi> are <hi>fundamental</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi>
to all <hi>Persons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Communities, &amp;c.</hi> and what
not: <hi>And that a Catalogue</hi> of such <hi>Doctrines</hi> be
given by the <hi>Respondent,</hi> or <hi>demonstrative</hi> reasons
alledged why such an one is not necessary.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if he will deny the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has separated externally from the present
<hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> but only from the <hi>Roman;</hi>
then, to make this good, he is obliged to name
what other <hi>visible</hi> Member of the <hi>Vniversal
Church</hi> they continue in <hi>Communion</hi> with, in
whose <hi>public Service</hi> they will joyn or can be
admitted, and to whose <hi>Synods</hi> they ever have,
or can repair. And, since at the time of their
first <hi>Separation,</hi> they were only in <hi>Communion</hi>
with the <hi>Roman-Catholic Church,</hi> and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, be must shew how, when, and
where they entered into any other new <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
Lastly, Since the <hi>English Church,</hi> by
renouncing not only several <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49048:171"/>
Councils</hi> acknowledged for <hi>General,</hi> and
actually submitted to both by the <hi>Eastern</hi> and
<hi>Western Churches,</hi> hath thereby separated from
both these, he must find out some other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> divided
from both these, (that is, some that are not
manifestly <hi>heretical,</hi>) with whom the <hi>English
Church</hi> communicates.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>A fourth Condition</hi> is, that he must either
declare other <hi>Calvinistical Reformed Churches,</hi>
which manifestly have no succession of lawfl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ordained <hi>Ministers,</hi> enabled validly to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
and <hi>administer Sacraments,</hi> to <hi>consecrate,
confirm,</hi> preach <hi>God's Word,</hi> &amp;c. to be no <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
or <hi>Schismatical Congregations:</hi> Or if they
be, he must demonstrate how the <hi>English
Church</hi> can acquit her self from <hi>Schism,</hi> since her
<hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> have authoritatively repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their<note n="*" place="margin">A. D. 1618. at Dort.</note> 
               <hi>Synods,</hi> and a general permission
is given to any <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<hi>them</hi> true, reformed, and sufficiently <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. The last shall be, that he abstain from
imputing to the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> the opinions
or sayings of particular <hi>Writers.</hi> The Church
her self having sufficiently declared her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in her <hi>Councils,</hi> especially that of <hi>Trent.</hi>
If he will combate against her, there he has a
fair and open <hi>field,</hi> and charity requires that
he affix to her <hi>Decisions</hi> the most moderate and
best qualified sense: Otherwise he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself as one, who is sorry <hi>his Mother</hi>
should not be ill reputed. Now in exchange,
I for my part am extreamly willing to proceed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49048:172"/>
in the same manner with the <hi>English Church.</hi> I
would sain charge her with nothing but her
own declared <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Decisions.</hi> But
truly I know not where to find them, except
only in the little <hi>Primmer</hi> and <hi>Catechism</hi> for
Children. For the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> being almost
all <hi>Negatives,</hi> may as well be reputed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Turkish Congregations,</hi>
since these also <hi>deny the Sacrifice of the Masse,
Purgatory, Infallibility of Councils,</hi> &amp;c. other
<hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have published reasonably
large <hi>Professions of their Faith,</hi> they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their own positive sense in almost all
Points of <hi>Christian Belief,</hi> as the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the English Church seems to have made a
<hi>secret</hi> of her <hi>Faith;</hi> upon what motive I am
unwilling to guess.</p>
            <p>14. These <hi>Conditions</hi> in themselves so <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi>
and even according to <hi>Protestants</hi>
grounds also, so <hi>necessary,</hi> if the <hi>Replyer shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to perform,</hi> he will, in the judgment of all
discerning Readers, be himself the <hi>Answerer</hi>
and <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uter</hi> of his own <hi>Reply;</hi> and withall,
will shew it is not <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> he aims at, but
the satisfying his own, or others interests,
passions and revenge against those who least
deserve it. All subterfuges, all involved intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies
in answering, all discourses which are
not open, candid, and sincere, will be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of guilt: He may perhaps hide the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his cause from credulous Women,
Trades-men, or possibly the more unlearned
part of our <hi>Gentry;</hi> but to all considering
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49048:172"/>
               <hi>Readers,</hi> his <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>hiding</hi> will be his most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<hi>discovery. Aristotle</hi> saies, the <hi>Sepi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> is the
wisest of all <hi>Fishes,</hi> because she conceals her
self by casting forth round about her a black

Fishermen are sure to find her under her inky

            <p>15. And now having finished our Answer
to the substance wherein we differ, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with the Name that distinguishes us: He
puts us in mind of the reason why the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
and from them other Reformerd took the
name,<note place="margin">Page 36.</note> 
               <hi>Protestants,</hi> for <hi>protesting</hi> against the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Edict of <hi>Worms, Spires,</hi> &amp;c. we find little
ground why the <hi>Reformers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> should
borrow that title. Against what Armes or
Armies did they ever <hi>protest?</hi> What Edicts were
made against them? We <hi>Catholics</hi> might rather
assume such a title, if it were of any special ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
having seen (and felt too) Edicts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and far more bloody nature made against
us: Nay (thanks to such <hi>Sermons</hi>) we see at this
day Edicts, severe enough, published, and worse
preparing, not against Subjects in Arms and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Rebellion, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were against
the <hi>Empire,</hi> but against such, as the Law-givers,
and Law-perswaders know mean no harm; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as would be both most watchful &amp;
assisting to establish the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Edicts, to draw all the remainder of
blood out of our vein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49048:173"/>
emptied in our Kings and Countries
Cause; though our hope is still in the mercy
of our gracious Sovereign, and the prudent
moderation of those about him.</p>
            <p>16. Yet sanguinary Sermons are greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
than sanguinary Laws; for Laws may
and somtimes are qualifi'd by the equity of
Judges, and in particular those against <hi>Roman
Catholics</hi> have often been allay'd by the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
clemency of our Kings. But the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sermons, that call for blood, inspire fury
into mens hearts, make compassion esteem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and the most savage cruelty the best Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of Religion. The truth is, Pulpits have
been the Sources whence so much blood has
flow'd in this Kingdom, which Sources, if they
