         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Let vs looke aduiſedly into the actions of this age, when was vertue and honeſtie more deſpiſed: when was pride, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and exceſſe more immoderate, when was adultery and all other kind of vnchaſt liuing, eyther more apparant or leſſe puniſhed, when were all manner of abhominations more tollerated, when Magiſtrates will ſometimes fauour their owne vices in others: and euery man accounteth that to be moſt comly, which is moſt taken vp and inured by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>How many men doe but flatter themſelues, by fauouring their owne vices, which they thinke to bee but veniall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the immoderate vſe of voluptuous pleaſures, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16395:16"/>
be but ſmall offences.</p>
               <p>Theſe adulterers, theſe drunkards, theſe ſwearers, theſe blaſphemers, they haue made a ſacrifice of their ſoules to the Diuell, and haue caſt of all care both of honour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie.</p>
               <p>We neuer thinke of the matter, how negligently we liue, and how careleſſely we ſleepe, euery houre beſiedged with a number of armed vices, that doe keepe a continuall watch, to bring vs to deſtruction: the thing that is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought after and deſired by all men is peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but theſe kinde of men that doe ſo much incline them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to this vngodly manner of liuing, it is but an vnaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace they hunt after, for the happyneſſe of peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is to make war againſt our ſelues, and to fight ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt our owne vices, for with theſe enemies <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (which is our true peace) is at variance, and that with deadly hatred.</p>
               <p>The life of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was wont to be called a continuall warfare, but it is nowe turned to a more peaceable time, when we liue in banqueting, in eaſe and in idleneſſe, in plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure and in ſporte, and in ſteade of <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Pauilions,</hi> wee walter and tumble our ſelues vpon our beds of downe, and in the ſtead of hard <hi>Armour,</hi> wee bee cloathed in ſoft ſilkes, perfumed with muske bals, with powders and pomanders of ſweete and pleaſant ſmell: and in the ſtead of weapons in the hand of a warriour, a payre of perfumed gloues, or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps a <hi>Curtizans Fanne,</hi> and thou O madde man cryeſt peace, peace, when thou haſt <hi>God</hi> thine enemie, the author of peace, that hath with open mouth denounced warre againſt thee, for whoſoeuer is at one with vices, hath broken the truce made betweene him and God in the time when he was baptized.</p>

               <p>SOme will ſay that, <hi>As the heart thinketh, ſo the tongue ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>: but we ſee where <hi>Opinion</hi> is once ingrafted, wee are no leſſe leaning vnto it in our actions, then we be in our wordes, and our <hi>opinions</hi> are ſo variable, that more changa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the Moone, we erect euery day a new choice, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that to morrow, which we liked of to day: and men doe vary in <hi>opinions,</hi> euen in matters of delight: yet amongſt all the things that may happen vpon this humane <hi>Theater</hi> of the world, there is nothing more generally hated then the actions of <hi>Warre,</hi> yet by a contrary <hi>Opinion</hi> conceiued by ſome other, there is nothing more pernicious then the bleſſedneſſe of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> would haue it, <hi>That an vniuſt peace, is to be preferred before the moſt iuſt warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> tels vs againe, <hi>That there is more ſafety in an vniuſt warre, then there is in a patcht peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One affirmes warre to bee the miniſter of Gods wrath, when he is diſpleaſed, no leſſe grieuous to the world, then the loathſome plague or peſtilence.</p>
               <p>It is truth (ſayth another) warre is the miniſter of Gods iuſtice, eyther for contempt of himſelfe, or of his religion, or for the wicked life of worldlings.</p>
               <p>It is yet againe alleadged, that the effect of warres is the deſtruction of countries, the deſolation of noble houſes, and the ſacking of oppulent Citties.</p>
               <p>The effect of peace (ſayth another) is to draw the verie corruption of manners after it, and there is nothing that bringes ſo ſweet and eaſie a ſubiection to vice, as the ſeaſon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16395:17"/>
and idleneſſe of peace, it infeebleth the mindes of young men, it maketh them become <hi>Hermophrodites,</hi> halfe-men, halfe harlots, it eſſeminates their minds, and nuſeleth them vp in all kinde of <hi>Folly</hi>: It giueth olde men opportunitie to trauell and turmoyle, and to tire themſelues, by oppreſſion, by extortion, by bribery, by periury, by craft, by ſubtiltie, and by all manner of vngodlineſſe to eſcape from my yong maiſter his ſonne, and whilſt the father is thus in his money harueſt toyling for wealth, the ſonne is in a <hi>Brothell</hi> houſe, ſporting and dallying with his wench.</p>
               <p>But yet (ſayth one) <hi>Warres</hi> ſhould euer haue an eye to peace, and <hi>Warres</hi> ſhould neuer be taken in hand but to the end to haue peace.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered againe that peace is it that draweth to proſperitie, and this proſperitie is it that ſetteth an edge to ſloath and negligence, for as peace is the parent of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſo it is the nurſe of pride, and the trainer vp of all care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>But warres ruineth both towne and Countrey, inforceth the husbandman to forſake his labour, it bringeth in want, dearth, and ſcarcitie, but peace is it that breedeth plenty.</p>
               <p>And as peace breedeth plentie, ſo it armeth <hi>Cape apee,</hi> all ſortes of ſinnes, for in the time of peace there is no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that wantes example: and I might yet further adde that in this time of peace the Marchant findeth libertie, to carry away Corne, Beere, Butter, Cheeſe, Leather, Tinne, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, Cloath, Wooll, and all other ſuch commodities, ſo that our ſtore and plenty, by theſe meanes are turned to penury.</p>
               <p>Warres that are vndertaken by a prince, in defence of his right, though they may be reputed to be iuſt and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and likewiſe to ſuppreſſe a forraigne foe, although the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16395:18"/>
conqueſt bee accounted glorious, yet in <hi>Ciuill warres,</hi> all things are full of miſery, yet nothing more miſerable then victory: when it pleaſeth the almightie to puniſh by <hi>Warre,</hi> all thinges vppon the earth are preſt to fight vnder his <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> yea euen the ambitiouſneſſe of Princes, to puniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues one by another: but where a kingdome is deuided in it ſelfe, the <hi>Barre</hi> of deuiſion proceedeth from their ſinnes: and where the neighbour forſaketh the neighbour, ſeeking to deſtroy him, God letteth looſe the reyne to bloud, for to runne vpon bloud, puniſhing (O great worke maiſter) one ſinne with another, ſo that where they once fall from God, they doe finde no crueller tormentors, then themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon themſelues.</p>
               <p>Warre is the ſcourge of God to puniſh ſinnes: the hand of <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to inforce change, and as it is the <hi>Adamant,</hi> to draw <hi>courrage</hi> vnto it, ſo it is a <hi>Baſilique</hi> to <hi>Feare,</hi> that dyes to behold it.</p>
               <p>Warre ſtrikes as God willes, workes as ſinne warpes it, and to be briefe, it is a miſerable neceſſitie in nature, and a neceſſary corrector of times infirmitie.</p>
               <p>It is yet againe alleadged that the Prayers that are exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the time of peace, is farre more happy for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, then the noiſe of <hi>Drummes</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Alarums</hi> of warre.</p>
               <p>And yet we may perceiue that the vices that are hatched vp in peace, are in far greater number then the inormities that doe accompany warre, and therefore if the affayres of warre doe not buſie a <hi>Statesman,</hi> the diſeaſes of peace will ſo turmoyle him, as he muſt be ſtill vigilent to diſcouer the diſeaſes of the common wealth daily drawne in by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie and ſurfeites of peace.</p>
               <p>I might yet inferre diuerſe other <hi>opinions,</hi> ſome vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>
                  <hi>Oſorius</hi> confirmeth it in theſe wordes, <hi>He that taketh away the knowledge of Armes, worketh the ouerthrowe of the common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> againe giueth vs this Item, <hi>we muſt not lay our Armes aſide, if we deſire to liue in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> is not to bee forgotten: <hi>There is nothing more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to incite an enemie, then wher he findeth ſlouth &amp; negligence</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Caeſar</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>It is certaine, that mightie Empiers, are not kept by ſlouth, but by weapons in the handes of experimented Souldiors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will conclude with <hi>Plato,</hi> who affirmeth how that a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Crowne,</hi> can neuer ſit cloſe to his head who once neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the knowledge of Armes: the common wealth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath as great need of valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men to defend it, as of good lawes to gouerne it, for maieſty without force, was neuer yet aſſured.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16395:19"/>
themſelues (at the leaſt as they are hand-led) are but the meere <hi>opinions</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>Vnhappy may thoſe lawes be called (poore ſuiters may well ſay) where there is ſo much controuerſie that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>If law be certaine, why ſhould iudgement be delayed; if but to doe right why are ſo many poore menne wronged, if grounded on conſcience, why is it partiall.</p>
               <p>Men that are out of apparell are deſirous to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in laſting ſuites, but he that would haue a laſting ſuite indeed, let him get him a ſuite in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> if it doth not laſt him out three ſuites of <hi>Perpetuana,</hi> the lawyer is but a <hi>Foole,</hi> that firſt tooke the meaſure of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>There is no worſe torture, then the torture of the lawe, they are ſo full of <hi>Inſtances,</hi> of <hi>Quidities,</hi> of <hi>Demurres,</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latories</hi> and delayes, that what ſhould I ſay, though the law it ſelfe intendeth nothing but right, it is yet made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of iniury and wrong, for they haue law to ouerthrowe law, and there is no law be it neuer ſo <hi>Legitimate</hi> or truly be gotten, which with their wreſted gloſſes and ſubtill expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they cannot <hi>Baſterdize.</hi>

               <p>It is the ill liuing of wicked men, that did firſt begette good Lawes, for what elſe are the great number of Lawes that are amongſt vs, but the Authenticall Regiſters of our corruptions, and what are the manifolde Commentaries that are written vppon them, but a very corruption of the lawes themſelues.</p>
               <p>Some are of <hi>Opinion,</hi> that in this age the multitude of our Lawes doe more oppreſſe, then the multitude of our enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities could hurt or moleſt.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> it was prouided, that if any man did inuent a new law, hee ſhoulde firſt propound the ſame to the people wearing a Halter about his necke, to the end that if it were thought pernicious, he might forthwith be hanged.</p>

               <p>But I wonder of what <hi>Opinion</hi> they be that will neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>Sermon,</hi> nor let ſlippe a new faſhion.</p>
               <p>Some to winne <hi>opinion,</hi> doth euery day ſuit themſelues in new fangled faſhions, like <hi>Proteus</hi> the god of ſhapes; and whilſt the poore ſoule is pend vp in a ſtreight <hi>Cell,</hi> our foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh cogitations are ſtill wandering throughout the world to ſeeke out new faſhions.</p>
               <p>Some by wearing a long locke that hangs dangling by his eare, do think by that louzie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie to be well eſteemed by the <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>Fooles,</hi> for although there be ſome wiſemen that will tollerate in the matter, yet I neuer knew wiſemen that would followe the faſhion,</p>
               <p>Some will ſo curle their haire, picke their browes and will ſo metamorphife themſelues aſwell in their atire as in their demeanures, that they rather make ſhow to be demy-harlots, then men.</p>
               <p>Some haue ſought to ſhake <hi>Opinion</hi> out of a <hi>Sinque pace,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:16395:31"/>
but now their legges are ſo ouer peſtered with <hi>Garters</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> that they are fit for nothing vnles for a <hi>Moris dance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch other like may perhaps beget an <hi>opinion,</hi> and what <hi>opinion</hi> is it, but a baſe <hi>opinion,</hi> and it is commonly conceiued, but by the baſeſt ſorte of people.</p>
               <p>I had allmoſt forgotten to ſpeake of women, yet they are ſometimes conceited in their <hi>opinions</hi> aſwell as men, but to ſpeake truly of thoſe women that be modeſt, they do laugh at the fooliſh <hi>opinions</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> hath not ordained all women to be wiſe, there muſt be ſome vaine, if it be but to fit the follies of men, and it is a receiued <hi>Opinion</hi> amongſt thoſe women of entertainment, that ſhe that learneth faſteſt to forget ſhame is houlden to be moſt excellent in faſhion.</p>
               <p>By this it may appeare, that the edge of induſtry is ſo aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the force of pleaſure both in men and women, that they rather ſtuddy to winne <hi>opinion</hi> then to practiſe <hi>vertue,</hi> I will not ſay how often we be deceiued in our <hi>opinions,</hi> taking that for vertue that is indeed but vice, but an eſpecial meane whereby to drawe on a vertuous <hi>opinion</hi> doth rather conſiſt in him that doth liue well then in him that can talke well; rather in doing of thinges worthy to be ſpoken of, then in ſpeaking of thinges worthy to be done.</p>

inſtruction, doth often come to naught, becauſe the minde is not ſatisfied with nature alone but hath neede of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke vſage of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which may cleanſe and ſcoure the ſoule by taking away the dim vayle of <hi>opinion,</hi> from whence ariſeth all the errors in men, for in caſe good and euill were well knowne, and perceiued, euery man woulde chuſe the good and leaue the ill, and therefore may vertue be ſayd to be a wiſedome and an vnderſtanding to chuſe the good, &amp; vice againe a lacke of foreſight and an ignorance that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to iudge falſely, becauſe men neuer chuſe the ill with <hi>Opinion</hi> that it is ill, but they are deceiued through a certain likeneſſe of ſome thing that is good: the Art therefore that teacheth to diſcerne the truth from falſhood may well bee attayned vnto, and the vertue by which we chuſe this good indeed, may be called true <hi>knowledge,</hi> which cannot bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by any affection that proceedeth from the bodie, eſpecially where the minde is well gouerned and ruled by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> for ſuch force <hi>Reaſon</hi> hath, that ſhe maketh the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces euer ready to obey, ſo that although our ſinewes, our bones, and our groſſe compacted fleſh, haue no <hi>Reaſon</hi> in them at all, yet when there ſpringeth in vs the motion of minde, that the imagination pricketh forward, and ſhaketh the bridle to the ſpirites, all the members are in a readynes, the feete to runne, the handes to vndertake, and the whole bodie to doe and indeuour any thing that the minde thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon.</p>
               <p>It is requiſite therefore that <hi>knowledge</hi> ſhould euermore march in the foremoſt rancke, for although <hi>Appetite</hi> may ſometimes haue a longing after thinges that be good, yet being blinde of her ſelfe, ſhee cannot make election of the good from the bad therefore hath <hi>Nature</hi> ſo ordained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to euery vertue of <hi>knowledge,</hi> there is annexed a vertue of

               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledge</hi> as I would define it, is vnderſtanding tempered with <hi>reaſon,</hi> neyther vaunting it ſelfe for any action of our owne, nor of any others that wee loue, or belong vnto vs: and <hi>knowledge</hi> is it that doth refine vs from the dregges and filth of the common people, it ſerueth as a Ladder to climb to <hi>Honour</hi> and dignity, it calleth vs from earthly vanities, to things celeſtiall and diuine: <hi>knowledge</hi> giueth vs new eyes to ſpie into the demeanures of flattering <hi>Paraſites,</hi> that wee cannot bee eaſily deceiued in our <hi>Opinions</hi>: and <hi>knowledge</hi> doth ſo vnmaske any mans eyes to ſee into himſelfe, that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi> can neuer make him blind.</p>
