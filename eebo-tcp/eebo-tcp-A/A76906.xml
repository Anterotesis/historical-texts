            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce my laſt to you, dated the 14. of this inſtant, The Scots Horſe are advanced from <hi>Carlile,</hi> towards our Quarters at <hi>Perith,</hi> and thought to have fallen upon our Out-guards, and ſurprized our men in our quarters, but by the vigilancy of our Scouts, they were diſcovered, and notice were given to our Horſe Guards, who were kept 4, miles from <hi>Perith</hi> in the Road to <hi>Carlile:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ockies,</hi> which accordingly they did; for about 2. miles on this ſide the bridge, a party of the Scots horſe; and 4 Companies of foot, were drawn up in a Cloſe, and ſtayed only for Orders, their horſe who gave the Allarm, retreated another way, ſo that they had not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our coming, but upon our near approach, they cryed out, Horſe Horſe, Arme Arme; but notwithſtanding all their preparatives, our Dragoones diſmounted, and got the hedge, and the Engliſh ground; they fired again, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161998:3"/>
kept their ground, and after a ſharp diſpute, and furious conflict gallantly maintained on both ſides, we gained ground, and beat them out of the field, where they firſt charged us, they be took themſelves to another field, (the ſence thereof being only ſupported by a ſmall ſtone wall) breaſt high, where they fired very reſolutely, but our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones purſued, and made way for the Horſe over the wall, which the Scots perceiving, betook themſelves to flight, our men purſued them 2. fields, but by reaſon of freſh ſupplyes coming to them, made good their retreat, with little loſſe.</p>
            <p>In this conflict we loſt about 8. men of the enemies, we found dead in the place above 20. who might eaſily be diſcovered by their gray ſhootes and blew Bonnets.</p>
            <p>Its ſaid that Lieutenant Col. <hi>Hames,</hi> and Major <hi>Ennis,</hi> who commanded in chiefe, were mortally wounded, for ndeed they fought reſolutely, charging three times through our body of horſe, a gallant break-faſt at their firſt coming; This action happened upon Sunday morning laſt about 2. of the Clock in the morning, The Armies of Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> are marched on this ſide <hi>Carlile;</hi> the ſaid Duke entered <hi>England</hi> with about 9000 horſe and foot, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50.
