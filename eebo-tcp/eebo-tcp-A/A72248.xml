            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>Robert Harriſon</hi> of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Wilts</hi> Inkeeper.</head>
            <opener>Moſt humbly ſhewing,</opener>
            <p>THat fiue yeares ſince the Petitioner bargained with one <hi>Stephen Barber</hi> alias <hi>Laurence,</hi> for the Inne called the <hi>White-hart</hi> in Marleboroogh and certaine goods therein for 350. li. whereof 50. li. was for the Leaſe, and 300. li. for the goods. The Petitioner at diuers times agreed vpon, paid all the ſaid 300. li. except onely 100. li. for ſecuritie whereof, <hi>Iohn Booth</hi> and <hi>Iohn Goldſmith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came bound in a Bond of two hundred pound to <hi>Barber,</hi> and for their indemnpitie, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner aſſigned ouer to them all the goods which hee had bought of <hi>Barber,</hi> beeing worth 300. li. the goods neuertheleſſe to remayne in the Petitioners poſſeſſion till the Sureties were damnified. Afterwards <hi>Barber</hi> being diſpleaſed with the Petitioner (for not permitting him to build a Barne on the backe ſide of the Inne, threatned to roote him out, and euer afterwards ſought means to vndo him, &amp; the better to compaſſe his malitious purpoſe, he combining with the ſaid <hi>Booth,</hi> and <hi>Goldſmith,</hi> procured them (although they were neuer damnified) priuately to confeſſe a Iudgement vnto him vpon the ſaid Bond of two hundred pound, and therupon ſued out a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> which being deliuered to the vnder Sheriffe, he entred into the Inne, and ſummoning a Iurie there: inquired what goods were there of the ſaid <hi>Booth</hi> and <hi>Goldſmith</hi> towards ſatisfaction of the Execution, and there not only extended the goods which the Petitioner bought of <hi>Barber,</hi> beeing worth as aforeſaid 300. li. but alſo (contrary to Lawe,) extended vpon all the reſt of the Petitioners proper houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe and bedding, worth at the leaſt 200. li. more, all which the vnder Sheriffe cauſed to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued but at two hundred and eight pound, for which, with the Leaſe the Petitioner was by one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Wydley</hi> then lately offered eight hundred pounds, which their indirect practiſes to vndoe the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner being perceiued, he ſhewed vnto them a Protection from his Maſter M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Awbin</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Houſe, hoping vpon the ſight thereof (in reuerence to this honourable Aſſembly,) they would forbeare to doe him wrong. But they made a ſcorne therof, <hi>Booth</hi> ſaying he cared not a fart for the ſame, and <hi>Cockes</hi> the Bailiffe ſaid in deſpight of the Protection, hee would carry the Petitioner to Priſon for tenne Groats recompencene, all the reſt laughing and ieſting at the ſame. Then the ſaid Maſter <hi>Wydley</hi> pretending great friendſhip to the Petitioner ſatisfied the Execution and tooke the goods from the vnder Sheriffe into his hands, and then Maſter <hi>Andrew Holdipp</hi> a friend to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner offering to pay vnto him 140. li. for the Redemption of the goods (which was as much as he was to pay for the ſame) he vtterly refuſed to deliuer the ſame, ſaying, That his throate ſhould be cut rather then the Petitioner ſhould keepe that Inne againe, and thereupon carryed the goods out of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner further ſheweth, That making declaration vnto Sir <hi>Thomas Richardſon</hi> the Speaker of this honourable Aſſembly, of the contemptuous behauiour of the ſaid parties, and of the wrongfull taking away the Petitioners goods without lawfull authoritie as afore-ſaid, Maſter Speaker (commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Petitioners diſtreſſed eſtate,) did write to the High Sheriffe, and the reſt that were Actors in the buſineſſe, wiſhing them to deliuer to the Petitioner his goods ſo wrongfully taken from him. But the High Sheriffe ſaid that he was ſufficiently ſecured by his Vnder Sheriffe, and the reſt regarded not the meſſage nor would deliuer the goods. By which meanes not only the Priuiledges and Liberties of this honourable Houſe are violated and contemned, and the Petitioner his Wife and nine Children are vtterly vndone. But alſo his Maieſties Subiects trauailing into thoſe parts are deſtitute of lodging and entertaynment, it being one of the chiefeſt Innes of Receipt betwixt London and Briſtoll.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner, therefore moſt humbly prayeth that the contemners of the Priuiledges of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſe may anſwere their contempt, and that by order of this Houſe the Petitioner may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his goods wrongfully taken from him. And he ſhall daily pray, &amp;c.</p>
