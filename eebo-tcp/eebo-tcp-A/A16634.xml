            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And to omit and leaue all ancient examples and preſidents of other Princes, That haue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17435:3"/>
beene carefull and prouident to take order for all ſuch triuiall and friuolous contentions and diſputations in the Pulpits or elſe where, wee finde a commendable Example, and Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the late excellent prince Elector, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>Saxonia,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God 1566. and of the Dukes alſo of Brownſwicke and Lunenburg, in the yeare of our Lord 1562. in the name of the common and generall churches of lowe <hi>Saxonia.</hi> Likewiſe the prince Elector <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the firſt of Saxonia, and duke <hi>Ioachim Fredericke</hi> at Lignitz and Brieg, in the yeare 1601, Princes of famous memory haue left behind them this moſt commendable Example to immitate them. And not onely the aforeſaid Preſidents haue moued vs heereunto, but alſo amongſt others this is not the leaſt; That we haue had conference with other Electors prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and States, (howbeit there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt them, that do profeſſe D. <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, yet we are agreed together) That in our countries and dominions alſo ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch order and prouiſion, that there might euery way bee vſed and obſerued all diſcretion and moderation by the Clergie in the Pulpits, and other publike aſſemblies: For to ſhun and auoyd all ſcandall; perturbation, or rather an intrication of conſciences, and preiudice to the Church. Therefore euery man may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and conſider, what griefe it hath beene vnto vs. That now, a reaſonable long time, there hath, by ſome of you (for in generall I can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17435:4"/>
not accuſe you) and ſurely by ſuch as are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and entiſed thereunto, not out of a ſpeciall zeale towards the truth of GOD, but rather out of ambition, arrogancie and pride, yet they could ſay and ſpeake the leaſt to it, if it ſhould come to a triall, or elſe, if they could but get a little gaine by it, they would turne quite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, becauſe that they ſeeke rather to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men then God; beene vſed without all ſhame and feare, ſo many acclamations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations, ſlanderings, thunderings, and reproachings, and at many times little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whether they bring foorth the truth or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth or whether it be fitting or not fitting in the pulpit, but onely to diſcomfort true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to make them grieue at it, when they in cooling their ſtomackes doe powre out their gall and venime, and make the Jeſuites and Papiſts (our common and publique ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) reioyce at it and make a laughing ſtocke of vs; beſides this, they doe heere withall, but heape vpon themſelues, and vpon their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the anger and wrath of God. For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scripture teacheth vs quite otherwiſe, not willing that they that are vnited, and agreed with vs in the true grounds of faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſtantly and faithfully beleeue onely to be ſaued by, and through GODS mercy &amp; the moſt precious merits of our only redeemer, Mediator and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and putting away all other Mediators and helpers, ſhould either haue any priuate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17435:4"/>
of conſcience, or receiue other wrongs by publique ſcandals and calumniations, nor ſuch as doe with vs alſo plant foorth Chriſt his Goſpel, and ſtiffely fight for the ſame, and for the Goſpels ſake, yet haue they ſuſtained and ſuffred of the Pope and his followers (common enemies of our true Religion) many innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſecutions, and doe daily ſuſtaine and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſtill, yea they haue very often with a ſpeciall courage and magnanimity, gladly ſpent their bloods for the Goſpels ſake, then why ſhould they bee excluded and ſeperated out and from the Chriſtian Communion? Moreouer, the Scripture doth very earneſtly commaund vs: That all matters in controuerſie and in queſtion ſhould not be rebuked, reprooued, and contradicted by friuolous wordes, and ſlander, (which is the proper nature of the Diuell) nor by heare-ſaying, and falſe witneſſes, nor in malicious and deteſtable manner, but out of meere ground of the word of God. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commandeth moreouer, that it ſhall bee done and performed with Chriſtian loue, and a meeke ſpirit, with friendſhip, patience, and with hartie compaſſion of thoſe that be in error, and not with contentious, ſlanderous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious wordes to the vndoing and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the erroneous. Therefore euery one can iudge by himſelfe, how farre theſe thundering exclaimers, aboue mentioned, doe deſtray from the right way, and what inſupportable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the end ſhall come vpon them that doe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17435:5"/>
indeuor themſelues to rule much more ouer the conſciences of man, then to further and increaſe the Church of God with good examples.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as it belongeth vnto vs, as Soueraigne of theſe countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to follow and vſe our office according vnto the firſt and the ſecond Table of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God; and becauſe we will not make our ſelues partakers of ſuch heauie ſins: Therefore we doe ſtatute, ordaine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (howbeit many of you are already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally admoniſhed thereof, although little by you regarded,) That yee heereafter ſhall inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor your ſelues to preach and teach to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and flocke committed to your ſeueral charges, the pure and cleare word of GOD, out of the Scriptures, of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, out of the foure capitall <hi>Symboles</hi> or Creedes, out of the reformed confeſſion of <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg</hi> and the Apologie thereof, and without any deprauation and falſifying of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as alſo without the formular gloſſes of new Doctrine, which ſome lazie, curious, and prowd Theologians haue deuiſed and forged amongſt themſelues, to obtaine therewith the primacie in the Church and Secular power to themſelues ye ſhall teach therefore and inſtruct the people with the pure word of God: For you ſhall draw more ſoules to the church of Chriſt, in ſeeking only the honor and glory of God, and the ſaluation of the people. And to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, you ſhal leaue and ſhunne all railing, ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17435:5"/>
curſing, and banning other Churches that are not committed to your charges, and which as yet neuer were conuicted of anie errour by their due confeſſion. For we cannot for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, longer abide and be ſilent vnto the ſame, and therefore if wee doe heare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, That one or more amongſt you (whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee or they bee, none excepted) that ſhall heereafter contemptuouſly tranſgreſſe this our earneſt and ſtraight Edict, being conformable to the word of God, they may certainely aſſure themſelues, that they ſhall be ſent for foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to appeare at the Court, and there in our behalfe to be heard, and our meaning propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto them. And if we then yet cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue amendment in them, that he or they ſhall be put out of their place and office, and diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame. Likewiſe they there ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt with due iuſtice, and ſeueritie of the Law that being ſent for will not appeare, that they may bee brought to obedience: And wee doe admit and grant, and it is not againſt our will and pleaſure, that if there be any zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and curious among them that ſhall thinke their conſciences to bee too ſtraightly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly charged with this our Chriſtianlike and well-minded Edict and Proclamation, that they may prouide themſelues otherwiſe with our full and free liberty and conſent, and depart out of our Dominions, and take their reſidence in ſuch places where ſuch vnchriſtian contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, railings, calumniations, ſlandering, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17435:6"/>
and banning other Chriſtians and their co-members may be permitted and allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: For which they may expect, in time, of God Almightie their reward.
