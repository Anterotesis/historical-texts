            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT whereas, after the Addreſſes of many thouſands of theſe actions, faithfully promiſing to eſtabliſh me on my Fathers uſurped Seat, and proteſting before God to live and die for me, whom they ſtiled their <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> appointed by God to compleat that happineſſe to the Saints which was begun by my Father, whom they called <hi>Moſes,</hi> that had brought them out of <hi>AEgypt</hi> and the Wilderneſſe unto the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of which number you of the Army were not the laſt, nor leaſt part: Yet notwithſtanding you forgeting your Promiſes and Engagements, were guilty of ſuch inſolent and contrary proceedings as to turn me out of my place before I was well warm, under the ſpecious pretence of ſetting up the <hi>Good old C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſe,</hi> which then you interpreted to be the Refuſe, or (as it's commonly called) the <hi>Rump</hi> of the <hi>long Parliament</hi>; which piece of a Parliament you had no ſooner eſtabliſhed, and vowed your ſelves by a ſolemn Oath their faithfull and conſtant Servants, but you turn'd them to graſte before they had leiſure to fleece the Commomwealth. Yet for all this, you ſtill proſecute the <hi>Good old Cauſe,</hi> which ſince it hath ſo many Colours, I know not how to define it otherwiſe then a meer <hi>cheating of the Publick</hi>: But to let that paſſe, you deviſed a thing called a <hi>Committee of ſafety,</hi> which being a Crew of Sword-men, with ſome others of your own Faction, appointed unto themſelves a certain time to produce a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del or form of Government, which time being expired, they ended as ſafely as they began, their pregnant womb being not delivered of ſo much as a Mouſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, and ſince you are now at a <hi>non plus,</hi> not knowing which way to turne your ſelves, I humbly beg of you (Gentlemen) to let me appear once more upon the Stage, beſeeching you to reſtore me unto my former dignity of being your Protector: It may be you'l ſay, I am altogether uncapable of ſo great a truſt: For anſwer; If you'l believe my Mother, I am the Son of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and think my ſelfe as wiſe as ſome of you, and much honeſter then the beſt of you. What though I was pictur'd with an Owls head and a Fools Coat? I'me ſure my Brother-in-law <hi>Fleetwood</hi> (your titular Gener<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l) deſerves it as well as my ſelf; for although he had ſo much wit as to depoſe me, wherein he ſhewed himſelf more then Fool: yet when he ſet up the tail of the long Parliament, and afterw<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rds ſuffred them to be caſt out by the ambition of <hi>Lambert,</hi> he ſavor'd more of the later. But I pray Gentlemen conſider what profit and advantage will acrue to your ſelves as well as the Nation, in caſe you readvance me to the Government; for I will call ſuch a Parliament as ſhall raiſe money for the ſatisfying of all Soldiers Arrears, and take a courſe that they be dayly paid for the future, and you your ſelves ſhall be my privy Councellors, provided you be more accute in conſulting the affairs of Government then you have been lately in forging one. And for the good of the Commonwealth in generall, we will countenance and encourage the two main props of a Stat<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>viz. Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi>: But as for the dull City of <hi>London,</hi> we may ride it to death if we pleaſe; ſhe hath been long ſick of a Conſumption, but will not go to the charge of a purgation whereby ſhe might be rid of thoſe humors that obſtruct her welfare, occaſioned by a ſurfeit ſhe took of too much of the fiſh call'd a <hi>Lobstar,</hi> which diet my Father fed her withall. But to ſpeak of her <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> he is the very ſame to you, as his horſe to him, who with all his furr'd gang of <hi>Aldermen</hi> are alwayes ready to comply with any power whatever at its firſt appearance, and will ever be your enchained ſlaves, for all their dayly conſultations at <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Golden Calves</hi> which the City worſhips, and will do till it be utterly beggar'd by their ſloath, who had rather live in perpetuall bondage then hazard their vaſt eſtates to purchaſe the freedome both of themſelves and their poſterity; for if the preſent Lord Mayor had as much wit as Frier <hi>Bacon's brazen head,</hi> and would but ſay, <hi>Time is,</hi> the buſineſſe would be done, and the whole City be freed from that oppreſſion which they have for ſo many years groaned under; but as long as they are led by the noſe by their Lord Mayor, and he by the Officers of the Army, hang but one <hi>Red-coat</hi> on the top of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple, and 'tis enough to keep the City in awe, though there were never a Soldier in it.</p>
            <p>But whilſt I was penning this, there came one and told me that you had ſet out a <hi>Proclamation</hi> of a <hi>Parliament</hi> to be called on the 24. of <hi>January</hi> next, without a <hi>ſingle Perſon,</hi> or <hi>Houſe of Peers</hi>: which thing I ſuppoſe you never intend, but only to delude the People with a bare pretence, the very name of a Parliament being a pritty bable to ſtill and quiet the childiſh rage of the <hi>City.</hi> However, if you do perform what you ſay, it will be a Parliament of your own ſtamp, which will bring more diſcontent to the People, then what they now ſuffer: Beſides, you will utterly croſſe the deſign of your grand Maſter in politicks, <hi>Lambert,</hi> who when he hath done with <hi>Monke,</hi> will be as new to begin again what he aim'd at, as he was before he turn'd out the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>long Parliament.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Maſters I beſeech you conſider what you go about, and go the ſafeſt way to work, which will be by lifting up me again to the Protectorſhip: and to this end, call to minde the diſcontented <hi>Frogs,</hi> who would not have the <hi>Log</hi> to be their <hi>King</hi>; but when <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſet the <hi>Stork</hi> to rule over them, which exceedingly devour'd them, then they prayed him to reſtore their <hi>King Log.</hi> Take heed (Gentlemen) that you do not run the ſame fortune as did the Frogs, left with them you repent too late; but hearken to this ſeaſonable, and (indeed) reaſonable advice of your <hi>Quondam Maſter,</hi> though now poor <hi>Petitioner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, (my Maſters) if you will be pleaſed to ſuffer me once again to mount into the ſaddle of Supremacy, I proteſt unto you that I will not be caſt out of it but with the loſſe of my life. Before I will be ſo befool'd as I was, I'le drive on as furiouſly as my Father when he turn'd Coach-man in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> and had like to have broken his neck for his labour: And rather then I will ſo ſneakingly be thrown down from the very Pinacle of honour,</p>
