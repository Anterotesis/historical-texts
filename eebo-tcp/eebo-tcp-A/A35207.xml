            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
KING's
Moſt Excellent
MAJESTY.</head>
            <opener>May it pleaſe Your Majeſty,</opener>
            <p>IT is not a Deſire to appear
in Print hath made me to
write, or a fond Opinion of
what I have written, to affix Your
Great Name to theſe Papers, but a
true Affection to my <hi>Native Country,</hi>
and the Cauſe Your Majeſty is now
ng ag'd in; A War, on whoſe
good Succeſs depends the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Religion, Liberty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
both to Your own Subjects,
<pb facs="tcp:49087:4"/>
and likewiſe to all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Intereſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> A War, as it
is abſolutely neceſſary, and muſt be
carried on with Vigour, ſo it is like
to be long and chargeable, and ſo
much longer, as we abate in Our
Vigorous Proſecution; A War,
which may ſtrain the <hi>Nerves</hi> and
<hi>Sinews</hi> of our Treaſure before it
be ended, and therefore as in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Diſcipline</hi> great Wiſdom muſt
be uſed to ſecure thoſe Poſts where
the Enemy bends moſt of his
Forces, ſo here 'tis Prudence to
ſtrengthen our Treaſure, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and ſecuring our <hi>Trade</hi> which
muſt bring it in; If this was done,
Taxes would be eaſily paid, and
little felt, and without it this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
will at laſt become Bankrupt,
when its Expences exceed its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
            <p>The Foundations of the Wealth
of this Kingdom are, <hi>Land, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49087:4"/>
and <hi>Foreign Trade,</hi> theſe
are its Pillars, which ought not
to be overſhaken, they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
borne the Burthen, and
felt the Smart of the War, and
'tis time now they ſhould ſlide
their <hi>Necks</hi> out of the <hi>Collar,</hi> other
ways may be found out to raiſe a
greater Summ annually than Your
Majeſty's Occaſions will require,
without Four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound
on the firſt, Exciſes on the ſecond,
or a Tunnage Bill on Ships on the
laſt, an Act which lighted heavy on
the Merchant, and left no room to
conſider whither he gained or
loſt by the Voyage, or whither
the Ship returned home full or
empty.</p>
            <p>The Methods for Raiſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
muſt be eaſie, when the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
neceſſary Summs are to be ſo
great, therefore it would be Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in our Law-makers to make uſe
<pb facs="tcp:49087:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thoſe which may leaſt hurt any
part of our Vitals, ſuch as <hi>Land</hi>
and <hi>Trade</hi> are; I mean that part
of <hi>Trade</hi> which is uſeful to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
God, not that which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
only for private Men's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
it may be poſſible to
rate the Trader, and yet to ſpare
the <hi>Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things which
ſeem to be of great Importance
to this <hi>Nation,</hi> and very neceſſary
to be look'd into.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The better ſecuring our
<hi>Plantation Trade,</hi> ſo as it may more
abſolutely depend on this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
than it hath hitherto done;
this will not only encourage our
<hi>Navigation,</hi> when all their Product
ſhall be imported hither, but alſo
much advance Your Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
when ſuch quantities of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
ſhall not be carried thence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to foreign Markets; to prevent
which, and ſecure Your Majeſty's
<pb facs="tcp:49087:5"/>
Duties when Imported, plain and
practicable Methods may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
and the Conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
would be, that this Kingdom
being the Miſtreſs of that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
Your Majeſty's Coffers would
be filled, not only from its Home
Expence, but alſo by a Tribute
raiſed from Foreign Nations, where
it would very much lie in Your
Majeſty's Power to ſet its Price;
I do not think new Impoſts upon
the Importer will ſo much advance
Your Majeſty's Revenue as they
will diſcourage the Merchant,
'twould be better to take away
thoſe already laid, and inſtead
thereof to raiſe a far greater Summ
on the Conſumer, which may be
done without the Clog or Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Officers, in ſuch a manner,
that it ſhall ſcarce be felt, either by
the Retailer or Spender.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the ſecuring
our Wool at Home, and making
<pb facs="tcp:49087:6"/>
this a Market for all the Wool of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> whereby <hi>England</hi> would
ſoon become the Queen of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and flouriſhing in its <hi>Manufactures</hi>
grow Rich by the Labour of its
People, and conſequently might
better afford to import Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
to be ſpent on <hi>Luxury;</hi> I
take it to be one great Reaſon why
the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> ſtill continues
poor notwithſtanding its <hi>Indies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all that the Inhabitants buy is
purchaſed for its full Value in
<hi>Treaſure</hi> or <hi>Product,</hi> their Labour
adding nothing to its Wealth, for
want of <hi>Manufactures;</hi> I am apt
to think greater Steps may be made
in this than have hitherto been done,
and our Wool may be kept at
home, not by puniſhing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
with Death, but by apt
Methods to prevent his doing it;
and when a Lock is put on <hi>Ireland</hi>
and <hi>Rumny-Marſh,</hi> Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys
<pb facs="tcp:49087:6"/>
will more eaſily be prevailed
on to ſend us theirs.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſeem worth the
Conſideration of the enſuing <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
a great many Members
of the laſt to my certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
began to be much in Love
with <hi>Trade,</hi> and have often lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the dark Notions That <hi>Houſe</hi> had
of it, for want of being put into
a better Light by thoſe who ought
to have repreſented it truly to
them.</p>
            <p>Which hath been a great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me in the writing this
<hi>Tract,</hi> that I might ſet forth the
Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> in Relation to
its Domeſtick and Foreign Traffick,
and how both may be better impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the Advantage of the Nation.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was pleaſed
to encourage <hi>Trade</hi> in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
by his Royal Example, ſoon
found it to be the weightieſt Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<pb facs="tcp:49087:7"/>
in his Dyadem, bringing him
in more Treaſure from abroad,
than all the Tribute he received
from <hi>Judea;</hi> The <hi>Trade</hi> of this
Kingdom hath always been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Ornament to the Crowns
of Your Royal Predeceſſors, Kings
and Queens of this Realm, and
it may be ſtill ſo to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's,
if the Cauſes of its languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were inquired into, and apt
Methods applyed for its Recovery.</p>
            <p>That it may pleaſe God to make
this Nation happy, by giving Your

Victories over the Enemies of its

its <hi>Trade,</hi> its <hi>Poor,</hi> and its <hi>Taxes</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the preſent War: The firſt I have
divided into the <hi>Inland</hi> and <hi>Outland</hi> Trade;
the <hi>Inland</hi> into three parts, <hi>viz. Buying</hi> and
<hi>Selling, Husbandry,</hi> and <hi>Manufactures;</hi>
Under the former Head I have comprehended
all thoſe Imployments whereby Men get by one
another, without making any Addition to the
Wealth of the Nation in general: <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi>
I have divided into <hi>Paſture</hi> and <hi>Tillage,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49087:10"/>
and have been the longer thereon to ſhew from
how ſmall Foundations the <hi>Primums</hi> or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of all our <hi>Trade</hi> are derived; which
indeed is wonderful, when we conſider that
the Lands of <hi>England</hi> according to the Act of
<hi>Four Shillings in the Pound</hi> cannot come to
above Eight Millions Five Hundred Thouſand
Pounds ſterling <hi>per annum,</hi> that whole Tax
with Perſonal Eſtates amounting to Nineteen
Hundred and Seventy Thouſand Pounds,
whereof I compute about Two Hundred and
Seventy Thouſand Pounds to be raiſed on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Eſtates, ſo the Remainer is Seventeen
Hundred thouſand Pounds, which being the fifth
part of the whole (if that Tax were equally and
juſtly laid) the Computation is rightly made;
but ſuppoſe they are worth Thirteen Millions
<hi>per annum,</hi> 'tis a very ſmall Summ if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the vaſt Expences of this Nation,
which, with the Charges of carrying on the
War, maintaining the Civil Liſt, and the
Profits laid up by particular Men, cannot be
leſs than One Hundred Millions <hi>per annum,</hi>
the reſt is raiſed by <hi>Manufactures, Trade,</hi>
and <hi>Labour;</hi> the firſt of which (though the
third in my Diviſion) is the moſt profitable
part of our <hi>Inland Trade,</hi> being That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our Product is advanced in its value, and
made fit both for our own uſe, and alſo for
Foreign Markets; from whence are again Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb facs="tcp:49087:10"/>
hither ſundry other Materials, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of <hi>Manufactures</hi> different in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from our own; theſe I have handled under
ſeveral Heads, and likewiſe ſhew'd by what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
they may be improved, and ſo have cloſed the
<hi>Inland Trade:</hi> Before I enter'd on the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I have conſider'd Navigation as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
between both, and given my Thoughts
how ſome Evils that attend and diſcourage it
may be removed; I have then proceeded to
our Foreign Traffick, or the Trade we drive
with other Nations, which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to under ſeveral Heads, <hi>viz. Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Africa, Maderas,
Ireland, Scotland, Canaries, Spain, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,
Turky, Italy, Holland, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
Poland, Ruſſia, Sweden, Denmark,
Norway,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and have endeavour'd
to ſhew how we get or loſe by each, and by what
Methods they may be improved, and made more
advantageous to this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond part of this Diſcourſe, the
<hi>Poor,</hi> I have ſhewed how this Habit of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Begging firſt crept in amongſt us,
how it may be prevented from ſpreading far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how Imployments may be provided for
thoſe who are willing to work, and a force put
on thoſe that are able, and how the Impotent
<hi>Poor</hi> may be maintained, and thoſe whoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
will not ſupport their Charge aſſiſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49087:11"/>
In the laſt place, I have propoſed general
Rules for raiſing of Taxes to carry on the
preſent War, and better Husbanding the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
when raiſed, wherein I have rather aimed
to ſhew that theſe things may be done, than
publiſhed Methods for doing them, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would ſwell this Diſcourſe above it
deſigned Brevity) are omitted here, as being
more proper to be laid before a Committee of
<hi>Parliament.</hi>

For as in the Body Natural, if you

Wealth of that Nation muſt decay, all

all which being Raiſed by the Induſtry

Riches, and likewiſe the Tools whereon
it Trades to other Nations, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
coming from the Earth, and the
Manufacturing them being an Addition
to their value by the Labour of the
People. Now where we Barter theſe

this doth not Increaſe our Wealth, but
it is otherwiſe where we change them

            <p>The firſt Original of <hi>Trade</hi> both <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick</hi>

abounding in thoſe Products another

Products exceeded the Expence, ſo much
both the one and the other grew Richer,
the remainder being ſold for <hi>Bulloin,</hi> or

as People increaſed ſo did Commerce,
this cauſed many to go off from <hi>Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi>

they do alſo in <hi>Beef,</hi> occaſioned by

greater Expence to the Government than
now 'tis at, but then better Methods muſt
be taken, and Men employed whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
it is to ſee them put in Execution:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49087:25"/>
When we firſt began this War the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had many Difficulties to cope with, the
<hi>French</hi> ſeemed to vye with us at Sea, whilſt
their Armies out-number'd ours at Land,
but now bleſſed be God the Scale is turned,
we force their Garriſons and ſtorm their
Caſtles whilſt they look on unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and at the ſame time our <hi>Navy-Royal</hi>
blocks up theirs, whilſt our ſmaller
Fleets Bombard their Sea-Port Towns,
we not only ride Admirals in the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Seas but alſo in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and
yet do now ſuffer more Loſs in our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
than formerly we did; The <hi>French</hi>
are come to a new way of fighting, they
ſet out no Fleet, but their Privateers ſwarm
and cover the Sea like Locuſts, they hang
on our Trade like Horſe-Leeches, and draw
from it more Blood than it is well able to
ſpare, whilſt we ſtill go on as we did,
without new Methods to countermine
them; The <hi>French</hi> King breeds up a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of <hi>Seamen</hi> at our Charge, whilſt his
Subjects are made Rich by our Loſſes; the
Act for Cruiſers was well deſign'd had
it been as well put in Execution, the
Parliament thereby ſhewed what might
ſecure our Trade, but left things ſo diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
to the Managers, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
knows not when he receives the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49087:25"/>
Benefit thereof, or how to complain if
he doth not, and by this means is in a
worſe Condition than he was before the
making that Law, adventuring larger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he thinks he Trades ſecurer; I
confeſs for my own part I value nothing
that cannot be reduced to a certainty in
its practice, things ſeem difficult to thoſe
who do not underſtand them, if we are
to Beſiege a Town we make uſe of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
if to ſtorm a Caſtle, Engineers, if
to build a Ship, <hi>Carpenters,</hi> and ſo in leſſer
things, and yet Gentlemen are thought fit
to ſit at Helm, and ſteer the Ship wherein
is Embarqu'd the Treaſure of our Trade,
who are altogether unskill'd therein, on
whoſe good Conduct the Nation's
Weale or Woe depends; Thus things do
fall into Confuſion, whilſt Men undertake
what they do not underſtand and ſet the
Nation in a flame, whilſt they injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
guide the Chariot of the Sun; This
makes Foreign Commodities dear, and
advances the Prizes of Materials uſed in our
Manufactures, ſo that as Trade grows
worſe Expences grow greater, and at
the ſame time no Body is a Gainer, The
Merchant pays ſuch high Fraights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances,
that he gets little by Trade
tho' he ſells his Imports for great Prizes;
and yet the Inſurers complain they loſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49087:26"/>
by underwriting, and therefore advance
their <hi>Premios,</hi> which is a new advance on
Trade; and the Owners of Ships get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by their Fraights, becauſe they pay
great Wages to the <hi>Saylors,</hi> and meet with
ſuch Delays both at home and abroad
that the length of time eats up all their
Profi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, ſo that Fraights muſt rather riſe than
fall; nor do the <hi>Saylors</hi> get, who gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
brought home more Money to their
Families in the time of Peace at three
Years end when they ſerved for Twenty-four
Shillings <hi>per Month</hi> than they now do
at Fifty, one loſt Voyage bringing them
more behind-hand than two good ones put
them forward; Now if Heads well verſt
in Trade were ſet at work, Methods might
be thought on to ſecure all with little
Charge to the Government, and hereby
the Kingdom might flouriſh, and be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by the Merchant with Commodities
cheaper, whilſt the Inſurers underwrote
for leſs <hi>Premio,</hi> Fraights let on lower terms,
the Wages of Mariners fallen, and All got
more than now they do; our Numbers of
Seamen might then be increaſed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Ship that goes abroad be a Nurſery
for the Fleet at home; Privateering, which
is now become a Trade amongſt the <hi>French,</hi>
muſt then neceſſarily ſink all concerned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49087:26"/>
therein, its own Weight and Charge
would cruſh it did we prevent their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Prizes; and no doubt the Merchants
of <hi>England</hi> would not oppoſe ſuch Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in their Trades as they ſaw were to
their Advantage, or refuſe to be at ſome
Charge when they ſaw thoſe Payments ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Money in their Pockets, and that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of things was put into the Hands
of Perſons engaged in the common Intereſt
of Trade with themſelves: This ſeems
to me of great Importance in our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
when the foreign Materials ſhall
be furniſhed cheaper to the Maker; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
if Trade were well ſecured the War
would ſcarce be felt, Loſſes by Sea diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the City, and the ill Conſequences
thereof reach the Country, whereby both
ſuffer more than by all the Taxes they pay
towards carrying it on.</p>
            <p n="7"> 7. <note place="margin">By lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Intereſt of Money.</note>By falling the Intereſt of Money;
this would very much quicken Trade, and
indeed is the true Meaſure of it, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
would be better able to cope with
Competitors abroad in the Manufactures
when his Intereſt did not eat ſo deep as
now it doth, and the Maker would be
enabled to ſell them cheaper at Home;
if Intereſt were fallen 'twould make all
Trades flouriſh, for whilſt we ſtand not on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49087:27"/>
the ſame Terms with our Neighbours
herein we muſt expect to be underſold
every where by them; the <hi>Dutch</hi> pay but
Three <hi>per Cent,</hi> and are thereby enabled
to Trade ſo much lower than we can; the
truth is 'tis a ſhame Money ſhould yield
more by being put to Intereſt than 'twould
do if laid out either in Land or Trade;
the firſt doth not clear Four <hi>per Cent,</hi> the
latter will not bring the Borrower Five for
all his Pains and Induſtry when the Uſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is paid, whilſt the other runs little
Riſque, and is a Drone in the <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi>
as for Orphans and Widdows,
(which is the main Objection againſt it)
let their Expences be leſſened ſuitable to
its Fall, and for all other People, let
them employ their Money in Trade if
they think 'twill yield more; And here I
judge it not amiſs to mention Banks and
Lumbards,<note place="margin">Banks &amp; Lombards</note> which I take to be ſo many
Shops to let out Money, for which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch Security, and for ſuch time, as
ſtands moſt for the conveniency of Trade,
and therefore the more the better, becauſe
every one will endeavour to underdo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

that Men rather truck than ſell for Money,

deal with will take what they juſt before
received for their Goods; this makes Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
precarious, and <hi>Trade</hi> uneaſie, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
riſing and falling on Men's Hands daily,
ſo that now nothing is more uncertain than
that which ſhould be the Rule of certainty in
the value of all other things.</p>
            <p>I do not think it convenient to advance
our Coyn, but let Bullion be of the ſame
value when coined as it was before, elſe
we have not the true worth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
we ſell for it, but are deceived
by the Stamp, which may be counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Nations for the
profit of the Overplus, beſides it will ſeem
ridiculous for a Man to give Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
worth of Silver for Eighteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of the ſame ſpecie, only becauſe it
is medall'd; this will neceſſarily be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the advance of Silver ſuitable,
the conſequence whereof will be the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
our Manufactures abroad cheaper, as
we receive leſs Bullion for them, and
the whole Profit redound to the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe <hi>Indies</hi> by the advance of
his Bullion will be worth more than they
were before; nor will this hinder its being
carry'd abroad, perhaps it may keep our
Coin at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not our Silver, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49087:28"/>
will be ſtill carried out in Specie; not
that I am of their Opinions who think the
advance of Money would raiſe the price
of Foreign Commodities among us, our
own Experience ſhews it will not, we
buy and ſell as much for Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in Farthings as for ſo much Silver
Coin; nor will their compariſon with the
<hi>Portugal Trade</hi> hold here, for when that
King advanced the value both of Peeces
of <hi>Eights,</hi> and alſo of his own Coin,
the Importer was obliged to advance the
Price of his Goods, becauſe Silver was
the Specie wherein he was to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,
which he received not as it was
worth in Coin but in value by the Ounce,
whereas had he laid it out in Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the Caſe had been otherwiſe, I
make a great difference between Money
as it is the Medium of <hi>Trade,</hi> and as it is
the Commodity we make returns in;
there are better Reaſons than this why
Coin ſhould be kept up to its true value.</p>
            <p>And for the more eaſie calling it in
when the Parliament ſhall ſee fit, I think
'twere beſt to cry down all clipt Money
at once, only to be received for ſix Months
by the King in his Taxes, who may ſend
it into the <hi>Mint,</hi> and if the Computation
be allowed that we have about ſix Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49087:28"/>
of Coined Silver Money in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſuppoſe four of it to be clipt, the
Taxes of <hi>Cuſtoms, Exciſe, Aids, &amp;c.</hi> which
we pay in ſix Months will require near
that Summ; and if there remain Two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
unclipt, it will ſerve the ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
till ſo much new Money can come
abroad, at the end of which time let all
the reſt be called in by the ſame Method;
This will bring forth the Broad Money,
which is now hoarded up, and during this
Scarcity both the King's occaſions and
thoſe of <hi>Trade</hi> will be very much anſwer'd
by <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Bank</hi> Notes; and for better
preſerving our new-coined Money, let
none for the future exceed Shillings, or at
moſt Half Crowns, and thoſe be made
broad and thin, with the Ring on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Circumference, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
both Clipping and Drilling, and if
the Stamp be not deep 'twill prevent
caſting.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Counterfeit-Money,</hi>
(which is ſuppoſed to be about a Million)
it muſt be loſt to thoſe who have it; and I

Before I proceed to our <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

of Navigation, which is the <hi>Medium</hi>

and <hi>Saylors,</hi> the former are the Sea Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
whereby we tranſport and carry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
from one Market to another, and
the latter are the Waggoners which drive
or manage them; theſe are a ſort of merry
unthinking People, who make all Men rich
ſave themſelves, have often more Money
than is their own, but ſeldom ſo much as
they know how to ſpend, generally brave
in their Undertakings, they go through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

as it were their Element, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by all to be the beſt Navigators in
the World; they are our Wealth in Peace,
and our Defence in War, and ought to be
more encouraged than they are in both,
but eſpecially in the latter, which might
be done if better Methods were uſed to
engage them in that Service, and better
Treatment when there;<note place="margin">Manning our Ships of War.</note> Now I ſhould
think if a Liſt were taken of all the <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>

to a Nation, and then to draw Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
thence applicable to the above
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49087:35"/>
Propoſition; I ſhall therefore lay down
ſuch general Notions as may without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
be allowed by all unbyaſſed Perſons,
which are theſe:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That that Trade is advantageous to
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> which Exports
our Product and Manufactures.</item>
               <item>2. Which Imports to us ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
as may be manufactured here, or
be uſed in making our Manufactures.</item>
               <item>3. Which ſupplies us with ſuch things,
without which we cannot carry on our Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade.</item>
               <item>4. Which encourages our Navigation,
and increaſes our Seamen.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And conſequently that Trade which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
little or none of our Product or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
nor ſupplies us with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to promote Manufactures at home,
or carry on our Trade abroad, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
Navigation, cannot be ſuppoſed
to be advantageous to this Kingdom; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when its Imports hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of our own Manufactures, and
more eſpecially when thoſe Imports are
chiefly the purchaſe of our <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe I would be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in my third Propoſition, I mean thoſe
Commodities without which we are not

able to fit out our Ships for a Foreign <hi>Trade,</hi>
ſuch as are <hi>Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Sail-Cloth,

abſolutely neceſſary, that we muſt have
them though purchaſed for <hi>Bullion,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief Hinges whereon Trade turns,
and the Tools by which we Mechannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
navigate our Ships, thoſe Bulky <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi>
of Foreign <hi>Trade;</hi> but for thoſe things
which are Imported only in order to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
again as Commodities to trade on,
theſe cannot be ſo advantageous to this
Kingdom as they may be to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
having little Land are maintained rather
by Buying and Selling than Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
whereas <hi>England</hi> being a large ſpot
of Ground, and having a great Product of
its own, (beſides what comes from our
Plantations) capable to be wrought up or
manufactured here, gets by the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its People, therefore it would be
the great Wiſdom of our Government to
regulate all Foreign <hi>Trades</hi> by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
as may beſt make then uſeful in the
promoting our Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland may be ſaid to be enricht by Trade.</note>Here it will not be amiſs to conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

there muſt be a difference made between a

doing ſo by it, and I humbly propoſe that
it may be poſſible for private Men to
be vaſtly improved in their Eſtates, and
yet at the Years end the Wealth of the
Nation not to be a whit greater than at
the beginning, and this both in an <hi>Inland</hi>
and an <hi>Outland</hi> Trade; for whilſt the
thrifty Shopkeeper buys at one Price,
and ſells at another to the prodigal <hi>Beaux,</hi>
and the induſtrious Artificer vents his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to the idle Drone, and the politick

one raiſes his Fortunes on the other's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay;
the ſame for our <hi>Outland Trade,</hi> if
we Export the true Riches of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for that which we conſume on our
Luxury, tho' private Men may get by
each other, yet the Wealth of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not any way encreaſed: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
by one Hundred Butts of Wines the
Importer gets Five Hundred Pounds, yet
when drank among our ſelves, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not thereby Richer but Poorer, and
ſo much poorer as thoſe Wines coſt at firſt;
for if Imported by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ships we looſe but the firſt Purchaſe, the
reſt being Freights, Cuſtoms, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
are divided amongſt our ſelves, but
if they are brought in by Foreigners, the
Nation loſes all but the Cuſtoms; I take
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49087:36"/>
the true Profits of this Kingdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in that which is produced from Earth,
Sea, and Labour, and ſuch are all our
Growth and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>To apply this now to the <hi>Eaſt-India
Trade,</hi> we will firſt conſider what are its
Exports and Imports, and then inquire
<hi>Cui Bono?</hi> whither the Conteſt for this
<hi>Trade</hi> doth proceed from a deſign to ſerve
the Nation, or from Principles of Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?
or whither the Members of that
Company who ſtrive ſo much about it,
would if in other Circumſtances ſtill be
of the ſame Mind? for Principles that are
in themſelves true are always ſo, we
may change our Opinions, but they do
not change their Certainty; I confeſs as
the ſtate of a Nation alters ſo muſt our
meaſures in <hi>Trade,</hi> but then it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the State of the Nation and
not our private Intereſts makes us to alter
them; Now when I find that it is not the
true Intereſt of this Nation to advance
the Product and Manufactures thereof I
ſhall change my Opinion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then to begin with their Exports;
and here I need not ſay much, it's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
allowed by the Traders themſelves
that our Product and Manufactures are
the leaſt part thereof, conſiſting chiefly
in Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49087:37"/>
But it's alledged that in Returns they
Import ſuch Goods which being again Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
do bring from Foreign parts much
more Treaſure in ſpecie; which leads me
ſecondly to conſider what thoſe Imports
are, and what becomes of them; They
chiefly are, <hi>Saltpeter, Pepper, Callicoes, Druggs,
Indigo,</hi> and <hi>Silks</hi> both wrought and raw,
many of which Commodities are very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
as well for our Home Expence as
to export again, others vaſtly prejudicial to
us, as they hinder the conſumption of our own
Manufactures both Abroad and at Home,
and this latter outweighs the former; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes</hi>
and wrought Silks are the things I
chiefly aim at, and hope to make it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear that thoſe two Commodities
do us more prejudice in our Manufactures
than all the Advantage they bring either
to private Purſes or to the Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and it were to be wiſht the Wiſdom
of our Parliament would prohibit their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worn in <hi>England,</hi> elſe like the ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
lean Kine they will deſtroy the
uſe of our Manufactures, which might be
fitted to anſwer all the ends they ſerve for;
Nor is the leſſening the wearing our own
Manufactures at home all the Miſchief
<hi>Callicoes</hi> have done us, their Importation
having thrown out the wearing of <hi>Sileſia,</hi>
and other <hi>German</hi> Linnens hath been
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49087:37"/>
attended with as bad a Conſequence from
thence, where thoſe Looms which were
formerly imployed on weaving them were
thereon turned to the Woollen Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
wherewith they not only furniſh
themſelves but <hi>Poland,</hi> which hath made
thoſe Countrys very careful to increaſe
and improve their breed of Sheep, whoſe
Wool was generally brought hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and uſed in making Hatts, but is now
much of it wrought up there; for when
we ſlighted their Manufactures they fell
on ours, whereas if we had encouraged
the Wearing their Linnen they would
have ſtill depended on us for Woollen;
This hath been a means to abate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of many thouſand Peeces of
Cloth, which would have brought more
Advantage to the Nation than all the
Trade we have driven to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
and will never be retrieved till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again to the uſe of their Linnens.</p>
            <p>He that conſiders how wonderfully Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
prevail on this Nation may ſoon
ſatisfie himſelf how things of little value
come to be prized, and to juſtle out thoſe
of greater worth; Faſhion is Fancy, which
as it hath of late Years brought in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
of our native Commodities by Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſo if our Nobility and Gentry
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49087:38"/>
would turn their Fancies to them again
I doubt not it would have the ſame effect,
and if our Workmen could receive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
no queſtion the Genius of
this Kingdom would ſoon reach to ſuch
a pitch as to anſwer all the Uſes of both
thoſe Commodities, even with a Thread
ſpun out of Sheeps Wool; It was ſcarce
thought about twenty Years ſince that
we ſhould ever ſee <hi>Calicoes</hi> the Ornaments
of our greateſt Gallants (for ſuch they are,
whither we call them <hi>Muſlins, Shades,</hi> or
any thing elſe) when they were then rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed ſave in Shrouds for the Dead,
and that chiefly among the Poor, who
could not go to the Price of finer Linnen,
and yet were willing to imitate the Rich,
but now few think themſelves well dreſt
till they are made up in <hi>Callicoes,</hi> both
Men and Women, <hi>Callicoe Shirts, Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths,
Cuffs, Pocket-Hankerchiefs,</hi> for the
former, <hi>Head-Dreſſes, Night-royls, Hoods,
Sleeves, Aprons, Gowns, Petticoats,</hi> and
what not, for the latter, beſides <hi>India-Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi>
for both Sexes; and indeed it will
be a hard matter to put them out of this
Fancy, nothing but an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> or
humour of the <hi>Court</hi> can do it, the latter
is the moſt natural means, and would
eaſier make way to introduce the former,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49087:38"/>
for beſides that 'twould bring with it the
Prayers of the Poor for thoſe who have
cut them out new Imployments, it would
likewiſe wonderfully tend to advance
the Gentlemen's Eſtates, firſt by expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Wool,</hi> and next by keeping the
Poor at work, who would conſume more
<hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Barly, Beef</hi> and <hi>Mutton</hi> in their
Houſes, and yet they need not fear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Labourers enough in their Harveſts,
though perhaps at a little higher Rates,
which would be abundantly made up by
an Advance on the Product of their Lands,
beſides what would be ſaved in the Poor's
Rates, and it hath been a conſtant Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
grounded on reaſon that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never thrives more than when the
Labour of the Poor is at ſuch Priſes as
they may live comfortably by it.</p>
            <p>We will next conſider:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How far the Manufactures of this
Kingdom have been already made to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the uſes of <hi>Indian Silks</hi> and <hi>Callicoes,</hi>
and what did encourage it.</item>
               <item>2. What farther Improvement may be
made thereon, and the means to bring it
about.</item>
               <item>3. Why the People of <hi>England</hi> are ſo
much againſt their Native Manufactures
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49087:39"/>
as to be more in love with <hi>Calicoes</hi> and
<hi>Indian Silks.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, I will go no farther
than the <hi>Act for Burrying in Woollen;</hi> how
averſe were the People of <hi>England</hi> to it at
firſt? as if the Dead could not reſt eaſie in
their Graves if wrapt in our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
or that it would trouble them
<hi>inter Hades</hi> that they had occaſionally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Imployment to their poor ſurviving
Country-men; no, the fault was not
there, Experience hath taught us that it's
all one to them, and Time hath more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
us to that Statute when we ſaw
the good effects it produced by putting
our People on making ſo many pretty
ſorts of Woollen Veſtments, as Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to the Dead as the others formerly
were thought to be, and of ſuch different
Fineneſſes and Prizes, that Qualities are
as eaſily diſtinguiſhed by them; and ſince
our dead Friends were to be dreſt in our
native Wool, we thought it moſt ſeemly
to imitate them by wearing the ſame at
their Funerals, hence it came to paſs that
our Mourning Attire was made of White
Crape, a Garb not only Decent and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
but Honourable to the Nation,
as it both ſhew'd our Eſteem for our
Woollen Manufactres, and alſo how ſoon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49087:39"/>
thoſe imployed therein could turn their
Hands to any ſort of Work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what farther Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
may be made on the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of this Kingdom to anſwer the
ends of <hi>Indian</hi> Silks and Calicoes, and
the means to bring them about; Here let
us ſee what Progreſſes have already been
made ſtep after ſtep by our Manufactures
to imitate, and in many things to exceed
all they have ſeen from abroad; witneſs
thoſe noble rich Silks, wherein they have
attained to ſo great a height; Our brave
noble <hi>Arras</hi> or <hi>Tapeſtry</hi> of all Priſes, not
to be out-done by thoſe very Nations
from whom we at firſt learned the Art;
And this is allow'd by all, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Workmen in great things outdo their
Patterns, and no doubt they may ſoon
turn their Hands to a ſlight Manufacture,
which People do now chiefly deſire, and
I take to be as profitable to the Nation;
How are we come from a ſtrong and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
to a ſlight thin Broad Cloth, from
thence to <hi>Stuffs, Perpets, Sayes, Raſhes,
Shalloones, Gauzes,</hi> and lately to <hi>Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi>
which laſt look as handſome as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Silks,</hi> and ſerve as well in Linings
for our Cloaths, alſo <hi>Crapes</hi> of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſorts both of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Wool,</hi> that not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49087:40"/>
only Cloaths for Men and Women are
made thereof, but alſo <hi>Hatbands, Cuffs,
Neckcloths, Hoods, Head Dreſſes, &amp;c.</hi> Now
was there a Law to encourage, or would
the Nobility and Gentry of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by their Examples promote the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our own Manufactures, no doubt they
might be ſoon brought to anſwer all the
ends of <hi>Indian Silks</hi> and <hi>Calicoes,</hi> and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee what reaſon may be given againſt
a total Prohibition of their being worn in
<hi>England,</hi> which will be the quickeſt way
to have them diſuſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is to enquire why the
People of <hi>England</hi> are ſo much againſt
their Native Manufactures as to be more
in love with <hi>Calicoes</hi> and <hi>Indian Silks?</hi>
The chief reaſon is Faſhion and Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of One another, though many others
are alledged, as the Ruffneſs and Ill Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Woollen, which keeps it from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the ends of <hi>Calicoes,</hi> Its weight
and thickneſs, which renders it improper
for the ends of ſlight Silks in Linings;
Theſe are not ſubſtantial but pretended
Reaſons, and would as well ſerve againſt
<hi>Calicoes</hi> and <hi>Indian Silks</hi> were we more
uſed to our Native Manufactures, and
they now to be introduced; for as to the
Ruffneſs of Woollen, may not that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49087:40"/>
be helpt by its fineneſs? and are not courſe
<hi>Calicoes</hi> altogether as Ruff? A fine Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-Shirt
feels ſoft and pleaſant to him
that hath been uſed to wear it, ſo ſtrange
Impreſſions do Cuſtom and Faſhion make
on us; and as for Colour, it is only Fancy,
when Yellow is in Faſhion it looks as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
as White, and as much Art is needful
to ſtrike it well as there is Curioſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the other, witneſs when Women wore
Yellow Hoods, both Men and Women
Yellow Veſtments, beſides, no doubt ways
might be found out to add to the Native
Whiteneſs of our Woollen Manufactures,
which do not therein fall ſhorter of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes</hi>
than they do of <hi>Hollands</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks</hi>
and as to the ends of Silks, Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Lightneſs, I think our Workmen
have given very great Inſtances in their
<hi>Crapes Gauzes</hi> and <hi>Antherines</hi> what they
could do had they Encouragement.</p>
            <p>But if a Manufacture of <hi>Wool</hi> will not
pleaſe, why may not one of <hi>Cotton,</hi> the
<hi>Primum</hi> of which <hi>Calicoes</hi> are made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have great quantities imported eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Year from our own Plantations in <hi>America,</hi>
and no doubt we might in a ſhort time
attain to an excellency therein, not only
to ſupply our ſelves, but alſo Foreign
Markets; He that conſiders how far we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49087:41"/>
have gone in this already will have no
cauſe to doubt a Progreſs, and if Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
were propoſed to that Perſon
who ſhould ſpin the fineſt Thread either in
Cotton or Wool, to be adjudged and paid in
each County, 'twould excite Induſtry and
Ingenuity, and no doubt we might in time
make Calicoes equal in their ſorts with
thoſe Imported from <hi>India,</hi> and afford
them as cheap as that Company now ſells
them, enough not only for our home Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penee,
but alſo for Exportation.</p>
            <p>We will next ſee what Employment
this Trade gives to Ships as it's now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in a Company, and how far it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
Navigation by making Saylors;
The Number of the firſt is but ſmall,
and I think far from making Seamen,
long Voyages being uſually their Bane, thoſe
Ships ſeldom bringing home ſo many Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
as they carry'd forth, whereas ſhorter
Voyages do more, made out of Land-Men,
both the Imployers and the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
being deſirous to make their firſt Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
on ſuch Voyages; beſides, longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
better Saylors to provide for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties
which attend them, and may be ſaid
rather to uſe Seamen than to make them;
and this is one great Reaſon why the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49087:41"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> raiſe them ſo eaſily, moſt of their
Imployments being a home Trade.</p>
            <p>If then it appears this Trade is no
more profitable to the Nation in general
we will next ſee how it is to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in parricular; I do not ſay to the
particular Members thereof, who by ill
Practices have raiſed their private Fortunes,
many of which have been lately laid open,
but to the Company as ſuch; and here we
find that a former failed; the laſt is thought
to have gotten little, conſidering the long
time they have been a Monopoly; and
what Advantage the new <hi>Fund</hi> will make
Time muſt ſhew, the Tricks uſed to engage
Men therein cauſes me to doubt whither
'twill anſwer the Expectations of the
Subſcribers.</p>
            <p>On the whole let us conſider what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can be offered to the Wiſdom of the
Nation to limit this Trade to an excluſive
Company as was deſired, or (as in truth
it is) to turn it into a Monopoly by Law,
a thing very contrary to the Genius of the
People of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeems to barr the
Freedom and Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>Were Monopolies to be allowed it
muſt certainly be in One of theſe three
Reſpects.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49087:42"/>
               <item>1. That we might put off our own
Commodities to other Nations in Barter for
thoſe we received from them.</item>
               <item>2. That we might keep down the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Commodities, whilſt we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
our own.</item>
               <item>3. That as the Conſequence of theſe
two we might encourage our Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
at home, and furniſh Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
cheap.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But when a Monopoly ſhall cauſe quite
different Effects it's not to be allow'd on
any Terms.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt; the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
takes off little of our Manufactures,
nor do I think the Trade will admit it,
for I cannot ſee how that Nation can be
ſupplied with Manufactures hence fit for
their Wearing anſwerable in Price to their
own, except they were a Luxurious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who cared not what they gave to
pleaſe their Fancies, which I do not take
them to be, but generally very Provident;
for if we conſider that when the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company hath brought their Calicoes
and Silks hither with great Charges, and
ſold them at an extraordinary advance,
they find vent by their cheapneſs, how
can we believe that any of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
can afford them a profit in <hi>India,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49087:42"/>
where they muſt be ſold ſuitable in price
to the others firſt coſt; and therefore
'twould not be amiſs if the Government
were put on making a narrow Inquiry
whither the Company do <hi>boná fide</hi> export
ſo much of the Product and Manufactures
of rhis Kingdom and land them in <hi>India</hi>
as they are obliged to do by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
elfe many ways may be found out
to evade it, and the Nation be deprived
of the only Advantage expected from that
Monopoly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and we deal not thither on the
ſame Terms, their Manufactures are ſmall,
and ſo no Matter what they Trade on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their Settlements in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi>
are ſo great, that what they bring thence
may almoſt be called their own Product,
whereof by monopolizing that Trade they
make greater Prices in <hi>Europe,</hi> which being
chiefly ſpent either in Foreign Markets or
by Temporary Reſidents brings them more
Profit; They have alſo great Advantages
above us in their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſt of the whole Traffick to <hi>Japan,</hi>
whither they carry <hi>Cloth, Lead,</hi> and other
Commodities from <hi>Holland, Calicoes, Spices,
&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>India,</hi> which they ſell for <hi>Gold</hi>
and <hi>Silver,</hi> increaſing thereby their Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as we diminiſh ours; Beſides their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49087:43"/>
               <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company is not ſettled on
ſuch a narrow Foundation as ours, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
limited to one City excluſive of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſells their Commodities for greater
Advance than any other Traders, whither we
conſider their Riſque, or the time they are out
of their Money, which ſhould be the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rules in Trade; Nor can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
whilſt they remain a Company,
the Charges both abroad and at home
being much more than when manag'd by
private Stocks, beſides the affected Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
in all which muſt be paid by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereon I take that Monopoly to be a
Tax ſo far as it might be ſupply'd with
them on cheaper Terms if the Trade were
laid more open by a Regulation; I know
there is much talk'd by the Company about
Forts Caſtles and Soldiers to defend
their Intereſts in <hi>India,</hi> but I cannot ſee
the uſe of them, for either they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
defended againſt the Natives, or the
<hi>Dutch</hi> their Competitors; the former have
no reaſon to quarrel with them, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them a Trade ſo highly their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as the purchaſing their Product and
Manufactures with Money, eſpecially if
they pay for what they buy; And as for
their Competitors the <hi>Dutch,</hi> if they
were not better defended againſt them by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49087:43"/>
our Fleets at home, and the Protection of
the Princes they trade with, than by all
the Force they have there, the Trade had
been but ill-ſecured, and muſt have ſunk
long ago; Only thoſe great Words ſerve
to hold us amuſed, whilſt their <hi>Guineas</hi> in
the two laſt Reigns were the Support of
their Charter.</p>
            <p>One thing which I aim at in this Diſcourſe
is to perſwade the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> to
be more in Love with our own Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and to encourage the wearing them
by their Examples, and not of Choice
to give Imployment to the Poor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation whilſt ours ſtarve at home.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> We will next proceed to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Trades; which I eſteem the
moſt profitable of any we drive, and do
joyn them together becauſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on each other.</p>
            <p>But before we enter farther I will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of one Objection, it having been a
great queſtion among many thoughtful Men
whither our Foreign Plantations have been
an advantage to this Nation; the reaſons
they give againſt them are, that they have
drained us of Multitudes of our People
who might have been ſerviceable at home,
and advanced Improvements in Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
and Manufactures; That the Kingdom
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49087:44"/>
of <hi>England</hi> is worſe Peopled by ſo much
as they are increaſed; and that Inhabitants
being the Wealth of a Nation, by how
much they are leſſened, by ſo much we
are poorer than when we firſt began to
ſettle our Foreign Colonies; Though I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the laſt Propoſition to be true, that
People are or may be made the Wealth
of a Nation, yet it muſt be where you
find Imployment for them, elſe they are
a Burthen to it, as the Idle Drone is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Induſtry of the labourious
Bee, ſo are all thoſe who live by their
Dependance on others, as Players, Ale-Houſes-keepers,
Common-Fidlers, and
ſuch like, but more particularly Beggars,
who never ſet themſelves to work; Its
my Opinion that our Plantations are an
Advantage to this Kingdom, and I doubt
not but 'twill appear to be ſo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this Diſcourſe, though not all
alike, but every one more or leſs, as they
take off our Product and Manufactures,
ſupply us with Commodities which may
be either wrought up here, or Exported
again, or prevent fetching things of the
ſame Nature from other Princes for our
home Conſumption, imploy our Poor, and
encourage our Navigation; for I take <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and all its Plantations to be one great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49087:44"/>
Body, thoſe being ſo many Limbs or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
belonging to it, therefore when we
conſume their Growth we do as it were
ſpend the Fruits of our own Land, and
what thereof we ſell to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for Bullion, or ſuch Commodities as
we muſt pay for therein, brings a ſecond
Profit to the Nation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Plantations are either the great
Continent from <hi>Hudſon's Bay</hi> Northward
to <hi>Florida</hi> Southward, containing <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found-land,
New-Eugland, Virginia, Mary-land,
New-York, Penſilvania, Carolina, &amp;c.</hi>
and alſo our ſeveral Iſlands, the chief
whereof are <hi>Barbadoes, Antigua, Nevis,
St. Chriſtophers, Montſerat,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica;</hi> the
Commodities they afford us are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Sugars, Indigo, Ginger, Cotten,
Tobacco, Piamento, and Fuſtick, of their
own growth, alſo Logwood, which we
bring from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> (though firſt brought
thither from the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Campeacha</hi> on the
Continent of <hi>Mexico</hi> belonging to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
but cut by a looſe ſort of People,
Subjects to this Kingdom, Men of deſperate
Fortunes, but of wonderful Courage, who
by force have made ſmall Settlements
there and defend themſelves by the ſame
Means) beſides great quantities of Fiſh ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Coaſts of <hi>Newfound-land</hi> and <hi>New-England;</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49087:45"/>
Theſe being the Product of Earth
Sea and Labour are clear Profit to the
Kingdom, and give a double Imployment
to the People of <hi>England,</hi> firſt to thoſe
who raiſe them there, next to thoſe who
prepare Manufactures here wherewith they
are ſupplied, beſides the Advantage to
Navigation, for the Commodities Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Imported being generally bulky
do thereby imploy more Ships, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
more Saylors, which leaves
more room for other labouring People to
be kept at work in Husbandry and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
whilſt they conſume the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the one and the Effects of the
other in an Imployment of a diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from either.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Deſign of ſettling
Plantations abroad, that the People of
<hi>England</hi> might better maintain a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Trade among themſelves, the
chief Profit whereof was to redound to
the Center; and therefore Laws were
made to prevent the carrying their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to other places, or their being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with Neceſſaries ſave from hence,
and both to be done in our own Ships,
navigated by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Saylors, except in
ſome caſes permitted by the Acts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
and ſo much as the Reins of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49087:45"/>
thoſe Laws are let loſe, ſo much leſs
profitable are the Plantations to us; The
Intereſt therefore of this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prevent any practices contrary to
the firſt Deſign, it would be the great
Wiſdom of the Parliament to frame ſuch
Laws as may more effectually do it than
any yet made; I do not mean Laws
whoſe chief Strength ſhall be their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
but ſuch whoſe plain Methods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable to be reduced to Practice
may do it without Oppreſſion of Officers,
for I eſteem them ſo far weak as they
need the Support of either the one or the
other; and it were to be wiſht that both
our Cuſtoms and all other Taxes might
be raiſed with leſs Charge and Burthen
than now they are, for which ways might
be ſound out if it were well conſidered
of, and then Multitudes of uſeleſs People
might be ſent into the Vineyards of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Among theſe Plantations I look on that
of <hi>New-England</hi> to bring leaſt Advantage
to this Kingdom, for being ſetled by an
induſtrious People, and affording few
Commodities proper to be tranſported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Inhabitants imploy themſelves
by trading to the reſt of the Plantations,
whom they ſupply with Proviſions and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49087:46"/>
other their Products, and from thence fetch
their reſpective Growths, which they after
ſend to Foreign Markets, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure
the Trade of <hi>England;</hi> Now as to the
firſt part, it's neither convenient for them
nor the Plantations that they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd
it, what they carry thither being
for the moſt part Fiſh, Deal-Boards,
Pipe-ſtaves, Horfes, and ſuch like, which
the others cannot be well ſupplyed with
hence, alſo Bread, Flower, and Peaſe; but
then they ſhould be obliged to make their
Imports hither, I mean to bring all the
Good; they load at thoſe Plantations to
this Market, and from hence let them be
ſupply'd again with what thereof ſhall
be neceſſary for their Home Expence, as
they are with all <hi>European</hi> Commodites;
by which means <hi>England</hi> would become
the Centre of Trade, and ſtanding like the
Sun in the midſt of its Plantations would
not only refreſh them, but alſo draw
Profits from them; and indeed it's a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of exact Juſtice it ſhould be ſo, for
from hence it is Fleets of Ships and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Soldiers are frequently ſent for
their Defence, at the Charge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this Kingdom, beſides the
equal Benefit the Inhabitants there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
with us from the Advantages ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49087:46"/>
by the Iſſue of this War, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of Religion, Liberty, and Property,
towards the Charge whereof they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
little, though a way may and ought
to be found out to make them pay more,
by ſuch inſenſible Methods as are both
rational and practicable.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Methods to render the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more profitable to England</note>Now the means to render theſe Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
more profitable to this Kingdom are
by making Laws.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To prevent (as much as convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may be) the Product of either to be
tranſported from the place of its Growth to
any other place ſave <hi>England.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. To prevent its being Imported hither
after manufactured there.</item>
               <item>3. To prevent (as much as may be
with Conveniency) the Exporting hence
any ſimple thing in order to be manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured
there, ſuch as Iron, Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which 'twere better for this Kingdom
were firſt wrought up here.</item>
               <item>4. In Lieu of all to lay open the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
Trade, that the Inhabitants may be
ſupply'd with <hi>Negroes</hi> on eaſie Terms.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are general Rules, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Exceptions; for when I ſay the
Commodities of one Plantation ſhould not
be carried to another, I mean thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which are fit for Trade, and may be
brought hither, and be hence diſperſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49087:47"/>
as Sugars, Cotton, Indigoe, Tobacco,
Ginger, and ſuch like; but for Proviſions,
Timber, Horſes, and things of like natures,
they may and ought to be permitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Nation cannot ſo conveniently
ſupply them hence; and therefore the <hi>Act
of Trade</hi> gave leave to tranſport the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> which hath laid open a
Gapp to that Peoyle, who carry the firſt
Beef to thoſe Markets, wherein they anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
us, and get the beſt Priſes, beſides
the Charges we are at in ſending our Ships
thither to load, which they ſave; Nor is
this all, for going to the Plantations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving Bonds to diſcharge in <hi>England</hi>
what they take in there as the Law doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
they frequently unload either all or
part of their Loadings elſewhere, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if a new Law was made that all Ships
Trading to the Plantations from <hi>Europe</hi>
ſhould firſt give Bonds in <hi>England,</hi> and for
default thereof be ſeized on their Arrival
there, it would be a great Step towards
preventing this abuſe, and then plain and
eaſie ways may be offered to hinder Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any part of their Cargoes elſewhere;
And when things are brought to this State,
that the Product of our Plantations ſhall
neceſſarily be center'd here, we may put
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49087:47"/>
almoſt what Rates we will on them to our
Neighbours; it's true 'tis the Intereſt of
<hi>England</hi> that what is conſumed among
our ſelves ſhould be ſold at reaſonable
Priſes, but the higher they yield abroad
the more Treaſure they bring to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
provided we ſtrain not the Staple
ſo as to be underſold from other Markets;
But there muſt be a Regard had to our
Fiſheries, that the Liberty of carrying that
Commodity direct to Foreign Parts be
not reſtrained.</p>
            <p>Next by their being brought home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manufactured
they would give great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
here; <hi>Cotten Wool</hi> by being
ſpun up and made into ſeveral ſorts of
pretty things; <hi>Tobacco</hi> by Cutting and
Rowling; and <hi>Sugar</hi> by refining; for I
would have no <hi>Tobacco</hi> brought home ſave
in Leaf, nor <hi>Sugar</hi> above <hi>Muſcovado;</hi> the
laſt would imploy abundance of Sugar-Houſes
in <hi>England</hi> to clay and refine it,
not only for a home Expence, but to be
tranſported to Foreign Markets; a Trade
we have been lately beat out of by the
Induſtry of the <hi>Dutch</hi> helpt on by our
own Imprudence, for no wiſe Nation would
have given ſuch an advantage to a Rival
Trader as by Law to put their Refiners
on terms of working <hi>Sugars</hi> Three Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>per Cent</hi> cheaper than our own, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49087:48"/>
when the thing comes to be well
weighed, I believe 'twill be found the
Intereſt of this Nation to ſuffer all thoſe
Commodities to be Imported Cuſtom
Free, and to lay a Duty on what is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
again unwrought, (I mean all <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
Commodities) and to raiſe an Exciſe
on what is ſpent at Home, for which eaſie
and practicable Methods may be propoſed;
and this would ſalve all thoſe Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
running <hi>Tobacco,</hi> or drawing back
Debentures after relanded; which Duty
might be collected with few Officers, and
little Charge, and the King might have
an Account of every particular Parcel how
it was transferred from Man to Man till
'twas paid.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Africa.</note> But if the <hi>Planter</hi> ſhould complain at his being denied to Import wrought <hi>Sugars,</hi> it
would be abundantly made up to him by
opening the <hi>African</hi> Trade, that ſo he
might be ſupplied with <hi>Negroes</hi> both in
greater Numbers and at cheaper Rates
than now he is; a Trade of the moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to this Kingdom of any we drive,
and as it were all Profit, the firſt Coſt
being little more than ſmall Matters of our
own Manufactures, for which we have in
Return, <hi>Gold, Teeth, Wax,</hi> and <hi>Negroes,</hi>
the laſt whereof is much better than the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49087:48"/>
firſt, being indeed the beſt Traſſick the
Kingdom hath, as it doth occaſionally give
ſo vaſt an Imployment to our People
both by Sea and Land; Theſe are the
Hands whereby our Plantations are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and 'tis by their Labours ſuch
great Quantities of <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
Ginger,</hi> and <hi>Indigo,</hi> are raiſed, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bulky Commodities imploy great
Numbers of our Ships for their tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hither, and the greater number of
Ships imploys the greater number of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decraft
Trades at home, ſpends more of our
Product and Manufactures, and makes
more Saylors, who are maintained by a
ſeparate Imploy; for if every One raiſed
the Proviſions he eat, or made the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
he wore, Trade would ceaſe, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
being a variety of Imployments
Men have ſet themſelves on adapted to
their particular Genius's, whereby one is
ſerviceable to another without invading
each others Province; thus the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
raiſes Corn, the Millard grinds it,
the Baker makes it into Bread, and the
Citizen eats it; Thus the Grazier fats
Cattle, and the Butcher kills them for
the Market; Thus the Shepherd ſhears
his Wool, the Spinſter makes it into
Yarn, the Weavet into Cloth, and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49087:49"/>
Merchant exports it, and every one lives
by each other: Thus the Country ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the City with Proviſions, and that the
Country with Manufactures; Now to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
a Government to monopolize, and
conſequently to leſſen this Trade, by
confining it to a limited Stock, is the ſame
as to adviſe the People of <hi>Egypt</hi> to raiſe
high Banks to confine the River <hi>Nilus</hi>
from overflowing, leſt it ſhould thereby
fertilize their Lands, or the King of <hi>Span</hi>
to ſhut up his Mines, leſt he ſhould fill

Trade indeed is our Silver Mines, for
by the Overplus of <hi>Negroes</hi> above what

Quantities thereof from the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> a
Trade we are lately fallen into by a
Compact of the two Natious, for which

diſcharged in the ſame ſpecie with great
Punctuality.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all the advantage the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Opportunities of ſelling our Manufactures

to that People, with whom we now grow
into ſome ſort of Familiarity, and may
be a means in time to make way for a

reap the beſt part of the Treafure of
thoſe Mines, <hi>Jamaica</hi> being now become

the former, ſo when that ſupply ceaſes,
it will be removed to ſome other place,

ſuch as the <hi>Court of Aſſiſtants</hi> ſhall think
fit to ſettle; which Stock to be imployed
for Buying or Building Forts where thought
neceſſary, and defraying all publick Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for carrying on the Trade.</p>
            <p>I do not remember that the greateſt
number of Soldiers proved at the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
appointed by the Honourable <hi>Houſe of
Commons,</hi> to enquire into that Affair did
exceed one Hundred and Twenty on the
whole Coaſt; nor did their Forts and Caſtles
appear to be any thing elſe ſave Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for their Factors, which (to ſecure
their Goods from the Natives, and the
ſudden Inſults of other Nations) they
guarded both with Men and Guns, all
which was propoſed to be done by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
Company; Beſides, when more
Factories are ſettled, conſequently there
will be more People, which will ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
their number of Soldiers, and be
more formidable, whilſt every Man fights
for his own Intereſt, whereas thoſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
(as it was there proved) were ill
provided for, worſe paid, and kept only
by Conſtraint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49087:51"/>
It was never made out (or indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
before that Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
that thoſe Forts and Caſtles were
to wage a National War, or to ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a National Invaſion, the defence of
their Guns could not exceed their reach,
which was not above a Mile at moſt; nor
were there any Magazines of Proviſions
laid up to expect a Siege from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
neither could they hinder Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
who traded on the Coaſts of what
Nation ſoever; but for that end the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had obtained Frigats from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
who by illegal Commiſſions
deſtroyed our own Merchants Ships (unleſs
permitted on the payment of Forty or
Fifty <hi>per Cent</hi> at home on the Goods they
carried out) whilſt they let others alone;
This being ſeconded by their Factors in
the ſeveral Plantations, who ſeized them
and their Cargoes there if they eſcaped
the former, diſcouraged our private Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who elſe found no Difficulties, the
Natives receiving them as Friends, and
chooſing rather to deal with them than
the Company; whoſe Factories alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at remote diſtances from each other,
great part of that Coaſt was unguarded,
and untraded too by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49087:51"/>
Nor do I ſee what need there was to
fight our way into a Trade altogether as
advantageous to the Natives as to us, for
whilſt we ſupply'd them with things
they wanted, and were of value amongſt
them, we took in exchange Slaves, which
were elſe of little worth to the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and it cannot be thought that the
People of <hi>England</hi> who have ſetled ſuch
large Colonies on the Continent of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
(beſides its ſeveral Iſlands) where
there was no reaſonable Proſpect of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and have increaſed their
Numbers ſo as to be able to defend their
firſt Footings without the help of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
not only againſt the Natives where
they found any, but likewiſe againſt all
other Nations, ſhould fall ſhort in carrying
on this Trade, which doth at the firſt view
offer the Proſpect of ſo great a Profit.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider the Inconveniences
that have attended this Monopoly, and
conſequently the Conveniencies which
would come to the Nation by digeſting
it into an open and free, tho' a regulated
Company; ſure if confining the working
in a Golden Mine to one day in a week
which would afford the like Treaſure every
day to the Nation cannot be its advantage,
no more can the limiting this Trade; for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49087:52"/>
if we ſend more Ships we fetch more <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi>
and vend more Commodities for
their Purchaſe; beſides every <hi>Negro</hi> in the
Plantations gives a ſecond Imploy to the
Manufacturers of this Kingdom, and had
we many more to ſpare the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would
buy them, ſo there can be no Ground for
putting this Trade into few Men's Hands,
except 'tis deſigned thoſe few ſhall grow
Rich, whilſt for their ſakes the Nation
ſuffers in its Trade and Navigation; The
Company have made this detrimental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their Charter, that they have
thereby been enabled to buy up our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
cheaper at home, and to make
the <hi>Planters</hi> pay dearer Rates for <hi>Negroes</hi>
abroad, than could have been done if
there had been more Buyers for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and Sellers of the latter; beſides the
ill Supply they gave the Plantations, and
the partiality in their Lots and Dividends
there, the effect whereof was that one
Planter who was befriended grew Rich
by having good <hi>Negroes,</hi> whilſt another
was ruined by having none but bad; and
this drew with it another ill Conſequence,
their Factors as it were Monopolized
Trade to themſelves, by obliging the
Planters to deal with them for other things
if they expected favour when the <hi>Negro</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49087:52"/>
Ships arrived, ſo that the reſt of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
were forced to look on whilſt the
others had any thing to ſell, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were reſtrained by a Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from ſupplying the Planter with the
ſame Commodity, for which likewiſe the
Company expected ready Pay, whilſt the
others gave long time.</p>
            <p>This was fully proved before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Committee at one of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to whom I heard an eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of <hi>London</hi> of an undoubted Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and well acquainted with the Trade
to <hi>Africa</hi> affirm, That on a former little
relaxation of the ſeverity of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was then called in queſtion
by the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi>
ſome of our Woolen Manufactures fit for
that Trade roſe inſtantly Fifty <hi>per Cent</hi> to
his certain knowledge, occaſioned by the
Multitudes of Buyers, whereof he was one;
and indeed it is not to be wondered at,
for whilſt that Company was in power
many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Interlopers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to fit in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
their Cargoes, it being thought
cauſe ſufficient to ſtop a Ship here if any
part of the Goods entered out gave Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
ſhe was bound for the Coaſt of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
which would have made a Stander by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49087:53"/>
to have thought that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Penſions in that Court as well as the
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but that the Vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our Product and Manufactures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
our Navigation on advantageous
terms is the true Intereſt of this Nation, and
all Foreign Commerce as it advances either
is more or leſs profitable, now the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>African</hi> Trade to a limited
Stock promotes the ends of neither, and
I believe 'tis one reaſon why we know ſo
little of that large Continent, becauſe the
Company finding ways enough to employ
their Fund among thoſe few Factories
they had ſetled on the Sea Coaſt never
endeavoured a farther <hi>Inland</hi> Diſcovery,
whereas if it was laid open, the buſie
Merchant that Induſtrious Bee of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would not leave one River or Creek
untraded to, from whence he might hope
to make Advantage.</p>
            <p>It's to Trade and Commerce we are
beholding for what Knowledge we have
of Foreign Parts, and it is obſervable that
the more remote People dwell from the
Sea the leſs they are acquainted with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
abroad; <hi>Africa</hi> is a large Country,
and doubtleſs the Trade to it might be
much enlarged to our Advantage, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49087:53"/>
Settlements made and ſecured if good
Methods were taken; Uſe and Experience
make us at laſt Maſters of every thing;
and tho' the firſt Undertakers of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
fall ſhort of anſwering their private
Ends, yet they may not the Ends of the
Nation, by laying open a beaten Path for
Poſterity to tread in with Succeſs where
they miſcarry'd; when all places in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
may freely ſend Ships, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the management of their own
Affairs, this encourages Induſtry, and ſets
Peoples Heads at work how they may
outdo each other by getting firſt into a
new Place of Trade; beſides, the more
Traders the more Buyers at Home and
Sellers Abroad, and by this means our
Plantations on that large Continent of
<hi>America</hi> would be better furniſhed with
<hi>Negroes,</hi> for want of which the Inhabitants
there could never arrive to thoſe Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they have done in the Iſlands, the
Company having given them little or no
Supply, who rather choſe to ſend them to
the latter, becauſe they were able to make
better Pay; But the Interlopers have done
it, tho' under great diſcouragements from the
Company and their Factors, who like the
Dog in the Fable, would neither ſupply
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49087:54"/>
thoſe Plantations themſelves, nor ſuffer
others to do it.</p>
            <p>As for the other Commodities brought
in Returns from <hi>Africa,</hi> Wax and Teeth,
one ſerves for a Foreign Trade without
leſſening the Expence of our own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
the other imploys our Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at home, and is afterwards Exported
to other Markets; and as for the Gold
brought thence, I need not mention how
much it doth advance our Wealth, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
it to be a good Barter.</p>
            <p>On the whole I take the <hi>African</hi> Trade
both for its Exports and Imports, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as it ſupplies our Plantations, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
Navigation, to be very beneficial
to this Kingdom, and would be made much
more ſo, and better ſecured, were it laid
open by being formed into a Regulated
Company.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Made as,</note> The next thing we will enter on is the Trade driven to <hi>Maderas;</hi> and here tho' I
muſt confeſs I am in my own Judgment
no Friend to Monopolies, and have not yet
ſeen any reaſon to alter my Opinion, yet
as that deſtructive Element of Fire may
and often is uſed to Advantage in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place, and Poyſon with Correction
makes good Phyſick, ſo the ends of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly
being truly anſwered, it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49087:54"/>
be very ſerviceable, ſuch as are the
vending our own Manufactures at good
Rates in Foreign Markets, whilſt for them
we receive in Barter the Product of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation at reaſonable Prices; And
this effect cannot be produced by incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
any Trade into a joynt ſtock ſo
naturally as that of <hi>Maderas,</hi> where by the
late ill management of our Factors things
are come to ſuch a Paſs, that nothing leſs
than this can recover it into a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
the Inhabitants of that Iſland by the
others Imprudence have gotten ſo much
Advantage of us that they take off little
of our Wolen Manufactures, whilſt on
the other ſide we buy their Wines for
Money, which heretofore we purchaſed
in Truck; a Commodity loaden off thence
chiefly by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, for the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhip little, the <hi>French</hi> leſs, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer
(except what is ſpent on the Iſland,
or ſent to Brazile) is drank in our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
and yet we are treated by them,
not as though they depended on us, but
rather as if they thought we could not
live without their Wines, prohibiting
ſometimes one part ſometimes another
of our Manufactures, inſtead whereof they
ſupply themſelves from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with things
tho' not ſo good, yet ſuch as they content
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49087:55"/>
themſelves with to promote Manufactures
of their own, ſo wiſe are other Nations to
chooſe rather to wear what is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves than what is brought
by Strangers, tho' better in its kind; whilſt
we preferr any thing that comes from
abroad, only becauſe it does ſo.</p>
            <p>But then great care muſt be taken that
the Profit of this Monopoly doth redound
to the Nation, and not only to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
private Perſons, and that it be
continued no longer than it appears to be
for the public Good, and a fair Account
muſt be given that the quantity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
carried hence do in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
equalize the Wines loaden thence,
alſo that the Plantations abroad be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
at reaſonable Rates; By this means
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being the only Buyers, and
they having put the Trade into one Hand,
may ſell their Manufactures for better
Prices, and ſet the Rates of the others
Wines, and conſequently afford them
cheaper in our Iſlands; Thus whereas thoſe
two Monopolies of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and
<hi>African</hi> Companies prey only on their
fellow-Subjects, this would make its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
on a Foreign People; beſides it would
as it were create a new Market in a place
where our Manufactures are almoſt diſuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49087:55"/>
I confeſs could it be done any other
way I ſhould not adviſe this, but I know
none, unleſs thoſe Wines were for ſome
time prohibited to be carry'd to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which would be very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Inhabitants, who cannot well
ſubſiſt without them; the heat of the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
ſpends Nature apace, which muſt be
ſupported, and nothing hath been found
ſo agreeable to their Conſtitutions as the
Wines brought from that Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ireland.</note> We come now to ſpeak of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which
of all the Plantations ſetled by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
hath proved moſt injurious to the Trade of
this Kingdom, and ſo far from anſwering
the ends of a Colony, that it doth wholly
violate them; for if People be the Wealth
of a Nation, then 'tis certain that a bare
parting with any of them cannot be its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
unleſs accompanied with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
whereby they may be rendred more

they left behind them, elſe ſo far as you
deprive it of ſuch who ſhould conſume its
Product and improve its Manufactures you
leffen its true Intereſt, eſpecially when
that Colony ſets up a Separate, and not
only provides ſufficient of both for its ſelf,
but by the Overplus ſupplys other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and thereby leſſens its Sales abroad;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49087:56"/>
This to a Kingdom ſo much made up of
Manufactures as <hi>England</hi> is muſt needs be
attended with great Diſadvantages, and
yet to maintain a good Correſpondence
with <hi>Ireland</hi> is very convenient, I ſhall
therefore conſider what Topicks may be
laid down as general Rules for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the former, and beſt agreeable
with the true Intereſt of the latter.</p>
            <p>It was a Queſtion once put by <hi>Pilate,</hi>
what is Truth? And when he had ſaid
this he went out again unto the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi>
which Queſtion ſeems to me rather to
ariſe from a Perturbation in his own Mind
occaſioned by the fluctuating of ſeveral
Intereſts, than from any Deſire he had to
receive an anſwer, for we do not find he
ſtaid to expect it; and the Conſequence
ſhew'd 'twas ſo, for his being willing to
do the <hi>Jews</hi> a pleaſure, and fearing leſt he
ſhould not be accounted a Friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
made him paſs Sentence againſt his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on an innocent Perſon, of whom
he confeſt, he found no fault in him; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
doth generally biaſs our Judgments
in ſuch a manner that the very ſuppoſing
a thing to be ſo makes us uneaſie under
any Diſcourſe that perſwades only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into it; but Truth is the ſame ſtill,
and the eaſieſt way to diſcover it is by wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49087:56"/>
in the Paths of Plainneſs; Falſhood
wants Sophiſtry to lacker and ſet it off,
therefore Men uſually repreſent their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Intereſts under the name of a public
Good, and thereby endeavour to guild the
Pill they would have go down.</p>
            <p>The Heads I ſhall proceed on are theſe
Two.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To ſhew that <hi>Ireland</hi> as things now
ſtand is very deſtructive to the Intereſt of
<hi>England.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. That the Methods which may be uſed
to render it more ſerviceable to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of this Nation will alſo render it more
ſerviceable to its own.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are plain Propoſitions, underſtood
by every Man, and I hope to make them
out with the ſame plainneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is now
deſtructive to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> I
think it will admit of little Diſpute;
for as long as that People enjoy ſo free
and open a Trade to Foreign Parts, and
thereby are encouraged to advance in their
Wollen Manufactures, they muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
leſſen ours, than which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do us a greater Miſchief, being the
Tools whereon we Trade, when they ſink
our Navigation ſinks with them.</p>
            <p>

Now the Advantage <hi>Ireland</hi> hath above
<hi>England</hi> in making the Wollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
will ſoon give them opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of outdoing us therein, firſt as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
as good or rather better Wool, and
next as it furniſhes all Proviſions cheaper
to the Workmen, which renders them able
to live on eaſier terms than ours can here,
and this will in ſhort time give Invitation
for many more to remove thither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But 'tis the ſecond Propoſition which
will not be ſo eaſily allowed; how the true
Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> will be advanced by
ſuch means as ſhall be uſed to promote
that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we muſt conſider, what is the true
Intereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and wherein it doth
conſiſt? Whither in Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
or in Improvement of its Lands
by a good Settlement? And I doubt not
but on a ſtrict Scrutiny it will appear to
be the latter; for indeed till that is made,
no Trade can be ſerviceable to any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
farther than it doth help towards it;
Nor is it the Advantage of an ill-peopled
Colony whoſe Riches are to be the Fruits
of the Earth to divert any number of the
Inhabitants from its Cultivation, whilſt
they can find Vent for their Product, and
be ſupply'd with conveniencies another
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49087:57"/>
way; had our <hi>American</hi> Plantations done
ſo, they had never been well ſetled, but
much more of their Lands at this time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved;
and this I take to be one great
Reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> have
always lain open to the Inſults of the
Natives there, the Country being
ſlenderly peopled in the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Parts; if ſo, then certainly whatever
hinders the Peopling, and conſequently
the cultivating and improving the Lands
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> doth ſo far hinder the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its true Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Now nothing doth this more than Trade
Abroad, and Manufactures at Home.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As they divert great Numbers of
People which cannot be ſpared from Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</item>
               <item>2. As they ſo far leſſen the Strength
and Security of that Iſland.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The true Intereſt then of <hi>Ireland</hi> being
Husbandry, Trade and Manufactures ſtand
diametrically oppoſite thereto; for Trade
being of it ſelf leſs laborious, and the Poor
maintained thereby living more eaſie than
ſuch as are employed in the Field, doth
invite them rather to ſettle in that way
than the other; this is the reaſon why
ſuch Multitudes of People daily flock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Cities from the Country, if they have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49087:58"/>
either Encouragement themſelves, or can
foreſee any for their Children, whereas
few withdraw from Trade to the Labour
of a Country Life; of this we have an
eminent Example in <hi>New England,</hi> which
tho' it was the firſt peopled, and by its
Trade hath drawn thither great Numbers
of Inhabitants, yet that large Colony
hath not cultivated ſo much Ground as far
leſs Numbers have in other Plantations
much later ſetled; for whereas in them
the Product was thought to be their
Wealth, and therefore the Setlers diſperſt
themſelves, and with all the Aſſiſtance
they could get endeavoured to clear and
fit the Ground for breaking up, theſe
took another Courſe, and by keeping
together choſe rather to live on Buying
and Selling, by which means their Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are very ſmall, and their Product
of no value ſuitable to their Numbers, ſo
that it ſeems at preſent rather a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of Trade, their chief Imployment
being to ſupply the other <hi>American</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
with Fiſh catch'd on the Coaſts,
and ſome other things raiſed near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and in Returns bring thence the
Commodities of their Growth, which
they again barter with us, or Ship to
Markets themſelves, and here it is to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49087:58"/>
noted that the great Ballance of their
Ttade is Ships, which (having plenty of
Timber) they build on reaſonable Rates,
either for Sale, or to be imployed for
tranſporting their own Commodities, which
being generally bulky, ſuch as Timber,
Mackrill, Bread, Horſes, for the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Codfiſh for <hi>Europe,</hi> great part
of their value ariſes from their Freights;
This was indeed their overſight at firſt,
and now ſcarce to be retrieved; for had
they then began with Planting, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that cloſely for ſome time, they
might in all probability long ſince have
made themſelves Maſters of a greater
Product, which would have laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of a much larger Trade both to
<hi>Europe</hi> and other places in <hi>America;</hi> they
are indeed a thrifty ſort of People, but
want Commodities of their own Product,
and the Profits of a Nations Trade being
very much limited according to that, if
the Parliament ſhould think fit by new
Laws to hinder the Freedom they now
enjoy in our <hi>American</hi> Plantations (which
I judge abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe ſo
much abuſed by their carrying thoſe
Commodities to Foreign Markets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
touching firſt in <hi>England,</hi> to the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening
our Cuſtoms, and diſcouraging our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49087:59"/>
Merchants here) their Trade muſt ſink,
and they ſee their error too late.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as Foreign Trade and Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
leſſen the Number of Husbandmen
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo ſecondly it leſſens the Strength
and Security of that Iſland, which lies in
a good Number of hardy People, enured
to Labour, who with it defend their own
Intereſts, and cannot depart thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaving their All; whereas Merchants
and Traders being but Temporary Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
may and often do leave a place
when it moſt requires their Stay for its
Defence; an Inſtance of this we had
lately, when the trading Part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
thereof who could remove their
Effects left it ſooneſt, whilſt the Men of
Land came more uneaſily away, becauſe
they left their Eſtates behind them, and
had no Methods of maintaining themſelves
in <hi>England</hi> but by living on what they
brought with them, whereas the others
ſoon fell into Trade here, and tho' they
changed the place were ſtill in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
now the Security of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
of <hi>Ireland</hi> is to engage as many
as they can in the ſame Intereſt with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which may be done by dividing
the Lands into particular Farmes, in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſuitable to the Stocks of ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49087:59"/>
them; by this means they fix their
Roots in the Ground, and bind them with
a Band of Iron; nor would many of their
People (if Trade were diſcouraged) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>England</hi> again, but imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Stocks in improving ſuch
Farms as they ſhould purchaſe either for
Lives or Years at eaſie Rents, or making
themſelves Freeholders.</p>
            <p>And as the ſecurity of <hi>Ireland</hi> is leſſen'd
at Land by Trade, ſo likewiſe at Sea, for
which they depend on the Kingdom of
<hi>England;</hi> now can it be thought this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be at continual charges only to
raiſe a People which ſhall vye with them
in their Trade? Or that we can be able
to do it when our Navigation decays?
which it muſt do as the others increaſes,
who afford us few Saylers towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our Fleet, whilſt our own are harraſt
by continual Preſſes; for let them be ſure
if the <hi>French</hi> King could have marched
an Army thither as eaſie as he could to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> the Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> might long
ſince have had other Landlords, maugre
all the defence they could have made.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Profit of this Trade and
Manufacture redound to the Free-holders,
but only to the Traders, who as I hinted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49087:60"/>
before are a ſeparate Intereſt, and remove
at their Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>But if the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> think <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
is bound to defend them againſt a
Foreign Invaſion an Account of its own
Intereſt and Security, they muſt be allow'd
to be in the right, yer let them conſider
alſo that we have power to limit their
Trade ſo as it may be leaſt prejudicial
to our own, which in my Judgment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better be done than by reducing that
Kingdom to the State of our other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
confining the Exportation of their
Product only hither, and that alſo unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured,
and preventing their being
ſupplied with Neceſſaries from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
this will make <hi>Ireland</hi> profitable to
<hi>England,</hi> and in ſome meaſure recompence
the vaſt Charges we have been at for its
Reduction and Delivery out of the Hands
of Foreign Powers and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cut-throats,
and that not leſs than twice in forty Years,
all paid by the People of <hi>England,</hi> a Gveſs
whereat may be made by this, that the
laſt coſt above Three Hundred and Forty
Thouſand Pounds only in Tranſport Ships,
for which we now pay Intereſt; and
if the Charge of Tranſporting our Army
thither with their Proviſions and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
coſt ſo much, what did the pay of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49087:60"/>
the firſt and Purchaſe of the latter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto? Now 'tis very reaſonable the
Nation ſhould ſome way or other receive
Satisfaction for its Expences, and none
ſeems more juſt and equal than this, which
would only limit the Profits of a few Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who carry on a Trade to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of <hi>England;</hi> As for the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
they would be ſupply'd with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
on as cheap terms as now, and
find Chapmen for their Product, which
would be bought up by Factories ſetled
from <hi>England,</hi> or they might ſend them
hither themſelves if they thought fit, and
by this means all would be manufactured
here, and Foreign Markets muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
hence as they are now thence.</p>
            <p>This is the way to prevent tranſporting
their Wool for other Places to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of our Manufactures, and Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tobacco with other of our Plantation
Commodities directly thence to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of our Cuſtoms and Merchants;
this alſo would imploy our Navigation,
and by its ſhort Voyages make Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Seamen; In ſhort, we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Advantages it would bring to
this Kingdom till Experience hath ſhew'd
us.</p>

<hi>What is Truth?</hi> 'Twill be as difficult
to perſwade the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> that
this is their true Intereſt, as it is thoſe of
<hi>Ireland</hi> that theirs does not conſiſt in Trade
and Manufactures, one being byaſſed by
the breeding part of this Nation, as the
others are by their Merchants, who repreſent
their private Profits as the Nations; and it
is not to be wondred they have Succeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
when it carries ſo much the face of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
advantage; but that the Gentlemen of
<hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſtill fond of that Act after
ſo many Years ſmarting under it ſeems to me
very ſtrange, than which I know no Law in
my time hath been more pernicious to the
Traffique of this Kingdom; 'twas this firſt
put thoſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> on that Trade which
hath ſince almoſt eat out ours; 'twas this ſet
them on Manufactures, which were ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
before the late troubles, that the
ſales of one Market as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
came to a Thouſand Pounds <hi>per</hi>
Week; for ſo long as they had Liberty
of Importing their Product hither, and
found a conſtant Sale when Imported,
they were contented therewith, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49087:61"/>
put on a neceſſity of finding out Foreign
Markets for their Proviſions, this made
their Merchants (who were before gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Factors to thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and are
to give them their due an ingenious pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People) dive deeper, and ſince we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take the Fleſh, they choſe to keep
the Fleece, and either to Ship it to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countrys where 'twould yield a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Price, or by a Manufacture to render it fit
for thoſe Markets wherein they vended the
other; 'Twas this that hath produced ſuch
great Quantities of Wool in <hi>Ireland</hi> as have
at leaſt equalled if not exceeded <hi>England,</hi> for
the greateſt part of the Lands of that
Kingdom by reaſon of the thinneſs of its
Inhabitants being turned rather to paſture
than Tillage, and this Prohibition diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the raiſing black Cattle, put the
People on ſtocking them with Sheep;
which Overplus would again decreaſe if
<hi>Ireland</hi> becoming better peopled in its
<hi>Inland</hi> Parts by laying aſide Trade fell
more on Tillage, or by repealing this Act
the Inhabitants received Encouragement
to betake themſelves again to breeding
black Cattle; now if it be true that not
the quantity of a Commodity at Market
but the Demand when there makes it
bear a Price, it will appear that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49087:62"/>
of that Law were out in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques,
by not conſidering that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be conſumed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and if ſent to Foreign parts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſupplied hence 'twould abate the
Exportation of ours, the Conſequence
whereof would be the leſſening their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
abroad more than it was increaſed
at home; nor did they at the ſame time
take care to put us on any footing equal
with the others by abatement in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
on Exportation, and thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> to ſell
ſuitably with thoſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ſtill
continued Three Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel on
Beef, and Four on Pork, whilſt the others
paid much leſs there, the ſame on But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Bread, Flower, and other Proviſions,
ſo that a Stander by would have thought
this Law had been contrived for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> all which proceeded
from the miſtaken Intereſt of one part of
the Kingdom, which (were it true) ought
not to prevail to the Detriment of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Trade, and the true Intereſt of the
Remainer.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be reaſonable unleſs this
Liberty be given to bind up <hi>Ireland</hi> from
a Foreign Trade, and conſequently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the conſumption of its Product to a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49087:62"/>
Home Expence, except what we ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally
fetch from them to carry A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
This as it will diſcourage the Free-holders
there, ſo will it Induſtry here, and
the Trade muſt be managed by great <hi>Funds,</hi>
ſmall Stocks not being able to engage in
tranſporting the Commodities they receive
in Barter to Foreign Markets, which they
might in bringing them to <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſhorter Voyage; and ſo conſequently
the Product of <hi>Ireland</hi> would have more
Buyers, and the Inhabitants be ſupplyed
with Neceſſaries on cheaper Terms by this
free Trade, than when their whole Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
ſhould be on thoſe Monopolizers.</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion will be what effect
the taking off this Prohibition will have
on our native Product? Whither it will
leſſen its Conſumption? I am of opinion
it will not, becauſe our Exports muſt be
increaſed as theirs from <hi>Ireland</hi> are leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſs we do imagine Foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
will not conſume the ſame quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they did before, or will find out new
ways to be ſupplied with them from other
places; beſides, by how much more charges
are added to the Products of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as
thoſe of Freight and other petty Expences
on ſuch bulky Commodities will be if
brought hither) ſo much will ours be put
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49087:63"/>
on the ſame Footing with them, and bear
a better price.</p>
            <p>It's well known that the Exporting our
Wool to Foreign Markets hath by the ill
Conſequences thereof abated its Price at
Home; This hath been obſerved by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
made by conſidering Men, and
the reaſon was, becauſe thoſe Countrys were
thereby enabled to work up much larger
Quantities of their own into various ſorts
of Manufactures, which both fitted their
occaſions at Home, and ſupplied Markets
abroad where we generally vended ours;
by this means our Sales growing ſlack,
and finding new Competitors in our
Trade, we were forced to ſell our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
cheap, and this was done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them ſlighter, and by leſſening the
Prices both of Wool and Labour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
had we kept our Wool at Home theſe
Miſchiefs had been prevented, and the
<hi>French</hi> and other Nations could not have
made ſuch a Progreſs in Manufactures as
they have done; their Wool being unfit
to be wrought up by its ſelf (unleſs mixt
with <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh)</hi> muſt have ſought
a Market here, and been returned again
to them in Manufactures, which is the
true way to enrich this Kingdom; This
would have drawn over great Numbers of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49087:63"/>
People to be employed in the Cloathing
Trade, who would likewiſe have conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
our Product; and as theſe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
ſo alſo had their Imployment,
which would have kept up the Price of
<hi>Wool,</hi> things being of value in Markets
according as they are ſupply'd by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
ſtanding in competition for Trade,
and it muſt be allowed that it was not the
Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to fall its Manufactures
abroad had we been the only Sellers,
for according as they yielded there, ſo much
is the Wealth of this Nation advanced;
This our Fore-fathers knew when they
made Laws not only to prohibit the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of <hi>Wool</hi> hence, but alſo from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which Laws cannot be too ſtrong,
on whoſe due obſervation depends our
Wealth or Ruin; now if the Trade of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was reduced to that of our other Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and the ſame Care taken about the
Commodities of its growth, our danger
from that Kingdom in Relation to this
would be at an end, when Methods may
alſo be uſed to prevent its being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
hence.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any reaſon to be offered
why <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould have greater Liberty
than our other Plantations, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
whereof have an equal Deſire to a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49087:64"/>
free Trade, forgetting that the firſt deſign
of their Settlement was to advance the
Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> againſt whom no
Arguments can be uſed which will not
equally hold good againſt <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As it was ſettled by Colonies ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As it hath been ſtill ſupported and
defended at the Charge of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As it hath received equal Advantages
with the other Plantations from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<hi>England</hi> hath been at in carrying on
Wars Abroad and Revolutions at Home;
And on this laſt there is greater Reaſon
againſt <hi>Ireland</hi> than any of the reſt, we
having lately paid more Money for the
Purchaſe of that Trade than the Profits
thereof may bring to us and our Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for many Generations; ſo that 'twould
be a piece of great Ingratitude for the
Free-holders of <hi>Ireland</hi> unwillingly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to any thing whereby the Intereſt of
<hi>England</hi> may be advanced, to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
whereof they are indebted for their
Lands, who have laid down their Lives
and ſpent their Treaſures to reinſtate them
in their Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>As for Corn, Fiſh, and Horſes, whither
a Liberty may not be allowed to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
them thence direct for other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49087:64"/>
on Ships firſt entring here in <hi>England</hi>
is a point worth ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>But the main objection as to <hi>England</hi>
is yet behind, a great part of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of this Kingdom thinking it will ſink
the Rents of their Lands if <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle
are admitted to be brought over alive,
others that the Importation of Proviſions
thence will fall the Price of our own;
and though in the former they do not ſo
generally agree, differing according as their
Lands are Scituated, and proper for Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Feeding, yet in the latter they
more unanimouſly conſent, and cry out,
<hi>This is the great Diana of the Epheſians,</hi>
the leſs Proviſions are brought in, the
more our own will be expended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if they did impartially conſider, they
would find it an empty <hi>Idol;</hi> Nothing
will advance their Lands like Trade and
Manufactures, therefore what-ever turns
the Stream of theſe elſwhere leſſens the
Number of Inhabitants who ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their Proviſions, and when thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
ſo do the others, which (beſides a
home conſumption by People engaged in
Imployments diſtinct from Husbandry)
doth always invite many Foreigners hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who being Temporary Reſidents
ſpend our Product, it being a ſure Maxim
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49087:65"/>
that <hi>where the Carcaſs is there will the Eagles
be gathered together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, when the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proviſions are
broughr hither, thoſe Markets which were
ſupply'd with them thence before will then
have them hence, tho' perhaps at dearer
Rates, and with them great Quantities of
our own; No Man can imagine what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
there would be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattle
were we once fallen into the Trade of
making Proviſions here, <hi>England</hi> as well
in its Beef as Manufactures exceeding all
other Countrys, with this farther Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that the former for Goodneſs and
Price cannot be ſupplied from any other
place ſave <hi>Ireland;</hi> nor do I ſuppoſe it ſo
much the Intereſt of this Kingdom when
Proviſions are advanced only by a Home
Expence, as when 'tis done by a Foreign
Export, the firſt makes particular Men
grow Rich by preying on their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but the Nation grows Rich by the
latter, when we vend them abroad at
good Prices; nor would our Plantations
which now take off the greateſt part of
the Cattle ſlaughter'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſpend one
Barrel leſs if kill'd here.</p>
            <p>All Trade had a beginning, occaſioned
by ſome lucky Accident which put Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on new Projects, and why <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49087:65"/>
which hath ſo many Plantations depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it ſhould ſuſpect a conſumption
for its Cattle I cannot imagine; we might
then ſet the Rates of Proviſions there, and
the Merchants afford to give better Prices
for them here, when they ſhall load them
at Home, and ſave the Charges of going
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> without fear of having their
early Markets foreſtall'd thence; and the
Planters being now grown rich are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
able to give greater Rates for them
than they could at their firſt Settlement;
<hi>England</hi> had never a fairer Opportunity

Countrys as well as the Feeding.</p>
            <p>But if a Manufactury is thought fit for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and its Circumſtances will admit
thereof, let that of Linnen be encouraged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this may draw over Multitudes of <hi>French</hi>

which we muſt aſſiſt by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Importation Cuſtom free, and
the Advantage of Faſhion; and then theſe
two Kingdoms encouraging different Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
will be ſerviceable to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for which Stocks would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49087:66"/>
even from the People of <hi>England,</hi>
who would delight to ſee <hi>Ireland</hi> thrive
when their Manufactures croſt not ours;
This would in time alter the Ballance
of our Trade with <hi>France,</hi> when we ſhall
ſend thither more Woollen, and receive
thence leſs Linnen.</p>
            <p>If the wiſdom of the Parliament ſhall
think fit by theſe or any other Methods
to make <hi>Ireland</hi> more ſerviceable to the
Trade of <hi>England</hi> it will advance both the
Lands and Traffick of this Kingdom, and

of this long and expenſive War.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Scotland.</note> I ſhall next ſay ſomething to the Trade of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hath formerly conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more of our Woollen Manufactures
than now it doth, ſince that Nation is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
on making them there, which they
do out of their own Wool, with the help of
what they get from us, alſo of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi>
both from hence and from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their chief Manufactures are Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
Butter, and Herrings; 'twere to be
wiſh'd the former was more encouraged
by this Government, with Liberty to bring
it hither Cuſtom free, provided they would
ſend us alſo their Wool, and then our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
would not juſtle with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
King <hi>James</hi> the II. limited their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49087:66"/>
Trade to his Pleaſure by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I take to be a great reaſon
why that People were ſo much at his
Devotion, but the Liberty of a free Trade
was made one of the Terms whereon his
preſent Majeſty received the Crown, who
hath ſince given them Encouragement to
ſettle Plantations abroad, ſuch as they
ſhall either plant, or buy from Foreign
Princes, which he hath promiſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſe
with the ſame Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
he doth grant in like Caſes to the
Subjects of his other Dominions.</p>
            <p>They have alſo fallen lately on the
thoughts of Codd-Fiſhing, whereof they
have great ſhoals about their Coaſts,
which formerly they uſed to pickle and
ſend away in Casks, but now intend to
cure after the manner 'tis done in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And doubtleſs theſe three things would
much encourage Trade had they Stocks to
manage them, but thoſe they want; I
have heard it diſcours'd that the Caſh of
that Kingdom amounted to One Million
of Pounds Sterling, but I ſcarce believe it
does to One Half, perhaps not one Third
which properly belongs to its Inhabitants;
therefore they propoſe to carry on the
Woollen Manufactures Plantations and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49087:67"/>
Fiſhery by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stocks, the two laſt
by Companies, which will conſiſt chiefly
of <hi>Londoners,</hi> who firſt promoted the
Deſigns, and will furniſh Monies for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
them; Now I cannot think any
Nation can ſettle Plantations abroad to
advantage which wants Stock and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of its own to ſupply them, the
great Profit of Plantations being to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Manufactures at Home, and the
means to ſettle them is by giving long
Credits to the Planters abroad, and when
this is done by Money taken up at Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
from another Nation the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
will redound to the Lenders, ſo that
the <hi>Scotch</hi> may make Settlements abroad,
but if neither the Stock nor Manufactures
are their own, they will have only the name
of being Proprietors whilſt others carry
away the Profits, like a Gentleman who pays
as much for Intereſt yearly as the Rents of
his Lands bring in, he may have the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
but the Uſerer has the Income of
his Eſtate; ſo for their Fiſhing, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
managed on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stocks will bring
them only ſo much as ſhall pay for the labour
of thoſe imployed about it; The ſame for
their Woollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49087:67"/>
On the other ſide if the Trade to theſe
Plantations is driven by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the <hi>Scotch</hi> indeed will get Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for their Saylors, but all the Product
will be other Men's, who will take care for
their own advantage to keep the Planters
poor abroad, and the Inhabitants from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
into it at home.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that Kingdom being now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
from <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
at cheaper Rates than they can
expect to raiſe them, will want vent for
their new Product when brought Home,
unleſs abſolutely prohibited to be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thither from hence, which will be a
new Tax on the Spender, paid only to a
Foreign Monopoly; neither can they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them to ſell on equal Terms with the
<hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that on the whole I cannot ſee
what advantage the <hi>Scotch</hi> can make at
this time of day by ſetling Plantations,
which if they do attempt, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to take care of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it to the terms of a Colony prevent
their ſelling the Product there, which I
am apt to think is the main thing they
aim at.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Canarys.</note> The <hi>Canary</hi> Trade brings us nothing but what we conſume, and takes from us little
of our Product or Manufactures, we chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49087:68"/>
purchaſe thoſe Wines for Money
therefore if it was reduced to the ſame
Terms I have propoſed for <hi>Maderas</hi> it
would do very well: By this means we
ſhould at leaſt buy <hi>Wines</hi> cheaper there,
and then their Prices muſt be limited at
Home, both on the Importer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer;
'twill be convenient to regulate
this Trade, but not to diſcourage it, for
ſince we muſt drink Wines, 'twere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had them from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> than
the <hi>French,</hi> the firſt takes off much
of our Manufactures, the other little, and
tho' perhaps the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands may not,
yet I am apt to think thoſe Wines are
paid for out of what we ſend to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Spain.</note> This brings me to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade,
which I take to be very profitable to this
Kingdom, as it vents much of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Manufactures, and ſupplies us
with many things neceſſary to be uſed in
making the latter; I ſhall divide it into
three parts, <hi>Spain, Biſcay,</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Spain;</hi> by which I mean
that part from the <hi>Bay of Cadiz</hi> Eaſtward
into the <hi>Streights of Gibralter;</hi> whither
we ſend all ſorts of Woollen Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Lead, Fiſh, Tin, Silk and Worſted
Stockings, Butter, Tobacco, Ginger,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49087:68"/>
Leather, Bees-Wax; and in Returns we
have ſome things fit only for Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſuch as are Fruit and Wines; others
for our Manufactures, ſuch as are Oyl,
Cochineal, Indigo, Anato, Barilia; with
ſome Salt; but the greateſt part is made
in Bullion, both Gold and Silver, with
which this part of the Kingdom abounds,
being ſupplied therewith from their large
Empires on the Main of <hi>America,</hi> whither
they again Export much of the Goods we
carry thither.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are a Stately People,
not much given to Trade or Manufactures
themſelves, therefore the firſt they drive
on ſuch Chargeable and Dilatory terms both
for their Ships and Ways of Navigation,
that other trading Nations, ſuch as the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereby, only that to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> is
on ſtrict Penalties reſerved to themſelves,
but having no Manufactures of their own,
the Profit thereof Returns very much to
thoſe who furniſh them; indeed of late
they have made a ſmall beginning on
<hi>Bayes,</hi> but will not be able to hold it when
the War is ended; Nor have they ſo
well ſecured the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> but that it is
very plentifully ſupply'd by us with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
and many other things from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49087:69"/>
               <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which is accompanied with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Advantage than when ſent firſt to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz;</hi>
for whereas we generally ſold them
there at Twenty <hi>per Cent</hi> advance, we do by
this Means make at leaſt <hi>Cent per Cent,</hi>
all paid for in Bullion, which adds to the
Wealth of the Nation; this I take to be
the true Reaſon why our Vent for them
at <hi>Cadiz</hi> is leſſened, becauſe we ſupply
<hi>New-Spain</hi> direct with thoſe things they
uſed to have thence before.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Biſcay</hi> I mean all that part under
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government which lies in the
<hi>Bay</hi> of that Name; the Commodities we
ſend thither are generally the ſame; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
formerly great Quantities of Refined
Sugars, till we gave the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
leave to undermine us, partly by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
they had by the late Impoſition
on <hi>Muſcovadoes,</hi> and partly by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
and ill Management of our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Bakers,</hi>
who would not take Pains to
comply with the humours of that People
as the others did; but I hope if due care
be taken, that profitable Trade may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
again.</p>
            <p>The Commodities we have thence are
very advantageous, ſuch as Sheeps Wool,
Iron, and Bullion, whereof the firſt is the
beſt, as being the ſubject Matter of a great
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49087:69"/>
Manufacture, which could we ſecure whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our ſelves (tho' it coſt all Bullion)
'twould be of great Advantage to the
Nation, but both the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi>
come in for their Shares.</p>
            <p>The third part of our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade is
that to <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereby I mean all that
part of the low Countrys now under its
Government; whither we ſend Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
much of the ſame nature with
thoſe we ſend to the other Parts, tho'
not in ſo great Quantities; and among
our Woollen Manufactures more courſe
Medlys; alſo Coals from <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> but
not ſo much Leather, being ſupplied
freely with raw Hides from <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
are tann'd there; This might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
were that Kingdom reduced to the
State of a Colony, and the Profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
would then return hither; We have
thence Linnens, Thread, and other things,
which are uſed at home, and ſhipp'd off
to the Plantations.</p>

much of our Product and Manufactures,
little different in their Kinds from what
is ſent to <hi>Spain;</hi> and from thence we have
in Returns Bullion, Salt, Oyl, Woad and
Wines; of the latter we have lately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49087:70"/>
great Quantities, which as they
take well with the People of <hi>England,</hi> ſo
its more our Intereſt than to have them
from <hi>France,</hi> whence our Imports are more
than our Exports, and to this Kingdom
our Exports are greater than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
thereof can make us Returns, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince we have deſiſted from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home their Sugars, a Commodity
wherewith we are more advantageouſly
ſupplyed from our own Plantations, and
did before the War furniſh Foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
cheaper than they could.</p>
            <p>This People were formerly the great
Navigators of the World, to whom we
are indebted for their many Diſcoveries

where 'tis again Barter'd for Wines,
ſhipp'd thence to our Plantations in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi>
in all theſe the Inhabitants live well,
and are very rich, but thoſe reſiding on
the <hi>Cape de Verd</hi> Iſlands are generally a
poor deſpicable People, made up of <hi>Negroes,
Molattoes,</hi> and ſuch like, who having but
little Product to give in Returns are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but meanly ſupplyed with Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and thoſe very ordinary, ſo that
they have ſcarce wherewith to cover
themſelves, much leſs for Luxury; Aſſes
Bieves and Salt being all we have from
them, which we generally carry to our
Plantations in <hi>America;</hi> Beife might be
made very cheap there could it be ſaved,
being purchaſed for little, and Salt for leſs,
but the Climate will not admit it; the
chief of which Iſlands is St. <hi>Jago,</hi> very
rich, well governed, and a Biſhops Sea,
where they are well ſupplied, becauſe
they have Money to pay for what they
buy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueze</hi> as they are now become
bad Navigators, ſo they are not great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers;
ſome ſorts of courſe Cloth

for which they drew over ſome of our
Workmen, but it ſoon came to an end,
and they returned home again by Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
given them hence, ſo prudent a
thing it is to ſtop an Evil in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Since this War they have had great
Advantages in their Navigation, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

recall'd, for which Order there ſeem'd to

refrain taking the Plate out of his Churches
to ſupport the Charge of his War,
ſhould out of Reverence ſpare the Lead
that covered them if he wanted it, and
could not elſewhere be ſupplyed with it,
which was not probable, ſince 'twas ſo

either to the length of the Peece,

between this and obliging the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer
to make his Cloth or Stuff to
a certain weight and thickneſs, without
any reſpect to the humour of the Buyer,
or the Climate of the Country to which
it is ſent; As for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as I take
them to be no good Planters, ſo no good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers,
their Heads are not turned that
way, but rather to Navigation and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
they were once famous in the Art of
Cloth-making, which was maintained by
the Wool they fetch'd hence, but King
<hi>Edward</hi> the III. conſidering the Advantage
they made by imploying their People with
our Growth whilſt our own ſtood ſtill,
prohibited the Exportation of Wool, and
the Importation of Foreign Cloth, and
cunningly perſwaded the <hi>Dutch</hi> Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
by Priviledges granted them to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49087:78"/>

We cannot hinder them from <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>

<hi>Iriſh:</hi> As for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Sweeden,</hi> their
Manufactures will come to nothing, and
it would be the great Wiſdom of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to encourage them to bring all their
Wool hither, though at ſome charge to
the Publick; as for <hi>Germany,</hi> the Woollen
Manufacture is not ſo natural to them as
the Linnen, which they would ſoon turn
to, if we gave them Encouragement by
wearing it here and in our Plantations;
this would be more advantageous to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
than by the uſe of Calicoes to force
a Neighbouring Nation to fence with us
at our own Weapons, which they very
unwillingly undertake; the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures

ſuch a Barter made, tho' by relinquiſhing
to them our part of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade;
Had we once the Command of all the

Prices we would on our Manufactures in
Foreign Markets, which now we cannot do,
but muſt ſell them cheap, leſt we be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold
by other Nations who vye with us
therein, and our Manufactures ſelling well
abroad, Wool would yield a good Price at
home; But if it be doubted that too much
Wool will be Imported, 'twould be better to
burn the Overplus at the charge of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick
(as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do their Spices) than to
have it wrought up abroad, which there
is no reaſon to fear, ſeeing all the Wool of

               <note place="margin">Inſurance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> I cannot cloſe this Diſcourſe without ſaying ſomething of Inſurance, the firſt
deſign whereof was to encourage the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to export more of our Product and
Manufactures, when he knew how to eaſe
himſelf in his Adventure, and to bear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch a proportion thereof as he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but by the irregular Practices of ſome
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49087:82"/>
Men (eſpecially ſince this War) the firſt
Intention is wholly obviated, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Intereſt have put in early Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and gotten large Subſcriptions on
Ships, only to make advantage by ſelling
them to others, and therefore have induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly
promoted falſe Reports, and ſpread
Rumours on the <hi>Exchange</hi> to the Prejudice
of the Ship or Maſter, filling all Mens
Minds with Doubts, whereby the fair
Trading Merchant when he comes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
his Intereſt either can get no one to
underwrite, or at ſuch high Rates that he
finds it better to buy the others Policies
at great advance; by this means theſe
<hi>Stockjobbers of Inſurance</hi> have as it were
turned it into a Wager, to the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of Trade; likewiſe many ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
Men their Policies being over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
have it's to be feared to the Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of honeſt Traders contrived the
loſs of their Ships; on the other ſide the
Underwriters when a Loſs is ever ſo fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved boggle in their Payments, and
force the Inſured to be content with leſs

engaging themſelves in long and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:49087:82"/>
Now if the Parliament would pleaſe
to take theſe things into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they might reduce Inſurance to its
firſt Intention, by obliging the Inſured to
run a proportionable part of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

attending long Iſſues at Law, or being

               <note place="margin">Whither the Price of Labour diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, or hinders Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> Here I intended to have made an end;
but being lately preſent where among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſcourſes the queſtion was put by an
Ingenious and Worthy Gentleman, (a true
Lover of his Country) whither the labour
of our Poor in <hi>England</hi> being ſo high does
not hinder the Improvement of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Manufactures? Which having ſome
Relation to the Subject Matter of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I humbly make bold to offer my
Thoughts thereon, <hi>viz.</hi> That both our
Product and Manufactures may be carried
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49087:83"/>
on to advantage without running down
the labour of the Poor.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, our Product, I am of
opinion that the running down the Labour
of the Poor is no advantage to it, nor is
it the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to do it, nor can
the People of <hi>England</hi> live on ſuch low
Wages as they do in other Countrys;
for we muſt conſider that Wages muſt
bear a Rate in all Nations according to
the prices of Proviſions, where Wheat is
ſold for One Shilling <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, and all
things ſuitably, a labouring Man may work
for Three Pence <hi>per diem,</hi> as well as he can
for Twelve Pence where it is ſold for Four
Shillings; and this price of Wheat muſt
ariſe from the Rates of Land; it cannot be
imagined that the Farmer whoſe annual
Rent is Twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
it as low as he who pays but Half a
Crown, and hath the ſame Cropp, nor
can he then expect labour ſo cheap as the
other; This is the caſe of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe
Lands yielding great Rents require good
Prices for their Product; and this is the
Freeholders advantage, for ſuppoſe Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
were the currant Payment for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
in ſuch caſe whither we call a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel
of Wheat One Shilling or Four Shillings
it is all one to him for ſo much as he pays,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49087:83"/>
but not for the Overplus of his Cropp,
which makes a great difference into his
Pocket; you cannot fall Wages unleſs you
fall Product, and if you fall Product you
muſt neceſſarily fall Land.</p>
            <p>And as for the ſecond, our Manufactures,
I am opinion that they may be carried
on to advantage without running down the
labour of the Poor; for which I offer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſervation, or Experience of what
hath been done, we have and daily do ſee
that it is ſo; the Refiners of Sugars late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſold for Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound what
yieled twenty Years ſince Twelve Pence;
The <hi>Diſtillers</hi> ſell their Spirits for one
third part of what they formerly did;
Glaſs-Bottles, Silk-Stockings, and other
Manufactures, (too many to be enumerated)
are ſold for half the Prices they were a few
Years ſince, without falling the labour of
the Poor, or ſo little as not to ſtand in
Competion with the other.</p>
            <p>But then the queſtion will be, how this is
done? I anſwer, It proceeds from the Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Manufacturer, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he makes in his ways of working thus
the Refiner of Sugars goes thro' that oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in a Month, which our Forefathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
four Months to effect; thus the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers</hi>
draw more Spirits, and in leſs time,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49087:84"/>
from the Simples they work on, than thoſe
formerly did who taught them the Art;
the <hi>Glaſs-maker</hi> hath fonnd a quicker way
of making it out of things which coſt
him littie or nothing; Silk-Stockings are
wove inſtead of knit; Tobacco is cut by
Engines inſtead of Knives; Books are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
inſtead of written; Deal-Boards are
ſawn with a Mill inſtead of Men's Labour;
Lead is ſmelted by Wind-Furnaces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of blowing with Bellows; all which
ſave the labour of many Hands, ſo the Wages
of thoſe imployed need not be leſſened.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there is a Cunning crept
into Trades; the <hi>Clockmaker</hi> hath improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Art ſo high, that Labour and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
are the leaſt part the Buyer pays for;
The variety of our Woollen Manufactures is
ſo pretty, that Faſhion makes a thing worth
both at Home and Abroad twice the Price
it is ſold for after, the humour of the Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
carrying a great ſway in the value of a
Commodity; Artificers by Tools and
Laves fitted for different Uſes make ſuch
things as would puzzle a Stander by to ſet
a price on according to the worth of Mens
Labour; The <hi>Plummer</hi> by new Inventions
caſts a Tun of Shott for Ten Shillings,
which an indifferent Perſon could not
gueſs worth leſs than Fifty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:49087:84"/>
The ſame Art is crept into Navigation;
A Tun of Sugars which coſt a few Years
ſince from Six to Eight Pounds Freight
from the Plantations, was commonly brought
home before the War for Four Pounds Ten
Shillings, and whereas it then weighed
but Twenty-five Hundred, 'taws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
to Forty-five, and yet Saylors Wages
were ſtill the ſame; Ships are built more
for Stowage, and made ſtrong enough to
carry between Decks; Wool is ſteeved
into them by Skrews, ſo that three or four
Baggs are put where formerly one would
ſcarce lie; Cranes and Blocks draw up
more for One Shilling than Men's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
could do for Five.</p>
            <p>New Projections are every day ſet on
foot to render the making our Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
eaſie, which are made cheap by the
Heads of the Manufacturers, not by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Price of poor Peoples Labour;
cheapneſs creates Expence, and Expence
gives freſh Imployments, ſo the Poor need
not ſtand idle if they could be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to work.</p>
            <p>The ſame for our Product; Pits are
drained and Land made Healthy by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
and Aquaeducts inſtead of Hands;
the Husband-man turns up his Soil with
the Sullow, not digs it with his Spade;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49087:85"/>
fowes his Grain, not plants it; covers it
with the Harrow, not with the Rake;
brings home his Harveſt with Carts, not
on Horſe-backs; and many other eaſie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are uſed both for improving of Land,
and raiſing its Product, which are obvious
to the Eyes of Men verſt therein, though
do not come within the Compaſs of my
preſent Thoughts; all which leſſen the
number of Labourers, and make room for
better Wages to be given thoſe who are
imploy'd.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Cheapneſs of our Product no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our Inland Trade.</note>Nor am I of opinion with thoſe People
who think the running down the Priſes of our
Growth and Product (that ſo they may
buy Proviſions cheap) is an advantage to
the <hi>Inland</hi> Trade of this Kingdom, but on
the contrary I think 'twould be beter for it if
they were ſold higher than they are,
which may ſeem a Paradox at firſt, till the
thing be rightly ſtated; ſuppoſe then the
common and uſual price of Beef to be Two
Pence half-penny <hi>per</hi> Pound, and Wheat
Three Shillings and Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel,
and all Fleſh and Grain ſuitable, 'twould
be better for our <hi>Inland</hi> Trade if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
yielded Four Pence, and the latter Five
Shillings, and other things in Proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49087:85"/>
To prove this, let us begin with the
Shop-keeper or Buyer and Seller, who is
the Wheel whereon the <hi>Inland</hi> Trade
turns, as he buys of the Importer and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer,
and ſells again to the Country;
ſuppoſe ſuch a Man ſpends Two Hundred
Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in all things neceſſary
for his Family, both Proviſions, Cloaths,
Houſe-Rent, and other Expences, the
Queſtion will be what proportion of this
is laid out in Fleſh, Corn, Butter, Cheeſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> barely conſidered according to their
firſt coſt in the Market? I preſume we ſhall
find Fifty or Sixty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to
be the moſt, and ſuitably the advance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will be about Twenty-five to Thirty
Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> but the Conſequence
thereof in the Profits of his Trade will be
much more; for by this Means the Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may give a better Rent to his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
who will be enabled to keep a more
Plentiful Table, ſpend more Wines, Fruit,
Sugars, Spices, and other things wherewith
he is furniſhed from the City, wear better
Cloaths, ſuit himſelf and his Family oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and carry on a greater Splendor in
every thing: The Farmer according to
his condition may do the ſame, and give
higher Wages to the Labourers imployed
in Husbandry, who might then live more
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49087:86"/>
plentifully, and buy new Cloaths oftner,
inſtead of patching up old; by this means
the Manufacturer would be encouraged to
give a better price for Wool, when he
ſhould find a Vent as faſt as he could
make; and a Flux of Wealth cauſing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Faſhions would add Wings to Mens
Inventions, when they ſhall ſee their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
advanced in their Values by the
Buyer's Fancy; this likewiſe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Merchant to increaſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
when he ſhall have a quick Vent for
his Imports; by which regular Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Payments would be ſhort, and all would
grow rich; but when Trade ſtops in the
Fountain, when the Gentleman and Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are kept poor, every one in his order
partakes of the ſame fate; and this hath
been a certain Rule grounded on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of all Men who have ſpent time
to look into it, that in thoſe Countrys
where Proviſions are low the People are
generally poor, both proceeding from the
want of Trade: So that he who would
give a right judgment muſt not always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
things <hi>primâ facie,</hi> as they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to us at firſt ſight, but as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be in their Conſequences.</p>

whoſe Wealth conſiſts in the labour of
our Inhabitants ſeem to encourage them
in an idle way of living, contrary both
to their own and the Nation's Intereſt:
Idleneſs though it cannot be called the
Image of the Devil, who is a buſie active
Spirit, yet fits for any Impreſſion, for
whilſt People neglect by ſome honeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to ſerve the publick Good, they too
often fall on ſuch Courſes as render them
publick Evils: <hi>Livy</hi> (that famous Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer)
obſerved it was the greateſt
Sedition that ever was in <hi>Rome,</hi> when the
Citizens went about with their Hands in
their Pockets, and would do nothing:
Hence it is that ſo many die Spectacles at
<hi>Tyburn,</hi> and offer themſelves up Victims
to Vice, no councels could perſwade nor
Examples fright them from thoſe evil
Habits they had contracted by Idleneſs:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49087:87"/>
The Curſe under which Man firſt fell was
Labour, <hi>That by the Sweat of his Brows he
ſhould eat his Bread;</hi> this is a State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
if compared to that which attends
Idleneſs; he that walks the Streets of
<hi>London,</hi> and obſerves the Fatigues uſed by
the Beggars to make themſelves ſeem Objects
of Charity, muſt conclude that they take
more pains than an honeſt Man doth at his
Trade, and yet ſeem to me not to get
Bread to eat; and I wiſh that was all
the Encouragement they met with, I fear
it is not, ſuch ſwarms of idle Drones
would not then fill the Streets, who are a
Nurſery of Vice: Beggary is now become
an Art or Myſtery, to which Children
are educated from their Cradles; any thing
which may move Compaſſion ſeems a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
a ſore Leg or Arm, or (for want
thereof) a pretended one; the Tricks and

3. What Methods may be uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for thoſe who are paſt their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the firſt; we ſhall find that Sloath
and a Deſire of Eaſe is the principal Cauſe;
which appears by People's ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on ſuch ways of Living as our Fore-fathers
would have been aſhamed of;
nothing but this could induce young Men
in their full Strengths ſlaviſhly to attend
on ſelling a Cup of Ale, or depreciate
themſelves to be Pimps to Vice, they
think by theſe ways to be maintained in
Sloth; Hereby Religion is deſpiſed, and
Vice promoted, Men thinking if they
ſhould profeſs the firſt or diſcountenance
the laſt they could not live on ſuch lazy
Terms; and whence doth this proceed?
Truly partly from the abuſe of thoſe
Laws we have, and partly from want
of better: Licenſes for Ale-houſes were
heretofore granted for good Ends, not to
draw Men aſide from their Labour by
Games and Sports, but to ſupport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
them under it; And as they were
then a Maintenance to the aged, ſo poor
Families had opportunities of being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with a Cup of Ale from Abroad,
who could not keep it at Home; great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
was alſo made to prevent idle
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49087:88"/>
Tipling, our Forefathers conſidered that
time ſo ſpent was a loſs to the Nation,
whoſe Intereſt was improved by the work
of its Inhabitants; whereas now Ale-houſes
are encouraged principally to promote the
Income of Exciſe, on whom there muſt be
no Reſtraint, leſt the King's Revenue be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened;
thus we live by Sence, and look
only to things we ſee, without revolving
what the Iſſue will be, not conſidering that
the Labour of each Man if well imployed
whilſt he ſits in an Ale-houſe would be
worth more both to the King and Nation
than all the Exciſe he pays; Induſtry
uſually brings Wealth as its Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and though Succeſs may not always
accompany private Men's Labours, yet the
Publick gets thereby.</p>
            <p>Nor did we fall into this Habit of Sloath
at once, but by degrees; when Luxury
firſt crept in this was in the Embrio,
but hath been cocker'd up under it to the
Pitch 'tis now arrived; much proceeds
from Imitation, our Gentry who have Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
betaking themſelves to an uſeleſs
way of Living, thoſe who had them not
ſoon fell in love therewith, and to this
much of the Miſery of the Nation is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Men affect to be thought what they are
not, and leaving honeſt Labour ſpend their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49087:88"/>
Patrimonies in fine Cloaths, and keeping
Company, till being put to their ſhifts
they are forced to betake themſelves to
play or begging.</p>
            <p>Another thing which hath increaſed our
uſeleſs People is the Nobility and Gentrys
leaving the Country, and chooſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in <hi>London,</hi> whither they bring up with
them Multitudes of luſty young Fellows,
who might have done good Service at the
Plough had they continued there, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now no other Imployments than to
hang on their Maſters Coaches forget
to work, and rarely or never return again
to Labour.</p>
            <p>Add to this the great Numbers who are
employed in Offices about the Revenue,
Men who might have been ſerviceable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Husbandry or Manufactures, but
now they and their Families are wholly
taken off from both, the Fathers chief
Aim being to get the Son into the ſame
way of Living.</p>
            <p>What Multitudes of Coffee-houſes are
there in <hi>London</hi> and other places, who
keep luſty Servants, and breed them up
to nothing whereby they may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49087:89"/>
What ſwarms of Youth go off to the
Law, who being the Sons of Yeomen and
Handecrafts Trades had been more uſeful
to the Nation if bred up in their Father's
Imployments?</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe who live only by Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Selling, wherein wanting Succeſs
they have no way to maintain themſelves
or their Families.</p>
            <p>But above all, our Laws to put the Poor
at work are ſhort and defective, tending
rather to maintain them ſo, then to raiſe
them to a better way of Living; 'tis true
thoſe Laws deſign well, but conſiſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in generals, and not reducing things to
practicable Methods, they fall ſhort of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
their Ends, and thereby render
the Poor more bold, when they know the
Pariſh Officers are bound either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them Work, or give them Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>England</hi> delighted more in
improving its Manufactures, ways might
be found out to imploy all its Poor, and
then 'twould be a ſhame for any Perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Labour to live idle; which leads
me to the ſecond conſideration, what muſt
be done to reſtrain this habit of Idleneſs
from growing farther; Here I find that
nothing but good Laws can do it, ſuch as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49087:89"/>
will provide work for thoſe who are
willing, and force them to work that
are able.</p>
            <p>To begin with Manufactures; Here I
ſhould think Work-houſes very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but then they muſt be founded on
ſuch Principles as may employ the Poor,
which can never be done on any thing I
have hitherto ſeen; nor will ſuch Work-houſes
take effect till the Poor can every
Week make Returns of their Stock,
which might be contrived did the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
of the Nation ſet in earneſt about it;
they muſt be fitted for the Poor and the
Poor for them; Imployments muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in them for all ſorts of People,
who muſt alſo be compelled to go thither
when ſent, and the Work-houſes to receive
them; the Stocks whereby they are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
muſt likewiſe turn often, for to put
the Poor on ways of Traffick is too dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
for the Ends intended, they muſt be
rather Aſſiſtants to the Manufacturers than
ſuch themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now the Materials which ſeem moſt
proper for theſe Work-houſes are Simples,
ſuch as Wool, Hemp, Cotten, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, which might either be ſent in
by the Manufacturers on ſuch equal Shares
as the Juſtices ſhould think fit, or be bought
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49087:90"/>
up on a ſtock raiſed for that end, in both
caſes to be taken off and paid for when
brought to ſuch a perfection as the Rules
of the Houſe ſhould direct, and that every
week, or ſo often as the Stock ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to let the Poor have their Wages
to ſerve their Occaſions; theſe things would
employ great Numbers of People, of both
Sexes, and all Ages, either by beating
and fitting the Hemp for the <hi>Ropemaker,</hi>
or dreſſing the Flax for the Shops, or
more eſpecially by Carding and Spinning
the Wool and Cotten, of different fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
which would be uſed in the various
ſorts of Manufactures we make; and if
a reward were given to that Perſon who
ſhould ſpin the fineſt Thread of either, to
be adjudged yearly, and paid by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
'twould very much promote Induſtry
and Ingenuity, whilſt every one being prickt
on by Ambition and Hopes of Profit,
would endeavour to exceed the reſt, by
which means we ſhould grow more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in our Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould theſe Houſes hinder any who
deſire to work at home, or the Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from imploying them in their own,
the deſign is to provide places for thoſe
who care not to work any where, and to
make the Officers of Pariſhes induſtrious
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49087:90"/>
to find out ſuch Vermin, when they ſhall
know where to ſend them, by which means
they would be better able to maintain the
Impotent.</p>
            <p>It ſeems alſo convenient that theſe
Work-Houſes when ſetled in Cities and
great Towns ſhould not be Parochial
only, but one or more in each place as
will beſt ſuit it, which would prevent the
Poor's being ſent from Pariſh to Pariſh
as now they are, and provided for no
where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oakham</hi> alſo is a fit Material for them,
which might be beat there, and for that
end <hi>Old Junk</hi> be bought up, and thoſe
who caulk Ships be obliged to take it off
at a certain Price.</p>
            <p>Tobacco alſo would imploy multitudes
of People, in picking, ſtripping, cutting,
and rowling it, which might be wrought
up either in Publick or Private Work-houſes,
where Boys might be imploy'd
till they came to Years fit for the Sea; and
when once the Poor ſhall come by uſe to
be in Love with Labour, 'twill be ſtrange
to ſee an idle Perſon; then they will be ſo
far from being a Burthen to the Nation,
that they will be its Wealth, and their
Lives alſo will become more comfortable
to themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:49087:91"/>
There are other things which will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the Poor beſides our Manufactures,
and more proper for Men, which are alſo
equally beneficial to the Nation, ſuch as
are Navigation, Husbandry, and Hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
Here if theſe or ſuch like Rules
were obſerved, they might be made more
Advantageous to all.</p>
            <p>As firſt let every Gentleman who takes
a Footboy be obliged to put him into ſome
way for his future Livelihood, to whom
he ſhould be bound for a certain number of
Years, and no Perſon ſhould be permitted
to continue ſo after ſuch an Age.</p>
            <p>Let every Merchant or Trader who keeps
a Foot-boy be alſo obliged to breed him
up in Buſineſs, and at a certain Age to ſet
him to ſome Trade, or imploy him in
Navigation, wherein he ſhould cauſe him to
be inſtructed; by this Means that which
now makes lazy Beggars would then be
the Nation's Advantage; I think it
a comely ſight when I ſee Commanders
of Ships attended on by ſuch Boys, becauſe
'tis rarely ſeen but that they breed them
up to be uſeful Men, and when the Pride
of Living tends to the Common Good 'tis
very well directed.</p>
            <p>Another way to provide for our Youth
would be by giving a Power to Juſtices of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49087:91"/>
the Peace to aſſign them to Artificers,
Husbandmen, Manufacturers, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
at ſuch Ages as they ſhall think them fit
to go on thoſe Imployments, who ſhould
alſo be obliged to receive them; and tho'
at firſt this may ſeem hard, as hindring
their Maſters from taking Servants who
might bring them Money, yet after ſome
time it would not, when thoſe who were
ſo bound out ſhall only do for others what
was done for them before; and this alſo
may now be made good to them by ſuch
an Overplus of Years in their Apprentiſhips
as may countervail the Money.</p>
            <p>I allow that theſe Methods are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for younger People than for thoſe of
elder Years; As for ſuch (who will rather
chooſe to beg than work) let them be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſerve the King in his Fleet, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
on board their Ships; the Sea is
very good to cure ſore Legs and Arms, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſuch as are counterfeit through
Sloath, againſt which the Capſter accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the Taunts of the Saylors is
a certain Remedy.</p>
            <p>Next for Ale-Houſes, Coffee-Houſes,
and ſuch like Imployments, let them be
kept only by aged People, or ſuch who
have numerous Families, and tended by
Youth, before they are fit to be put abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49087:92"/>
And as for Maid-Servants, let them be
reſtrained from Exceſs in Apparrel, and
not permitted to leave their Services with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Conſent, nor be entertained by others
without Teſtimonials; this will make
them more orderly and governable than
now they are.</p>
            <p>No Servant ſhould be permitted to
wear a Sword, except when Travelling;
and if all People of mean Qualities were
prohibited the ſame 'twould be of good
conſequence, for when once they come to
this, they think themſelves above Labour.</p>
            <p>'Twould likewiſe be of great uſe to
the Nation if Maſters of Ships were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to carry with them ſome Land-men
every Voyage, which would much increaſe
our Seamen, therefore the Juſtices ſhould
have power to force them to enter ſuch as
were willing, and to ſettle the Rates of their
Wages; I mean by Land-men thoſe who
have not been above three Voyages at Sea.</p>
            <p>Young People ſhould be prohibited
from Hawking about the Streets, and from
ſelling Ballads; if theſe things muſt be
allowed they are fitter for the Aged.</p>
            <p>Stage-Plays, Lotteries, and Gaming,
ſhould be more ſtrictly look'd after, Youth
in this Age of Idleneſs and Luxury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only drawn aſide by them, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49087:92"/>
more willing to put themſelves on ſuch
eaſie ways of living than Labour.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Methods being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Wiſdom of a Parliament
may tend not only to the introducing a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of Vertue amongſt us, but alſo to the
making Multitudes of People ſerviceable
who are now uſeleſs to the Nation, there
being ſcarce any one who is not capable
of doing ſomething towards his Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and what his Labour doth fall
ſhort muſt be made up by Charity, but
as things now are, no Man knows where
'tis rightly placed, by which means thoſe
who are truly Objects do not partake
thereof; And let it be alſo conſidered,
that if every Perſon did by his Labour
get one Half Penny <hi>per diem</hi> to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
'twould bring in Six Millions Eighty
Three Thouſand Three Hundred Thirty
Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight
Pence <hi>per Annum,</hi> (accounting Eight Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of People to be in the Kingdom)
which would pay the Charge of the War,
ſo vaſt a Summ may be raiſed from the
Labours of a Multitude, if every one paid
a little.</p>
            <p>Nor is the ſending lazy People to our
Plantations abroad (who can neither by
good Laws be forced, or by Rewards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49087:93"/>
to work at Home) ſo Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Nation as ſome do dream,
they ſtill ſerve it in one of its Limbs, where
they muſt expect another ſort of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if they will not labour; 'tis true
they give no help to the Manufactures
here, but that is made up in the Product
they raiſe there, which is alſo Profit to
the Nation; beſides, the Humours and
other Circumſtances of People are to be
inquired into, ſome have been very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
there, who would never have been ſo
here, and if the People of <hi>England</hi> are
imployed to the advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
no matter in what part of the
King's Dominions it is; many Hundreds
by going to thoſe Plantations have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
profitable Members to the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi>
who had they continued here had
ſtill remained idle Drones; now they raiſe
Sugar, Cotten, Tobacco, and other things,
which imploy Saylors abroad, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers
at Home, all which being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Earth and Labour I take to be
the Wealth of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Imployment of Watermen on the
<hi>River Thames</hi> breeds many Saylors, and
it were good to keep them ſtill fill'd with
Apprentices; alſo the Imployment of Barge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Lighter-men, and Trow-men, both
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49087:93"/>
on that and other Rivers does the ſame, who
ſhould be encouraged to breed up Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and fit them for the Sea.</p>
            <p>Confining the Importation of Sugars
from the Plantations to <hi>Muſcovadoes</hi> would
give Life to our Refining Houſes at Home,
ſo would prohibiting (as much as may be)
the Shipping thither things unwrought
give Encouragement to our Manufactures,
both which would imploy the Poor.</p>
            <p>Idleneſs is the Foundation of all thoſe
Vices which prevail amongſt us, People
aiming to be maintained any way rather
than by Labour betake themſelves to all
ſorts of Villanies, the ill Conſequences
whereof cannot be prevented but by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Youth in an early Delight of
Living by Induſtry, which would keep up
a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit in them, and create a
Deſire to ſecure a Property in what they
have; whereas a ſloathful Dependance
on another's Bounty makes Men ſlaviſhly
give up all at the Will of their Benefactors,
and having no Properties of their own to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
are eaſily perſwaded to part with
their Liberties; this a former Reign knew
well, when the Miniſters of that Court
found an Inclination in the People to ſell
their Priviledges for Luxury and eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:49087:94"/>
And certainly nothing hath ſo much
ſupported the Rights and Priviledges of
the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as making ſo
many of them Free-holders, whereby they
are encouraged to make Improvements
where they have Properties, and to defend
them when made, Eſtates raiſed by their
own Induſtry and Labours; which likewiſe
ſtirrs up Tenants to endeavour by the ſame
means to attain the ſame ends; a Spirit
great where-ever it is, tho in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Peaſants, when they rather deſire to
live of their own than by Dependance
on others; this puts them on honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
theſe get them Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which gives Opportunities of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
their Fortunes, and if this Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
went through the Kingdom we ſhould
not have ſo many lazy Beggars or Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Livers as now there are; nor is God
more honoured among any than He is among
theſe induſtrious People, who abhor Vice
on equal Principles of Religion and good
Husbandry, Labour being uſually a Barrier
againſt Sin, which doth generally come in
at the Doors of Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49087:94"/>
The third Conſideration is what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
may be uſed to provide for thoſe who
either are not able to work, or whoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
cannot ſupport their Charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here I
take Alms-Houſes to be good Gifts, where
they are deſigned to relieve Impotent
old Age, or educate Youth; not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
idle Beggars, or eaſe rich Pariſhes,
but to provide for thoſe who have been
bred up in careful Imployments, though
notable to ſtem the Current of a croſs
Fortune;<note place="margin">Mr Edw. Col<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, near Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll.</note> Such a one is magnificently built,
and ſuitably endowed by a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
near a great City, for which he deſerves
to be truly honoured, though perhaps he
may ſcarce be imitated.</p>
            <p>Another way to provide for thoſe who
are true Objects of Charity is by taking
care that the Poor's Rates be made with
more equality in Cities and Trading Towns
than now they are, eſpecially in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
where the greateſt number of Poor
uſually reſiding together in the Suburbs
or Out-Pariſhes are very ſerviceable by
their Labours to the Rich in carrying on
their Trades, yet when Age Sickneſs
or a numerous Family makes them deſire
Relief, their chief Dependance muſt be
on People but one ſtep above their own
Conditions, by which means thoſe Out-Pariſhes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49087:95"/>
are more burthened in their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than the In-Pariſhes are, tho' much
Richer, and is one reaſon why they are
ſo ill inhabited, no one careing to come
to a certain Charge; And this is attended
with another ill Conſequence, the want
of better Inhabitants makes way for thoſe
Diſorders which eaſily grow among the
Poor; whereas if Cities and Towns were
made but one Poor's Rate, or equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into more, theſe Inconveniencies
might be removed, and the Poor main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by a more impartial Contribution.</p>
            <p>And that a better Proviſion may be made
for the Relief of Saylors, (who having ſpent
their Labours in the Service of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and through Age or Diſaſters no longer
fit for the fatique of the Sea, ought to be
taken care for at home,) let a ſmall Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be made from Seamen's Wages, and
Freights of Ships, to be collected by a
Society of honeſt Men in every Sea Port;
This, with what addition might be made
by the Gifts of worthy Benefactors, would
be ſufficient to raiſe a Fund capable to
maintain them in their old Age, who in
their Youth were our Walls and Bulwarks;
but it muſt be ſetled by Law, and no Man
left at his Liberty whither he will pay or no;
Theſe are generally the moſt Laborious
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49087:95"/>
People we have, I do not mean thoſe
Scoundrel Raſcals who often creep in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, but the true old Saylor, who
can turn his Hand to any thing rather than
Begging, and I am troubled to ſee the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conditions they and their Families are
many times reduced to when their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are done; Alms-Houſes raiſed for
them are as great Acts of Piety as build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Churches; Age requires Relief,
eſpecially where Youth hath been ſpent
in Labour ſo profitable to the Publique as
that of a Saylor, and not only themſelves,
but their Widows and young Children
ought to be provided for; In this the
Worſhipful Society of the Merchants Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
within the City of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> are a
Worthy Pattern.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe who loſe their Lives or
Limbsfighting againſt the <hi>Enemy,</hi> themſelves
or Families ought to be rewarded with a
bountiful Stipend, which if raiſed by a Tax
would be chearfully paid; 'tis attended with
ſad Thoughts when a Woman ſees her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
preſt into the Service, and knows if
he miſcarrys her Family is undone, and
ſhe and they muſt come on the Pariſh;
whereas if this Provition were made, the
Fleet would be more eaſily mann'd, our
Merchant-Ships better defended, Saylors
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49087:96"/>
more ready to ſerve in both, and their
Wives to let them go; but great care
muſt be taken that this Charity of the
Nation be not abuſed, nor put into the
Pockets of thoſe appointed to diſpoſe of it,
Confiſcation of their Eſtates ſhould be
made a Penalty to detert them from ſuch
ill Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Taxes to carry on the War.</note> We will next conſider the State of the Nation with regard to its Taxes.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the neceſſity of the
War we are now engaged in, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of its Event, (the Liberties of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Security of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Religion depending on the Succeſs
thereof) I think it the Duty of every good
Subject to offer his advice in a matter of
this Importance.</p>
            <p>Money we know to be the Sinews of
War, it is that which doth ſtrengthen
the carrying it on, and I believe there
are few Men who do not by this time ſee,
that not the longeſt Sword but the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.
Purſe is moſt likely to come off Victor;
we are too far engaged to look back, and
if we do not go on with Vigour it will
encourage our Enemy, and make him think
better of his own Strength; we cannot
preſerve at too high a Rate thoſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Jewels of Liberty and Property,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49087:96"/>
which (if we miſcarry in this War) we are
very likely to loſe; therefore how unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſoever Taxes may ſeem, Money muſt be
raiſed, till the <hi>French</hi> King can be brought
to ſuch Terms whereon a ſafe and laſting
Peace may be concluded; but great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ought to be uſed in the Methods of
raiſing it, leſt the People be thereby
diſguſted againſt that happy part of our
Conſtitution, Parliaments, when they ſee
their only work is to find out new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for raiſing Taxes; to whom every
ſuch Act ſeems a new Arrow levied at
them, by theſe it is they are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and think themſelves ſhot thro'
and thro', becauſe that under different
names they hit the ſame Perſons again

for many Years; ſo that for the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49087:97"/>
future new Projects muſt be thought on,
and what this will at laſt tend to no Man
can foreſee.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think moſt Men would agree
with me in this, that if a Method could be
found out whereby Four or Five Millions
might be raiſed Yearly with little Charge
and great Eaſe and Equality it muſt be
much better than now it is, and this to be
a Fund out of which the Parliament to
appropriate what Summs they ſee neceſſary
for every uſe, ſo that then they would
have Leiſure to ſpend much of their time
on other Affairs, which is now wholly
taken up about Ways and Means; beſides,
when the People knew there was no new Tax
to be raiſed, they would more chearfully
look upon the opening of a Seſſions; and
the <hi>French</hi> King muſt be exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
when he ſhall ſee that after ſo
great Expences we come on with new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and have provided a Fund for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the War till he can be brought to
ſuch Terms as will eſtabliſh a ſafe and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peace, which by the Means hitherto
uſed we cannot expect, every Tax we
have given being like the Gaſps of a
Man labouring for Life, whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
we could not ſubſiſt a Year longer,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49087:97"/>
and doubtleſs his Emiſſaries in <hi>England</hi>
have not failed to repreſent things to him
in their worſt Colours; but I hope both
He and They will find that the People
of <hi>England,</hi> to defend their Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and Properties, neither want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
nor a Will to give it.</p>
            <p>The Taxes of this Kingdom are chiefly
to be raiſed on Land or Trade, the firſt
muſt be eaſed, and what is laid on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
muſt be done with great Caution and
Conſideration, things muſt be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Principles whereon we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
muſt be ſure and ſolid, and then a
thinking Man may improve them by well-digeſted
Notions; Trade like the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
will ſtoop to take up its Burthen, but
the weight thereof muſt not be greater
than it can chearfully riſe under, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we deſtroy it, and ſhall by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
Covetouſneſs loſe thoſe Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Eggs it every day would bring us.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be conſider'd in the
laying a Tax is, that the Poor bear little
or none of the Burthen, their Province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more properly to labour and fight than
pay; He that gets his Money by the
Sweat of his Bt ows parts not from it
without much Remorſe and Diſcontent,
and when all is done, 'tis but a little they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49087:98"/>
pay, therefore Taxes that light heavy on
them (ſuch as Chimney-Money, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
a Poll) tend rather to unhinge
than aſſiſt the Government, by diſguſting
ſuch a number of robuſt and hardy Men
as carry a great perſonal Ballance in the
Kingdom, and may be apt when they
think themſelves oppreſt to joyn with
any for a preſent Relief, not being well
able to foreſee the Conſequences of things
at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>Great Care ſhould alſo be taken of our
Manufactures and Manufacturers, that
they be not oppreſt.</p>
            <p>A general Exciſe cannot do well, for
beſides the great Charge and Oppreſſion
of Officers, it ſhews no Reſpect to the Poor,
but they pay more than the Wealthieſt of
their Neighbours ſuitable to what they
have; for though a rich Man ſpends more
in exciſable things than a poor Man doth,
yet it is not his All, whereas the other's
Poverty gives him leave to lay up no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but 'tis as much as he can do to
provide Neceſſaries for his Family, out
of all which he pays his Proportion.</p>
            <p>Much like this is a general Poll, where
'tis very difficult to tax People equally.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:49087:98"/>
But out of all theſe ſomething may
be taken which may be both eaſie and
practicable, and a Project may be fram'd
which may raiſe annually enough to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the Charge of the War, on equal
and eaſie Terms, with little or no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.</p>
            <p>In the well laying whereof theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Rules ſeem fit to be conſidered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That what is laid on Trade be ſo
weighed, that where the Trader pays he
may ſee an apparent Advantage.</item>
               <item>2. That the charge of Collecting be
on ſuch eaſie Terms as not to eat up a great

Acts which may be raiſed by One.</item>
               <item>6. That the Conſequence of a Tax be,
either to remove a Publique Grieviance, or to
make it pay towards the Charge of the War.</item>
               <item>7. That it be chiefly laid on thoſe who
have hitherto leaſt felt former Taxes,
have leaſt ſuffer'd by the War, and whoſe
Imployments tend more to their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Advantages than the Support of the
Government.</item>

by it, whither they live in <hi>England</hi> or

            <p>But after all is done, when Money is
raiſed with Eaſe and Equality to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
yet if great Care be not taken to ſee
it well laid out, 'twill fall ſhort of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end deſigned; good Methods are
as neceſſary in this as the former, and
the Nation will be more willing to give
chearfully, when it ſhall ſee the Publick
Treaſure managed to Advantage; 'twill
be no difficult Task to make its Credit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with private Merchants, and its Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
paſs as far, this will be done when
its Payments are as punctual; but then
things muſt not be begun in the middle,
but at the right end; we quarrel in vain
with a Collonel for not paying an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds to his Regiment, when
perhaps he receives but Seventy to do it
with; nor can the Captains pay their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to the full, when the Money grows
leſs in every Hand through which it paſſes;
Labour is ſpent to no purpoſe about the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49087:99"/>
Conduit Pipes, when the Water ſtops in
the Spring; Errors in the Foundation are
moſt fatal; when things are ſet right at
the Fountain Head, then 'twill be time to
enquire into the defects of the ſeveral
Currents; Payments punctually made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to agreement would encourage all
Men to ſell their Commodities cheap,
and put an end to the Abuſes of Agents,
Cloathiers of the Army, and Ticket-Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who do now prey on the Publick; the
King would then have his Money well
laid out, and thoſe who ſerve him be paid
without dilatory and chargeable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances;
and when the Nation comes to
be ſatisfied that what Money is raiſed for
carrying on the War is juſtly applyed to
its uſe, and managed with good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
the Parliament will give more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and the People pay more chearfully;
this will render his Majeſty the Terror of
his Enemies, and the delight of his Friends,
who will then ſtrive to outdo each other in
their forwardneſs to ſerve him with their
Lives and Fortunes; eſpecially when they
ſhall ſee that due Care is alſo taken to
ſecure their Trade, which muſt enable
them to pay their Taxes.</p>
