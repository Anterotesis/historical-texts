            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, his prayer to God to keep him in his way, his going, <hi>and his footſteps from ſliding,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40440:6"/>Thirdly, he prayes for deliverance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>ſhew thy marveillous loving kindneſſe to me O Lord</hi>; my ſtraights they are marveillous, I know not what to do, nor whether to turn me, but my eyes are towards thee, as my ſtraights are <hi>marveillous,</hi> ſo let thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be <hi>marveillous</hi> towards me, <hi>and keep me as the apple of thy eye, O Lord,</hi> I am but as a dog, a vile creature in the eyes of Saul, and thoſe about him, but bleſſed be thy name, I can look up to thee, and know that I am dear unto thee, as <hi>the apple of thy eye</hi>; all the Saints of God are dear to God, at all times, but the perſecuted Saints, they are <hi>the apple</hi> of Gods <hi>eye</hi>; if at any time they are dear to God, <hi>then</hi> eſpecially when they are moſt perſecuted, they are the apple of his eye, and the <hi>apple of an eye</hi> you know is weak, and little able to reſiſt any hurt, which makes men the more tender of it; the more weak and ſhiftleſſe Gods people are for themſelves, the Lord is ſo much the more tender over them.</p>
            <p>And one argument that the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40440:7"/>
uſeth in praying againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is this, and a ſpeciall one, becauſe they proſpered ſo much in <hi>this world,</hi> they <hi>are incloſed in fat,</hi> and have their hearts deſire, and <hi>thou filleſt their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with thy hid treaſure,</hi> they leave to their babes, <hi>they have their portion in this life</hi>; Lord keep me from them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly he doth profeſſe his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>yet</hi> notwithſtanding all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he was in, to go on in the wayes of God, and expects a gratious iſſue, but <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will behold,</hi> thy <hi>face in righteouſneſſe</hi>; indeed I cannot behold the face of the King without danger, there are a great many that run to kill me, and I deſire <hi>his face,</hi> but though I cannot ſee his face, yet Lord I ſhall behold <hi>thy face,</hi> I will behold thy face, and it ſhall be <hi>in righteouſneſse,</hi> I will ſtill keep on in the wayes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>and when I awake,</hi> for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe troubles will not hold long: I ſhall not ſleep a perpetuall ſleep, but I ſhall be delivered, <hi>and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with thy likeneſſe,</hi> there ſhall be the manifeſtation of thy glory to me,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40440:7"/>
that ſhall ſatisfy me for all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that I have endured for thy names ſake, that my ſoul ſhall ſay, <hi>I have enough</hi>; this is the ſumme of this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Now the words read unto you, are a deſcription of Davids adverſaries, implying an argument, why he would be delivered from them; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be <hi>men</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> they were onely thoſe that were adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to him; and a comfort it muſt needs be to the Saints of God, to ſee that none are their enemies, but <hi>wordly</hi> perſons, men of <hi>this</hi> world, who have their portion in <hi>this</hi> life; they have ſomewhat <hi>here,</hi> and <hi>here</hi> is all they are like to have.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it implies the argument, why he would be delivered; <hi>Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from them,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>men of this world,</hi> who <hi>have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life</hi>; where lies the force of this argument, that he would be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>livered from them becauſe they were men of this world, that have their portion in this life; It conſiſts firſt in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40440:8"/>
this, Lord, they care not what inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice they do, they have no regard of any thing but in this world, therefore be it right or wrong, may they have but their luſts in this world, that is all they care for; Lord deliver me from ſuch men; Secondly, here is all their good, their portion is <hi>in this life,</hi> and therefore they are greedy upon this, &amp; if they may have this, let it be with the ruine of never ſo many men, though it be to raiſe their eſtates by my ruine, and the ruines of others, that are never ſo innocent, what care they they are greedy upon having their luſts ſatisfied, for here is all their portion; they care not for religion, they will make uſe of pretences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion any way for their own ends; what care they what pretences they make for religion, ſo they may thrive in the world they regard not anything in religion, ſo they may have their own ends; Lord, deliver me from ſuch men; Thirdly, they have their portion in this world, hence is it that their hearts are ſo ſwelled with pride in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40440:8"/>
their luſts, and ſo warm, their malice is ſo heated that it is outragious; <hi>O let not the foot of pride come upon me</hi>; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from proud men that fluſht with the enjoyment of their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; As long as they may have their own ends, and fulfill their luſts, they will be exceedingly hardened in their own wayes, they will give no glory to thee, but will be ſo much the more enraged againſt thy people, by taking that as an argument that their wayes are good, <hi>Lord,</hi> therefore <hi>deliver me from thoſe men</hi>; they ſcorne at <hi>prayer,</hi> or any thing that is ſaid, concerning the tenderneſſe of <hi>Conſcience</hi>; they deſpiſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi>; Lord, let me never fall into the hands of ſuch; <hi>deliver me from the men of this world, who have their portion in this life</hi>;<note place="margin">The words opened.</note> from the men of the world, that is <hi>from mortall men,</hi> from men though <hi>of the world,</hi> yet are not like to enjoy the world long, ſo ſome tranſlate it, <note place="margin">89. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.</note>
               <hi>Remember how ſhort my time is,</hi> ſaith David <hi>how ſhort,</hi> what little time I have in this world, the men of this

read of one, being a Monk was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to come into an Epiſcopall ſeat, and being a lewd wicked man, he began to be proud of his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon hee heard a voice uttering theſe words, <hi>cur ſuperbus O infelix,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>why art thou ſo proud,</hi> O unhappy man, <hi>thou art not advanced, becauſe thou art worthy of this honour,</hi> but becauſe this City is ſo ill, that it deſerves ſuch a Prelate to be over it, in way of judgement to that place. God advances ſome man out of wayes of heavy judgements unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, God gives them ſuch a portion not out of love to them, though they are ready to gather the argument, but out of his diſpleaſure unto others; and then, he gives a plentifull portion to many, to teach us all to do good unto our enemies, not onely <hi>humanitati</hi> as they ſay, but <hi>homini</hi> not onely to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, but to men, to men that are wicked, ſome good muſt be done unto them.</p>
            <p>And beſides the Lord would ſhew hereby, that he would have no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of love or hatred to be drawn from theſe outward things; and indeed becauſe he would not have them to expect any more; it may be many men that are ungodly, proſpering in this world, they gather this argument, that therefore God loves them, &amp; intends mercy to them; no, you may rather gather an argument quite t'other way becauſe God intendeth no further good unto you hereafter, therefore it is, you have ſo much now; we uſe to anſwer men that come for their doal, when they come twice, why do you come again, you have had your doal already; ſo will God anſwer to many men, when they ſhall cry to him for mercy at that day, why come you to me for more, you have had your doal already; have you not had already more then your works comes to, more then you have done; you have had your part and portion already; indeed men ſpeak much of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the mercy of God we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be very great, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; well, God doth ſhew himſelf

glorious in mercy that thou being ſo wicked haſt ſo much as thou haſt in this world; and therefore though thou ſhouldſt be denyed of eternall mercy hereafter, yet thou haſt cauſe to tell divels and damned creatures that ſhall be thy company, that God was very mercifull to thee, while thou diddeſt live in this world.</p>

            <p>You know thoſe in the vineyard, that agreed for their penny, they began to murmure indeed, when they came to receive their wages; but ſaith the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of the vineyard, did you not agree with me ſo? ſo you agree with God; all you intend in Gods ſervice is, that you may have ſome preſent comfort in this world, you dare not truſt God for the future, and here is that that God will ſhew his infinite diſpleaſure againſt the ſin of diſtruſt by, that when the Lord propounds now in this day of grace, ſuch glorious and bleſſed things to the children of men, and for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40440:21"/>
ought you know, any of you may have your portion in them, as well as others, &amp; yet you dare not truſt God for theſe gratious things; you think rather with your ſelves, let me have ſomewhat now, ſomewhat for the preſent, that for the preſent is reall, that which you talk off, is to come, &amp; I know not whether they be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or no; Therefore you mean it ſeems to ſerve God for your preſent pay, &amp; preſent pay you ſhall have &amp; no more; there are ſome ſervants that are your day labourers, that expect their pay at night, and if you give them that there is an end, but there are other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that will ſerve you in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a reverſion, &amp; expectation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, eſpecially when they ſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men &amp; Princes, though they have no preſent pay given them at night, yet they go on cheerfully in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they expect ſome great reverſions and leaſes, &amp; preferments afterwards; &amp; now though they have nothing at preſent, yet when the other befalls them, they and their poſterities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40440:22"/>
this is the direct difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the men of the world &amp; Gods children; the men of the world will do nothing without preſent pay, that which is juſt before them they muſt needs have, their hearts are upon that; but the Saints they hear what a bleſſed thing God hath revealed in his word, what a bleſſed Covenant of grace there is, what rich promiſes of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things to come, now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God, and truſt in God for theſe, and they ſay, Lord let me have my portion in the life to come, and what ever thou doeſt with me here, I care not; as it was the ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Lord, here burn, here cut mee, but ſpare mee hereafter; I am content (Lord) to be burnt, to be cut, to endure any thing in the world, onely hereafter I look for ſomewhat elſe, and i'le wait for hereafter.</p>
            <p>You'le not wait for hereafter, but you muſt have it for the preſent, and that is the reaſon you are put off here; O it is a ſerious thing, I ſpeak off to you, many a ſoul will wring its hands,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40440:22"/>
and curſe it ſelf eternally, that it was not content to truſt God for hereafter, but would have preſent pay; you that are great Merchants, if you buy a thing that is but a trifle, you pull out your purſe, and give the mony down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but ſuppoſe you go to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and bargain for 1000 l. there you may give a little down now, but the great pay muſt come upon pay dayes afterwards, it is not expected it ſhould be preſently done; ſo there are ſome men in the world will trade with God, but they trade with God for pidling things, for their credit, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and for their preferments and eſtates: God gives down the pay pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, you ſhall have it, there is your mony preſently, it is done; but now there are other of Gods Saints that trade with God for great things, for immortality and glory, &amp; a Kingdom, and the Crown of eternall life, now they expect not to have it down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they are content to ſtay; O theſe are the beſt Traders, the beſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that will trade with God for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40440:23"/>
great things, and be content to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Further theſe things that are here, they are the onely ſuitable things to your hearts, and what will you do with any more hereafter, theſe things doe exceedingly pleaſe you, and give you content as agreable to you, and the things that are to come, are diſagrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; what would men do that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and wicked now, what would they do in heaven, certainly if you hate Gods Saints now, that have but a little grace, you would hate them infinitely more afterwards, when they are perfect in grace; &amp; when all your common gifts ſhall be taken away, for ſo it ſhall be; now the things of God are unſuitable to you, though you have now many common gifts, and you now abhorre the grace of God, though it be imperfect, what then, when all common gifts ſhall be taken from you, and grace made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, how inſuitable will it be then to you; therefore expect nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:40440:23"/>Again 5. You abuſe your portion you have <hi>now,</hi> what will you do with more, who will truſt you with the true riches, you abuſe that you have; indeed men of the world that are wicked, and very rich, and preferr'd to places of honour and power, O what a deal of miſchief they do in the world, what dreadfull evills are they unto the earth; ſuch men, how do they abuſe their portions; why now as it is with a tooth in a mans head, a tooth indeed is preferr'd to have an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place in the head, but when the tooth comes to be rotten, painfull, what do we, but pull it out, and throw it away: ſo though God preferres men to eminent places, when through their wickedneſſe they grow rotten, and do hurt, the Lord pluckes them out in his anger; they abuſe their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do a great deal of miſchief, therefore muſt expect to be thrown away.</p>
            <p>But above all, the argument is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no intereſt in Ieſus Chriſt; the rich treaſures of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40440:24"/>
grace of God, are let out in Chriſt; God hath divers conduit pipes, (as I may ſay) of his grace, to let out unto his creatures; there are ſome leſſer conduit pipes, and thoſe conduit pipes may be opened through the generall bounty of God; but now the Lord hath the great current of his eternall mercies, for ſome that he doth intend eternall good unto, and this great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his, it is ſtopped by juſtice, the infinite juſtice of God doth ſtop this great current, ſo as it cannot be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have any drop of that mercy let out, untill the divine juſtice comes to be ſatisfied; in the mean time the other ſmaller pipes run, the generall bounty of God ſtill flowes; Chriſt therefore out of pitty to mankind that they may not be put off, with theſe generall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, he comes and ſatisfies Gods infinite juſtice, that he might open the current, the ſluce of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite &amp; eternall grace to others; now happy are thoſe creatures, who have intereſt in the Lord Chriſt, for this is his work to ſatisfy the juſtice of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40440:24"/>
Father, that ſo the great pipe may be opened, and then flowes in all grace, infinite eternall grace, when that comes once to be opened, no mervail though we hear of ſuch glorious things, that the Saints of God have in the life to come, no mervaile, why Chriſt doth come and opens the great ſluce of Gods infinite grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them; as for the men of the world, they have but a little of the driſlings of Gods generall bountie through ſome crannies, but the floud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of Gods grace are opened in Chriſt: therefore till divine juſtice be ſatisfied, there can be no further good for poor man, but meerely the fruits of Gods generall bountie, and patience.</p>
            <p>There are ſome creatures, whom the Lord hath left to the courſe of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, they ſhall have what they earne, and no more; others there are, whom God hath ſet his heart upon, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they earn or no, God intendeth eternal mercies to them, here is the difference of the Covenant of works,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40440:25"/>
and the Covenant of grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one is left to himſelf: and the other, Chriſt the head of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant comes to undertake for him what he cannot do; they who are not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and muſt not expect childrens portions, as many of you rich men, when you die, you will leave your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſome legacy; perhaps you'le give every ſervant in your houſe 5. l. or ſo, but when you come to your children, to write in your will, what ſuch a ſon, and ſuch a daughter ſhall have, that is another manner of buſineſſe, then 40 ſ. or 5. l. Great things you leave to them.</p>
            <p>So the world may be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween children and ſervants, for though the truth is, all men are at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with God, yet God maketh them ſervants one way or other, and there is ſome little legacy that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall have but they muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the childrens portion; therefore they have it here, but muſt not have it hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaith the Lord, if the Prince
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40440:25"/>
give a gift unto any of his ſons, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſhall be his ſons, but if to his ſervant, then it ſhall be but till <hi>Iubilee</hi>; this was Gods law, that if a Prince gave a gift to his ſon, his ſon ſhould inherit it for ever, but if he give it to a ſeruant; it ſhould continue with him but for a while; Here is the difference of Gods adminiſtration of all his gifts, he giveth ſome to ſervants, and theſe ſhall continue for a time, with in a little while all will be called for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, all the good and all the comfort thou haſt, God will call for it again; but now that which he gives to his children, they ſhall have for ever, their pleaſures are durable and their mercies everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Again the portion that the world hath here comes from Gods patience, now there will be an end of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the glory of patience in this world; as there are ſome graces of the Spirit of God in the Saints, that ſhall have an end in regard of their exerciſe in this world, ſo there are ſome attributes of God that ſhall have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40440:26"/>
an end in regard of the manifeſtation of them in that way that God doth now manifeſt them in this life, and that is the patience of God towards ungodly ones, now if they hold all upon patience (mark, they hold all upon patience) when that expires, then all their good is at an end.</p>
            <p>And ungodly men, ſhall have to deal with God immediately in the world to come (I beſeech you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but this anſwer) now they have to deal with God through creatures, and while they have to deal with God through creatures, they may get a great deal, &amp; may make ſhift for much, but when they ſhall come to have to deal with God immediately, then it will be otherwiſe with them, as for example, there are a great many hang-byes at great mens houſes, perhaps when they come to have to deal with the ſervants, they get ſome bits and ſcraps, and many things of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but if they know they can have nothing, but from the very hand of the Knight or Lord of the houſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40440:26"/>
then they will expect no great matter; ſo wicked men in this world, they are as hang-byes and all that they have, are but as ſcraps from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they have to deal onely with creatures, they look no further; But hereafter things ſhall be ſetled ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and all things ſhall be weighed by God himſelf, in a ballance of juſtice, &amp; diſtributed by the hands of God himſelf immediately, and then things will be carried after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, the Lord himſelf will come to diſpoſe of things.</p>
            <p>Then it was a ſpeech of a <hi>German Divine,</hi> though he were a good man, and lived very innocently, when he lay upon his ſick bed and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, he was in great terrours of ſpirit, mightily troubled, and ſome of his friends came to him, &amp; asked him, why ſhould you be ſo troubled, that have lived ſo good a life as you have done? this was his anſwer: <hi>The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God</hi> are one, <hi>and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men</hi> are another, <hi>I have now to deal with God,</hi> it is true, I lived thus
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40440:27"/>
before men, and men gave their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of me as good, and thought I was in a good condition, but O, <hi>I am now to go to God, and to deal immediately with him,</hi> and Gods judgements and mans judgements are different things; when God ſhall come to weigh all mens portions out, as it will be, then ſo much righteouſneſſe, ſo much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; you'l ſay then, Lord what ſhall become of us all, all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is as the menſtruous cloth; I but for the Saints, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt will be put into one ſcoale, and their portion into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their portion will be weigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; <hi>Now</hi> when thou comeſt to God, thou muſt come to the ſcoale, and thou wilt put in thy good ſervings of God, and thy coming to Church, and ſome good civill actions and morall things thou haſt done, thou wilt put them in the ſcoale, God will ſay, that thou haſt had already, weighs down all thoſe. Haſt thou nothing to put into the ſcoales but this? thou haſt had thy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40440:27"/>
reward already for all this, and much more, then, if there be nothing to put into the ſcoale but this, thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and there is nothing for thee for eternity; and theſe are the 2. firſt things; now then ſome Corollaries from hence, and then we will proceed unto the other.</p>

            <p>God knows they would have been willing, to have been as ſilent as you, but ſuppoſe all the Miniſters of the Kingdom, and men that had ability to appear publickly, had all been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo as the buſineſſe had been wholly betrayed, and at length an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Papiſts had riſen, when you had

            <p>It is true they that are godly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves unworthy of the leaſt thing they have here in the world; but i'le tell you a miſtery of religion now, a practicall maxime of religion, that is a great miſtery to the world, which is this, that a gracious heart, though he thinks himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the leaſt crum of bread, yet all the creatures in heaven and earth, will not ſerve him to be his portion, will not ſatisfy him; though he hath a heart that will be ſatisfied with any thing, as counting himſelf unworthy of the meaneſt condition in this world, as a preſent gift of God; but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40440:40"/>
if God ſhould give him heaven and earth, he had ſuch an unſatisfying heart, as he would not be ſatisfied with heaven and earth, except God gives him himſelf too; therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thy portion, it is a but a very little portion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Beſides thoſe things thou haſt, are things that will vaniſh, and quickly come to nothing; it is ſaid of the whole world, that it hangs upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;<note place="margin">26. <hi>Iob</hi> 7.</note> ſo all the things of the earth do: therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſought a City, that had <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi>;<note place="margin">10. <hi>Hebr.</hi>
               </note> all other things, are as things that have no <hi>foundation at all</hi>; there is a worm in every creature that will conſume it in time; and the Scripture calls all our riches <hi>uncertain riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtian, thou art made for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condition; theſe things are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; when thou comeſt to enter in upon thy eternall eſtate, if thou ſhouldſt then ask, what ſhall I have now, I have now thus much, and thus much in my whole life; but what ſhall I have now I come to enter in upon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40440:40"/>
my eternall eſtate? truly nothing at all. If a man were to go a great voyage to the Indies, and all the proviſion he makes is this, he gets a veſſell that can make ſhift to carry him as far as Graveſend, that he will do, and what need he hath of proviſion to Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, or perhaps to the Downs he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for, he goes on, &amp; ſhould go on now from the Downs, and begins his voyage, to go to the Indies, and is gotten into the Ocean; alas, his veſſell is a rotten veſſell; were not this an unwiſe man? truly this is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thouſands in the world; man, woman, thou art made for an eternall condition, God intendeth eternity for every mothers child that is here this day, and God expects that thy life ſhould be ſpent in making proviſion for this eternall eſtate of thine, and thou thinkeſt of nothing, but that thou mayſt provide for a few years here, &amp; live in ſome faſhion, and be ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world. O when thou comeſt to enter upon the Ocean of eternitie, thou wilt give a dreadfull ſhrik, &amp; cry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40440:41"/>
out, I am undone, I am undone, I have nothing provided, for eternall life.</p>
            <p>Again conſider whatever thou haſt in this world, it is no other, but what may ſtand with the eternall hatred of an infinite God towards thee: it may be the portion of a reprobate, and will this ſerve thy turn? will this ſatisfie thee? will that ſatisfie thy ſoul, that may be the portion of a reprobate? there are many that are now ſweltring under the wrath of the infinite God, that have had 20. times as much as any of you have that are here before the Lord this day, they have had greater eſtates then you, and lived merrier lives then you, &amp; yet are now under the wrath of God, will a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates portion ſerve thy turn: therefore conſider that to enjoy the dominion of all the world, may ſtand with Gods eternall hatred, but to have the leaſt dram of ſaving grace, intitles men to the favour of God which is better then life. What a difference is there then, between the having the leaſt dram of grace, and the enjoyment of all the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40440:41"/>
world, and what a goodly portion is there here that thou ſo much rejoyceſt in? certainly, thy heart is ſtrait, that thou thinkeſt theſe things to be ſo big, as in a narrow veſſel a thing will appear big, but in a mighty wide veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell it appears little; ſo when the Lord by grace ſhall widen and enlarge thy heart, then all the things of the world will be little to thee.</p>
            <p>Indeed if a man be below here, he looks upon that, which is next to him, that hath any bigneſſe in it, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what great, but if a man were advanced on high, on the top of a pinnacle, then that which ſeemed great appears but little to him; ſo the men of the world that are here, lie graveling below, and the curſe of the ſerpent is upon them, and they think the things of the world great matters, but grace lifteth up the heart on high to God and Chriſt, mounts it up to eternity, and then we look upon all things here below as mean, this was the reaſon that <hi>Luther,</hi> when he had great gifts ſent to him by many of the great men of <hi>Saxonie,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40440:42"/>
he began to be afraid, leaſt the Lord ſhould reward him here in this world, and he hath this expreſſion, <note place="margin">Luther.</note>
               <hi>I did vehe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mently proteſt, God ſhould not put me off ſo</hi>; that is his word, according to the manner of his language: thus he ſpeaks, when there came in things of the world, and he began to be tickled with honour, and great men did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him, O (thought he) I ſhall be ſome body now in the world; thus corruption began to work, but grace did prevail, and he breaks out with this expreſſion, I did profeſſe, God ſhould not put me off ſo; the Lord ſhall not put me off with worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nors and dignities; there are other things I look for, things that are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and higher, theſe are poor pittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for this ſoul of mine to be put off with all, there are other things I muſt have from the Lord, or elſe I cannot be ſatisfied; that is the firſt thing, the poor things of the world, which is the portion of wicked men.</p>
            <p>Secondly conſider the tenure by which they hold it; all you have in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40440:42"/>
the world, you hold it not by very good tenure, it is not held in <hi>Capite.</hi> I confeſſe this, I think not the men of the world to be uſurpers, for what they lawfully get in the world: I think not they ſhall anſwer meerely for their uſing what they do, meerely for their right to uſe what they have; but they ſhall anſwer for their not right uſing the ſame; they ſhall not anſwer (I ſay) for their right to uſe, but for their not right uſing; they have ſome right, but what right is it.</p>
            <p>There is a 3. fold right. 1. a right of <hi>juſtice,</hi> that we may claim to a thing as a due: what is not your right, you cannot claim. 2. there is a right of <hi>Creation,</hi> that God gave to man at <hi>firſt</hi>: you have loſt that right now. 3. there is a right of <hi>promiſe</hi>; God hath promiſed all good things to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; you have not that right neither: you have neither the right of <hi>juſtice</hi> to claim, nor the right of your <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor the right of <hi>promiſe</hi>; what right then?</p>
            <p>There is a fourth right, and that I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40440:43"/>
confeſſe you have, which is a right of donation; God is pleaſed to give to you. And thus you hold all your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and eſtates, that are ungodly men; juſt thus, even as a man that is condemned to dye, and there being a little reprieving for 2. or 3. dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his execution, the Prince out of his indulgence gives order to have proviſion made for him, according to his qualitie, that if he be a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> he ſhould have ſuch proviſion, if a <hi>Knight,</hi> or a Nobleman, he ſhall have proviſion according to his qualitie, till his execution; now no man can ſay, this man uſurpes, though he hath forfeited all his right to his lands and eſtates, yet if the King will give him this refreſhment, he is no uſurper, but it is a poor right he hath, it is a right of donation; and thus God gives the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men in this world their right to outward comforts; you have your portion, but you ſee how you hold it.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is, that this portion here, as it is poor
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40440:43"/>
in regard of the mean things, and the Tenure; ſo there is a great deal of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there in, and the truth is, all the good things wicked men enjoy in this world, will ſcarce bear charges; that is, there is ſo much trouble they meet withall in this world, with their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what they have will ſcarce bear charges; &amp; if a man goes a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, we uſe not to count any thing he ſpends by the way, to be part of his treaſury; now all we have here in this world is but ſpending money to bear our charges in religion: God knows we ſhall be at a great deal of charges, and afflictions we ſhall meet with here; but beſides, there is a mixture of <hi>Curſe</hi> in every portion of an ungodly man; if any of you think you get ſuch a rich match, you get an heire that is a very rich match, &amp; you get her porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; if it be in money, there you go &amp; fetch away the bags of gold, that are her portion, but if it ſhould prove that every bag of gold, you have of your wives portion, had the plague in it, it were but a poor portion; certainly it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40440:44"/>
is thus with all ungodly ones in the world, that all the while they live, whatſoever they enjoy, (continuing wicked men) they have a curſe of God that goes along with it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes way unto eternall miſery for them; as thoſe that are godly have the bleſſing of God in outward things that makes way for their eternall good; ſo thou haſt the curſe of the Lord mingled with all thy outward things that makes way for eternall evill unto thee.</p>
            <p>And then conſider what portion thou looſeſt, thou haſt got one, but thou looſeſt a great deal more; if a man had been at the exchange and made a bargain about ſome petty thing, and afterwards when he comes home, knows that by not being at home, he hath loſt a purchaſe that would have made him, and his poſterity: he hath little cauſe of rejoycing in that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; ſo though thou haſt got a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may ſeem to ſatisfie thee ſomewhat, know thou haſt loſt a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infinite worth and value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40440:44"/>It is impoſſible to ſhew you, what this portion is; for the devil could ſhew Chriſt all the glory of the world in the twinckling of an eye; but if I ſhould come to ſhew you the glory of Heaven, I had need have eternity to ſhew you, what the portion of the Saints is; but though I cannot ſhew it you all, I will onely give you a hint or two, that you know ſomewhat what it is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſuch a portion as is fit for the ſpouſe of the Lamb, as is fit for the ſpouſe of one that is to marry the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; 2. it is ſuch a portion as is fit and ſuitable to an heire of life &amp; glory, an heire of Heaven and Earth; yea, it is ſuch a portion, as God doth give men, to this very end, to declare what the infinite power of God is able to do, to raiſe a poor creature to the height of happineſſe; what think you this muſt be, that (I ſay) it muſt <hi>therefore</hi> be done, that it might declare to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all creatures, what the infinite power of God is able to do, to raiſe a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40440:45"/>
poor creature to happineſſe &amp; glory; this muſt be ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>Again, it muſt be ſuch a one as in which, God muſt attain unto the great deſigne, that he had from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, in making of Heaven and Earth, which was to magnifie the riches of his grace to a Company, that he had ſet apart to glory; it muſt be ſuch a portion; and gueſſe you what this muſt needs be.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is ſuch a portion as muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the infinite power of God, to ſupport a creature to bear the weight of that glory; and all this muſt be now to all eternity; I remember when <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> did but hear <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father, tell what a bleſſing he had given unto <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> he fell a weeping; O that God would ſo ſtrike unto the hearts of men, that have ſo little minded any thing, but the world: Thou heareſt but a few words, to what the Lord hath reſerved to all eternitie, for his Saints; and compare but that with what is thy portion, and thou haſt cauſe to weep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40440:45"/>I but more cauſe you'l have to weep, if you conſider the laſt thing, and that is, what is like to be the end of all thy portion in this world; if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou could'ſt ruffle it out in this world, and enjoy thy hearts deſire, and there an end: it were ſomewhat; O, but there is ſomewhat elſe remains afterwards; as. 1. O, the perplexity of ſpirit, that any worldly man will have when death comes, when he ſhall ſee an end of all the comforts of this world, now farewell houſe, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well lands, and farewell friends, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well acquaintance, and all merry meetings, and joviallities, I ſhall never have comfort more in you; as it was the ſpeech of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> when he was to die, <hi>O thou my ſoul, my ſoul, whither art thou going? whither art thou going? thou ſhalt never have more jeſts, nor be merry, nor be jocund any more; where art thou going</hi>? ſo may a man that hath his portion in this world, ſay at his death, where is this poor ſoul of mine going? I have lived here thus many years, and I have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40440:46"/>
merry meetings, I have eaten with the ſtrongeſt, and have drunk the ſweeteſt, and gone in brave array, but now my day is gone, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, what peace have I now, when all is gone.</p>
            <p>I remember <hi>Latimer</hi> hath a ſtory in one of his Sermons, that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before King <hi>Edward,</hi> of a rich man, that when he lay upon his ſick bed, there came one to him, and tells him, that certainly by all reaſon they can judge, he was like to be a man for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, a dead man: aſſoon as ever he hears but theſe words, <hi>what muſt I die,</hi> ſend for a Phiſitian, <hi>wounds, ſides, heart, muſt I die? wounds, ſides, heart, must I die?</hi> and thus he goes on, and there could be nothing got from him, but <hi>wounds, ſides, heart, muſt I die?</hi> muſt I die, and go from all theſe? here was all, here was the end of this man that made his portion in this world.</p>
            <p>Another rich man that lived not far from the place, that I my ſelf lived in heretofore; when he heard his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40440:46"/>
was deadly, he ſends for his bags of money, and hugs them in his arms, O muſt I leave you? O muſt I leave you? And another, lying upon his ſickbed, layed a bag of gold to his heart, and then bids them, take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>it will not do, it will not do</hi>; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when he lay upon his ſickbed, his ſervants came to him, &amp; ſaid, what lack you? would you have any beer? what do you want? O (ſaith he) I want onely one thing, <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> that I would have, it is not beer, nor friends, nor an eaſy pillow I want, but eaſe of <hi>conſcience</hi>; O conſider, whether there be not like to be perplexitie in your ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And then (brethren) you muſt be called to an account for all, though (as I told you before) not to account for the right to uſe; but for not right uſing; and do but think with your ſelves, if you <hi>now</hi> have ſo much as you cannot reckon, how <hi>then</hi> will you be able to reckon for it, if now you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not count, how will you be able to give an account at the laſt day, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40440:47"/>
when you have had no thoughts of this before hand.</p>
            <p>There will be a dreadfull portion indeed at the day of judgement, O the ſhame and confuſion that will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faces of the men of the world in that houre, when they ſhall ſee their poor neighbours have their portion with Chriſt in glory; perhaps, a poor ſervant in the houſe advanced to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and they ſtand on the left hand to be caſt out; perhaps ſome of theſe poor hoſpitall boyes ſhall be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to eternall glorie, when as ſome of you, that are their great maſters, ſhall be caſt out eternally; what an infinite ſhame and confuſion will this be to you.</p>

world to come. There are many men have a great deal in this world &amp; they ſay they hope, God will be mercifull to them in the world to come. Now this is a certain truth, that man to whom God denies ſpirituall mercy in this world, God will deny eternall mercy to him in the world to come; this therefore ſhould be thy care, doth God increaſe my eſtate in this world? O that the Lord would give a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable meaſure of grace, or elſe it is nothing; Lord, thou giveſt me here a great eſtate, if thou giveſt not to me together with it, a proportionable meaſure of grace to uſe it to thy name, I had better have been without this.</p>
            <p>Is this thy care?

            <p>You may further examine it, by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40440:49"/>
workings of your hearts about your preſent portions; As. 1 whether you enjoy what you have for it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and whether your hearts be terminated in what you do enjoy; one that is godly hath his portion beyond theſe things, he enjoyes the creatures. I but it is God that he enjoyes in them; that is ſweet to me, that I can ſee, and taſte the love of God in; I but a Carnall heart enjoyes the creatures, and runs away, and is terminated there; looks much at the creature, but at little in God; as divers of your hoſpitall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here, look more at the men that were their friends, to bring them into the hoſpitall, when they were Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and Motherleſſe, and ſhiftleſſe, then they look at the founders of the Hoſpitall, they little think of them, to thank God for them, but if they meet with him that was the next cauſe to bring them in, they will thank him for his kindneſſe; ſo it is with moſt men, they look at outward means and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes, but a godly heart looks at the root of all things; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40440:49"/>
one that came into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurehouſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> where he ſaw Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of gold and ſilver, and he pointed down, looking at the bottom of the Table, whereupon one asked him, why is your eye ſo at the bottom? O (ſaith he) I am looking at the root of all this; Alas, it is a ſmall matter for a man that hath a great trade, to have a great ſtock.</p>
            <p>A godly man though he hath but a little, yet he looks at the root, at the love of God, and the Covenant of grace, which is the ſpring of all, and the chief thing that ſatisfies his heart, it is the goodneſſe of God that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a gracious heart, and not the bare creature.</p>
            <p>Therefore examine, how your hearts are ſet upon theſe things of the world, whether your hearts go out with full ſtrength to them; if you make your bellies to be your God, then your end will be deſtruction: That man that hath his heart ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the world, like <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40440:50"/>
in the earth; if the things of the earth be a gulfe to ſwallow thy heart up, there is another gulfe to ſwallow thee up hereafter. Conſider how do the loſſe of the things of the world, take thy heart; doſt not thou account thy ſelf an undone man, when thou had loſt ſome comforts? doſt thou not come home to thy wife and children, I ſay, I am an undone man? why what is the matter? I have loſt ſome part of my eſtate; O carnall heart! one that is Gods child may have ſome croſſes, but no loſſes at all; becauſe he enjoyes all in God, and hath God ſtill. The truth is, if thou wert truly Godly, whatever afflictions thou meeteſt with all, (as we ſay, a man may put all his gain in his eye; ſo you may,) if you be godly, put all your croſſes in your eyes; you are ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
            <p>Examine then whether theſe things of the world, be not the onely ſuitable things to your hearts? whether you bleſſe not your ſelves in theſe, as in your happineſſe; the Ivie will claſpe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40440:50"/>
about a rotten tree, and cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off it, without tearing; and ſo the heart of a worldling, will claſp about theſe rotten comforts, as the onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable things. You may hear them ſometimes tell with joy that we were in ſuch a place, and were ſo merry, &amp; had the braveſt meeting, and what was there? there was ſinging and drinking, and blaſpheming of the name of God, &amp; yet it was the braveſt meeting that could be.</p>
            <p>When did you ever come from an ordinance of God, and ſay, O it was a brave day to me, the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my heart this day; did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go from the word, with as merry a heart, and rejoyce of it amongſt your friends, as you did from a merry meeting? you may fear you are the man that have your portion here.</p>
            <p>If I were to give but one evidence. whether a man hath grace or no? I would give this aſſoon as any one; Suppoſe thou haſt got ſome eſtate in the word, I put this to thee, what doſt thou account to be the chiefeſt good
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40440:51"/>
of thy eſtate, more then thou didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. A man that hath got an eſtate more then he had before, thinks with himſelf, now I may live at a better faſhion, then I could, now I may have more freedom then before, now I may have more credit in the world then I had now, I may have my own mind, and ſatisfie my luſt more then I did, or then another man can do; is not this the thing thou moſt rejoyceſt in; nay, is not this a truth, that ſome of your hearts (if your hearts were ripped up, this would be the language of them) moſt rejoyce in, becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you have moſt fewel for your luſts; a poor man hath not ſo much fewel for his uncleaneſſe as you have, nor ſo much fewell for his pride and malice as you have, and many rich men account the bleſſing and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their eſtates to conſiſt in this very thing, that now they may have a larger ſcope for their luſts then ever they could before; alas, a poor man cannot go abroad, and drink, as you can do; a poor man cannot lay out ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40440:51"/>
much upon a whore, and an unclean wretch, as you can do, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, if this man hath not his portion in this <hi>world,</hi> who hath? the Lord ſtrike thy wretched heart.</p>
            <p>A gracious man, when God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him in this world, though there be but a little grace in him, it will work thus: the Lord hath raiſed my condition above my brother, &amp; why? the Lord giveth me a larger opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to do him ſervice, then my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, or then I had before: there is ſuch a poor man, he is an honeſt man, but (God knows) he can do but little in the place where he is, he hath but little means; but God hath given me means, and this means enlarges my opportunities to do God ſervice, and for this my ſoul bleſſeth God, I account my eſtate happier then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I now may be of more uſe, and do God more ſervice then otherwiſe I could do; have you ſuch workings in heart, you rich men if: you have not never be at quiet till you get your hearts working in this manner; this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40440:52"/>
will be a bleſſed teſtimony, that God gives you a portion here, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth another portion for you in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Again, what is that thing that you ſtrive to make moſt ſure? that which a man ſtrives to make moſt ſure, that he counts his happineſſe to conſiſt in; O for thy Land, and debts, thou ſtriveſt with all thy might to make them ſure, but as for the matter of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and peace in Chriſt, thou haſt a good hope thereof, but takeſt no pains to make it ſure.</p>
            <p>See what thou doſt moſt admire men for? O ſuch a man is happy, he hath ſo much coming in, and hath ſo much a year; but doſt thou call the vile man happy? this is a ſigne that thou haſt not thy eye enlightned: canſt thou look upon thoſe that are poor and mean in this world, as moſt happy creatures, becauſe the Lord gives them the grace of his ſpirit? and think, well, it is true, I have a greater eſtate then ſuch a poor man that is my neighbour, or then ſuch a poor kindſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40440:52"/>
but God knows, he doth God more ſervice then I do, he prayes more, and more heartily in one day then I do in a whole year. O, the Lord hath other manner of prayers, and ſighes come from his poor cottage, then ever he had from my brave pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: I have my citie houſe and my countrey houſe, but they were never ſo perfumed with prayers; ſome that live in poor cellars, ſend up more prayers, and God hath more honour from them, then he hath from me; in my familie (perhaps) there is curſing and blaſpheming of God, in ſuch poor cottages, there is (perhaps) bleſſing and prayſing of God, now canſt thou look upon them, as the moſt happy people in the world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, what art thou moſt carefull to lay up for thy children? if the things of the world take up thy care for thy children moſt, it is an argument thou thinkeſt, thy children ſhall have a good portion if thou canſt leave them ſo many thouſands; &amp; it is like it is thy portion too; if thou counteſt it theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:40440:53"/>Examine alſo thy ſervices what they are; doſt thou put off God with ſlight ſervices, then know thy portion is like to be of Gods ſlight mercies; Again, art thou hypocriticall in thy ſervice, doſt thou ayme at the praiſe of men in outward duties, that is a ſigne thou haſt thy reward here; and are thy ſervices forced, that thou art compelled, it is meerely conſcience compells thee, and not an inward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greableneſſe between the frame of thy heart, and holy things: then it is like, a ſervants portion will be thine, and not a childs portion.</p>
            <p>Further, haſt thou heretofore been a forward profeſſour in religion, and haſt now forſaken the wayes of God; I'le give you a dreadfull Scripture for this, in the 17. of <hi>Ieremiah<note place="margin">17. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 13.</note>: All you that forſake the Lord ſhall be aſhamed, &amp; they that depart from me, ſhall be written in the earth</hi>; if thou haſt been forward heretofore, and now thou comeſt to be more ancient, and now thou art dead, and dull, and cold —; here is a Text for thee, go home, &amp; tremble,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40440:53"/>
leaſt thou be a man, whoſe name is written in the earth. And doth not God for the preſent curſe thy portion? thou findeſt the more thou haſt, the worſe thou groweſt; as if a man ſhould eat meat at ones table, and aſſoon as he hath eaten it, begin to ſwell, he will conclude certainly the meat was poyſoned, ſo when thy eſtate riſes, thy heart riſes with pride, ſurely it was poyſoned with the curſe of God that was in it.</p>
            <p>Again I'le onely name one ſigne more; what ſayeſt thou to this, that man that ſpends his dayes without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome fear, leaſt God ſhould put him off with the things of this world: there may be ſome danger of that; it is ſaid of ſome, that they feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without fear;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iude</hi> 12.</note> you can go to a merry meeting, and feed upon the chear, and eat without fear; but never have ſuch a thought as this in your heart, what if God ſhould put me off with theſe things? I hear indeed there are ſome menare put of ſo, what if that ſhould prove to be my portion what a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40440:54"/>
miſerable creature were I? I fear there were ſome men never had ſuch a thought in their lives, what if it ſhould prove ſo with me, what a miſerable creature were I.</p>
            <p>I have one word of exhortation to you all, &amp; then I have done, &amp; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation muſt be divided: <hi>Firſt,</hi> unto you that have ſome evidences that God hath given you a better portion, that God hath not put you off with the portion of this world; O bleſſe the Lord for his goodneſſe to you, that ever he hath ſhewed you better things then the world affoords, your line is fallen into a good ground, you have a goodly inheritance; though thou haſt not ſo much as others have, yet thou haſt that that will make thee happy forever.</p>
            <p>I have read of one <hi>Didimus,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed godly Preacher, but he was blind, whereof he complained, &amp; was much troubled for his want of ſight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Chriſtian friend rebuked him ſharpely; what (ſaith he) hath God given you that that is the excellency
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40440:54"/>
of an Apoſtle, of a Miniſter of Chriſt; and are you troubled for want of your ſight, that a piſmire may have, that a bruit beaſt may have, for the want of thy ſight, that the rats and mice may have, are you troubled with that, and rather not taught to bleſſe God, that hath given you ſo great a mercy, as to make you ſuch an inſtrument of his ſervice? ſo may I ſay to you that are godly, hath God given you Ieſus Chriſt? hath he given you his Son, hath he given you his Spirit, hath he given you himſelf, to be your portion, and are you troubled that you have not more of that, that beaſts may have, as well as your ſelves? O be aſhamed of any mournfull diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for want of the comforts of this world.</p>
            <p>And do not envy wicked men for their outward proſperity; I remember a ſtory of a poor ſouldier that was condemned to die meerely fortaking a bunch of grapes from a Vine, for there was a ſtrict law that who ever ſhould take any thing from that place they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40440:55"/>
went through, he ſhould dye for it. Now he had taken a bunch of grapes, and was condemned to die, and as he went to execution, he went eating of his bunch of grapes, and ſome came to him, and ſaid, doſt thou go eating thy grapes, thou ſhouldſt think of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe; he anſwers, I beſeech you (Sir) do not envy me my grapes, they will coſt me dear; ſo may I ſay of all the men of the world; we have no need to envy them of any thing they have, it will coſt them very dear one day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, live like ſuch as God hath not put off with the portion of this world? manifeſt in it your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that you look for higher &amp; better things, then what this world affoords; ſhew they are but ſlight in your eyes; look upon your eſtates as deſpicable, be willing to improve them all for publick good, yea, to jeopard not eſtates onely but your names, your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and your lives in a publick cauſe; and thoſe that ſhall do ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the world may look upon them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40440:55"/>
in a ſad condition, and ſay, O ſuch a man is like to be undone, and his life is in danger; I tell you ſuch a one that ſhall out of a good principle, be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to venture life and eſtate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for God, that man ſhall be moſt honoured, and be found the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man at laſt; and indeed herein he ſhews himſelf to be a man that looks for a higher portion, then theſe things here; as thoſe in the Hebrews: By that they ſaid and did, <note place="margin">11. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 14.</note>
               <hi>they ſhewed plainly,</hi> they <hi>looked for another Country</hi>; ſo ſee you men that might live as comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in outward things as you, and (did their conſciences give way) they could be as quiet as you; but conſcience puts them upon it, that ſeeing God calls them to a publick place, they can be content to put all at Gods feet.</p>
            <p>Now though you may think that ſuch are in moſt danger, they ſhew plainly they are men of another countrey, and ſhould be moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; and take but this principle with you, the more any one gives up
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40440:56"/>
his eſtate to God, the more comfort he hath in his eſtate, whether in the enjoyment of it, or in the loſſe of it; I expreſſe it thus: when one reſignes up all he hath, his <hi>eſtate, liberty, name, life</hi> to God, the oftener it comes into Gods hands, the better it comes, when God gives it him again; a carnall heart when once he hath theſe things, he will not truſt God with them, but he will have them in his own keeping; but a gracious heart, though he hath all theſe from God, yet every day he is willing to give up all to him, and to truſt God with them again; though he be a rich man, he is willing every day to come and beg his bread at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gate, and give up all; now he gives up all in the truth of his heart to God, and God gives it him all again; as long as in a lawfull way he enjoyes it, he hath it a freſh from God; now this (I ſay) the oftener any thing comes out of Gods hand, the ſweeter &amp; the better it is; wicked mens eſtates come but once out of Gods hands, and therefore there is not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40440:56"/>
in them, but a godly mans eſtate comes 100. and 100. times from God; for every reſignation gives it to God, and God gives it him again; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is comfort, and O bleſſed are they that live ſo, as that they declare they look for another Countrey, and that their portion is not here; let the men of the world think them fooliſh, that will venture themſelves ſo, God and his Saints have declared that their portion it not here.</p>
            <p>And now to you all, the word of exhortation from God is, that every one in this place, would put on to make more ſure of another portion, beſides the portion of this world; put on, I ſay for you are all made capable of higher and better things, then the things of the world; and never a one here but hath an immortall ſoul, and is capable of Communion with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that is another manner of buſineſſe, then to eat and drink, and have pleaſure with the fleſh, here for a while; God hath made your natures capable of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40440:57"/>
ſuch glory, do not debaſe your ſelves, to reſt ſatisfied with husks, when you may have meat enough in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe; and therefore put on, and let the pooreſt ſort put on, that have but a little portion here; yet there is as fair way for you to have the God of Heaven and Earth to be your portion, to have whatſoever Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed by his bloud to be your portion, to have eternitie, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to be your portion; (I ſay) there is as fair a way for it, as for the greateſt Princes in the earth; you may come to have a portion here.</p>
            <p>Indeed many a poor apprentice may ſay; my Father is dead, and hath left me no portion: I, but you that are poor apprentices, and others, and the poor Hoſpitall boyes, that live upon charitie, it is poſſible ſome poor wretches there may come to have their portion in God and Chriſt, and immortality, as well as the greateſt, and richeſt of all; therefore raiſe up your hearts here, you that are the pooreſt and meaneſt, &amp; know you are born for high things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40440:57"/>If I ſhould come and tell one that is a poor boy in a blew coat now, what ever you are now, there is ſuch a rich man will adopt you to be his child, and make you his heire, that would raiſe up his heart; well, how ever meanely you live now, you may be a glorious creature hereafter, if ſo be you have now a heart to put upon it, and to ſeek after it for your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But you'le ſay, Lord what ſhould we do, that our portion may be a higher portion, then in this world; the firſt thing I would put you upon, is this; let the whole courſe of your life be ſteared (as it were) with the fear of God, have a continuall jealouſy, leaſt God ſhould put you off with the things of this life; hold forth this in every action, that any one may ſee by your converſation, ſurely this man, this woman hath ſome fears, leaſt God ſhould put him off with a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this world; and eſpecially you that have great portions in this life, &amp; have done God little ſervice; you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40440:58"/>
know there are many poor people that live upon almes, have done God more ſervice then you; you have moſt cauſe to fear; they that are Rulers and Governours have mighty cauſe to fear, unleſſe they have good evidence in their hearts; <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the 13. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that are Governours; ſaith, <hi>I wonder that any</hi> Governour <hi>ſhould be ſaved</hi>; he hath ſuch a ſpeech there: I will not ſay ſo, but there is a great deal of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; Chriſt tells us, that a man that hath a great portion in this world, (though it is poſſible he may have more hereafter,) yet it is doubtfull; whether he ſhall inherit heaven.</p>
            <p>It was the counſell of one to a King; ſaith he, I deſire but this favour, that every day you would think of this Text, <hi>what profits it a man, to gain the whole world, and to looſe his own ſoul?</hi> ſpend ſome little time in conſidering of it every morning when you ariſe, and every night when you lie down, what will it advantage me to be great here and miſerable hereafter. The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40440:58"/>
ſame councell I give to you, daily pray to God, to make you underſtand, what there is in this Text, that there are a generation of men, who have <hi>their portion in this world only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if you would not have your portion here, labour to take off your hearts from all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; he that <hi>will be</hi> rich, ſhall fall into many temptations; know it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, you ſhould have an eſtate in this world, but it is neceſſary, you ſhould make your peace with God; it is neceſſary I ſhould provide for my ſoul; but how things go with me here, is not ſo much neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſet the glorie of Heaven and eternitie daily before your eyes, and be trading for higher things then the world affords: many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go up and down the ſtreets, crying ſome mean thing, and think it well, if they get 18<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. in a whole day, but a rich Merchant can go out in the morning, and make a bargain, and perhaps get 500. l. in an houre, he trades ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like; ſo the men of this world la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40440:59"/>
for the meat that periſheth; but a godly man hath communion with God, and in a quarter of an hour gets that, he would not looſe for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
            <p>It was a ſpeech of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> thou art not to fiſh for <hi>Gudgeons</hi> and <hi>Trowts,</hi> but thou art to angle for Caſtles and Cities; ſo may I ſay, if thou haſt an immortall ſoul with thee, thou art not ſo much to angle for meat and drink, and cloaths, to make proviſion for the fleſh, but for heaven and immortalitie.</p>
            <p>The next thing is this: <hi>Honour God with thy ſubſtance.</hi> Lay out thy portion <hi>here</hi> for God. O, that I could but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of one principle of divinitie more, and that is this, that there is more excellency and good in one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous action, then there is in all the creatures in heaven and earth, (beſides the bleſſed Angels, and glorious Saints above, I ſay others of the Saints, excepting theſe) take all creatures, <hi>Sun, Moon, Stars, Seas, Earth,</hi> all the Pearls &amp; Iewels of the world, Pearls,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40440:59"/>
put them all together, yet this is true divinitie, that there is more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in one vertuous action, then there is, if thou hadſt all theſe things to be thy poſſeſſion; if men were convinced of this, they would be abundant in good works: Thou thinkeſt it a brave thing, to have ſo much coming in by the year, do but one good action for God, out of an upright principle, ANd there is more excellency in that one action, then there is in thy great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, if thou haſt 1000. times more added to it.</p>
            <p>Me thinks this ſhould make them <hi>that are rich,</hi> to be rich in good works; ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Charge them that are rich</hi> in this world, <hi>that they be rich in good works,</hi> O, there is a rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in good works, as well as in great revenues; O, improve, lay out thy eſtate now for God; <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place, of the rich man: is it not more honour, that ſo many children ſhall account you as their <hi>Father,</hi> then that ſo many pieces of gold ſhall call you their <hi>Lord?</hi> Theſe pieces of gold,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40440:60"/>
do (as it were) call you Lord, &amp; there are 2. or 3. children ſhall call you Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and is it not more excellent to have a couple of poor Orphans, while you are alive in this world, to call you <hi>Father,</hi> then to have ſo many bags of gold call you <hi>Mr?</hi> O, therefore, give a portion to 6. and to 7.</p>
            <p>Again, if you would not be put off with a portion in this world, be ſure that all the ſervices you perform to God be choice ſervices, if you expect choice mercies, let your ſervices be choice ſervices, be ſure all your works be ſupernaturall works; you'le ſay how ſhall I know that? if I had time, I could make it out clear. A ſupernaturall work is that that hath a ſupernaturall principle, done to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall end, and in a ſupernaturall manner; A ſupernaturall <hi>principle,</hi> that is <hi>grace,</hi> which makes it ſuitable to my heart, not that I do it out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience only, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall end, that is, when I ayme at God, and not at my ſelf in any dutie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40440:60"/>But what is this ſupernaturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſerving God? I ſhall explain it thus. <hi>Seneca</hi> in giving his rule how to know the affections, when they are naturall, and when not; ſaith, you ſhall know a naturall affection by this, if it be kept with in bound, it is naturall, if it be out of bounds, it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; I'le make uſe of it in another way; when you come to the ſervice of God, if you think to limit God in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, this is but a naturall ſervice, you'l go ſo far and there ſtop, but if it be a ſupernaturall ſervice, you'l let out your hearts, if it were poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to God; you cannot be infinite, that is true, but you'l propound no bounds, nor limits to your ſervice, &amp; this is indeed the truth of grace, when it hath the impreſſion of gracious infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe upon it; infiniteneſſe is that whereby God is without all limits; ſo when the ſoul is without all limits and bounds in the way of grace, it is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to honour God, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in an infinite way; theſe are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40440:61"/>Laſtly, would you not have your portion in this world, be willing to caſt away whatever of your portion you have got ſinfully; this in the name of God, I declare as a ſpeciall thing; therefore take it home with you; what ever man or woman in this place would not have his portion in this world, but would have his portion in the world to come; whatſoever of thy portion, thou haſt got in a ſinfull courſe, caſt it away preſently, never ſleep with it, lye not down one night with it, reſt not till thou art cleared of it.</p>
            <p>It is an old rule, but a true one; all the repentance in the world, and all your ſorrowing for ſin whatſoever, will never obtain pardon without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, unleſſe you reſtore what you are able, you can never have comfort of the pardon of that ſin; If you have got it when you were young, being an apprentice, or at firſt ſetting up, away with it, elſe it will ſpoil all, and you'l never have any other portion from God; theſe hands of mine, had that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40440:61"/>
once given them, <hi>to reſtore</hi> that was got wrongfully 50. years before; the wrong was done 50. years ago, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 50. years ſpace, the conſcience of the man troubles him, and he comes to make reſtitution, and ſatisfie the wrong, he had done deſiring me to conveye it to ſuch a man whom he had wronged in ſuch a place.</p>
            <p>Know therefore that all the ſweet morſels, that at any time you have ſo delight fully got down, they muſt up again; therefore willingly part with them; reſolve before thou go out of this place, whatever thou haſt got wrongfully, not to keep it one minute: and do it willingly, elſe thou canſt have no comfort here or hereafter: if there be any true divinitie in the world, this is true divinitie; and yet it is hard to convince covetous men that have got their means this way.</p>
            <p>If there be any that have done wrong in things betruſted to them, as thoſe that be Maiſters of Hoſpitalls, be ſure you keep not that, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you'l curſe the time, you ever took

it; therefore let the charge of God be ſtrong upon you this day, caſt out whatever you have got falſely. I have read a ſtory of one, who hearing that place of Scripture read; <note place="margin">5. <hi>Iſaaih</hi> 8.</note>

            <p>And if you would have your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another life, be willing to join with the ſufferers for Chriſt; ſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did, though he were in the way of preferment, yet he choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſur's of ſin for a ſeaſon: Priſe the Saints, aſſociate with them, rather then with the jolly blades of the world. It is ſafer joyning with ſufferers, then with thoſe brave ſpirits that ſcorne goodneſſe, jolly blades of the world, it is ſafer to join
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40440:62"/>
with the ſufferers, then to joyn with thoſe that are the jolly, and the brave ſpirits; And ſo I have done; onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that the Lord would ſettle all home upon your ſpirits, if it may be, becauſe ſomething may not be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the pallat of everie one, as ſome other, but if for that, you ſhould reject what hath been ſaid, and go away and ſlight this word of God; know that this Text one day may prove to be as ſcalding lead in your conſciences; and that what is ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Doeg, in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 52.7. may prove to be your portion. It is ſpoken of Doeg; This is the man (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) that did not make God his truſt, but truſted in his great riches; this is the man. So you may be pointed out one day, this is the man; Doeg was a great courtier, and becauſe he was an Officer to King <hi>Saul,</hi> and becauſe he had his favour, he truſted in the favour of the King, and in his riches, and what did he care for <hi>David?</hi> yet by the Text it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears? he was one that made ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40440:63"/>
ſhew of religion too; in the firſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> 21.7. He was detained before the Lord; <hi>Tremelius</hi> thinks, either out of ſome religious vow, or to keep the Sabbath; or ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that law, he was detained before the Lord; and yet he was a vile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant againſt <hi>David,</hi> and all becauſe he truſted in the great countenance he had at Court; now this is the man that made not God his truſt, but that truſted in his great riches. The Lord forbid, this Scripture ſhould be made true of any of you; I leave this Text with you that are rich men, take heed. I leave this Text with you that are in places of dignitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, take heed. I leave this Text with you that are voluptuous men, given up to your pleaſure. Take heed you hear not one day this, Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in thy life time, thou hadſt thy pleaſure; I leave it with all that will not truſt God, for a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come; and above all, I leave it with all hypocrites, let them take heed, it be not ſaid to them, here is

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40440:65"/>
of ſome great evill, that it ſeems was upon him, or that he was in danger of. The argument that he uſeth, is, Firſt his truſt in God, as in the firſt verſe, <hi>Preſerve me O God, for in thee do I put my truſt.</hi> And it was not an ungrounded and unwarranted truſt, but that which proceeded from his intereſt he had in God, as in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe, <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord</hi>: thou art mine, and my onely God, in whom is all my confidence. But what if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſhould now periſh in this diſtreſſe, ſhould God be any looſer by it? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſeems to acknowledge this, that though he ſhould not be preſerved, yet God was bound to preſerve his own name, and his own cauſe; as it followes in the ſecond verſe, <hi>my goodneſſe extendeth not to thee.</hi> Though I ſhould live, yet it is little that I could do for thee. But to the ſaints that are in the earth, Though my goodneſſe extendeth not unto thee, yet may I be of uſe to thy people, and unto thy Saints while I live; for it extends to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40440:65"/>
them, and they are thoſe that my ſoul cloſeth with and hath delight in. O, therefore do I deſire to live, and to be preſerved, that I may be uſefull to them, that are thy Saints.</p>
            <p>It is a great argument to prevail with God, when any of you are in danger, and ſeek for preſervation, if your hearts work thus to God, that the deſire you have to be preſerved is, that whatever you are, and whatever you can do, may extend to the Saints, that you may live to be of uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the world to Gods people. Many of you when you apprehend your ſelves to be in trouble, you then cry to God to be preſerved: but to what end? wherefore would you be preſerved? wherefore would you live? If we may judge of your ends according to your practiſe, you would live that you may have more time to ſatisfie your luſts, that you may have more time to diſhonour God, that you may have more time to do miſchief in the places where you live. There is this in the heart, and God ſees it:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40440:66"/>
God ſees whatſoever will be after in your lives; God ſees before what was in your hearts when you cried to be preſerved. But now one that is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, he deſires therefore to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: O, ſaith he, that I might live to be of uſe in that place where God hath placed me. If God ſhould take me away now, my conſcience tells me that it is little ſervice that I have done for him. I have been of little uſe in the place where God hath ſet me, O, that I might be preſerved for this end, that what I am, or have, or have been might extend to the Saints on earth, even the excellent in whom is all my delight. Thus you have the ſcope of the words, and the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them. And in them there are theſe two things obſervable.</p>

               </label>And ſecondly, the ſweet delight that <hi>Davids</hi> heart had in them; <hi>in whom is all my delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, the high eſteem that <hi>David</hi> had of the Saints, &amp; the Saints
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40440:66"/>
that were on earth, the Excellent. The point is this, that the Saints of God, thoſe that are godly, are the excellent in the earth.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, from this that he ſaith, in whom is all my delight. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, that a gracious heart above all things in this world, takes the moſt contentment in the Saints of God; he is much delighted in them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is but a preparation to the ſecond: therefore I ſhall paſſe it over briefly. They are the excellent in the earth, therefore my delight is in them.</p>
            <p>They are the excellent in the earth. Let them be what they will in regard of their outward meanneſs, yet there is an excellency in them. <hi>Iob</hi> ſcraping upon the dunghill; and <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſticking in the mire in the dungeon, yet they had more glory and beauty upon them, then the greateſt Potentates of the earth when they ſate upon their thrones. Though they lie among the pots (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) yet are they

as Doves, their wings are the wings of Doves, <hi>whoſe feathers are of gold, and ſilver</hi>; Pſalm. 68.13. beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and glorious. You know the judgement that the holy Ghoſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon the Saints in old time, that were outwardly mean enough, there is as much meanneſs on them as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the world could put: the Text ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.36.</note> 
               <hi>they had tryalls of mockings, of ſcourgings, of bonds, and impriſonments, they were ſawen aſſunder, they were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, they wandred in ſheepskins, &amp; goats skins: deſtitute, afflicted, tormented.</hi> What kind of creatures were theſe, ſurely they were ſome wretched men, and women that were thus hunted up and down to wander in ſheeps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins and goats-skins, deſtitute, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tormented? No ſuch matter, they were ſuch <hi>of whom the world was not worthy</hi>: v. 38. that is the judgement of the holy Ghoſt upon ſuch, <hi>the world was not worthy of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The men of the world would have thought, and did think that they were ſuch as were not worthy to live in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40440:67"/>
world: but the judgement of the holy Ghoſt was ſuch, that the world was not worthy of them. I remember <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath this interpretation of the phraſe, they are ſuch as are worth more then all the world, more then many thouſands of the world; one of them is worth more then all the men of the world beſides. It is a truth ſo; one Saint of God, though never ſo mean, one poor youth, one ſervant that is truly gracious, is worth more then all the men of the world beſides that are not ſo. All the Monarchs and Princes on earth, have not that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in them that one poor child or ſervant hath that is gracious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God.</p>
            <p>But the ordinary interpretation is thus, they are ſuch as have that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as that the world is not worthy to enjoy them, they are not worthy of their preſence, that they ſhould ſo much as live among them; they are rather fit to be ſet as ſtars in heaven, &amp; be before the Lord in his glory: <hi>the world is not worthy of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:40440:68"/>But what is there in the Saints that makes them the excellent in the earth? <hi>The Saints that are the excellent.</hi> The word in the originall ſignifies the magnificent ones; thoſe that have magnificent ſpirits, and are exceeding glorious.</p>
            <p>There is this in them (that I may briefly paſſe over this firſt.)</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Saints have the Image of God.</note>They have the image of God upon them, and therefore they muſt needs be the excellent on earth. The image of God makes them to reſemble God in that which the creature is able to conceive of; That which is the height of Gods excellency: though it be true, whatſoever is in God is God himſelf: yet we conceiving of God according to our manner of ſpeaking, there is ſomething of God that appears moſt excellent, and glorious. And it muſt needs be in regard of that expreſſion, becauſe grace is called the image of God. Now when we draw the image of a thing, we draw it as near as we can according to that which is the moſt proper excellency of that thing.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40440:68"/>
If I would draw the image of a man, I do not draw the likeneſſe of a piece of fleſh, a beaſt hath that as well as a man; or I do not draw feet or legs, or the back parts of a man: but when the image of a man is drawn, his face is chiefly looked after to be drawn, which is the moſt excellenteſt part of man; and there we endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his life, and ſpirit as much as can be: for that is the moſt excellent part; and though the ſpirit cannot be drawn, and there can be no picture of it; yet becauſe it is ſhewen moſt in the face, that is, as near as we can go, that is drawn there.</p>
            <p>So the image of God, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the creature reſembles God in height of excellency and glory. It is not every reſemblance of God that is Gods image: there are ſome things that ſet out ſome of the glory of God, and they are but called Gods foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, or his back parts. All the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God in his creatures; and the expreſſions of his power, and wiſedome; the inviſible things of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40440:69"/>
God that we ſee in the creature, they are all but his footſteps, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; they are not his image, Why? becauſe they do not reſemble God in that which he hath ſet out to us to be the height of his glory. What is that? The holineſſe of God, that is the height of his excellency. Therefore it is ſaid of God him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>holy and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend is his name.</hi> Gods name comes to be reverend by holineſſe: were it not for his holineſſe, notwithſtanding all the reſt, (if it were poſſible to ſeparate them) his name would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend. Therefore when the Saints in heaven glorifie God for his chiefeſt excellency, it is thus <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai</hi> 6.3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.8.</note>
               <hi>holy, holy, holy.</hi> We find not in Scripture any of Gods Attributes thrice repeated, Wiſe, Wiſe, Wiſe, or Almighty, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Almighty, but <hi>holy, holy, holy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the excellency of God conſiſts chiefly in Holineſſe: the LORD on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is Holy.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe where grace is in the creature, reſembling this holineſſe of God, there is that principle whereby
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40440:69"/>
the creature is able to act as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acts: for that is holineſſe, the working of God to his own end in all things ſuitable to his nature. So when the creature works to God as his laſt end, and in ſome meaſure is ſuitable to that God with which the creature hath to doe, here is the Image of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Scripture expreſſeth grace by theſe 4. things, as
<list>
                  <item>The Image of God.</item>
                  <item>The Life of God.</item>
                  <item>The glory of God, and</item>
                  <item>The Divine nature.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>There are theſe 4. expreſſions for the work of grace.</p>
            <p>The Image of God, it reſembles God in his excellency. The life of God himſelf, Epheſ. 4. <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> that notes acting like God himſelf. And then it is the glory of God himſelf; and the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. So that there muſt needs be excellency in the Saints that have grace that is of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40440:70"/>Certainly, there is more of God in the meaneſt Saint, in the meaneſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man or woman; there is more of the glory of God, then in all the world beſides, then in heaven and earth. Take all the creatures, all the glory of God in the heavens, in the Sunne, Moon, and Stars, and put all into one. Take all the glory of God in the ſeas, thoſe vaſt Oceans, and put that into one; take all the glory of God that appears in the earth, all the riches of the earth, and all arts and ſciences, and what you will; put all into one, and the meaneſt youth or ſervant that hath the leaſt degree of grace, hath more of the glory of God then all this is. There is more of the ſhining of God in the leaſt degree of grace in the pooreſt Chriſtian in the world, then there is in all theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If there were a quinteſſence of all the excellency, and glory, extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and drawn, and put into one, yet there were not ſo much of God, God could not ſee ſo much of himſelf in that one creature that ſhould have the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40440:70"/>
excellency of all creatures put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he ſees in the meaneſt Saint that hath the work of grace.</p>
            <p>And ſurely then they are the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth, if there be ſo much of God in them.</p>
            <p>The work of grace is that which hath moſt of God in it; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, it is that which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of Gods eternall love; it is a beam of it, therefore there is a great deal of excellency in it. Take all other creatures, and it is poſſible to enjoy all the good that is in all the creatures in heaven and earth (excepting this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the grace of God) through the bounty of God, and the pleaſure of God.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that the creature hath, but may be communicated as a fruit of Gods generall bounty except ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt: but where ever this is, though in the leaſt degree, it is of that nature, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come but onely from the eternall election of God. It is that which is the principle of Eternall life, whereſoever
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40440:71"/>
it is, it is that which will grow up to eternall glory.</p>
            <p>All common gifts will never grow up to glory, though they grow up to the height of glory, but the grace of God, true grace, it is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with eternall glory. Therefore for the kind of it, it is the greateſt good that ever God did, or that ever he will communicate to any creature for all eternity. I ſay, where ever God hath communicated any dramme of grace,<note place="margin">Grace is the chiefeſt good that God doth beſtow.</note> that is the greateſt good that ever God did, or ever will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to all eternity, to any of his creatures, therefore it is exceeding excellent.</p>
            <p>Onely excepting the work of God in the hypoſtaticall union of the two natures, wherein he joyned the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and the divine nature together in one perſon; excepting that, the work of grace in any ſoul is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work that ever God did from all eternity, or that ever he will do, for the kind of it.</p>
            <p>Now that which hath ſo much of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40440:71"/>
God in it, &amp; comes from the eternall election and love of God; and is the greateſt work that ever was done, or ever ſhall be done; and the greateſt good that ever was, or ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any creature for ever, truly this muſt needs be the greateſt excellency. For God made the world for that end, that he might commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his excellency, and glory to the world, to the creature. Now that which was the greateſt thing that God intended from all eternity; for the communicating of all his glory, it muſt needs make the creature excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. This is the firſt thing, that the Saints are the excellent on earth in regard of the image of God upon them, and the work of grace in them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, they are the excellent of the earth, in regard of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them for God: they are thoſe that God ſet his thoughts upon from all eternity, that they might enjoy him. The great counſels that God wrought from all eternity, eſpecially
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40440:72"/>
were ſet on work upon this great thing of ſeparating of certain creatures for himſelf from the reſt of the world.</p>
            <p>Now when God ſhall ſet as it were (to ſpeak after the manner of men) his thoughts and counſels on work from all eternity to ſet apart a few creatures for himſelf; if theſe can be known who they are, certainly, we cannot but look on them as the excellent on earth: Now whereſoever we ſee the work of grace in any, we may by that know that theſe God hath ſeparated for himſelf, as ſetting his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on work from all eternity above that. That was the thing he was moſt exerciſed in before the world, about the work of ſeparating ſuch and ſuch for himſelf. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>O ye ſons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into ſhame? How long will ye love vanity and ſeek after leaſing? But know, that the Lord hath ſet a part him that is Godly, for himſelf.</hi> Pſalm. 4.2.3. Here you ſee that God hath ſet apart the godly for himſelf, they are thoſe that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40440:72"/>
are dedicated, &amp; conſecrated to God, therefore there is a wonderfull excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency put upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated.</note>As you know any thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated and conſecrated, though it be never ſo mean in it ſelf, yet being once dedicated, being once made a conſecrated thing, there is a great deal of excellency put upon that thing. As in the law, if it were but a piece of wood in the Tabernacle, if it were but a Badgers skin; if it were but braſſe or goats hair or any ſuch thing that were meane in it ſelf, yet if it were once conſecrated and made holy to God, they looked upon it as having a great deal of excellency on it.</p>
            <p>Now I reaſon thus; if a piece of wood, or a little hair, or leather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God had an excellency in it: what then hath an immortall ſoul, that hath the graces of the ſpirit, as ſo many pearls in it, when that is conſecrated &amp; ſet apart to God to the glory and praiſe of his grace to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; here muſt needs be much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and moſt eminent prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40440:73"/>When a thing is conſecrated we look on it no more according to the quality of the thing, but to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. As I remember I read of ſome people in India, that when they have but loſt an Apes tooth that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to their god, they will give an unſpeakable ſumme of money for the redemption of it again, becauſe it was a thing that was conſecrated to their god. So I read of another that being raiſed from a mean birth, he took this way to make himſelf to be highly eſteemed of the people, he had a golden baſon that he uſed to waſh his feet in, he took that and made an idoll of it, and conſecrated it, and then every one fell down, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped it when it was conſecrated. Nay, ſaith he, if this which was mean before it was ſet apart to this uſe, comes ſo to be honoured, then I that am mean by birth, being ſet apart to the government, may as well be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by you.</p>
            <p>Thus then if the ſuperſtition, and will of man having conſecrated a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40440:73"/>
thing, thinks he puts ſo much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency on it, how much more when God himſelf, and the great and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall work of the holy Ghoſt that he is deſigned to, it is a ſpeciall work of his office to conſecrate ſouls to God, and to ſet them apart to himſelf, what an excellency muſt this needs be that is put upon them? <hi>They are the excellent of the earth.</hi> That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Saints Relation to God.</note>Thirdly, if we conſider that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Saints have to God; they are the neareſt relations that can be expreſt. Of children to parents; they are the children of God. Of a ſpouſe to her husband; they are the ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſecond perſon in Trinity; and in that regard they are more nearly united to God then the Angels themſelves are, in being the ſpouſe of the Son of God. Yea the very members of his body, they have a nearer relation in that reſpect to the divine nature, to the ſecond perſon in Trinity then the Angels themſelves: for they have not ſuch a relation as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40440:74"/>
this, therefore they are <hi>the excellent of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Saints Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note>Again, fourthly, if we conſider the great priviledges that the Saints have, we ſhal ſee them the excellent of the earth. Not to ſpeak of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſin and guiltineſſe, and thoſe immunities that they have from others. But conſider they have this priviledge, that God in all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and works, he is continually working for their good.</p>
            <p>There is this excellent prerogative of the Saints, there is no attribute of God but it is continually working good to every Saint of God. There is no work of Gods providence, but it works and acts continually for their good.</p>
            <p>It would be a mighty excellent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon any man, if but ſuch an honourable aſſembly as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould take thought for ſuch an one, and all their purpoſes and plots, and councels all the time they are ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhould tend to the good of ſuch an one in particular, taking notice in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40440:74"/>
particular of him. It is that which I ſaid, all your wiſdome, and power and mercy, and faithfulneſſe, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite alſufficiency of God is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every moment working, not onely for the good of thoſe that love God in generall, but for every particular Saint of God. God takes ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, and ſets all his attributes continually on work for their good, &amp; wellbeing.</p>
            <p>And the heavens continually work for them. They have this priviledge, that the whole world is made for them, God hath given them the world, they are the heirs of the world; as it is ſaid of Abraham, he was the heir of the world. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abraham</hi> had little himſelf, yet he had the world. Now the children inherit their fathers eſtate; if the world were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams inheritance, then it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of every child of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for ſo the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> are heirs to all that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, that is, as far as concerns them, therefore they that are his heirs, are heirs like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40440:75"/>
of the world, ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.23. <hi>All are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> So that God, and the creatures are theirs, here is a mighty priviledge indeed.</p>
            <p>Again, the priviledges that they have in all the good of the Covenant of grace, Whatſoever good there is in the Covenant of grace, all the rich promiſes in the Covenant of grace are the priviledges of the godly Saints. It is admirable priviledges that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes in the Scripture ſpeak of, to have intereſt in them all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Saints immunities that come by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</note>Beſides, not onely the promiſes, but the immunities that come from the Covenant of grace, as this; that they are not to ſtand or fall for their eternall eſtate, by any thing that they are able to do themſelves, they are freed from this, their eternall eſtate hangs not on that which they can do. Whereas others, that are not ſaints, that are not in the Covenant of grace, their eternall eſtate hangs on their endeavours, and actions, God dealing with them according to the Covenant
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40440:75"/>
of works, being in that condition: though they may be ſuch as may after come to be Saints, and as God hath elected, and in love may look on them as he intends towards them: but for the preſent they are in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that they know not, but that their eternall eſtate depends on that which they do themſelves. Now to be delivered from this, to have this immunity that ſuch a thing of ſuch a conſequence, as our eternall eſtate ſhould depend upon a ſure foundation, upon that which is done by Chriſt, and done already; it is an infinite pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. Others cannot challenge to themſelves this priviledge, that God will accept of their endeavours; do what they can, yet not being in the Covenant of grace, thoſe endeavours are not accepted. That it pleaſeth God to accept the will for the deed; it is one of the priviledges of the Saints, that comes by the Covenant of grace: but it belongs not to others, they have not to do with this immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and priviledge. So I might name
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40440:76"/>
divers others, but then I ſhould go out too far.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Saints have acceſſe to the Throne of Grace.</note>Again, this is a glorious priviledge of acceſſe to the throne of grace, to come to God in prayer. God gives them the key of all his treaſures to come, and open them, and take what they will; it is a glorious priviledge that belongs to the Saints in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. God gives them a gracious praying heart, and that is the key of all the treaſures of God, of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of God, that they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to come and take out what they will, <hi>be it unto thee as thou wilt.</hi> Theſe <hi>are the excellent of the earth,</hi> that have theſe priviledges.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Saints are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent on earth.</note>Again, they are the excellent in earth in regard of that which comes from them. As the work of grace is ſo excellent as hath been ſpoken of: ſo every gracious action that comes from a gracious heart there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous excellency in it. There is not any one gracious action, but it hath more excellency then heaven and earth. Not onely grace it ſelf, but any

               <note place="margin">Luther an advancer of faith and holineſs.</note>It is an expreſſion of <hi>Luther,</hi> (though he were a great advancer of faith, yet he was alſo an advancer of holineſſe as well as of faith; therefore ſpeaking of any gracious work of a godly man or woman, ſaith he, <hi>precioſa &amp;c.</hi> it is more precious then heaven and earth.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vſe.</note>Which (by the way) ſhould teach us to abound in holy duties; though our actions as they are from us cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, we look on them as deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet know that God looks on them as the moſt glorious things in the world, any breathing of a gracious heart, therefore <hi>he deſpiſeth not the broken heart, nor the ſighing of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> Pſalm. 51.17. God can deſpiſe Monarchs, and Princes of the world: but God cannot deſpiſe a broken

heart, nor any breathings from it. Though thou mayeſt deſpiſe it thy ſelf, and look on it as deſpicable, the Lord cannot deſpiſe it: he ſees ſo much excellency in it, though it be mixed with thy corruptions; yet there is that remainder of excellency in it, if there be but ſo much as may denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it a gracious act, it is a glorious thing in the eye of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (to name no more) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Saints appears in this, the great uſe that they are of in the world. As eſpecially this is one thing that God attains in them his great aim and end in creating the whole world. Were it not for a few gracious men, and women, what glory ſhould God have in all the world? They are thoſe that hold up the glory of God in the world, by which God hath his glory actively; for that is that God aims at. It is true God can force glory in ſpight of mens hearts, he will be glorified in ſpight of Devils: but God hath no active glory, but from gracious, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people (I ſpeak of the inferiour
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40440:78"/>
world) it is onely the godly that God hath glory from. Therefore were it not for them God (in ſome kind) had made all the world for nothing. Now thoſe that are imployed in ſuch a great work, and are of this great uſe in the world, as to bring to God that which he made the world for, the main, and great end that he made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth for; certainly theſe are principall in Gods eſteem, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. God can ſay I have my end in theſe: Take any town where there are but two or three that are godly, what glory hath God but of theſe? So for other places where hath God glory but for a few contemptibile ones? They are theſe that God glorifies in high and great ſervices: theſe are the lights of the world, the ſalt of the earth: they are theſe that are the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the world whereſoever they are; they are theſe for whom the world continueth ſo as it doth. There is a notable expreſſion in Iſaiah, <hi>In that day ſhall Iſrael be the third with Egypt, and with Aſſyria, even a bleſsing in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40440:78"/>
middeſt of the Land, whom the Lord of hoſts ſhall bleſſe, ſaying, bleſſed be Egypt my people, and Aſsyria the work of my hands, and Iſrael mine inheritance.</hi> Iſaiah 19.24.25. Whereſoever they are in a Kingdom, or a family, or a town, they are a bleſſing in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in that town, and in that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Iſrael ſhall be a bleſſing in the middeſt of the Land. Theſe are they that are the excellent of the earth.</p>
            <p>I would now willingly be over this that I may come to the other, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a word or two of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. And that is.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ſhew what a vaſt difference there is between thoſe that are godly, &amp; thoſe that are wicked. Many things I might ſhew that the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth of wicked ones in all their glory: let all the glory of the world be put upon them, yet the Scripture ſpeaks exceedingly contemptuouſly of them. I muſt not ſpend time in thoſe expreſſions, onely one, and that is Daniel. <hi>And in his eſtate ſhall ſtand up a vile perſon, to whom they ſhall not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40440:79"/>
give the honour of the Kingdome: but he ſhall come in peaceably, and obtain the Kingdom by flatteries.</hi> Daniel 11.21. It is ſpoken (as moſt Interpreters carry it) of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> he is called a vile perſon, we may obſerve that <hi>David</hi> doth here more fully ſet out the love and affection he bears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that feare God by the contrary effect of hatred wherewith he doth proſecute the wicked, as in the 4. v. of this Pſalm, &amp; in the 4. verſ. of the foregoing Pſalm, the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,</hi> but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. Pſalm. 15.4. Of this <hi>Antiochus</hi> there are three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet he is called a vile perſon. Firſt, he was a great enemy to many ſinnes. Secondly, when the Iews wrote to him, becauſe they feared his wrath, he being a perſecutor of the Iews; there were ſome that lived in Samaria that were Samaritans that wrote to him to deſire his favour, that were not their own ſelves Iews, but Samaritans: and <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40440:79"/>
wrote to him in this ſtile, <hi>To An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Antiochus the mighty God</hi>; they gave him this title of honour. He was a great man on earth accounted where he lived; among the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, a mighty god; yet the Scripture calls him a vile perſon. And then his name <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> which is as much as illuſtrious or glorious. He hath that title of almighty god, and illuſtrious, and glorious, and yet he was a vile perſon. Thus it is, where God ſees not the work of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vſe.</note>The conſideration of this might give us ſome hope that there will be a time wherein God will appear for his Saints. It is not probable that God will alwayes ſuffer his Iewels to be trodden under feet in the world; that God will alway look upon ſuch as are excellent on earth, and ſee them ſo abuſed in the world, &amp; ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as they are; ſurely this will not be alwayes, God hath this time to make it manifeſt to the world, that they are the excellent of the earth. They are now Iewels, yet they are ſuch as are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40440:80"/>
in the dirt, and ſo are deſpiſed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: but there is a promiſe, that <hi>the Lord their God ſhall ſave them in that day as the flock of his people for they ſhall be as the ſtones of a crown, lifted up as an enſign upon his Land.</hi> Zach. 9.16. As the ſtones of a Crown, God will lift them up and make them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>And there is another Text which is very obſervable; for every one to take notice of Gods intention to make theſe excellent ones famous on earth. <hi>The governours of Iudah ſhall ſay in their heart, The inhabitants of Ieruſalem ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of hoſts their God.</hi> Zach. 12.5. There was a time when the governours of Iudah deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe that were gracious &amp; godly; but God hath promiſed that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Iudah ſhall be convinced of their errour, and ſhall ſay in their hearts <hi>the inhabitants of Ieruſalem ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of hoſts their God:</hi> However now through the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of the world; however now through the reproaches that are caſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40440:80"/>
upon the Saints of God, it falls out many time, that even the governours of Iudah deſpiſe and contemne them, and ſay they are ſeduced people, that they are factious and turbulent, and ſo their hearts are againſt them, &amp; hate, and abhorre them, &amp; look upon them with ſuch an evill eye, as thoſe that they name puritans: yet there is a time promiſed when the governours of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah ſhall ſay in their hearts the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ieruſalem are my ſtrength in the Lord of hoſts. O ye inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Gods Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his ſanctified ones (for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> typified the eſtate of Gods people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell; Gods ſanctified ones under the Goſpell) ſhall be ſuch as the governours of Iudah in their hearts ſhall ſay, My ſtrength is in them. I ſee they are my beſt ſubjects, my chief ſtrength is in them, and they are of principall uſe for me, and my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is upheld in peace for them, and there is the bleſſing of God on them, they ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of hoſts their God. Now I ſee God is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40440:81"/>
their God; God hears their prayers, and hath done much for them, we are convinced of it. O this will be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time, when it ſhall be that the governours of Iudah ſhall ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God that they do ſay ſo in any meaſure, that the governours of Iudah ſay at all of the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of the godly, that their ſtrength is in them: that they may ſee thoſe that are the excellent of the earth, in any meaſure to be truly the excellent of the earth.</p>
            <p>It were a ruefull ſpectacle, and would draw tears of bloud, to ſee the excellent ones to have that uſage that they have had. But now to ſee thoſe excellent ones countenanced in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick way, eſpecially in publick courts of Iuſtice, it is glorious, when the governours of Iudah ſhall do it. And this we are to pray for, that it may be more and more ſeen amongſt us, and to ſay no more; let us learn to honour them that God hath honoured: ſince they are excellent ones, and God hath put excellency upon them, do
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40440:81"/>
you ſo too, look on them according as God eſteems them. It is obſerved, that God in the time of the law did not require them to offer in ſacrifice, Lions and Eagles, thoſe brave crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but Lambs and Doves, mean creatures, he would have offered in ſacrifice. So God doth not regard the brave ſpirits of the world that ſtrut it out; but if there be any that be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and godly though they he never ſo poor and mean, as Lambs and Doves, God honours and reſpects them, they are a ſacrifice to him; the broken heart is a ſacrifice to God.<note place="margin">

            <p>That ſhould teach us, if the heathens when they ſee their God put honour on any, they honour ſuch as God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, then when you ſee or hear that God honours gracious &amp; godly men, and women, do you ſo too; prize them, let them have high eſteem in your

Somewhat for the people of God; to walk as excellent ones, not to defile one another. And for others, if they would be thoſe here in the world that be excellent and glorious; it is not the outward things of the world that hang on you; as clothes, and riches that make you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ones in the eye of God, but it is grace, and godlineſſe.

            <p>Some think there is no way to get eſteem, but by outward bravery, great livings, fine clothes and the like; and men think that the way to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more eminent then others, is to be rich, and to wear fine cloaths &amp; get honours and ſuch like; but theſe are fading and not permanent.

reſpect for any thing in themſelves, they have no ſpirituall excellency; eſpecially when they are to deal with God, and the conſciences of men, they have no reſpect. But godly men have not ſo many ſervants to gain reſpect by outward things: but that reſpect they have of Gods Saints, and in the conſciences of men they have it from an internall excellency. But we let this go.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point follows, <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of the earth. In whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is but little that can be done I ſee, though it were the point I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended moſt. That that hath been ſaid already makes way abundantly into the heart, that if they be the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth, there is cauſe that we ſhould delight in them.<note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That is the point, that <hi>a gracious heart takes great delight in the Saints on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt in their perſons.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly in their ſociety, and communion with them.</p>
            <p>Or rather thus; they take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40440:85"/>
in them, ſeverally and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>If they look upon any one Saint of God, they have deligt in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they have more to look on all the Saints together jointly; ſo they can ſay their ſouls delight in them, there is a ſweet complacency taken in them jointly. And that is that which I ſhall ſpeak to at this time; The delight that is to be taken in the Saints jointly together. There is delight in the Saints in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſweetneſſe of their ſociety and communion with them. For ſo this delight of <hi>David</hi> is to be taken in a large ſence; not onely in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, becauſe of the good that he ſaw in their perſons: but in regard of all the good he ſaw in them, and by them in joyning with them take them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether jointly. All the good that came from them; ſo he delighted in them. There is a great deal of delight and contentment to be had in the Saints of God, eſpecially jointly.</p>
            <p>If you look at one ſometimes (though in never ſo mean a condition)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40440:85"/>
there is a great deal of delight there. As Doctor <hi>Tayler</hi> the Martyr, that we read of in the book of Martyrs coming to <hi>Bradford,</hi> he profeſſed that it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailed all his trouble in priſon, that he was acquainted with that Angel of God <hi>Iohn Bradford,</hi> meaning him in particular. And another that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he had rather be with <hi>Cato,</hi> (a heathen) for his morall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in priſon then with <hi>Ceſar</hi> in the Senate in all his pomp. To be ſhut up with one godly man is a great deal of delight and contentment: what a great deal of delight is there then in their being together, and in that way wherein moſt of their excellencies appear? ſuch delight is in them joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Communion of Saints is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>Firſt, becauſe the moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table communion that poſſible can be is enjoyed with them, and in them: for</p>
            <p>Firſt, is it not a moſt delightfull thing to ſee a company of godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together to behold the reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent beauty, and glory of the graces
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40440:86"/>
of Gods ſpirit? If there were nothing elſe, what a delightfull thing is it ſaith the heart? The very ſight of good men is pleaſing and delightfull to thoſe that look upon their faces: wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome makes their faces ſhine. The ſeeing of the reſplendent grace of God in them is very delightfull. What is the delight of God, but the ſeeing of the ſhining of his glory in his works? eſpecially when God ſees that which is the ſhining of his higheſt glory, as his own grace and holineſſe, that God delights in moſt. So when a gracious heart ſees his own image, &amp; that grace that God hath wrought in him, he ſees it reſplendently in others, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull object.</p>
            <p>Again, there is a comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them in regard of the fragrancie of grace. The beauty of grace is delightfull, but the fragrancy, the breathings of grace, are ſweet in the heart. The beholding of it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to the eye, but the workings of their grace is exceeding ſweet, and comfortable to the heart: Therefore
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40440:86"/>
ſaith the Church, <hi>Let my beloved go down into the gardens, among the beds of ſpices to feed in the gardens, and to gather ſpices.</hi> Cant. 6.2. All the Churches of God in the world are as the garden of Chriſt; and every particular Church in that garden is as a bed of ſpices; and every particular Saint is as the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of that bed, &amp; eſpecially the fragrant ſmell is very ſweet.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of Alexander, his very body was of ſuch a conſtitution, that where ever he went there was a ſweet ſavour came from his body. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where there is but one of Gods children, there is ſweetneſſe from him; but where there is a company joyntly, there is a wonderfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ſweetneſſe comes from them, it is exceeding comfortable to a gracious heart to be among them.</p>
            <p>Again, their communion is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and delightfull jointly, in regard of the nearneſſe; there being no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under heaven, wherein there is that nearneſſe one to another, as of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40440:87"/>
the Saints. Obſerve, (that you may ſee how near they come together, and are made one, and ſo are exceeding delightfull one to another) any thing the more ſpirituall they are, the more they are united; the more corporeall they are, the leſſe union. A heap of ſtones are not united, as the ſeverall beams of the ſun, a thouſand of them are united in one point, becauſe they are of a ſpirituall nature. So it is with the ſpirits of men, the more carnall any men, and any ſociety is, the leſſe union: therefore the reaſon why the people of God many times are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and not united is, becauſe they are carnall, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>Are ye not carnall,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,when there were diviſions? were you ſpirituall you would be more united one to another, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men are carnally minded.</p>
            <p>It is with ſpirituall ſociety in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſpirituall union, as it is with the ſociety of wickedneſſe. There is bodily, fleſhly wickedneſſe, and there is ſpirituall wickedneſſe. Now thoſe that joyn together in groſſe bodily
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40440:87"/>
wickedneſſe, they are not ſo cloſely united as thoſe that joyn in ſpirituall wickedneſſe. A companion of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards or whoremongers, they take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in one another, and joyn in wickedneſſe, but it is corporall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſoon fall out, and fly in the faces one of another. But thoſe that joyn in ſpirituall wickedneſſe, as poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ambitious men, men that joyn in miſchief in a ſpirituall way, they keep mighty cloſe, and you cannot eaſily break their bond of union; they will ſuffer much before they will diſcover one another, and break union one with another, becauſe their union is in a way of ſpirituall wickedneſſe. So on the contrary, when any are united in the ſpirit of holineſſe, they are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united, there is no ſuch union under heaven as that.</p>
            <p>We read of the curtains of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. there were ſome of them that were made of purple, &amp; ſcarlet, and fine linen, and their teaches that held them together were pure gold. There were others of goats hair,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40440:88"/>
and their buckles were braſſe. So it may ſet out the different condition of men in the Church: There are ſome in the Church that are truly gracious and godly, that excell in grace; and they are united by tacks of gold; their union is mighty ſtrong and glorious in their hearts. There are others in the Church, outward profeſſours that are carnall, that are goats hair, goats in the Church; and they maintain a union too, but it is but braſſe, the ground and bottome of the union is but mean; it is not ſuch a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den union, as the union of the hearts of Gods people; there are no people under heaven ſo united as they.</p>
            <p>It is true, through their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is a great deal of diſſention (as there is corruption in the beſt) but that is as farre as they are carnall; the more ſpirituall they grow, the more near is their union one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the more entire is their love,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9.</note> 
               <hi>My beloved is one,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Church, <hi>ſhe is the choice of one
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40440:88"/>
of her that bare her, and the daughters ſaw her and bleſſed her.</hi> There is an oneneſſe, and intireneſſe in the hearts of the Saints, and this makes them to be bleſſed by thoſe that behold them, and makes their communion very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</p>
            <p>That is the firſt particular, their communion is moſt delightfull of all other communions: therefore David ſaith, <hi>all my delight is in them,</hi> taking them together.</p>
            <p>But then in the ſecond place, A gracious heart muſt needs delight in the Saints, if you take them jointly; becauſe that when they are together, there God is worſhipped: the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt worſhip that God hath is from the Saints joyned together. As I told you before that the glory that God had in the world was from them all: but the ſolemnity of Gods worſhip cannot be but from them jointly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Therefore the great delight of a gracious heart is to be with the ſaints when they are jointly together: becauſe there the name of God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40440:89"/>
and they worſhip God in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne way; God is honoured among them.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf much delights in the Saints when they are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the duties of holy worſhip, do but compare two Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that will both make us in love with the Saints, and delight in joynt communion with them. Compare Pſalm. 22.22. with Heb. 2.12. The Pſalme is a propheſie of Chriſt; and generally all interpreters go this way, that it is ſo, it appears by the Pſalme that Chriſt eſpecially is meant: the Text ſaith, <hi>I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the middeſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation will I praiſe thee.</hi> It is the promiſe of Chriſt to declare the name of his father to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the middeſt of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he ſhall praiſe God. Mark it, in Heb. 2.12. the Apoſtle applies it to the Saints joyned together, ſaying, <hi>I will declare the name unto my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the middeſt of the Church, will I ſing praiſe unto thee.</hi> This was after
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40440:89"/>
Chriſt had been in the fleſh, yet the Apoſtle applies this to the Church, <hi>in the middeſt of the Church, will I ſing prayſe unto thee.</hi> This they gather hence, that Chriſt he delights in being with his people when they are jointly together, becauſe of the ſolemne worſhip of God, that is tendered to God by them, and he joynes with them in it as a delightfull work: as they are together to praiſe God, Chriſt is praiſing him; as they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Chriſt is worſhipping. Now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint of God hath the ſpirit of Chriſt in him, and ſo he delights in the ſociety of the Saints on this ground, becauſe there is worſhipping of God, and God is praiſed ſolemnly among them. If there be any place in the world, wherein God hath ſolemne worſhip, it cannot be grieve a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, that he is not with them, for his heart is with them, he delights to be with them, eſpecially in ſuch a work as that; it grieves him that he cannot be there.</p>
            <p>It is a note of an Interpreter that I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40440:90"/>
have met with upon Iſaiah. 6. where the Angles cry <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Hosts,</hi> the Prophet cryes, <hi>Woe unto me for I am undone,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith he, upon this ground, becauſe he could not joyn with thoſe bleſſed creatures, and ſo magnifie, and praiſe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; that he through his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe was not able to joyn with them, he cryes, <hi>Woe is me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi> So when any gracious heart doth but hear, that there is a people in the world that are precious ones, the excellent on earth, that joyn in the worſhip of God, and honour God in his own way, and enjoy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and I cannot joyn with them, woe to me that there ſhould be any let or hinderance that I cannot come and joyn with them: for my heart is there, my delight is in the Saints when they are jointly together: becauſe Gods ſolemne worſhip is there.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, my delight is in the Saints jointly, in regard of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull delight God hath in them. A
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40440:90"/>
gracious heart muſt needs delight in them, becauſe God himſelf takes ſo much delight in them: but eſpecially when they are jointly together. There are ſpeciall expreſſions in Scripture of Gods taking delight in the Saints jointly, as in Zephany Zeph. 3.17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the middeſt of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over thee with joy: he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> What expreſſions are here of Gods delighting in his people! <hi>The Lord thy God will rejoyce, he will rejoyce over thee with joy; he will love, he will reſt in his love, and joy, and joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> And in Iſaiah, you ſhall find that the Church is called Hephzibah, Gods delight: <hi>Thou ſhalt no more be termed, Forſaken; neither ſhall thy Land any more be termed, Deſolate: but thou ſhalt be called Hephzi bah, and thy land, Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land ſhall be married.</hi> Iſaiah 62.4. it is a wondrous delight that God hath in his Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40440:91"/>There are wonderfull expreſſions in Scripture for the manifeſting of Gods delight, even to admiration; eſpecially in the Church jointly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. They are ſuch expreſſions as we could not think or invent: as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, that he calls his people his <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his pleaſant portion, for the Lords portion is his people: Iacob is the lot of his inheritance.</hi> Deut. 32.9. God calls them <hi>his inheritance, the lot of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi>: Ier. 12.7. he calls them <hi>the dearly beloved of his ſoul</hi>; Exod. 19.5. he calls them <hi>his peculiar treaſure. Now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people.</hi> God hath treaſures in the world; the creatures that are called the <hi>good treaſures of the Lord</hi>: Deut. 28. but his people are called his peculiar treaſure, there is a particularity: There is another kind of excellency in the people of Gods delight, then in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; they are his common treaſure, but his people are his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſure. God calls them <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40440:91"/>
I will glorifie the houſe of my glory, I will place ſalvation in Zion for my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Iſa. 46.13. <hi>The crown of his glory,</hi> Iſa. 60.7. he calls them the <hi>Throne of his glory,</hi> Iſa. 62.3. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a Crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall diadeem in the hand of thy God.</hi> In ſeverall places that I cannot ſtand on. His glory, the Houſe of his glory, the Crown of his glory, the Throne of his glory. He calls them the royall Diadeem, he calls them his ornament, an ornament ſet in Majeſty and glory. There are the expreſſions, and more I might name of Gods delighting in his people. Therefore if God delight in them and find ſatisfaction, much more ſhould we.</p>
            <p>Chriſts ſpeaks of his Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>O my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, my heart is raviſhed with thee.</hi> It is a ſtrange expreſſion, for Chriſt himſelf to be raviſhed with his people. It is an expreſſion beſeeming the Church, to have ſaid ſo to Chriſt, but for Chriſt to ſay to the Church, it is wonderfull. And again, <hi>My love,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40440:92"/>
my dove, my undefiled one,</hi> Cant. 2. and at that very time when the Church was in a ſtate of ſecurity, that Chriſt ſhould call her his love, his dove, his undefiled; all to expreſſe the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of delight in his people. Well if God have ſuch delight in them, much more ſhould the Saints.</p>
            <p>Again, if we conſider further, the preſence of God among his people, it is another argument why the Saints of God ſhould take ſo much delight in other Saints, eſpecially when they are joyned together, becauſe God is preſent there. <hi>The Lord is here,</hi> is the name of all their aſſemblies, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.11.</note>
               <hi>The Lord dwells, and hath his tabernacle in Sion.</hi> It is a ſtrange expreſſion concerning the preſence of God, in that he makes his people his habitation. As the people of God call God their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo God calls his Church his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. <hi>God dwells in Sion.</hi> Pſal. 90. Would you not delight to keep houſe with God? Where Gods people are, God keeps houſe: and we ſhould long to have it our own houſe, and not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40440:92"/>
come as ſtrangers. A man may come as a ſtranger, and take a bit, and be refreſhed in a family; but it is not his houſe, But now Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when they go to others of the Saints they ſee God there, and they have that houſe for their houſe. It is called (as I told you) <hi>the houſe of his glory</hi>; that houſe that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to dwell in; he hath a mighty love to that houſe, to dwell among his people. In Pſalm. 132. there are many great and excellent expreſſions. <hi>For the Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his habitation,</hi> Pſal. 132.13, 14. God deſires Zion; what is Zion, but onely his Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple joyned together? Zion was a type of the Church: ſo now all the Saints of God together are Zion. Now God hath a deſire to this habitation. God dwells in the high and holy place, the higheſt heaven is God habitation; but though God have ſuch a houſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet he is not (as it were) contented with that houſe, but he deſires an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other houſe: he hath a deſire to Zion
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40440:93"/>
to be his habitation, and the houſe where his honour dwelleth. You know a Prince may have ſome houſes of meaner regard, when he goes to his ſport, he may have a mean houſe to lodge in for a while: but his pallace where he ſhews his Majeſtie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that is more glorious. So the people of God, and the Church, is called the houſe of Gods honour, it is not a mean houſe, but a houſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Further, it is that houſe that he means to dwell in for ever, he loves it ſo well. This is my houſe, I will dwell in it for ever. I am ſo well pleaſed with it, I will reſt in it for ever. Surely, we have cauſe to reſt our hearts in Gods people, when God finds reſt there, and for ever.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome of you are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acquainted with the people of God, &amp; at the firſt delight in them: but your hearts being carnall you ſoon grow weary of them. It is not ſo with God, he delights in his people, and reſts there, and reſts there for ever.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I anſwer, in two regards God is ſaid to dwell among his people in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe he makes himſelf known to his people, more then to all the world beſides. There are none that know the counſell and mind of God, ſo as his Saints do. <hi>God is known in Iudah.</hi> Pſal. 29.9. There God opens himſelf, <hi>In his Temple every man ſpeaks of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf moſt among his people, God is ſaid to be in heaven. Why? but becauſe there he manifeſts his glory more then in other places; therefore heaven is his habitation. If that be his habitation where he manifeſts himſelf more, then his people are his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he manifeſts himſelf moſt there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heaven is the place of Gods reſidence, becauſe he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40440:94"/>
himſelf moſt there: then alſo Gods people are his reſidence, he communicates himſelf there. And he communicates himſelf to them in a ſpeciall manner, in four regards.
<list>
                  <item>1. He communicates to his people more choiſe mercies.</item>
                  <item>2. He communicates mercies more fully.</item>
                  <item>3. He communicates mercies more powerfully.</item>
                  <item>4. More univerſally, then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He communicates goodneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people and Saints more choiſely, more choiſe mercies of God. There is a remarkable place in the Pſalmes, <hi>The Lord that made heaven and earth bleſſe thee out of Zion.</hi> Pſalm. 143. ult. He ſaith not the Lord that made heaven and earth bleſſe thee, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of heaven or earth, but out of Zion, as nothing that the choiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that God hath to communicate are out of Zion; among his people joyned together in the way of wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip. Would you deſire that God
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40440:94"/>
ſhould bleſſe you with the chief mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he hath? look upon God as bleſſing out of Zion; out of Zion God communicates his choiſeſt mercies: therefore it concerns all to be in Zion, that they may have God to bleſſe them out of Zion; there runs the ſweeteſt of Gods mercies indeed in Zion.</p>
            <p>Again, God communicates his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies more fully among his people then any other way. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 36.7, 8. How excellent is thy loving kindneſſe, O God! therefore the children of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings.

While they are alone in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they may have many ſweet drops of pleaſure from God, but when they are joyned with the Saints, there are rivers of pleaſure, and delight that come to their hearts: therefore there is great delight to be had in the Saints of God when they are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he communicates them more powerfully, mark, in Pſal. 133.3. <hi>As the dew of Hermon, and the dew that deſcended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded a bleſsing, even life for ever more.</hi> There was bleſſing, &amp; the Lord commanded it: there went a powerfull work of Gods grace upon the hearts of people there, when they were joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Zion: there God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſing. If you would have God ſpeaking powerfully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a bleſſing on your ſouls you muſt be among his people, you muſt joyn in a holy fellowſhip with his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40440:95"/>
people; there God commands it.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, more univerſally all the goodneſſe of God is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated among his people, therefore the Church is called <hi>the perfection of beauty</hi>; Pſam. 50. that ſome tranſlate, the univerſality of excellency and beauty. There is a univerſality of all among the Church and people of God. And in another place, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee.</hi> Pſam. 87. ſpeaking of joyning with the people of God, that is, all my ſprings of truth that are revealed to me; all the ſprings of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that I have communicated to my ſoul, all the ſprings of grace that I have; to quicken me, they are all in thee in the joynt ſociety and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Gods people, I find all. Thus we ſee the preſence of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people in regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of himſelf to them, and therefore what a great deal of cauſe there is to joy, and delight in the Saints jointly together.</p>
            <p>Again further there is abundance of cauſe to delight in them joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40440:96"/>
in regard of their admirable priviledges as they are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have priviledges as they are alone, but as they are joyned they have committed to them the <hi>oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3.2. all the ordinances by which God conveyes himſelf. To them are committed the ſeal of the covenant, you cannot ſingly have the ſeal of the covenant, but joyned with the people of God, cloſing with them. To them is committed the very power of Ieſus Chriſt: ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, When ye are together with the power of Ieſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. a glorious priviledge. Yea, further, take this one thing they are inheritours to all the promiſes that ever God made to the Church from the beginning of the world. There is no ſociety of Saints that joyn in Chriſtian fellowſhip, but they are ſo. See a remarkable place for that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper, and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee in judgement thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: this is the heritage of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40440:96"/>
of the Lord, and their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs is of me, ſaith the LORD. That promiſe that God made to the Churches before, this is their heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And conceive of this one now that is of great uſe, that all that is ſaid in Scripture concerning Gods delight to be among his people, and in Zion, all were but to type out the excellent condition of Gods Church in the times of the Goſpell. The moſt of the expreſſions are of Gods delight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people in the time of the law: but know that all thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were but meer types, and there is a great deal more in the Antitype then in the type: therefore the Saints of God joyned under the Goſpell have abundance more of the glory of God, of the preſence of God, and of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, then Zion had, or Ieruſalem could have; becauſe that was but a type of their happy condition under the time of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>It is an obſervable place that we have in the Hebrews, it is ſaid concerning the ſtate of the Church, that <hi>the law
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40440:97"/>
had but a ſhadow of good things to come.</hi> Heb. 10.1. and not the very image of the things. It is not ſo much as an image: obſerve, a ſhadow is not ſo much as an image; but an image is not ſo much as the thing it ſelf: but that was not an image, but a ſhadow. As a Painter that takes an image, he draws firſt the dark ſhadow with a cole, there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that ſhadow, and the image in beauty: ſo much difference there is between all the glory of God in the Church in the time of the law, and that glory of God that is among his people in the time of the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We may ſafely ſay, there is the like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Gods manifeſting of himſelf to his people then, and now; as between a dark ſhadow drawn with a cole in compariſon of an image. But mark, it was but a ſhadow of the image; that which we have now is but an image. As there is not ſo much in a ſhadow as in the image, ſo there is not ſo much in the image as in the thing it ſelf. The preſence of God and all his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40440:97"/>
goodneſſe to his people, and his glory to his people now, it is but an image to that which ſhall be; there ſhall be another preſence of God, another communication, and revelation of God hereafter, in another kind then there is now; all that we have now is but an image of that which ſhall be; all that was in the law was but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that image: therefore we ſhould have a great deal of delight in the Saints.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid further, for delighting in them now, becauſe they are thoſe that we ſhall live for ever with in heaven hereafter. Look to the Saints eſpecially together, they are thoſe that we ſhall live eternally toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with in heaven, therefore they are thoſe that we ſhould delight in. They are thoſe that we ſhall be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with for ever in everlaſting hale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs, before him that ſis upon the throne, and the Lamb. Look upon any Saint, though he be never ſo mean in gifts and abilities, thou and he ſhall alway joy in the preſence of God in glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:40440:98"/>Yea to be among Gods people is heaven it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are not onely thoſe that we ſhall be with in heaven, but it is heaven. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I create a new heaven and a new earth.</hi> Iſa. 65.17. The ſtate of the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heaven, For what is there in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but is here? I might ſhew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of heaven, and that which is in heaven is here among us, and therefore if heaven be a place to be delighted in, the Saints are.</p>
            <p>Therefore have a high eſteem of the Saints, cloſe with them, and come into as near communion as is poſſible. If they be ſo excellent, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, then eſpecially when they are joyned together labour all to come in, and joyn with the Saints in the neareſt union that is poſsible, in that fellowſhip wherein you may (as near as can be) have fellowſhip onely with them, eſpecially that have the appearance of ſuch.</p>
            <p>The mixture of our communion doth much hinder our delight. Caſt dirt into the fire, and it will damp it:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40440:98"/>
ſo the mixture of ungodly ones, their ſpots and blemiſhes hinder the delight of Gods people one in another. But now to come among thoſe that your hearts may cloſe with, that you have comfortable evidence, that they are not meer talkers of religion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours at large, but that the image of God is on them, O what cloſing is there with their hearts, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable good might we enjoy in the communion and ſociety of them. Therefore know that it is one of the greateſt bleſsings that you are capable of in this world to have the neareſt communion with the Saints next to your immediate communion with God himſelf; it is that which you ſhould ſo eſteem; and your hearts ſhould work after. Mark that Text Pſalme. 36. what is ſaid of our joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the people of God, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is thy loving kindneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appears the excellency? They ſhall be ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of thy houſe. It is a fruit of the excellency of the loving kindneſſe of God for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40440:99"/>
to be of Gods houſe, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fatneſſe of it. To have abundance of Gods creatures, and to have an eſtate, and friends, it is a fruit of Gods kindneſſe: but to joyn with Gods people in a way of worſhip and in the neareſt union, that is a fruit of the excellent loving kindneſſe of God to admiration. How excellent is thy loving kindneſſe? it was ſo excellent that he was not able to expreſſe the excellency of it.</p>
            <p>It is made in Scripture to be the proper inheritance even of the elect of God; to enjoy communion with the people of God, in the type, it is a fruit of the very inheritance of the elect of God; ſo as it is oppoſed to all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world. Mark what God ſaith by Iſaiah,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.13.</note> 
               <hi>Vanity ſhall take them away, but he that putteth his truſt in me ſhall poſſeſſe the Land, and ſhall inherit the holy Mountain and ſhall ſay, caſt ye up, caſt ye up, prepare the way, take up the ſtumbling block out of the way of my people, For thus ſaith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40440:99"/>

            </p>
            <p>Here is a firm inheritance indeed, the Saints ſhall poſſeſſe the holy mountain. God dwelleth on high, in the higheſt heavens, and the Saints that are of a contrite and humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with him.

Nay, every part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of the Saints ſhall be glorified, Chriſt ſhall make our vile bodies like his glorious body, ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> There is no queſtion, but his body is glorified throughout; there cannot be the leaſt ſhade of darkneſs, for he is the Sun of righteouſneſs, &amp; ſo ſhall all the juſt, they ſhall ſhine as the Sun; every glorified Saint by the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

without man, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and without beaſt, yet the voice of joy and the voice of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the voice of the Bridegroom &amp; the voice of the Bride, the voice of them that ſhall ſay, praiſe the LORD of hoſts, for the Lord is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his mercy endureth for ever; this voice ſhall be to the inhabitants of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. But by what means ſhall theſe mercies be beſtowed on then? in this Text, he tells them where ever they are afflicted or in any great diſtreſſe, call unto me, and I will anſwer thee. And as Chriſt in the Goſpell, having the book of the Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto him, when he was in the Synagogue, read apart of it, then cloſed the book, and began his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the people; this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.21. So may I ſay of this Text, that we have out of this Prophecy read unto you.</p>
            <p>Behold this day hath the Lord full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this word of his in our ears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. And therefore is it that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40440:101"/>
we are all here this day met before the Lord, that we may witneſs unto this his good word and promiſe, <hi>Call unto me, and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things, which thou knoweſt not.</hi> In the two laſt Verſes of this Chapter, the Lord promiſeth to eſtabliſh a Covenant with <hi>David</hi> and raiſe up a deliverance to the ſeed of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and cauſe them to return out of their captivities, &amp; he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them.</p>
            <p>That which he ſaith to his people, he ſpeaks it plainly and openly, <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark place of the earth.</hi> The heathen Gods did ſpeak darkly and ambiguouſly to their worſhippers, that they knew not what to make of their words; but I have not done ſo to you, ſaith God. They would have you worſhip them, but they cannot help you when you have ſo done; it is not ſo with me, Thus ſaith the Lord, if my Covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, then will I caſt away the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40440:102"/>
ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, the Church of God, the Saints.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Why are the people of God called <hi>the ſeed of Iacob,</hi> rather then <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> or <hi>the ſeed of Iſaac? the ſeed of Iacob.</hi> The reaſons may be theſe two. Firſt, becauſe that all Iacobs poſterity were the Church of God; all Iacobs children the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, were every one of the Church; All that came from Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham were not ſo, Iſhmael was not ſo; All that came from Iſaac were not ſo, Eſau was not; But all Iacobs children were: therefore ſpeaking of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, of the Church that ſhould be to the end of the world, they are ſaid here to be <hi>the ſeed of Iacob,</hi> rather then <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> or <hi>of Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, <hi>the ſeed of Iacòb,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is here ſpeaking of the bleſſing of his ſeed, namely in the hearing of their prayers. <hi>Call unto me, and</hi> I <hi>will anſwer thee.</hi> Now becauſe Iacob was the moſt eminent in prayer, (though Abraham and Iſaac
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40440:102"/>
no queſtion were mighty with God in prayer yet,) the Scripture doth not put ſuch an eminency either upon A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braham or Iſaac for prayer as upon Iacob. You have the moſt eminent expreſſion for prayer that ever was ſpoken of any man, never the like. Gen. 32.28. <hi>And he ſaid, thy name ſhall be called no more Iacob, but Iſrael: for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and with men, and haſt prevailed.</hi> O how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent was he in prayer. Therefore it is rather ſaid, <hi>the ſeed of Iacob,</hi> then <hi>of Abraham</hi> or <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, then they ſhould rather have been called the ſeed of Iſrael: for his name of Iſrael was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him upon his prevailing with God.</p>
            <p>We muſt not be too inquiſitive. Theſe names are uſed promiſcuouſly. But, this is one reaſon that is given, and it ſeemeth to have probability with it.</p>
            <p>In Scripture when God ſpeaks of the Church in a low condition, he puts the name of Iacob on them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40440:103"/>
then Iſrael: <hi>Fear not, thou worm Iacob</hi>: and it follows, <hi>ye men of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 41.14. He puts them in mind of their low condition by this name ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Iſrael; <hi>Fear not thou worm Iacob</hi>: For before Iacobs name was changed, ye know what a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what ſtreights he was in. So here, the Lord ſpeaking of his Churches deliverance out of diſtreſs, he calls them the <hi>ſeed of Iacob,</hi> that they might ſee how by their prayers they were brought from their ſtreights, as Iacob was brought from his ſtreights by prayer. When he was Iacob before he was Iſrael, he was in great ſtreights: ſo ſhall the Church be till they ſeek God. Call unto me and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things which thou knoweſt not.</p>
            <p>That is, firſt, I did require it of them, and my requiring did prevail with them: I did not exhort them to it, or require it, and my words fell to the ground and they did not call unto me; but what I required of them was
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40440:103"/>
effected in them. When God ſpeaks to a people, and they do not what he requires, his word may ſeem to be ſlighted, there being no efficacy in his words to prevail. But ſaith God, Call unto mee, and I will anſwer thee, that is, I called not on my people to call unto me and they went their own way; but what I ſpake to them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them, and in them, and they did that which I required. This is a bleſſed thing that we do that which the Lord requires of us to be done. That is the firſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, call unto me, and I will anſwer thee, that is, I did not onely command, but I did promiſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. They calling unto me in a right manner, by that way &amp; means which I directed them, I promiſed to anſwer their deſires, when that they ſhould call unto me.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that the principall ſcope of the holy Ghoſt is that which the words plainly preſent to our view; That we muſt call upon God, before
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40440:104"/>
he will hear and anſwer our requeſts. God requires his people to call unto him, and he is pleaſed to be found of them; and not onely to anſwer them, but to do abundantly for them.</p>
            <p>So then this point ariſeth plainly out of the words, <hi>When God requires a people to him, he will make it good to them that he will anſwer them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I open this point I will give you a Scripture or two, one in the old Teſtament, and another in the new, Deut. 4.7. <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</hi> Here is an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fruit of calling unto God; and it is ſpoken to ſhew the honour of Gods people, the priviledge of the ſeed of Iacob, and the eminent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were in. God is nigh to them in all things they call upon him for: therefore they are not required to ſeek God in vain. So Matth. 21.22. <hi>And all things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi> A very ſtrange expreſſion: Here might
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40440:104"/>
ſeem to be a tautologie. One would think that it had been large enough to have ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask, ye ſhall receive</hi>: but here is, <hi>all things whatſoever.</hi> We would not ſpeak ſo in ordinary language. I <hi>will give you all things whatſoever.</hi> Yet it may be, this may be intended, and I believe it is; <hi>And all things,</hi> here is the generall promiſe, that all things that ye ask ye ſhall receive: and <hi>whatſoever,</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to particulars, every particular thing that ye ask ye ſhall receive. You will ſay, any one that underſtands rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Logick knoweth that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are included in the generall. But there is this illogicall reaſoning of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; that though we agree to the premiſes in generall, yet when we come to particulars, we think they will not be made good to us. I ſuppoſe you find your unbelieving hearts ſo irrationall, that though they believe the generall promiſe, yet when it comes to particulars, and you cannot but ſay that ſuch a particular is in the generall, yet your hearts will not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40440:105"/>
come up to it. Therefore our Saviour ſaith not onely, <hi>all things</hi> in generall, but alſo, <hi>whatſoever,</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>So, Jam. 5.16. <hi>The effectuall fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> There is but one word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>working</hi> prayer; but it is tranſlated by two, <hi>effectuall, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> Surely then prayer and ſeeking of God is the ordinance which he hath appointed for the turning about of the great affairs of the world. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> is the engine that doth it inwardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are indeed a great many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wheeles uſed, but the ſpring of all is within, prayer turns all about. God never made uſe of any created power ſo much as of this. He never did ſuch great things by any created power as by the ordinance of prayer. The Word is appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of ſouls, but a great part of the bleſſing of the Word dependeth on prayer.</p>
            <p>In the opening of this point I will firſt give you ſome evidences of it; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40440:105"/>
ſhew you what great things prayer will do. Thirdly, wherein the efficacy and power of it lyeth. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the objections of troubled unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſpirits againſt it. And then come to apply all. The evidences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are firſt the many famous records in Scripture of the noble and glorious exploits of prayer. If any of you ſhould come to me to ask, as that King did of the prophets ſervant, 2. Kings 8.4. <hi>What great things hath thy maſter done?</hi> ſo what great things hath prayer done in the world? truly we might ſpend houres and dayes in returning you an anſwer, a great part of holy Scripture being ſpent in this very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. And it is a very good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for you in the night, when you cannot ſleep, or at other times when you are troubled, to do as that King did, Eſther 6.1. call for the book of the Records of prayer. You that read the Scriptures, mark what you read. The word of God will tell you how prayer hath ſtopped the Sunne in the firmament, opened heaven, and ſhut it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40440:106"/>
again, raiſed from death to life, opened the priſon doores, and what not?</p>
            <p>Secondly, all Gods people are able to tell you great ſtories of what they have gotten by prayer. <hi>This poor man cryed,</hi> ſaith David of himſelf, Pſalm. 34.6. <hi>and the Lord heard him.</hi> Who is it that cannot tell hiſtories of Gods gracious dealing with him upon his calling unto him? to be ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath many things to ſay this way; and every particular godly ſoul hath many things to ſay: they would not loſe their income of prayer for all the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſurely it is not in vain to call unto God: for there was never any ſoul that ever would leave off, but would continue as long as he lived ſeeking him: he would ſeek his face evermore; if he had had no anſwer, he would have left off. When we ſee a Bee ſtick on a Flower, and will not be driven off, or if ſhe be driven off, ſhe will come again, we conclude certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it finds honey there. So all the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40440:106"/>
Saints of God that have ever ſought God truly, they would never be beaten off this way. Let the world do what it will, perſecute them, ſet ſpies to watch them in their meetings of prayer, let it puniſh and impriſon them, let all the malice and rage of men be againſt them, yet they cannot hinder them either from praying in their cloſets, or from injoying the benefit of the communion of Saints in prayer. Daniel had rather loſe his life then be kept from his prayers, though but for a day: but pray he would, and that openly, yea three times a day, as he was wont; he would not forbear one time. He did ſtick to prayer find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honey &amp; ſweetneſſe in it. Oh how unlike are we to Daniel, though the performance of this duty was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hazzardable to Daniel, yet he would not be deterred from it; but every light trifle taketh off our hearts.</p>
            <p>It is not in vain for wicked men to call upon God, though they are not able to ſeek God as they ought. <hi>The
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40440:107"/>
prayer of the wicked is abominable,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Prov. 15.8. That is not to be underſtood of the prayer of every man that is unregenerate, <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> is not ſo to be taken in that place. For we know that God hath regarded the prayers of men unregenerate. The prayers &amp; faſting of Niniveh were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of God: the praying &amp; faſting of Ahab was regarded of God. God hath granted the wicked ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he hath looked on them as his creatures. Though God ſeeth enough in their prayers to caſt them off, yet God hath manifeſted his regard to them. Therefore if it be not in vain for the wicked to call unto the Lord, much leſſe is it in vain for the ſeed of Iacob, the elect of God, to call unto him.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Lord heareth the cry of the very Ravens &amp; the beaſts, Pſalme 147.9. and Pſalme 104.21, 27, 28. Therefore the people of Niniveh would have the beaſts eat nothing, that they might cry unto God, Ionah 3.7, 8. Surely if the brute beaſts and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40440:107"/>
the fouls be heard when they cry, it is good for the people of God, to call unto him.</p>
            <p>There is very great reaſon that we ſhould call unto God, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God that have been wiſe and have converſed with God, and have known much of the mind of God, have given up themſelves and all their ſtrength to the duty of prayer. Now it were a weak part and an idle thing for any one to give up his ſtrength &amp; all his might to that which in reaſon we could not expect, and whereby there is no great thing to be obtained. It is ſaid of Iehoſhaphat 2. Chron. 20.3. that <hi>he feared, and ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord.</hi> It is tranſlated <hi>compoſuit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem ſuam,</hi> he ſet his face, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up fully to ſeek the Lord. They know what they doe that give up themſelves wholly to ſeek God.</p>
            <p>Indeed carnall hearts condemn the people of God becauſe they ſee them ſo earneſt in thoſe things that they think to be frivolous: For it argueth weakneſſe in any man to give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40440:108"/>
with all his ſtrength to things that are vanity, and have no ſtrength in them. Therefore becauſe carnall men look upon the way of Religion, as a thing that hath no end, they think it fooliſh for men to be ſo earneſt to give up their ſtrength &amp; their whole ſouls for it: But the Saints of God know what they do when they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to ſeek the Lord, they know if they call unto him, he will anſwer them.</p>
            <p>Again, this is an evidence that there is much advantage by prayer, becauſe men that were wiſe and holy have ſo prized the prayers of the Saints, and made ſuch high account of them. Mark the expreſſion of the Apoſtle, writing to the Saints for their prayers. Rom. 15.30. <hi>Now I beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for the Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you ſtrive together in prayer with me in your hearts to God for me.</hi> The Apoſtle Paul, ſo great a man, and one that had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirit in prayer, writing to private Chriſtians in the Church of Rome, he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40440:108"/>
beſeecheth them for the Lords ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that they ſtrive in prayer for him: He knew that there was much to be had this way.</p>
            <p>Yea further, God is <hi>found of them that ſought him not,</hi> Iſaiah 65, 1. then ſurely, the people of God that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſhall receive anſwer from him.</p>
            <p>Yea yet further, God when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew no mercy, giveth a ſtreight charge to his people not to pray, or he ſhutteth up their hearts that they are not able to pray. This is an argument that prayer is prevalent, becauſe when God will not ſhew mercy, he would not have ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing loſt and ſpent to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is not in vain, becauſe if it ſhould, then a praying heart were not alway a mercy from God: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is. Therefore though perhaps you cannot find the thing granted that you pray for, yet to have a continuall praying heart, know that it is a great
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40440:109"/>
mercy from God. And thoſe that are ſpirituall, prize more the continuance of a praying heart many times, then the granting of the thing they pray for. All theſe put together are full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that it is not in vain to call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
            <p>There be many other evidences which I paſſe by one purpoſe, that I may have as much time as may be for application.</p>
            <p>But now, wherein doth it appear that it is not in vain to ſeek the Lord? what doth prayer do?</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is not in vain to ſeek God, if there were nothing elſe in prayer but the right exerciſe of the faculties of our ſouls and of our graces; this alone were worth our time. The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our ſouls muſt be exerciſed about ſomewhat: Now prayer ſerveth for the exerciſe of all graces.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not in vain if it were nothing but the performance of our duty as creatures to God. There are many people that are weary of prayer, becauſe they have not that by it that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40440:109"/>
they expect: But know that there are two arguments to prayer; the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duty, and the obtaining of mercy: If there were but onely the former, that alone ſhould ſuffice to keep thee praying as long as thou liveſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it were not in vain if it were nothing but the tendering that homage and worſhip that we owe to God. Prayer is not onely a duty, but a great part of the worſhip that God hath in the world. While we are worſhipping of God it is worth the time.</p>
            <p>Again, it is not in vain, if there were nothing but this, that we come and ſhew what ſide we are of, that we joyn and ſide with God againſt his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and for his people. But theſe are not the things here intended.</p>
            <p>Further, it is not in vain, becauſe there is no faithfull prayer that ever was made but God accepts of it in heaven. There was never one of the ſeed of Iacob, that ever put up a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full petition to God, but God took it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40440:110"/>
in his hand and read it. A King or any ſuperiour, when you come with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition may refuſe to take it, but God never refuſeth to take any petition from a faithfull ſoul. Therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 6.9. <hi>The Lord hath heard my ſupplication, the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my prayer.</hi> He will take it, and look on it, and read it; and not onely ſo, but he will alſo accept it, and take pleaſure in it: A Prince may take a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and look on it, and after frown and ſhew anger in his countenance; but God doth not ſo with the prayers of his people: <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15.8. he never reads a petition that his people ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but with a ſmiling countenance. If it be a faithfull petition, he accepts it of them and receives it graciouſly. It is an expreſſion of Luther ſpeaking of the prayer of a contrite heart, <hi>The leaſt ſigh of a contrite heart ſo fills hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with noiſe, that there is no noiſe of any thing in heaven or earth heard at that time, but onely the noiſe of prayer.</hi> Certainly a faithfull prayer taketh the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40440:110"/>
heart of God very much, yea every faithfull prayer is recorded in heaven. You keep your letters upon the file, that you may readily find them, when you have occaſion to look on ſuch a letter ſent from ſuch a countrey: ſo God hath his file in heaven where all faithfull prayers are kept upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. As Princes have their paper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, where tranſaction between one State and another are kept, ſo the Lord hath his prayer-office, where he keeps all the prayers of his Saints that ever were put up to him. Revel. 8.3. <hi>Another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden cenſer, and there was given him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints.</hi> Where were thoſe prayers of all the Saints that he muſt take a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and offer incenſe with? God had them recorded with him, and now they were to be offered to him. And ſee what great things follow upon the offering of the prayers of the Saints, verſ. 4. <hi>The ſmoak of the incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40440:111"/>
aſcended up before God out of the Angels hand. And the Angel took the cenſer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</hi> Theſe followed upon the prayers of the Saints. It ſignified the time wherein all ſhould come in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, as if an Angel were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, yea, Chriſt the Angel of the Covenant, hath a time to take the prayers preſented long ago, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to God with his own incenſe. They are all recorded in heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not in vain. When a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is taken and put upon record, the petitioner petitioneth not in vain, his petition is not thrown out. God doth take all the petitions of the Saints and recordeth them; they are all filed up in heaven.</p>
            <p>Yet further, there is no faithfull pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition but God puts his <hi>fiat</hi> to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, at the inſtant that it is put up to him. There is a decree in heaven iſſued out for mercy, at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that the petition is put up, God dealeth not with us in this kind, as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40440:111"/>
men do who are counted very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, if they pleaſe to tell us they will conſider of our petition: no; but your petition is preſently granted. A peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner when there is time taken to conſider of his petition, trembles and ſhakes for fear it ſhould not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but the petitions of the Saints of God are granted preſently. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> had been ſeeking God at the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice, an Angel comes to him, and tells him, that at the beginning of his prayer there was a decree to grant it, and that he was ſent to him at the beginning of his prayer, Dan. 9.23. &amp; Pſa. 56.9. <hi>When I cry unto thee, then ſhall mine enemies turn back: this I know, for God is for me.</hi> Did not Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid cry oft, and yet his enemies did not turn their backs when he cryed? He cryed oft when his enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed: yet he ſaith, <hi>When I cried then mine enemies turned back</hi>: and <hi>this I know,</hi> why? <hi>for God is for me.</hi> The meaning muſt be this, that at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that he cryed, there was a decree in heaven; the thing was done. He
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40440:112"/>
looked on it as done, even as certainly as if he had ſeen it with his eyes.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon that the Saints after they have prayed, though the thing be not actually done, fall to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bleſſing of God. We have a notable example in Iehoſhaphat, of whom we read 2. Chron. 20.3. that being in a great fear bad <hi>ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a faſt throughout all Iudah.</hi> He did not ſeek God ſlightly, but <hi>ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord.</hi> And what his prayer was, ye may ſee from verſ. 6. to 12. <hi>And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven, and ruleſt over all Kingdomes?</hi> Mark how he pleadeth with God for the Covenant he had made, verſ. 8. Speaking of the Sanctuary they had built for his names ſake; <hi>If when evil commeth upon us, as the ſword, judgement, or peſtilence, or famine, we ſtand before this houſe, and in thy preſence, (for thy name is in this houſe) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.</hi> He urgeth the promiſe made to Solomon at the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40440:112"/>
dedication of the Temple. For that prayer of Faith which Solomon made, and God accepted, hath the ſtrength of a promiſe in it. <hi>O our God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might againſt this great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21.</note> Though he profeſt that his enemies were ſo many, that he knew not what to do, and that they had no might to reſiſt them, yet after his prayer was done, and before the battell began, when he had conſulted with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he appointed ſingers unto the Lord, that ſhould praiſe the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of holineſſe, as they went out before the Army, and to ſay, Praiſe the Lord, for his mercie endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>Mark: he had not yet gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the battell was not fought, yet as ſoon as he had ended his prayer, he praiſed the Lord for his mercie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever. He made account that the thing was done: It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in heaven. Therefore ſurely the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40440:113"/>
people of God are anſwered when they call upon him.</p>
            <p>Nay, it is not onely decreed, but ere long God will <hi>ſatisfie his people, &amp; fill their longing ſouls with goodneſſe,</hi> Pſal. 107.9. A time ſhall come when they ſhall they ſay their prayers are heard, and that they have enough. Yea the Lord giveth more ſometimes then his people mention in their prayer, they ask temporall bleſſings, and he beſtoweth ſpirituall, yea he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them himſelf, and that is all in all. Surely then the prayers of the Saints are heard and anſwered.</p>
            <p>But wherein lyeth the efficacy of prayer? What makes prayer ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with God?</p>
            <p>One thing is, becauſe God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mercy, and in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf to the children of men. He taketh more pleaſure in doing good, then any can in ſeeking it; yea, then any can in enjoying it from him. Our hearts cannot be ſo ſtrongly ſet to ſeek for any mercy from God, as he is to communicate mercy to us. <hi>Who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40440:113"/>
is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18.</p>
            <p>Another thing that rendreth pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo effectuall, is Gods Covenant and promiſe to his people. It was the ſpeech of Alchimedes, <hi>Give me a place to ſet my Engine in, and I will ſhake the whole earth.</hi> Let prayer have a ſure foundation to ſet foot on, and it will do mighty things. Now the promiſes are the foundation of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereof we have great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance Numb. 23. You ſhall find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of promiſes to the Saints of God, when Balaam was brought to curſe the people. But in Deuter. 33. there are admirable promiſes. There is none like unto the God of I<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and on the skie in his excellency. The eternall God is his refuge, and underneath are the everlaſting armes: and he ſhall thruſt out the enemy from before
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40440:114"/>
thee, and ſhall ſay, deſtroy them. Iſrael then ſhall dwell in ſafety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the fountain of Iacob ſhall be upon a land of Corn and Wine, alſo his heavens ſhall drop down dew. Happy art thou O Iſrael, who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is that ſword of thy excellency, and thine enemies ſhall be found lyars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places. Here are promiſes to the Saints of God. They ſhall have all things that are good, and God will manifeſt himſelf, eſpecially againſt his enemies. There muſt be a mighty efficacy in ſuch a plea, when there are ſuch large promiſes. So in the 14. Chapt. of this book of Iſaiah, there are diverſe promiſes for Gods people, For the Lord will have mercy on Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and will yet chooſe Iſrael and ſet them in their own land, &amp; the ſtranger ſhall be joyned with them, and they ſhall cleave to the houſe of Iacob, and the people ſhall take them and bring them to their place: and the houſe of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40440:114"/>
Iſrael ſhall poſſeſſe them in the land of the Lord for ſervants and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids: and they ſhall take them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, whoſe captives they were, and they ſhall rule over their oppreſſours. And it ſhall come to paſſe that in the day that the Lord ſhall give thee reſt from thy ſorrow and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou waſt made to ſerve, &amp;c. I make no queſtion but ſome of the people of God have been pleading this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in prayer where the Lord hath promiſed to have mercy on Iſrael, and to give him reſcue from his ſorrows, and fears, and hard bondage. It was hard bondage that we were made to ſerve in, not long ago; here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God will give us reſt from it; and upon the pleading of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God hath made it good to his people.</p>
            <p>And in Iſa. 41.8. there are large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in that Chapter to the Saints of God. <hi>But thou Iſrael my ſervant, Iacob whom I have choſen, the ſeed of Abraham my friend, Thou whom he have taken
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40440:115"/>
from the ends of the earth.</hi> Here are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for prayer to ſet foot upon, no marvell if it hath ſo much power and efficacy.</p>
            <p>There are divers others, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things behind of the efficacy of prayer, as it depends upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe &amp; covenant that God hath made with his people: for every promiſe is but a ſeverall branch and expreſſion of the covenant of God: therefore we are to referre them all to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. I will give you but one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Ier. 30.10, 11. Therefore fear thou not, O my ſervant Iacob, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be diſmaied O Iſrael: for lo, I will ſave thee from a far, and thy ſeed from the land of their captivity, and Iacob ſhall return and be in reſt and quiet, and none ſhall make him afraid. For I am with thee ſaith the Lord, to ſave thee: though I make a full end of all nations, whither I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed. There is ſomewhat that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40440:115"/>
God doth, but yet ſtill he remembers his promiſe in the middeſt of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he will leave nothing of that undone: therefore though his people be under great afflictions, the Lord will be good to them according to his promiſe.</p>
            <p>Now again the Lord will regard the prayers of his people; the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their prayers depends upon this, becauſe it is Gods own work. That which is the work of God is not in vain: God made none of his works in vain. Now all their calling upon God, it is from God; it is Gods own work, and a moſt glorious piece of the work of God. Every prayer that comes from the pooreſt Saints of God; every gracious, and faithfull prayer it is a glorious piece of Gods work; It is a work of the holy Ghoſt, and therefore it is not in vain.</p>
            <p>Again, as their prayers come from God, they ſeek God from God; ſo they ſeek God for God, they ſeek the Lord for himſelf. If the people of God ſeek God onely for Corn,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40440:116"/>
and Wine, and Oyle; if they did ſeek him onely for their own eaſe, and outward liberties, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for the lives of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, perhaps they might ſeek in vain. No, but when they ſeek God, they ſeek God for God, &amp; thence they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo much with God, <hi>Ye ask amiſſe, that ye may ſpend it on your luſts.</hi> Iames 4.3. You pray to God oft to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from enemies, and you think your prayers (if it be in ſuch a time as this) they come in vain: No marvell if ſo you pray that you may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to trade, and deliverance from taxations; (theſe may be ſought,) but the houſe of Iacob ſeeks God for his name, that that may not be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for his Goſpell, that that be not taken away, and the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe trodden as dirt in the ſtreet. When they ſeek God for God, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but God will hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>But the great efficacy of prayer is this, it is part of the purchaſe of the bloud of Chriſt: that God might hear
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40440:116"/>
the prayers of the Saints, it comes from the merits of Chriſt, it is a part of his purchaſe that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, it is in his name that we pray; ſo we are taught. It is by Chriſt that we have acceſſe to the throne of grace, our priviledge of ſeeking God is that which Chriſt hath purchaſed by his bloud. So that our ſeeking of God is not onely a duty, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to us, but it is a high priviledge purchaſed by the bloud of Chriſt; by him we have acceſſe with boldneſs, the word is, with liberty of ſpeech: li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpeech is by the bloud of Chriſt, that we may come before the Lord, and open our minds fully, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is a great deal of efficacy in prayer. Whatſoever our prayers are, as they are from us, though they be vain as they are from us, yet take them as Chriſts purchaſe, here lies the great efficacy of prayer.</p>
            <p>Think not that the efficacy of prayer lies in earneſtneſſe, or enlargement: though it be a comfort and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God enlargeth us by his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40440:117"/>
Spirit, (it is not parts that enlarge, but the Spirit) but the virtue of prayer lies not here: the ſtrength whereby prayer doth great things, it lies in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, in the purchaſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt takes all the prayers of his people, and tenders them up to his Father for acceptance. We have a more glorious way of coming to God then Adam had in innocency, yea in ſome reſpects then the Angels themſelves, by having ſuch an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor that takes all our prayers and carries them to his father.</p>
            <p>Yea, not onely ſo, but he joins with us to the Father. There is a place in the Hebrews quoted out of the Pſalms, that ſhews that Chriſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God in the congregation; it is not onely the Saints that praiſe God but Chriſt himſelf. Heb. 2.12. I <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy name unto my brethren, in the middeſt of the Church will I ſing praiſes unto thee.</hi> Chriſt in the middeſt of the Church ſings praiſe to God. When people meet to praiſe God, Chriſt praiſeth him. It is a mighty encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40440:117"/>
in praiſing God. So in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when we meet to ſeek God Chriſt ſeeks him: for he is at the right hand of the Father, making continuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Saints; Chriſt himſelf joynes with them in the work that their prayers may be heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>Again, it is the ſtile and title that God glories in, to be a God hearing prayer, therefore he will hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Again, prayer is the pouring forth of the ſpirit to God; the ſpirit that is ſo be beautified with the graces of his own ſpirit; now the pouring forth of ſuch a precious ſpirit to God ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and principled with the graces of the holy Ghoſt, certainly this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be anſwered by God. Indeed, the Scripture ſaith of the heart of the wicked, that it is little worth: Let their heart be poured fourh, God doth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mind, or regard it: but the heart of the righteous is much worth; it is very precious before God: therefore when their hearts are poured out,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40440:118"/>
and God ſees the beauty and glory of his graces on them, it is exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to him, and ſuch pouring out of their hearts, are heard and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If God have a bottle for all their tears, he hath a bottle alſo for all their expreſſions, and pouring out of their hearts in prayer.</p>
            <p>Further, the exceeding delight that God hath in his Saints muſt needs cauſe God to regard their calling unto him. They are his darlings: now there is no man that loves to deny a ſuit to any that he delights in.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it were not for the honour of God, that his people ſhould call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and not be anſwered, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that comfort they pray for. It is reported of <hi>Titus,</hi> though he were a heathen Emperour, yet he would not that any man ſhould go ſad out of the preſence of the Prince. God accounts it an honour that none ſhould go ſad out of his preſence. Therefore thoſe are called on to rejoyce that ſeek the Lord. <hi>Let the hearts of them rejoyce that ſeek the Lord,</hi> Pſalm. 105.3. not onely
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40440:118"/>
let the heart of them rejoyce that find the Lord, that obtain that they ſeek, but thoſe that ſeek the Lord, while they are ſeeking ſhould rejoyce in ſeeking him.</p>
            <p>But now I will onely take away that great objection, and reaſoning, that is in the hearts of many men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this point, and then come to the application.</p>
            <p>You tell us that the prayers of Gods people are not in vain. But when they call unto him he will anſwer them, and by Gods mercy now and then, we have found ſome comfortable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from heaven: but ordinarily we find it otherwiſe. How many prayers have we put up to God, and find not the iſſue? we pray, and pray, and the enemies prevail, though now and then God give us help.</p>
            <p>Now for the taking away of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing reaſonings againſt this point, I will not go from the Text at this time.</p>
            <p>Therefore the firſt anſwer is this: You ſay you have ſought God, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40440:119"/>
have not what you would have, and therefore God hath not anſwered when you have called.</p>
            <p>Though perhaps this that you now ſay is ſomething, yet it makes not the text void. Remember what hath been before: heretofore you have ſought God, and God had anſwered your ſeekings, remember the times of old, let that for the preſent a little ſtay you. It was that that ſtayed the Pſalmiſt, he began to reaſon as you do, that he had ſought God without anſwer, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm, 7, 8. here ſeems to be as much unbelief as in your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, but mark what follows, v. 10. <hi>And I ſaid this is my death: but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the years of the right hand of the moſt high.</hi> O, it is my ſinne, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that I ſhould reaſon thus, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not what to do when I reaſon thus: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt high, verſ. 11. I will remember the works
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40440:119"/>
of the Lord: ſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y I will remember the wonders of old. v. 12. I will medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate alſo of all thy works, and talk of thy doings. Thy way O God is in the ſanctuary: who is ſo great a God as our God? Thou art the God that doeſt wonders, thou haſt declared thy ſtrength among the people, v. 14. Thou haſt with thine arm redeemed thy people, the ſons of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> v. 15 Mark, at length he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf with this, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things ſeem to go hard, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what God had done; ſo do thou in this caſe. In this book of Iſaiah, you have a complaint of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hearts, as if God had been ſought in vain. Iſa 40.27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou O Iacob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is paſſed over from my God.</hi> Art thou one of the ſeed of Iacob, and haſt ſought God and ſayeſt, thou haſt had no anſwer? God reaſons the caſe, and will confute their unbelief. Haſt thou not known? haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40440:120"/>
creator of the ends of the earth, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, neither is weary? there is no ſearching of his underſtanding. He giveth power to the faint, &amp; to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength. Even the youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fall. v. 28, 29, 30, 31. But they that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength; they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles; they ſhall run and not be weary and they ſhall walk &amp; not faint. Hath not God done great things heretofore, in 88. and in the powder plot and at other times? and though we be in ſome ſtreights, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what God did before.</p>
            <p>This ſhould appeaſe your hearts, what though thou have not preſent audience for the thing thou ſeekeſt: yet think, I deal with a God that hath an underſtanding that I cannot ſearch. God it may be lets the adverſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſometimes, I cannot tell what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God may get by it, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how God can bring his own glory about when Iſrael flees before
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40440:120"/>
the Philiſtines. But why ſayeſt thou ſo O Iacob? there is no ſearching of Gods underſtanding, God ſees further then thou canſt ſee: that thing that thou thinkeſt will make againſt his name may make for it: therefore lay thine hand upon thine heart. He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might. God ſtayes till men have no might, till they faint, and are ready to fail, and then he comes and helps them. That is the meaning of that Scripture in Luke, where Chriſt ſaith, God will avenge his elect that cry night and day to him, though he tarry, he will avenge them, he will hear their prayers, he will anſwer their requeſts. But it follows upon it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when the Sonne of man comes ſhall he find faith on earth? I verily think that that want of faith, hath reference to that very promiſe ſpecially, that God will hear his elect that cry: but God may ſtay ſo long, as that the very time when God ſhall come to perform it, and ſhall intend to do it, it may be a time when their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40440:121"/>
faith is overcome, and fails in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they begin to give over, and think they have ſought God in vain. And uſually the time when God comes to fulfill his promiſe, and to anſwer the prayers of his people, it is that very time when they fail and are ready to ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck. Therefore that may be another argument, it may be thou haſt not believed this promiſe. Thou ſayeſt thou haſt prayed, and thou thinkeſt thou haſt not anſwer: haſt thou believed this promiſe in the Text? haſt thou relyed on it? God hath commanded it, and haſt thou done as he commanded with belief, <hi>Call unto me and I will anſwer thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word of God ſhall be made good, but how? upon our faith: it ſhall be made good to us upon our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: though we be never ſo godly, and pray never ſo well, yet if we will have the promiſes made good, it muſt be upon believing. If thou haſt not laid the weight of thy ſoul on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, thou haſt no cauſe to ſay that God hath not made his word good; it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40440:121"/>
may be thou haſt not faith: learn to believe the word, and then thou ſhalt have it fulfilled. Thou wouldeſt have it made good, and then thou wouldeſt believe it; no, thou muſt firſt believe the word, and then expect that God ſhould fulfill his promiſe.</p>
            <p>Again, God is a great God that we call unto, and it is fit for us to wait, &amp; and to wait long. He is great, and we call for great things, and we are poor, mean, vile wretches. God hath his prerogative ſometimes to anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, ſometimes not ſo. <hi>Elias</hi> was a great praying man, he is ſet for an example of prayer; he prayes at one time for fire to come on the ſacrifice, and fire came down preſently; another time he prayed for rain, and then he prayed ſeven times, and bowed his head between his knees, and ſent his ſervant, and ſent him again and again. At one time God comes in at the firſt, at another time not till the ſeventh hour; it is Gods prerogative.</p>
            <p>And take this note; it is a true ſign of a gracious ſpirit, though God defer,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40440:122"/>
yet ſtill for the ſoul to cling to God, to think well of God, and of the wayes of God, and of the duty of prayer; it is an excellent ſign, and the ready way to find favour with God. You have ſometimes two beggers follow you for alms; one perhaps hath true need, pure need, and is of a ſoft tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the other is a ſturdy rugged beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, you deny them both; he that hath pure need, and hath a ſoft tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he thinks he is unworthy that the other man ſhould be bountifull to him and he falls a weeping: yet he thinks well of the man, and will be ready to beg of him upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he hath good thoughts of him. But the ſturdy begger rails, &amp; breaks into an angry paſſionate mood, and he will ask no more; who of them is like to prevail, the ſoft ſpirit that hath an ingenious diſpoſition, or the ſturdy ſpirit that ſoon breaks off? Thus there are many paſſionate hearts, that are not froward with men, but with God, they come, and ask mercy of God, but their hearts are ſtiff, and froward
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40440:122"/>
and ſturdy, if they have not that they would, they preſently break off, and ſay, why ſhould we wait on God, and cry, it is in vain to ſeek the Lord. But now a gracious, tender, ingenious diſpoſition, though the thing come not that he prayes for, he juſtifies God in all, and ſpeaks well of God, and well of prayer, and loves that ſtill, and waits on God in that way: this is the ſoul that is likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>But further, (to anſwer from the Text) it may be thou haſt not called unto God, <hi>Call unto me,</hi> ſaith God. It may be it is ſomewhat elſe that thou haſt ſought in prayer then God: though thou name God in thy prayer, it may be thy heart hath been after creature-helps, and thou haſt made more account of the help of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of Armies, and ſtrength, thou haſt made account that they would do it rather then prayer; and if there be no help but prayer, thou thinkeſt it but a dry buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>A carnall hearted man when he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40440:123"/>
hears of an army of twenty thouſand men well clothed and the like, he thinks much may be done, but for the prayers of Gods people they think they be nothing. Now if thou have ſought help by creatures, rather then by God, thou haſt not ſought God all the while, Or if it have been but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſafety, that thou haſt ſought and not the face of God, thou haſt not ſought God, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> ſaith God, Pſalm 27. <hi>This is the generation of them that ſeek thy face, O Iacob.</hi> Pſalm. 24. Thou ſeekeſt not God, without thou ſeek Gods face, without thou ſeek God for himſelf. And ordinarily, God is not ſought, but thy eſtate is ſought; and thou cryeſt out for the danger thou art in. Therefore thou haſt no cauſe to ſay, it is in vain, look to thy prayers, take up thy prayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Do as the fiſhermen do; if they find that there comes nothing up, that they do not catch, they take up their net, it may be there is a hole, a rent in the net. And ſo the Angler, if the fiſh do not bite he takes up the bait, it
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40440:123"/>
may be there is ſomewhat wanting on the hook. So look to thy prayers, it may be it is not God that thou haſt ſought, take them up and ſee what is amiſſe in them.</p>
            <p>Another anſwer is this, it may be thy prayers have been vain and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell if nothing but vain come of them. <hi>Surely; God will not hear vanity,</hi> Iob 35.13. If there be nothing but vanity, how canſt thou expect that God ſhould hear them? Our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ordinarily without form, and void, that is, there is nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them. Not that God regards ſo much the ſetting of a mans words in form handſomely: for the grones and ſighs of the ſpirit of God are acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, though they be not methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as the making of a ſpeech to men; God looks not to that. Many pray, and they know not why, but becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; but they propound not the true end of prayer.</p>
            <p>I appeal to thy conſcience; when thou haſt gone to pray to God, haſt thou propounded this end? I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40440:124"/>
to tender up that worſhip and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, that I a poor creature, owe to to the infinite glorious firſt being of all things: you call your families ſometimes to come to prayer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think what you do, what you aim at. I and my family are now going to ſeek the great God in prayer, I am now going to joyn with my father or my maſter, now that we are altogether in this family to tender up that worſhip and homage that we poor creatures owe to that infinite glorious firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things whereby to teſtifie our high reſpect, and eſteem of him. Now if thy prayer be a cuſtomary way of prayer it is vanity, it hath not a right end.</p>
            <p>It may be thou goeſt to prayer meerly to ſatisfie conſcience· Or ſome have this by end in prayer, a wicked end, that is, they think to ſatisfie God for their former ſinfull wicked wayes. They take liberty in company to drink and pleaſe the fleſh, and as they ſerved themſelves then, ſo now they will ſerve God, and ſet one againſt another.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40440:124"/>
Sometimes they will give liberty to the fleſh to take contentment that way, but they will not alway do ſo, ſometime they will be devout &amp; ſerve God. There is no man ſo wicked as to be alwayes in the acts of wickedneſſe, but they think God muſt have his turn, and they muſt have their turn ſometimes. And this is the prayer of many people, to put their ſins in one ſcale, and ſo many devout prayers in the other ſcale, and the one ſhall poize the other. This is vanity, this is not the end of prayer.</p>
            <p>When God doth not ſee thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions filled with the graces of the Spirit: this is vanity; Take heed of vain expreſſions, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but nature in prayer; though there be never ſo much earneſtneſſe in prayer, if there be but a naturall ſpirit it is vanity, we muſt pray in the ſpirit as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>And take heed of ſluggiſhneſſe in prayer, that makes it vanity. The breath that comes from life in mans body is warm, but the breath that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40440:125"/>
comes from bellows is artificiall and cold, ſome mens breath in prayer is artificiall and cold, but the prayer that comes from life, is warm breath that comes up to God.</p>
            <p>Again, vanity in prayer is this, when all is eaten out with vain thoughts, thy heart roves in prayer, thou knoweſt not where thou art, thou canſt not call that which thou makeſt a prayer. A prayer with vain thoughts it like beer, or wine that is dead, and hath loſt the ſpirits. Vain thoughts are worms that eat out the ſtrength of a duty: would you preſent a diſh to your ſuperiour that were worm eaten, or that were gnawn on before? when we let out our thoughts in duties, and preſent them to God, they are worm-eaten, and torn, the ſtrength of them is quite gone.</p>
            <p>And after you have prayed, take heed that you make not your prayers vain, by not looking after them, for the accompliſhment of them; or by being proud of your prayers &amp; gifts, by reſting in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:40440:125"/>And again it is vani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y when thou undoeſt all as ſoon as thou haſt done, by going contrary to thy prayer in thy life, not adding watchfulneſſe to prayer. If a man take pains to weave a web, and ſpend ſo many hours in it, and then ravell it out, this man ſpends his time in vain. So do moſt people with their prayers, they pray for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and grace, and as ſoon as they have done they go quite contrarie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and undo all, is not this vanity? No marvell if thou thinkeſt it in vain, when there is nothing but vain thoughts in thy prayers.</p>
            <p>And take heed that you make not the prayers of others vain. Luther writes to Melancthon angerly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his fear of the power of his adverſaries, ſaith he. You make our prayers void. So it may be ſaid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are cold, and luke-warm, and dead-hearted, and do not take to heart the cauſe of God; that fear the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of this bodie, and that bodie; you make our prayers void. You that have praying friends, it may be fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40440:126"/>
&amp; mothers that are dead whoſe prayers are put up in heaven, take heed that you make not their prayers void; that you give them not cauſe if they ſhould come to live again from the dead to weep and cry out, O how are our prayers made void by the prayers of ſuch and ſuch.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay; Lord, what will become of us? we have abundance of vanitie in our prayers.</p>
            <p>Therefore, that you may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, know, that though there be manie vain thoughts in prayer, yet if there be ſighing and mourning, and humbling of the ſoul, and panting of the heart after God in groning, and ſighing, &amp; though there be a mixture of vanitie, yet there is a working of the Spirit of God, and of grace in the heart after God; know that the Lord will not charge this vanitie on thee, the Lord will do away thy ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not that diſcourage thee. The efficacy lies not in the excellencie of thy prayer, but in the merits of Chriſt, and his mediation: Onely Chriſt will
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40440:126"/>
have ſomewhat of thy ſelf in thy prayer, he will have thy heart pant, &amp; work after him: but there may be abundance of vanitie, thou draweſt a line, and makeſt a blot, and another line, and another blot, Chriſt draws all fair again, and preſents to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

He looked no further, he minded no great matters. Therefore in Pſ. 24. there the generation of Iacob is ſet out, and one thing is, he that hath not lift up his ſoul to vanity. The men of the world have great things in their eyes, they are vanitie in Gods eye, though they be great in theirs, and they lift up their hearts to them. Now the ſons of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40440:128"/>
do not lift up their hearts to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though the things of the world be preſent, their hearts ſtirre not, they riſe not; but if God and Chriſt, and heavenly things be preſented, their hearts are lifted up. If thy heart be lifted up to vanitie, if thy heart be as iron and the vanities of the world come and draw it up, thou art not a ſon of Iacob: a little would ſerve Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob though he were a great heir, <hi>He was a plain man and dwelt in tents,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis 25. and had a plain ſpirit, he did not look after great things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Eſau looked after great things abroad.</p>
            <p>Again, he was one of a tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: therefore where it is ſaid he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Angel, it is ſaid he wept, and made ſupplication unto him, he found him in Bethel, &amp; there he ſpake with us. That ſtorie of Iacob concerns us how God dealt with our Father. If now thou have a tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as he had; if when thou goeſt into the preſence of God thou find thy ſpirit yield and melt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40440:129"/>
thou art one like thy father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</p>
            <p>Again further, Iacob did in the time of his ſtreights repair to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that was a great ſatisfaction to his heart; he looked to the covenant, he faſtned on that, and there he held as the main ſupport of his ſpirit. Gen. 32.9. And Iacob ſaid, <hi>O God of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, and God of my Father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidſt unto me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto thy countrey, and to thy kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and I will deal well with thee.</hi> &amp;c. He heard that Eſau was coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with a great company; &amp; what doth Iacob? he gets him to God, <hi>O God of my Father Abraham, &amp; of my Father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaid unto me return into thy countrey,</hi> &amp;c. He repairs to the Covenant: <hi>Remember thy Covenant with Abraham and Iſaac,</hi> and with me to, I went on thy word. Here was the guiſe of Iacob: canſt thou in a ſtraight get thee a word, and a promiſe, and brood thy ſoul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and claſp it cloſe, and ſay this is the promiſe that muſt, and will do me good?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:40440:129"/>Again, Iacob was of an humble ſpirit, I am not worthy of the leaſt of thy mercies. He admired at the mercy of God that he had any thing, &amp; Gods mercies made him more humble; this is an excellent diſpoſition, we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times humble and lowly when we are under the hand of God in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but when mercies make us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the more God is gracious the more vile we are in our own eyes, this is excellent.</p>
            <p>And he looked back to his former condition, he looked upon his poor beginning and gives God the glory: I paſſed over this Iordan with my ſtaff; Many of you came with your ſtaff, and God hath given you two bands, you are grown great, are you willing to think of it, and to acknowledge the poor eſtate that once you were in, and to give God the glorie, I was thus, &amp; thus, of poor parentage, and ſee how God had dealt with me.</p>
            <p>Another thing remarkable is, that Iacob contented himſelf with God alone, he accounted that he had
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40440:130"/>
enough in God alone, though all were taken from him, he did not look upon himſelf as undone, but he had that that might make him for ever. In Gen. 33. compare the 9. and 11. verſes, you ſhall find a notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Eſau and Iacob, yet the word in our books is the ſame, but this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is much wronged by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In verſ. 8. Eſau when he comes to Iacob, when Iacob would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him his preſent, ſaith he, <hi>what meaneſt thou by all theſe droves which I met?</hi> he ſaid <hi>theſe are to find grace in the ſight of my Lord</hi>: and Eſau ſaid, <hi>I have enough my brother.</hi> It was a ſtrange ſpeech of Eſau: A covetous wretch that is alway pyning and murmuring for having no more, and thinks, he ſhall want before he dye, he doth not come ſo farre as Eſau, and Eſau could ſay, <hi>I have enough,</hi> are there not many of you that never ſay you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? I pray thee take my preſent ſaith Iacob, for I have all things, nay ſaith Eſau, I have enough. The one ſaith I have enough, the other ſaith I
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40440:130"/>
have all things, for <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the word is <hi>Col</hi>; Eſau had enough, he did not want, he had meat and drink, and he ſaw none to interrupt him, he was ſatisfied with his eſtate, as his portion; he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he cared for nothing more, they might talk of other things, but that was enough to him. Iacob comes, and ſaith I have enough; but this was another manner of enough: Eſaus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is his eſtate, but Iacobs enough is God, for he ſaith, <hi>I have all,</hi> Iacob was meaner for his outward condition then Eſau, for he had nothing but what he had gotten in hard ſervitude. Now Eſau ſaith, <hi>I have enough</hi>: Iacob ſaith, <hi>I have all</hi>: that is, God is enough in the want of all, if Eſau ſhould ſtrip him of all he had, yet he had all in God. Now one that is of the ſeed of Iacob, in the time of want (as ſome of you may be plundered, and then all is gone you ſay;) no, if thou be of the ſeed of Iacob if thou have God thou haſt all. There is ſuch a promiſe, <hi>He that overcometh, ſhall inherit all things.</hi> How is that? <hi>and I will be his God,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40440:131"/>
21.7 Therefore whatſoever thou wanteſt if God be thine, if thou be Gods child, thou haſt all.</p>
            <p>Further, one of the ſeed of Iacob is one of the Church of God: for all Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs poſterity was ſo: therefore the bleſſing in Ruth is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee like Rachel and Leah,</hi> which two did build up the houſe of Iſrael. Why is it not, the Lord bleſſe thee as Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah, or Sarah, but as Rachel &amp; Leah. (It was a bleſſing upon a marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) the reaſon is, becauſe from Rachel and Leah, came onely thoſe that were of the Church, that were members of the Church of God; but there came others from Rebeccah, &amp; of Sarah came onely Iſaac, but Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams poſterity was otherwiſe. And that Church that was then was but a type of that which ſhould be after; that is of a company of people elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and called out from the world to be partakers of the Priviledges of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The people of the Iews, the ſeed of Iacob were the Church of God, as the ſeed of ſuch an one. And
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40440:131"/>
this typified the Church that ſhould be after; a company that are taken out of the world, to partake of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Ieſus Chriſt. Canſt thou ſay that thou art of the Church? The word that we tranſlate Church is a company that is called out from the world. Canſt thou ever tell of a work of God ſeparating thee from the world, that when thou wenteſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the world, God gave thee a mighty call that made a ſeparation between thee and the world? For it is ſaid ſo of the ſeed of Iacob, Numb. 23.9. <hi>From the tops of the rocks I ſaw him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people ſhall dwell alone, they ſhall not be reckoned among the Nations.</hi> All the ſeed of Iacob are called out of the world, they are ſeparated from them by a mighty work of God to partake of Chriſt, and be a member of him.</p>
            <p>And upon this, ſuch an one mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly longs after all the outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, to enjoy all the outward ordinances of Chriſt after his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40440:132"/>
way, thoſe that are of the ſeed of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, they prize the excellency of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob as the greateſt excellency, their hearts are towards it, and they rejoyce in that above all the excellency in the world. If you ask what this excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Iacob is? it is the joyning of Gods people in the way of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and duties of Gods worſhip in the purity of them. This in Scripture is called the excellency of Iacob, Pſal. 47.4. <hi>He ſhall chuſe our inheritance for us, the excellency of Iacob whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> It is an excellent Scripture. O, it is a bleſſed thing to give all to God, to let God chuſe our inheritance. What is our inheritance? The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Iacob whom he loved. What was that? The worſhip of God, and his ordinances, joyning with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in the way of his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in his temple, thoſe were the things that were the ordinances of God in thoſe times; thoſe are called the excellency of Iacob; and ſo it is now the excellency of a people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Gods ordinancies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:40440:132"/>You have another expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>And I will bring forth a ſeed out of Iacob, and out of Iudah an inheritour of my mountain, and mine elect ſhall inherit it, and my ſervants ſhall dwell there.</hi> Iſaiah 65.9. What is the mountain of God? Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in his Church, <hi>I will bring a ſeed out of Iacob, and Iudah, and they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit my mountain.</hi> So that the greateſt inheritance of the ſeed of Iacob is the mountain of the Lord: communion with the Church of God, and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: if you be of the ſeed of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, your hearts prize, and rejoyce in this, and that you have in Pſalm. 24. verſ. 3, 4, 5. you ſhall find how the ſeed of Iacob prize the enjoyment of God in his Ordinances. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend in to the hill of the Lord? who ſhall ſtand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lift up his ſoul unto vanity, nor ſworn deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. He ſhall receive the bleſsing from the Lord, and righteouſneſſe from the God of his ſalvation. This is the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that ſeek him: that ſeek thy
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40440:133"/>
face O Iacob.</hi> It is ſo in the book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the particle O, is not in the originall: and therefore it may be read thus, <hi>That ſeek the face of Iacob</hi>; it may be read in the Genitive caſe, as well as in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative. <hi>This is the generation of them that ſeek him, even of Iacob,</hi> and then he turns to God, <hi>that ſeek thy face</hi>: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heart was full of this, of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods face, (though he intend to mention what generation it was, the generation of Iacob) he puts in that before, the generation of Iacob that ſeek thy face: that is, this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ſo priſe God in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and account it ſuch a bleſſing of God; that joyn themſelves to the Church of God, and ſet up his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and wayes; this is the bleſſed generation, theſe are thoſe that ſeek God truly. We ſeek not God truly unleſſe we ſeek him in his own wayes, unleſſe we ſeek him in all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, we cannot comfort our ſouls that we ſeek him in truth. For as in the way of obedience, we cannot have comfort in our obedience that it is
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40440:133"/>
true, except it be univerſall to all Gods commandments, ſo we cannot have comfort in our ſeeking that it is true, except it be in all his ordinances, and wayes: therefore we muſt be of the generation of them that ſeek the face of the Church, that ſeek thy face O Iacob. So it follows in that place, <hi>lift up your heads O ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, that the King of glory may come in.</hi> Where ſhould the King of glory come but into his Church? <hi>Who is the King of glory? The Lord, ſtrong and allmighty:</hi> ſtill the Church is called on to entertain Chriſt in his glory, ſo this is ſpoken of the Church. Thus you may know, whether you be of the ſeed of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</p>
            <p>Again, if you be the ſeed of Iacob you have the inheritance of Iacob, &amp; account it your inheritance. What was Iacobs inheritance? Deuter. 33.2. <hi>The Lord came from Sinai and from his right hand came a fiery law.</hi> The law of God is a fiery law; yet in verſe 4. <hi>Moſes commanded us a law, even the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40440:134"/>
inheritance of the congregation of Iacob.</hi> So that though the law be a fiery law, a ſtrict law, a ſevere law, yet it is the inheritance of the congregation of Iacob. If you be of the congregation of Iacob you account the law of God to be part of your inheritance: not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely to be that which you are bound to, that you muſt obey whether you will or no, but you rejoyce in the law of God as your inheritance. For my part I know not a more ſure note of a gracious heart then this; one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in Gods law as his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: as you know what expreſſions <hi>David</hi> hath, he rejoyced in it more then in Gold and Silver, more then in the honey, and the honey-comb. It is one thing to obey Gods Law, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to rejoyce in it as an inheritance. If thou be of the ſeed of Iacob, thou haſt the inheritance of the ſeed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</p>
            <p>Another is, he that is of the ſeed of Iacob is faithfull in the place that God hath ſet him. Iacob in ſerving of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Gen. 31.6. though he were chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40440:134"/>
he profeſſeth that withall his power he ſerved his father. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Text for ſervants; you would fain have time to ſeek God, and God forbid, but there ſhould be ſome time allowed the pooreſt and meaneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſeek God alone. But art thou of the ſeed of Iacob? then be like him in this, to ſerve with all, thy power, though thou have a froward maſter or miſtris, as Laban was, though they uſe you hardly, yet ſhew godlineſſe in that relation. And for ſervants to ſeem godly, he muſt go hear, this Sermon, this man, and the other man, and be very earneſt: (I blame them not for loving the word and deſiring it: but for ſervants to be earneſt in hearing the word, &amp; injoying the ordinances, and crying out againſt ſuperſtition, and Antichriſtianiſme, &amp; yet be ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, and unfaithfull in their ſervice, and ſo as to give juſt offence to their governours, it is a diſhonour. Shew your godlineſſe in your relation: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is no man or woman god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but thoſe that are ſo in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40440:135"/>
and places that they are ſet in: therefore manifeſt your ſelves thus to be the ſeed of Iacob.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſeed of Iacob is a taught ſeed, God teacheth them, Pſal. 147.19. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he gave his law to Iacob, and his word to Iſrael.</hi> So in Deut. 33.10. <hi>Levi is appointed to teach Iacob.</hi> There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one of the ſeed of Iacob that is ignorant, that is a fool in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he is taught.</p>
            <p>And then, one of the ſeed of Iacob, is one that hath a care of his family: ſo we read of Iacob, Gen. 35.1. <hi>God ſaid to Iacob, Ariſe, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddeſt from the face of Eſau thy brother. Then ſaid Iacob to his houſhold and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange gods that are among you, and be clean,</hi> &amp;c. When he was to go into Gods preſence, he laboured to reform his family. When God calls you to faſt dayes, and to the Sacrament, do you cleanſe your families, do you look
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40440:135"/>
what evills are in your families, and put out your power to cleanſe them?</p>
            <p>But there is one more that I may not omit, that is, Iacob, when he was to die, though he himſelf was to go the way of all fleſh, yet this was his great comfort and the comfort of thoſe that he left behind, that God would make good his word to his Church and people, Gen. 48.21. <hi>and Iſrael ſaid to Ioſeph, Behold,</hi> I <hi>die, but God will viſit you, and bring you again to the land of your Fathers.</hi> Behold I die, but I die in faith of the promiſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am taken away ſhall I think the promiſe ſhall be of no effect? no; God ſhall bring you to the land of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now when God ſhall caſt you on your ſick beds can you ſay, Behold I die; but go you on, God will make good his word, I die in faith that it ſhall go well with the Churches of God: there will be a time when they ſhall get the victory, when Chriſt ſhall reign, and the Saints ſhall be delivered from their oppreſſours? Here was the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40440:136"/>
ſpirit of Iacob: if you be ſuch a ſeed of Iacob you ſhall not ſeek Gods face in vain, but when you call unto him, he will anſwer you.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, it is true, ſome men may call unto God, and he will hear him, but I am a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and wretched creature, and if I do call unto him, he will not hear nor anſwer me.</p>
            <p>That place in the Pſalm fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers any objection againſt our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, or the poverty of our prayers, Pſalm. 102.17. <hi>He will regard the prayer of the deſtitute, and will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their prayers.</hi> The prayer of the deſtitute, the word ſignifies a poor ſhrub in the wilderneſſe, a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhrub, that is trodden on by the feet of beaſts, and none regards it; God regards ſuch prayers.</p>
            <p>If I could make an excellent prayer it were ſomewhat: No, he doth not deſpiſe thy prayer. It may be thy prayer is ſuch as thou deſpiſeſt, &amp; that others would deſpiſe, but God will not deſpiſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:40440:136"/>But this was ſpoken perhaps to ſome in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>Mark what follows; <hi>This ſhall be written for the generation to come.</hi> This Scripture, this promiſe of God, <hi>it is written for the generations to come. And the people that ſhall be created ſhall praiſe the Lord.</hi> We that were not made then, but were created ſince, let us praiſe the Lord for this Scripture, that God will regard the prayers of poor ſhrubs, and not deſpiſe them.</p>
            <p>But they are great things that I ſtand in need of, and it may be in vain for me to pray for ſuch great things at Gods hands; perhaps if I did pray for ordinary things there might be hope, but I am to pray for great things, mercies for the Church and for the Kingdom, &amp; people of God; is it not in vain for ſuch a poor wretch as I to pray for ſuch great things?</p>
            <p>We may think that the things we pray for at Gods hands are too great for us to beg, but they are not too great for God to give. It is obſerved
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40440:137"/>
of Perilla, when Alexander would have him ask a dowrie for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Alexander preſently promiſed him 50. talents; it is too much ſaith he, 10. talents are ſufficient; Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der anſwered him, if it be too great for you to ask, it is not too great for me to give. God loves that his people ſhould ask great things of him: yea he loves that the pooreſt, and meaneſt of his people ſhould ask him great things; and therefore he ſayes in this Text, <hi>Call unto me &amp; I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things.</hi> This is a promiſe to every one of the ſeed of Iacob.</p>
            <p>But when I pray in the time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and Gods hand is on me, will it not be in vain to call unto him then?</p>
            <p>It is true; to neglect God in former times, and then to pray onely in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is a dangerous condition: but this temptation comes upon ſuch as have ſought God before. I, now you ſeek God, but this is in your affliction, and will God regard you now? I ſpeak
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40440:137"/>
it onely to comfort ſuch as are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſeek God in the time of their health: yet if thou haſt been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; it is poſſible that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thee in the time of affliction. Ionah prayed, and ſaid, <hi>I prayed and cryed by reaſon of mine affliction to the Lord, and he heard me,</hi> Ionah 2.2.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it be affliction for ſin: for ſo the objection may ariſe. It is true, if I did call unto God in the time of affliction that God did ſend for tryall, it may be God would hear me: but ſuppoſe Gods hand be on me for ſin, will God hear my prayers?</p>
            <p>That one notable example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid may help the people of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a temptation: Gods hand was on him for his ſin, when he fled before Abſolom, God threatned that warre ſhould not depart from his houſe: yet David then prayed againſt that wicked politition, and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that the Lord would turn his counſell to folly; and God heard Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids prayer in his affliction that was for ſinne, <hi>And the Lord turned the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40440:138"/>
of Achitophel to folly.</hi> Let us not be diſcouraged though polititians work never ſo craftily; though Gods hand be on us, and we have conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing us, and ſay, I this is for your ſins that God leaves you thus in the hands of your enemies, that God gives them ſuch power; that they find ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Prince as they do, though this be for our ſins, yet let us ſeek to God to turn the counſell of Achitopell to folly. It ſhall not be, nor hath not been in vain, we have found it ſo, that in our affliction, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin, yet crying to God to turn the counſell of Achitophel to folly, God hath done ſo graciouſly, &amp; hath incouraged us more and more to cry and call unto him for that end.</p>
            <p>But what need I ſeek to God, God hath decreed and determined what he will do, what God intends to do, he hath decreed from eternity, therefore whether we pray or no it ſhall come to paſſe, if we do not pray it ſhall come to paſſe. If God have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deliver me out of a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40440:138"/>
it ſhall be done whether I pray or no; &amp; when any ones time is come they ſhall die; and ſo when the time of a Kingdome is come it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and not till then; therefore what good can prayer do?</p>
            <p>Though I ſuppoſe you cannot but be ſatisfied, and think that this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath little weight, yet for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I will give you a Scripture or two, Pſalm. 2. <hi>I will declare the decree,</hi> The decree of God concerning the advancement of Chriſt in his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo of the ſucceſſe of the work of Chriſts mediation. <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid thou art my ſon this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſsion.</hi> Gods giving of Chriſt the heathen for his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion; it was decreed of God, yet Chriſt muſt ask it of his Father notwithſtanding Gods decree. And another Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is in the propheſie of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40440:139"/>
where the Text ſaith Dan. 9.2. <hi>In the firſt year of his reign, I Daniel underſtood by books, the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah the Prophet, that he would accompliſh</hi> 70. <hi>years in the deſolation of Ieruſalem. And I ſet my face unto the Lord God to ſeek by prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Mark, Daniel underſtood by books what God had determined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ieruſalem; what need Daniel go further, he knew Gods mind what he would do whether he did pray or no? but mark, verſ. 3. <hi>I ſet my face to ſeek the Lord.</hi> After he knew what God had decreed, and what he would do, and what he had promiſed. Now we know not Gods decree: but if we did certainly know the decree of God in ſhewing mercy to the Land, yet it could no way hinder us, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to ſet our faces to ſeek the Lord, and to ſeek him more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly: therefore that is a vain obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Again, it is not in vain to call unto the Lord, if we examine all we have
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40440:139"/>
had already: though we have not all we would have, yet if we conſider the ſupporting mercies, the preventing mercies, and the guiding mercies that God hath granted us, we ſhall find that it is not in vain that we have ſought him. There are abundance of mercies that thou haſt had already. It is an evill thing to complain of Gods grace, when God hath beſtowed ſuch mercies. Thou thinkeſt thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe thou haſt not all thou wouldeſt have; as a froward child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath not every thing to its mind caſts away all. God hath been exceeding gracious to us; other ſouls would have adored God, and have bleſſed him with their faces to the ground, if they had had but the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of thoſe mercies that we have; yet becauſe we have not all we deſire, we are ready to think it is in vain. O let us take heed of diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God.</p>
            <p>Again, further thou thinkeſt it is in vain, becauſe God ſometimes denies in granting, and grants in denying.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40440:140"/>
Many times God grants that we pray for in denying it, and denies that we pray for in granting it: our denyals are grants to us. Wo to us, if all were granted to us that we pray for. Much good may be gotten out of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyalls: and God denyes us to do us good, and to prepare us for mercies: therefore it is not in vain that thou haſt fought God, becauſe it is not in vain that thou art denyed.</p>
            <p>But further, it may be God delights more in thy praying, then in thy praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, therefore though thou have not that thou haſt ſought for, give leave to God to delight in thee which way he pleaſeth. There is the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the praiſing voice of Gods people, thou delighteſt that God ſhould hear thy praiſing voice, it may be God delights to hear thy praying voice, and it may be he ſhould not if thou haddeſt what thou wouldeſt have. Saith God to the Church, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for it is ſweet.</hi> There is no man that will think the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his petition, as long as the King
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40440:140"/>
loves to read it. If one preſent a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King, he doth not ſay he will preſently do it: but if he read it, and when he hath read it, calls for it again, and again, will any man think it in vain that he hath put up that peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? as long as the King hears it, and delights to read it, it is not in vain. So, as long as God loves to hear thy voice, and to read thy petition it is not in vain. As for thy praiſing voice, God ſhall have enough of that in heaven, but he ſhall have none of thy praying voice: therefore why ſhouldeſt thou not be willing that God ſhould have more of thy praying voice here? All that ever God ſhall have of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice it is in this worln, and after a little time God ſhall never hear us pray more. Therefore let us be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go on, and continue in prayer, and not to wonder why God keeps us on in a way of praying, becauſe all the time that ever God ſhall have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in the praying voice of his people it is in this world: and for our praiſing voice, we would fain
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40440:141"/>
ſpend all our dayes in praiſing God for his mercies, but that is reſerved for another world.</p>
            <p>Further, it may be Gods way to ſtay till he bring a great deal of mercy together, and not by bitts and drops. As when men deal with great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they expect not to have pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſix pences or ſhillings or Crowns at once: but though there be two or three or ten pounds due, they ſtand not on that, but ſtay for a greater ſumme. Now little traders that deal by retail, they take it in by pence, and little ſummes, Chriſtians that are to deal with God, they deal for great things, and there are great tranſactions between God and a gracious heart: therefore think not much that God ſtayes with a greater ſumme. For as God deals with the wicked in the way of juſtice, ſo he deals with godly men in a way of mercy. He lets wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men go on a great while, he comes not to judgement for ſin, but ſtayes till all come together, till a great ſumme of wrath and judgement come
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40440:141"/>
together. So he deals with the ſaints he comes not with leſſe mercies, but he ſtayes till abundance come, and when Gods time is come mercies will come to the full indeed.</p>
            <p>Further, it may be God hath ſo much mercy that thou haſt not a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell capable of it. Onely know that heaven, and earth and all are working for thee. Is the plowing, and the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the husbandman, and all the ſhowers in vain; becauſe the corn is not in the barn? we account it not ſo: ſo we muſt not account our prayers loſt, becauſe the thing we pray for is not preſently graunted and owe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers anſwered. Now for Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if it be ſo, that God ſaith, call upon me, and I will anſwer thee, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there are great things for the Church to build on: God is to do marvelous things for his people in theſe latter dayes. Why? becauſe all the Saints from the beginning of the world have been ſeeking God, not onely for their own times but for the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40440:142"/>
Church to this very day: all their prayers are upon the fyle, and muſt be anſwered one day. O what a glorious harveſt will it be! bleſſed are they that ſhall live to partake of it. We have a little, but certainly, there are glorious things for the Church; becauſe everie prayer ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you that are the Saints of God, know your honour, though you be never ſo poor otherwiſe, God hath given you that which makes you rich: you have the key of heaven, you may open the treaſures in heaven, and it ſhall never be in vain. Gods people are ſuch as are exceeding honourable in the eyes of God, and in this regard that they have credit in heaven, that their prayers ſhall be heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Bathſheba ſaith to Solomon, 1 King. 2.20. <hi>I deſire one petition of thee, I pray thee, ſay me not nay,</hi> It is tranſlated by ſome, <hi>Ne confundas fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam,</hi> confound not my face. Indeed, the denying of a petition, it is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a confounding of the face:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40440:142"/>
but God will not confound the faces of his people.</p>
            <p>O, here ſee your priviledge, and your riches, all the prayers that you have made in your life time they are all trading in heaven, they are not loſt. If a man have ventured a ſtock abroad to the Indies, and do not hear of it in a great while, he thinks it is loſt &amp; gone: but if he hear certain news that all his ſtock is ſafe, &amp; in the place where he would have it, and thoſe that are there faithfully improve his ſtock, he is revived by this, it rejoyceth his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he can ſay bleſſed be God; I hope to be a rich man for all this. I ſay to thee be of good comfort thy ſtock is not loſt, it is trading in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and everie prayer that thou haſt put up is there. We ſhould account our prayers as riches, as adventures ſent to heaven, and not as children that ſhoot arrows and do not mind them.</p>
            <p>And then learn this, it is a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to have a praying friend, a praying companion. Manie of you
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40440:143"/>
love friends that are delightfull, of a cheerly nature, and merry; but are they praying ones: praying friends are the ſpeciall friends: becauſe prayer can prevail with God. To have a friend in the Court, that can obtain any peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we think it a priviledge; to have one great friend in heaven is a great priviledge. Many people when they lie on their ſick beds, they ſend to ſuch and ſuch to pray for them: why do they not ſend to their companions, that they did drink with, and ſwear with, to pray for them? O, they dare not. Here is enough to convince anie mans conſcience, who are the beſt men, whatſoever they ſay.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe thy condition were thus, that thou diddeſt lie on thy death-bed, and thy life did depend upon the prayers of four or five men. If God ſhould ſpeak thus from heaven, thou art at the brink of deſtruction, onely this favour thou ſhalt find; thou ſhalt have leave to chooſe where thou wilt four or five men to pray for thee, and according as they pray ſo it ſhall be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40440:143"/>
with thee; thou haſt liberty to chooſe through the world whom thou wilt. I appeal, would a drunkard chooſe four or five drunkards, or a ſwearer chooſe ſwearers, or unclean ones that they moſt delighted in all their life time? If all ſhould depend upon it thou wouldeſt not chooſe ſuch; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art convinced in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thou knoweſt that thoſe are not precious in Gods eyes, (however thy luſt have prevailed) but that the other are better men, that are gracious and have more credit in heaven. Learn to priſe praying friends, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God.</p>
            <p>And let us ſet the crown upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers head, in the mercies we have from God, in publick mercies, and private deliverances of friends; attribute it not to ſecond means, to fortune and chance, take heed of denying God his glorie.</p>
            <p>It is a ſign of a carnall ſpirit, when God hath glorified himſelf in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prayers of his people, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to any other means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:40440:144"/>As I remember, I read of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirian atheiſts, that followed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme of Porphyrie, they darkned the work of God in delivering the children of Iſrael out of Egypt thorough the red ſea. They ſay that Moſes had learned of the Egyptians, and they were great Aſtronomers: and Moſes knew when it would be a low tyde, and what conſtellations there would be at that time, and that the tyde would prove low then, more then ever in the age of man, and Moſes took the nick of time, end lead them through the ſea. Thus atheiſts would darken the works of God, &amp; put them of to naturall cauſes. So I find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of the old Prophet in Ieroboams time; Ioſephus hath it related of him, he ſent to Ieroboam to ſtretch out his hand, he tells us that this was by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he was wearied all the day long, and now he had the Palſie, and after it was reſtored again; that which was done by prayer, he would have it by naturall means.</p>
            <p>Iuſt thus it is, when God hath ſo
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40440:144"/>
magnified his mercy to England, and wrought ſuch wonders yet manie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall atheiſticall ſpirits, ſay this was an accidentall thing, and the policie of ſuch men brought it to paſſe, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all to naturall cauſes, it is a ſign of wretched profane heart: For if God ever magnified prayer he hath done it in theſe dayes. There are 2 or 3 Scriptures that ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan were never more magnified, then by Gods working at this day.</p>
            <p>One is in Exodus 13. In the thing wherein they dealt proudly, God was above them. Never ſince the world began was that more fulfilled. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is that in the 10. Pſalme, <hi>The wicked are ſnared in the work of their own hands.</hi> If ever there were a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Scripture ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, it is as this day. A third is this in the Text. <hi>I ſaid not to the ſeed of Iacob; ſeek ye my face in vain.</hi> God (as I ſaid) hath raiſed a ſpirit of prayer among the ſeed of Iacob more then ever any in the world knew; there was never the like ſpirit of prayer
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40440:145"/>
raiſed, nor never the like things done for prayer.</p>
            <p>And the Lord the rather honoured the ordinance of prayer now, becauſe men ſo diſhonoured it before and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted it, that the people of God could not meet and aſſemble to faſt and pray, but preſently it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, and they were perſecuted as factious people. Becauſe God ſaw this way deſpiſed, he hath honoured it, and the former, and the latter mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we have received, we are to attribute to the goodneſſe of God by prayer, they were obtained by prayer. Let us ſtill be incouraged to call unto God for what we would have: for God hath ſaid, call upon me and I will anſwer thee.</p>
            <p>There are many of us now that can do little elſe: if God have delivered you from ſickneſſe, and other evils, know that God hath delivered you to pray, the leſſe you can do otherwiſe, the more you ſhould do in prayer. I have read of a heathen, Nu<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylius, that he would never go about
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40440:145"/>
any thing but he would go to the temple and pray: you that are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments intruſted with our lives, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, you had need to pray much, go into your cloſets and ſanctifie all your thoughts and reſolutions by prayer, that your help and aſſiſtance may not be in vain to us. And all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had need to aſſiſt you in ſeeking God in prayer. This incouragement we have, that there is not any of us that ſeek God alone, but we joyn with thouſands: why ſhould our place be found empty? why ſhould not our prayers joyn with the reſt? We ſhall meet manie prayers in heaven; the prayers of our forefathers; the prayers of thoſe that are dead and gone that did not live to enjoy the fruit of their prayers, yet when we pray for mercies our prayers meet with theirs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: therefore let us be incouraged to call unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And if mercies ſhould come, what a daunting would this be to our hearts, that mercies are come, but we have not ſought them? and if mercies
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40440:146"/>
come not, conſcience will flie in our face that we have been ſenſuall, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall creatures, and it is for our neglect of calling unto God, that God hath denied us the mercies that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>And then it ſhould be a uſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke to thoſe that begin to ſeek God, and continue not. O wretch, why haſt thou left? whether wilt thou go? Is it in vain to ſerve the Lord? certainly thou wert never acquainted with God and his wayes; thou wilt find it a dreadfull change, when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that thou had left God the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living water, and haſt ſought after vanitie, and forſaken thine own mercy.</p>
            <p>But the main of all ſhould have been for the applying of it to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. The Lord hath made good his word this day, call unto me, and I will anſwer thee· This day teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it to be true that they are great things that prayer hath done. I have heard manie years ago by credible te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, that on this fifth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40440:146"/>
when we had ſuch a great mercie ſo manie years ago, that verie day it was known, that a great manie godly people in the citie kept in faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, ſo as it was eminently known and delivered from hand to hand of them in the city at that time, and you know what God did.</p>
            <p>But what hath he done of late? If our fathers ſhould riſe out of their graves, and we ſhould tell them that now the high commiſſion (that they were ſo troubled with) is down; that there ſhall be no more ſtar-chamber, that cutting off of ears is gone, they would wonder how this ſhould come to paſſe. And whereas Parliaments were wont to be ſnapped in ſunder, that this Parliament is to continue by as firm an Act as any thing in the land is made by. And for oppreſſours, all the Courts and Biſhops Chanceries, they are down, and gone, God hath extirpated them: they were firſt caſt out of the houſe, and now out of the Kingdome. And though an armie did riſe and ſeek to bring us into ſlaverie,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40440:147"/>
yet God hath given us victory (though ſome have ſuffered hardly) and brought the adverſaries very low to ſurrender their towns, and caſtles and arms. And here we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God, and to bleſſe him for all.</p>
            <p>If many of our anceſtours ſhould riſe, and hear what we ſpeak, how we hold up our hands and bleſſe God, with what hearts would they joyn in the praiſing of God, and wonder that ever ſuch things ſhould be done! Let not the grace of God be in vain, as God hath not ſaid to us, ſeek my face in vain.</p>
            <p>What uſe ſhall we make of it?</p>
            <p>Let us give him reall praiſe, and not onely come to repeat it, and tell God of it, but make his praiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, put a glorie on it; and then we do it, when we make a right uſe of his mercies, when we receive not his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in vain.</p>
            <p>What is to make uſe of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall we celebrate?</p>
            <p>Firſt, the remembrance of theſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40440:147"/>
mercies muſt humble us; that is a ſweet humbling; it is better to be melted by the beams of the Sunne, then by the ſcorching of the fire.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, humbled, for what?</p>
            <p>There are three things that we have cauſe to be humbled for, upon the conſideration of the mercy of God towards us,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſinne of unbelief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, when we were ſtraitned at any time, when we heard ill news, that our armies fled, and came to danger, how our ſpirits were down as if all were gone. Let us check our hearts, God rebuked us in a kindly manner, we might have had a furious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, be humbled for all our murmuring and repining, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, O we did not think that the wars would have held ſo long, and O what taxations are upon us, and all our eſtates rent away? And how manie are there that had rather that all the good that God hath done for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40440:148"/>
ſince theſe times ſhould never have been done, then that they ſhould ſuffer in their outward eſtates. Be rebuked for all your murmuring and repyning at ſuch difficulties as you have met with in the great cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>The third thing that this mercy ſhould make us humbled for, &amp; look back to, is that if ever there have riſen this thought in any of our hearts, that it had been better for me if I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared ſo much. I ſee how things are like to be, the enemie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails and is like to overrun all: had it not been better that I had not ingaged my ſelf ſo much? that I had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much? are they not wiſer men that have kept themſelves quiet and ſilent, and done as little as they could, nothing but what they have been forced to? And when the Kings party come, if they tax us, they can do no more then force us. If thou have ſuch a thought, pray to God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give that thought: Let this that God hath done rebuke thee. Art thou ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40440:148"/>
for what thou haſt done? thou ſeeſt God will do it without thee. If thou have been a publick inſtrument, and haſt done good and yet if in fear of ſucceſſe thou haſt repented? God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes thee this day.</p>
            <p>Then labour to love prayer as long as you live, as David ſaith, <hi>I will call upon God as long as ever live.</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſts the ſcals, and hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the other ſide they feared not to ſuffer much if they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; they think they have a head and they would be where he was, and he would countenance them, &amp; make good their condition for them, but this ſide if they had been overcome, they had been men utterly undone: what a mighty advantage was there one way more then another?</p>
            <p>Then the Kings ſide if he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed he had places of dignitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; if the Parliaments ſide prevail, we are but where we were, we do but maintain our own, we cannot expect to raiſe our condition. But how many
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40440:149"/>
broken Gentry expected to raiſe their condition on the other ſide? As it is ſaid concerning the Pope, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Counſell; the Pope prevailed, notwithſtanding the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, though that were above him, why? the Pope had Cardinall ſhips, and Deaneries to beſtow but the Councell had none; they had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that way.</p>
            <p>Again, thoſe that appeared on the one ſide how were they diſcouraged extraordinarily? on the other ſide they were incouraged to the utmoſt. On the one ſide how unfaithfull have they been? on the other ſide they have kept to their principles, becauſe their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſuitable to the fleſh: but there are many on this ſide that have not gracious principles and had a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick cauſe, therefore they have been unfaithfull. We have uſe of men that have not principles to act by, but all the other go according to their own principles. The one part acts that they may gratifie mens luſts; now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the world love it; they
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40440:149"/>
know if the one partie prevail they ſhall have liberty, and licenſciouſneſs, but if the other prevail they ſhall live under laws. Now men would have their luſts; therefore when they ſee on the one ſide they ſhall have their luſts, and on the other ſide they ſhall be more curbed, they ſtrive hard for their luſts.</p>
            <p>At the firſt I wondred that men ſhould be ſo vile to fight to make themſelves ſlaves: but when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they ſhall have ſlaves under them, and have their luſts, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide be more curbed, then I was ſatisfied, and wondered that God ſhould caſt the ſcale the other way, they having all the advantages in a carnall way more then the other. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here it is, we have people that have prayed, and this hath caſt the ſcale. Love prayer, and praying people, and joyn with them, be on their ſide, for God is with them, and will not ſuffer them to pray in vain: a praying Chriſtian is a uſefull Chriſtian in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:40440:150"/>Again, make this uſe of all that hath been done. Look how far thou thinkeſt the adverſaries would have been hardned if they had prevailed againſt the cauſe of God, be thou ſo much the more reſolute in the cauſe of God. If they had prevailed how would they have blaſphemed? and manie thouſands of Atheiſt; would have been made more then there was before: what a mightie offence, and ſtumbling block would this have been? Now ſince God hath turned it the other way, juſtifie God and his cauſe; ſettle your hearts in the love of God, and his cauſe, and ſettle your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves more ſtrongly in the reformation in hand.</p>
            <p>Further, let us give him reall praiſe, that we may not receive the grace of God in vain. By this grace we hope that he hath given us our eſtates that we were afraid would have been rent from us; we have the continuance of our liberties, and of the Goſpell. Let our hearts be ingaged to God to give up our eſtates this day; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40440:150"/>
our ingagements to God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, between God and our ſouls. Lord thou mighteſt have taken away my eſtate by the ſpoylers, it was near it; and thou haſt done it to other of my brethren, and is mine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued! That eſtate that ſhould have been ſpent for their luſts, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſpend it in thy ſervice that haſt preſerved it; and I account it a great mercie that I have an eſtate to honour thy name, I feared I ſhould not.</p>
            <p>God expects, that ever hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward you make a more holy uſe of your eſtates then before. And call your hearts to queſtion, what do I do with my eſtate for God? what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath God from my eſtate more then before? God expects more, or elſe God may juſtly ſay, in vain have I preſerved this wretched eſtate: there are manie of my ſervants, if I had preſerved their eſtates, they would have improved them in the towns and places they lived in, and here is a wretch I have preſerved his eſtate,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40440:151"/>
and he is more greedy and ſcrapes up for himſelf, and all his thought is, how to repair what he hath loſt by taxations, &amp;c. The Lord may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of what he hath done, and the curſe of God may follow ſuch a mans eſtate. Take heed, know that there is an ingagement after this time.</p>
            <p>And ſo for the libertie of the Goſpell, God expects that you ſhould priſe the Goſpell more then ever. Lord, we were afraid the Goſpell would have been gone, if thou hadſt given us up into the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and our eyes ſhould not have ſeen their teachers; we ſhould not have heard things that refreſh our hearts; ſhall we have the Goſpell, and hope that our poſterity ſhall have it? we hope that we ſhall never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thee as we have done heretofore to take it away. A man that hath been in danger to looſe his eſtate, and hath recovered it, will be carefull after. Our ſlighting of the Goſpell becauſe we had it ſo ordinarie might have cauſed God to take it from us; and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40440:151"/>
hath God reſtored it? let us take heed we provoke not God now, but attend upon the word more then ever we did.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, doth God ſay to us, <hi>Call upon me, and I will anſwer thee,</hi> then when God ſeeks us, let us be found of him. There is all the reaſon for it in the world. If God be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to poor baſe worms, ſinfull creatures, that if we do but chatter, our prayers are anſwered: Is it not reaſon when God calls upon us, that we ſhould call upon him? When God calls out of his word to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch, and ſuch duties, God ſeeks thee; then make uſe of this Text, I have called upon God, and he hath anſwered my requeſts. And now I go to hear the word, and out of the word he calls unto me, and ſeeks me, let me ſay, Lord what ſayeſt thou to thy ſervant? The Lord is ready to hear your call, be you ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his anſwer, and go on, go on with encouragement, the Lord hath incouraged us this day. And let all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40440:152"/>
your prayers and indeavours break through all difficulties, and the Lords mercy ſhall break through all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: for he hath ſaid, <hi>Call unto me, and I will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things, which thou knoweſt not.</hi>
