            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I Sing the Man that never Equal knew,</l>

               <l>Who when the Globe of Earth he had subdu'd,</l>

Long as the world shall fresh and deathless last,</l>
               <l>No less to future Ages, then the past.</l>
               <l>Great my presumption is, I must confess,</l>
               <l>But if I thrive, my Glory's ne're the less;</l>
               <l>Nor will it from his Conquests derogate</l>
               <l>A Female Pen his Acts did celebrate.</l>

               <l>Whose Laurels were not fresher, than their Fame</l>
               <l>Is now, and will for ever be the same.</l>
               <l>If the like favour thou wilt grant to me,</l>
               <l>O Queen of Verse, I'll not ungrateful be,</l>
               <l>My choicest hours to thee I'll Dedicate,</l>
               <l>'Tis thou shalt rule, 'tis thou shalt be my Fate.</l>
               <l>But if Coy Goddess thou shalt this deny,</l>
               <l>And from my humble suit disdaining fly,</l>
               <l>I'll stoop and beg no more, since I know this,</l>
               <l>Writing of him, I cannot write amiss:</l>
               <l>His lofty Deeds will raise each feeble line,</l>
               <l>And God-like Acts will make my Verse Divine.</l>

                  <l>And none could say, where most her Charms did lye,</l>
                  <l>In her inchanting Tongue, or conquering Eye.</l>
                  <l>Her Vertue yet her Beauties so out-shon,</l>

                  <l>The most Accomplish't was esteem'd to be,</l>

                  <l>The <hi>Muses</hi> too, like him, did none inspire,</l>

                  <l>But these so much Excelling parts the Swain,</l>
                  <l>With Imperfections no less Great, did stain:</l>

For proud he was, of an Ungovern'd Will,</l>
                  <l>With Love Familiar, but a Stranger still</l>
                  <l>To Faith and Constancy; and did his Heart,</l>
                  <l>Retaining none, expose to ev'ry Dart.</l>
                  <l>Hapless <hi>Rodanthe,</hi> the Fond Rover, caught,</l>
                  <l>To whom, for Love, with usual Arts he sought;</l>
                  <l>Which she, ah too unwary, did bestow:</l>
                  <l>'Cause True her self, believ'd that he was so.</l>
                  <l>But he, alas, more wav'ring than the Wind,</l>
                  <l>Streight broke the Chain, she thought so fast did bind;</l>
                  <l>For he no sooner saw her Heart was gain'd,</l>
                  <l>But he as soon the Victory disdain'd;</l>
                  <l>Mad Love else-where, as if 'twere like Renown,</l>

Her Form, her Fame, her Vertue, Riches, Wit,</l>
                  <l>Like Deaths sad Weights upon her Soul did sit:</l>
                  <l>Or else like Furies stood before her Face,</l>

                  <l>Disabl'd both to Act, and to Command.</l>
                  <l>Oh Cruel Fetters! rather wish to feel,</l>
                  <l>On your soft Limbs, the Gauling Weight of Steel;</l>

                  <l>And time'd soft Musick with their downy Wings.</l>
