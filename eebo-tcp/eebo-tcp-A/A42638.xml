            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Those who have Marshald the Orders of Colombs (to make good the first Point) have Ranged the Toscan to be the Supporter of a Building, but such an Atlas must stand on a firm Ground, not as ill Builders place Colombs (either of Brick or Stone) like things Patcht or glewed against a Wall, and for the most part against the second Story of a Building, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very <hi>Gothish</hi> Custome, who at least did begin their But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trises from the Ground) as if their intent were, that the weight of the Colombs should draw down the Wall, on the heads of those that passe by.</p>
                  <p>Such Builders confound the first and essential point of Building, (to wit, <hi>Solidity,</hi> with <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Conveniency.)</hi>

                  <p>They will make a shew of some thing, but misse thereby (as ill

Bow-men) the Mark: They may perchance have heard of rare Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, nay, seen the Books of the <hi>Italian</hi> Architects, have the Traditions of <hi>Vignola</hi> in their Pockets, and have heard Lectures on the Art of Architecture, which have laid before them the most necessary Rules, as also the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the severall Orders of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombs, and Discourses made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the <hi>Toscan</hi> is as the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> so of the <hi>Jonic</hi> and <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian;</hi> the first of the two to Resemble the Dressing of the Daughters of <hi>Jonio,</hi> who had Twists of Hair on both sides of their Cheeks. The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Heads to represent a Basket with Acante Leaves, and the Guttered Colombs, the Pleats of Daughter and Womens Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Grecians</hi> (in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Victories) did


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30449:59"/>
Range the Colombs in their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, to represent the number of Slaves which they had taken; the Grains, Beads, Drops, Pendants, Garlands, Enterlaced-Knots, Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and an infinite number of Ornaments, which are put on the Frize, to signifie the Spoiles which the Victors had brought away from their Enemies; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Memory thereof, did place them on their Buildings, that they might also serve for a true History.</p>
                  <p>But none of such Ornaments were ever impediments to the strength or convenience of a Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for they were so handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well contrived, as once the Dutchesse of <hi>Cheiveruse</hi> (a French Lady) said of the English Females, that they had a singular grace to set their Ornaments right and handsomly.</p>

                  <p>And as for the inside of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, Builders should in the first place set the Doors, Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Windows, as may be most convenient for use.</p>
                  <p>Builders ought to be not onely experimented in House-keeping, but also good Naturalists, to know (before they spend time and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials) the required Property to every part of a Building.

                  <p>An though it be not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fign in this small Discourse to Treat of Dimensions (which are fit for a Primar to Apprentices,) Yet I cannot desist (by reason of the <hi>West-Indian</hi> Herican-like-windes which happened <hi>February</hi> last, to preswade all Builders to forbear the Building any more those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Chimney-Shafts, which when they fall, break both Roofs and Sealings of Roomes, and kill good People in their Beds: since a Chimney some two Foote high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Ridges of the Roof of a Building, (which is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertopt

                  <p>Noble, magnificent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Staircases, must in the first place participate of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans manner of Pace and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>There is no man of sound Limbs (and that hath a gallant Gate) but lifts his Toes at least four Inches, when he goeth an ordinary easie

Pace; so that if two steps (each four Inches high) be eighteen Inches broad, or deep, which makes six and thirty Inches the two (the just measure of a mans two steps,) they may be ascended from the first Floor, to the higher Story, as if a man walked on a level ground.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those Staires ought to be so long, that the Attendants on each side the Noble Person, Prince or Soveraign, may not be streightned for roome.</p>
                  <p>Such were the Monarchlike Staires of the Pallace of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, at <hi>Chelminor</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> near <hi>Saras,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan between <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Espa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi> I do speak indeed of a Pallace without comparison to any other, the Walls of Circumvallation of that Pallace, being four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot thick, and the Staires (as

                  <p>King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could not have been so much in danger of an Onset in a Paire of Staires, larger enough for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Retinue to his Person, as he was in a narrow Pair, which History mentions.</p>

Mens Houses, <hi>Too many Staires and back-Doorss</hi> (as the old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Proverb) <hi>makes Thieves and Whores.</hi> And the setting the Front of a Building towards the North-West, and a Pallace, like Cardinal <hi>Wolseyes</hi> ill-placed one (now called <hi>Whitehall)</hi> on a low ground by the River side) makes work for Physitians, Apothecaries, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Coffen and Grave-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
                  <p>But as for a Seate on Morish Grounds (except the Builders observe the practice of those of <hi>Venice</hi> (in <hi>Italy)</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> (in <hi>Holland)</hi> who bestow more Timber of Oake in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one, than in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of six Houses,) in effect 'tis to Build perpetually, leaving to their Posterity to prop and redresse their ill grounded Buildings; and they may well be rankt with the Duke

                  <p>I must also advise Builders on high Grounds, to cause their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors to search for Springs, and shun them; which serve better to fill up Glasses to allay the Vapours of <hi>Gascony</hi> Wines, than to make a Pond in a Sellar.</p>
                  <p>Builders ought also to be very curious. and carefull in the choice of the place to build a Seat on, for good Prospect, well Garnisht with Woods, and the Water at hand, not too near, nor too far from a City or Town.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> I must wish all Princes and Noble Persons who are resolved to Build Palaces and Seats answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their quality, to imitate

those who in the Heathen age were so carefull in the ordering of the Structure of their Stone Images, especially of their <hi>Saturn, Jupitur, Apollo, Mars, Neptune,</hi> (and all their Fry of wanton Godesses) as to empannel a Jury of Philosophers, Naturalists, Physiognomists and Anatomists, who were to direct the Sculptors how to Represent those Images. And so I would wish Builders to proceed in the contriveing the Models of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fabrick, to wit, to consult (as those of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> did in the making the Model of their Town-House, divers experimented Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects, though they pitcht for the Front on the worst of all.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30449:64"/>
never to alter, nor to pull down what hath been well begun, nor to hearken to the diversity of opinions, which have been, and are the causes of many Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Extravagancies in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and especially those who seem to have had for Models Bird-Cages, to jump from one Roome into the other by Steps and Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, to cause Men and Women to stumble.</p>
                  <p>And the sides all of Glasse (like Spectacles) the glasse Windowes of small Payns, with great store of Lead, to draw the more Wind and Moisture from the open Aire within Doores. As also Windowes with store of Iron Casements, which rust, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shut close, Notwithstanding all the various devices of Smiths, to catch Money out of the Builders Purses, contrary to the


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30449:65"/>
good custome in <hi>Italy, Spain, France, Germany,</hi> and the Low-Countreys, which certainly for plurality of Voices should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and followed.</p>
                  <p>Those Nations cause their glasse Windows to be fitted in woodden Casements treble rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to keep out Wind and Rain; they are lined with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Shutters, and have double boarded Shutters without, to resist all the violence of the Weather and Thieves.</p>
                  <p>Let no man mistake these Windows for woodden Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for such are usually seen here in <hi>England</hi> in old woodden Houses, the Casements scarce above one Foot and a half high, tottering things; for these are substantially, strongly, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osly made Casements; nor are the woodden Shutters such Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-like 


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30449:65"/>
things, as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally put on the outside of the Windows on the <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs Houses, but duble-Deal well-riveted Windows, with substantiall Locks, Bolts, and Hinges, and a double Iron Bar, with a Bolt fixt in the middle of them both.</p>
                  <p>Nor do good builders affect partitions of Lime and Hair in their Houses, nor any of their Bricks to be daubed over with finishing-Morter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> are very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the tempering their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the laying it as thin as possibly they can, to prevent the sinking and bending of their Walls, which the laying of their Morter too thick doth cause; and experience sheweth, that when some Walls are taken down in <hi>England,</hi> half of the


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30449:66"/>
substance is Sand and Dust.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> (as likewise the <hi>Grecians</hi> before them) did not make use of their Lime, at the same time it was slakt, but for six Moneths time suffered to putrifie, and so putrified com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a Seiment, which joyned with Stone (or Brick) made an inseparable union, and such strong work as I have seen Iron-Tools break on the old Morter of the <hi>Amphitheaters</hi> at <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their manner of preparing Lime is to lay it in Cesternes the one higher than the other, that the Water (after it hath been so stirred as that it is well mixt and throughly liquid) may drayn from one Cistern to the other, and after six Moneths time (the Lime having evacuated its putrefaction) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30449:66"/>
purified, and then they mix two parts of Lime with one part of Sand, and makes that strong and pure Morter, which if practised in <hi>England</hi> would make a wondrous strong U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, especially if the Clay-makers did beat the Clay as it ought to be, the English Clay being better than the Italian, nay the best in the world.</p>
                  <p>They are very carefull in the making large and deep Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to let the Walls raised on the Foundations rest and settle a good while before they proceed to the second Story.</p>
                  <p>Some of our Carpenters have learned to lay Boards loose for a time, the <hi>Italians</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not sparing therein, they nayl them as if for good and all, but rip or take them up again, to fit them for the second time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:30449:67"/>
As I said before, no Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is begun before a mature Resolve on a compleat finisht Modell of the entire design: the Builder having made choice of his Surveyor, and committed to him all the care and guidance of the work, never changeth on the various opinions of other men, for they are unlimited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every mans conceits are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their profession, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasion.</p>
                  <p>A Soveraign or any other Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, is then guided by naturall Principles, as well as by his own Resolve, taken on a long consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Modell, because they know (by experience) how suddain changes are able to cause mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous effects.</p>
                  <p>They know that a well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Surveyor must not be disturbed in his task, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30449:67"/>
but as the Silk Worm and the Soul of Man, the first in his Husk, the second in the Womb, wherein both the one and the other (by the powers of the great Architect and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of all things) works out his own compleat Fabrick, if not interrupted; but if inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any outward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it happens that those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions become the originall causes of exorbitant Features and Forms. An <hi>Item</hi> for all Builders to suffer a good Architect quietly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue his task, if he understands it.</p>
                  <p>It hath been observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the French (a Nation as much addicted to changes as any) that when the charge of an undertaking hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to many, it caused but confusion, and therefore its a


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30449:68"/>
saying among them, <hi>Trop de Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sineirs gattent le pottage,</hi> Too many Cooks spoils the Broth.</p>
                  <p>I shall not spend time, and transgresse on the Readers pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, concerning the making of Clay, and burning of Bricks, only say, that it imports much the Clay should be well wrought, before it be put in the Mould: experience hath also taught Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers to have them of such a length, thicknesse and widenesse, that four of them (together with the Morter thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) may raise a Foot.</p>
                  <p>As for Free-stone, <hi>Portland</hi> Stone works well, and makes a good union with Bricks, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compared with Marble, nor to the Blewish Stone of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Leige</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> But 'tis also certain, that this Climate makes Marble it self to Moulder very


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30449:68"/>
much: as for example, the <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in <hi>York-House</hi> Garden, which did not Moulder when it stood in that of the Duke of <hi>Larma</hi> at <hi>Valedolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (together with the moistnesse of this Clime) being of a contrary operation to the temper of the Aire in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Builders see their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings; Water-table, Cornishes. Railes, and Balisters to decay, they must have patience, since there is no Meterial but is subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and that Rails and Balisters (either on the top of the Walls of a Frontispiece, or in Belconies, though never so well Painted in Oyle, and of the best seasoned Timber,) but must be renewed at fourty or fifty years end.</p>
                  <p>Builders ought to calculate the Charges of their designed Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and especially with what


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30449:69"/>
Summe of Money they are willing to part, and yet remember to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate some Philosophical Humorist, who resolves to venture on a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thing called a Handsome Lady, without which their Fate seems to tell them they cannot live, and therefore makes an account before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that all things will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely answer his expectation. But on the contrary, the Lady instead of being a good Houswise, (and an assistant) proves expensive, and an impediment. And if it prove otherwise, he will be a great gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the bargain; for let Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders put their design to Master-Workmen by the Great, or have it Wrought by the Day, either the Workmen will over-reach themselves, or the Builder will be over-reached.</p>
                  <p>Charity to the one, and respect to the other, moves me to keep


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30449:69"/>
the rest in my Pen, yet shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be backward to inform either of them in the ear what may be the best for them to choose.</p>
                  <p>But I must freely advise all Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in general, never to begin to Build on a Ground before it be Purchased, as the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did at <hi>York-House,</hi> where there hath been much daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and breaking through old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten decayed Walls; first to make a Ladies Closet on the corner of a Wall where a Butteryses stood; and which was taken away for the Closet, intended only at first for a Closet of case, and to serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> could be perswaded to accept as good a Seat as that was, in lieu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30449:70"/>
to the Dignity of a prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State) forreign Princes and Embassadors; so as on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, all the Butterises that upheld that rotten Wall were thrown down, the Seeling of Roomes supported with Iron-bolts, Belco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nses clapt up in the old Wall, daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with finishing Morter, and all this (as a Toadestoole groweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a night) to serve untill a Model for a Solid Building (to stand even with the Street) were made, and to be Built or such Stone as the Portico or Water. Gate at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver side is, and this was done on a Morish Ground, whereon no New Building could stand any time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proppings, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the main. Principle of good Building.</p>
                  <p>I must proceed and conclude with my humble respects concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Palaces of Soveraigne Princes,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30449:70"/>
which must differ as much from other Buildings, as their quality and condition from that of their Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And in the first place, as <hi>Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> must be the first Principle in all good Building; so much more ought it to be observed in that of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, unto whom the whole world hath accesse.</p>
                  <p>And as there must be spacious Ground before their Palaces, their Inner-Court ample, the Offices for their Retinue large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and so placed as they may neither be an aunoyance nor of ill aspect.</p>
                  <p>The first Stories ought rather to be vaulted than boarded, to prevent such an accident as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Lewis</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> French King, (and his Queen at a Ball,) when the Floore of the Roome (with all the Company) fell down; the

King and Queen only remaining (by a special Providence) on the Hearth of the Chimny, setting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cloath of State.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a necessary Magnificence to be exprest on the Front and inside of Princely Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, answerable to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; so is it absolutely necessary, that the Architect be possest with a Soul as great as the Player in the French Play, called the <hi>Viriona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> where he perswades himself to be <hi>Alexander,</hi> and governs his Motions accordingly. And the Lines and Strokes of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect must be <hi>Alexander-like:</hi> his Figures and Statues <hi>Colosses,</hi> his <hi>Pyrimidis</hi> like those of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Vaults like that Rock wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> wrastle for Mastery in a Valley in <hi>Persia,</hi> between <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Espa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> at a place called <hi>Carimonsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>


                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:30449:71"/>
where formerly was a great City six English Miles long; in which <hi>Groto,</hi> the <hi>Alexander-like</hi> mind of the Sculptor, hath Hewn within the Rock, (besides <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> on Horseback, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Huntsmen and Ladies) the aforesaid <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> wrastling to break a Ring between them.</p>
                  <p>Such a like mind Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> (Sonne to the Great <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi> of <hi>Savoy)</hi> infused into his Architect, Sculptor, and Caster in Brasse, who he imployed in the Designing and Building a Stable in <hi>Turin,</hi> within all of Marble, the Racks, Manger, and the upright Posts all of Copper, Richly Wrought, Conveyances of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pipes. The Manger fourteen Inches wide at the bottom, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Pale for Water on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. The upper most edge of the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30449:72"/>
Manger three foote eight Inches high from the Ground, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> great Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Horse to raise their Neck. The Rack Poles three Inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder and upright, that as the Frenchman saith, <hi>(L'appetit vient en mangeant)</hi> the Horse may feed more chearfully, the Hay and Dust may not fall on their Heads, as it doth out of a Rack which stands shelving: the under part of the Manger ought to be made up to keep in their Litrers, and no Boxes made there for Dogs, as some not curious do, where no Harnesses, Saddles, Coverings of Horses, or any other Implements or Tooles, are not to seen about the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern, since those things do but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the Accesse of a Cavallier to the Horses.</p>
                  <p>The disposing a Stable into a double Range, hath been affected


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30449:72"/>
by some, who would see all their Horses at once.</p>
                  <p>Others love only a single Range, whith a broad Walk, and if they have a great number of Horses, returne at the end into another Range, if the Ground can afford the same, so as a Wall makes the Partition between the Horses.</p>
                  <p>The Paving of such a Stable is very neat, being of white or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (twice burnt) <hi>Flanders</hi> Bricks, in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Clinkart;</hi> farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Planking of Stables, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reasons. The Paviors (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Bricks are laid) throw sharp Sand over them, and twice a day they are Watered with a Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Watering-Pot, and Swept with a Broom, which the Grooms are to continue sometimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sand gets between the Joynts, and makes the Paving very close and firm. The Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30449:73"/>
at the Foot of the Manger, must be raised at the least six Inches higher, than at the Gutter where the Posts are placed, which ought to be five Foot and an half distant one from the other, which Ground so Paved is of double use; first, that the higher a Horse stands towards the Manger, the better sight it is, and especially when the Lights of the Stable strikes on the Horse their backs, which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That a Horse its usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al standing place being so much shelving, accustomes the Horse (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing more on his hinder Feet than on the foremost) to be more light and nimble in his Gate and Pace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That his Stall doth not remain under him, and especially when its standing hath eight foot in length from the Manger to the


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30449:73"/>
Channel, which for neatnesse ought to be above Ground, the eight Foot in length, being at full the space which the Horse doth possess when in the night time he lyeth stretcht on his Litter.</p>
                  <p>I must not omit by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to Write somewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kitchin of a Princely Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether there should not be as much curiosity, if not more in the Kitchin than in the Stable; since the Meat prepared in a Kitchin, ought to be Drest with all Neatnesse, and preferred before a fine Lace about the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Cooks Towel: Neither are the Vessels of Silver but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Neatnesse which ought to be observed in all Cookery. The French-Mans Glasse is wrenched as often as he Drinks, and why should not Cooks be more Curious and Neat in their


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30449:74"/>
Kitchins, than Grooms in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? And as a Stable can have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances for the Horses Water, so may Kitchins for Slabbering, for Guts of Fowls and Deer, Coles, Ashes, and whatsoever else can cause Dirt and Nastiness, and be freed from the annoyance of Smoak, which ill-placed Doors may cause; nor ought the Kitchin or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Selleridge, (as in some Palaces in <hi>France)</hi> to be so placed as they may prove prejudiciall to the Court, and if they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a Palace they ought to be vaulted.</p>
                  <p>I must not forget that the Roof of a Palace should be covered either with Lead or blew Slates.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Brass, which a Pope mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cast Canons, no such as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat, drink and sing.</p>
                  <p>No curious eye can well indure


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30449:74"/>
those Barn-like Roofs of many Noble Persons Palaces, covered with red Tiles, which break and rot away, and then the Roof being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and patcht, seems to be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars Mantell, which I would not have the Nobles and Courtiers to be. See the Roofs of <hi>Lester, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Southampton,</hi> and such like their Palaces, whether they do not look as Barns for Hay, and not Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald, by their patched Tiles?</p>
                  <p>As for the main bulk of Palaces, its, true some have a greatnesse in plainnesse, as that of <hi>Farners</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof <hi>Michael Ang elo</hi> made the <hi>Arcitrave, Frize</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for Bignesse and Solidty, that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> and <hi>Escuriall</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> for Ornament, <hi>Munikch</hi> in <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the <hi>Louver</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> for Vastnesse, Situation and Ornament, by the imbossed Imagery on the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30449:75"/>
Frontispiece, variety of Orders of Colombs, with the delight of the annexed Tuilleries, wherein as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in that of the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> but above all in the Cardinals their <hi>Vignas</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> is observed the form of a true Princely Garden, consisting not only in much Air, great plots of Grass, low Borders, large Gravell-Walks, but for close Walks, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Groves, and Statuaes, to make good the Italian saying, <hi>Per variar natura é bella.</hi> And as for the imbossed carved Imagery on the Frontispiece of a Palace, their Dimensions must be according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their distance from the Ground; which is the main point requisite to be observed also in Scheames, wherein divers undertakers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit very great faults, not only by the not reducing whatsoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the true Lines of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30449:75"/>
but also by omitting the giving such Proportions to things, as may satisfie the sight of all the Spectators at their severall distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for Excellency doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in vastnesse, nor in the quantity of Objects, nor Shapes, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                  <p>The Sphear in an Angle of a great Chamber in St <hi>Pedro èVatica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> confirms this truth, and every judicious Eye will be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. Seas must not only be seen to have a naturall motion, but heard to make a noise of breaking of their Waves on the shore, and against the Rocks. Cloudes must not only drive, but be transparent, Winds, Thunder, Lightning, Rain, Snow, and Hail, must be so heard, seen, and felt, as that Spectators may think those sights to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall operations. The Sun, Moon, and Stars, no Past-board devices,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30449:76"/>
but so represented, as that they may dazle the Eyes of Spectators. And all the Motions of Sceans and Mutations as insensible, and no more to be discovered, than that of the Hand of a Diall.</p>
                  <p>Neither can all great Rooms of Princely Palaces serve for this use, except they be after the Moddell of such as the Italians have built, as there is a good one at <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> with conveyances sor Smoak, and capacities for Ecchoes, which <hi>Inigo Jones</hi> (the late Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor) experimentally found at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and by his built Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting House, so as having found his own fault, he was constrained to Build a Wooden House overthwart the Court of <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greatness of a Soveraign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fists not in the quantity of Stone and Timber heapt together, The Quarries possess more Stone, and


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30449:76"/>
the Woods more Timber than a Banquet Room. Let anygood eye judge, whether it be not true, that the extream height of a Room takes not away the greatness of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that is in the same, and that all Hangings of Tapistery make no shew at all, unless they reach to a proportionable height of a Room.</p>
                  <p>Since the greatness of a Nation consists not in a Husk, but in it self, and in its Soveraign, nothing should be suffered to diminish the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that greatness within or without Doors. A Soveraign and his Retinue, in a too vast Roome in height, width and length, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a company in a Valley near high Mountains. Whenas a body standing on the brow of a Hill, and seen from below, seems to be a kind of <hi>Colosse,</hi> which argueth that there must be a great discretion used in the making them fit and pleasing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:30449:77"/>
All which I do not Write to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue any Modern Works, nor any of the Cavallier-like <hi>Operas,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Talent being commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. As I am confident there are some that live, who will not deny that they have heard the King of blessed Memory, graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to avouch he had seen in <hi>Anno</hi> 1648, (close to the Gate of <hi>York-House,</hi> in a Roome not above 35. Foot square,) as much as could be represented (as to Sceans) in the great Banquetting Room of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi> and that divers judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will not deny, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the several Triumphall Arches erected in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> consists not in their Bulk.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (who have shown their Master-ship in them) did conform them to the respective places.</p>
                  <p>Things can be too great, as well


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30449:77"/>
as too little, too massie, and too slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, too gaudy, and too plain; and Colours placed together, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not one with the other, as blew and green. God in his Rainbow ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shewed us the best way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Colours. Nor is it the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Timber or Stone, that speaks love in an Arch, but rather when it is composed of the hearts of Loyal Subjects, which surpasseth all that can be made.</p>
                  <p>May therefore the oldest and most tottering House in the Land, breath forth of its Windows what may answer that true love, and in point of good Building; wherewith this Discourse is begun, (next to the giving such a new Form to the Streets of <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs, as may in a manner equalize those in <hi>Holland</hi> in neatness, if the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants will but take the right and onely course therein.)

have shunned, and what they have curiously Observed; the particular care of Surveyours, their choice of Materials, even to their preparing of their Lime and Clay: The care of their Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers in laying of a Foundation, and that they have been firme and resolute in their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings to proceed on a well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Modell, since Alterations in a well begun Building are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial.</p>

Offices to their Palaces, (as well as rooms of State, for great Feastival Shows, and ordinary use.)

                     <p>This is onely a rate for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of paving allowed by Act of Parliament, for which price, but very slight work hath been furnished; till such time as Mr. <hi>Le Coeur</hi> (having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Commissioners pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving works) hath contrived such a plenty in stone, which hitherto was so scarce that by consequence he hath since rendred the work more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the very same rate.

Undertakers, and Society have industriously invented, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are not onely able to make a most substantial good pavement, but are likewise ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable by that same certain new invention, to maintain it dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for twenty one years long, in reparation at a yearly small rate, but must of necessity cost them much more then sixteen pence once, for all at the first paving.</p>
                     <p>If materials could be had at lower rates then the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it would be as well done to seek for such materials, as to look to the goodness of them. So in the choice of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for on those who can work best.</p>
                     <p>To compleat these matters, I shall note what is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30449:124"/>
First, That what contributes more to the fatall ends of many good Mothers Son, is ill Building Paper like walls, Cobweb like windowes, doores made fast as with Pack thread, purposely to tempt men who through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream want are become weary of a languishing life, and to whose fatall end, ill Builders are in a manner accessary.</p>
                     <p>Let not the <hi>Hollanders, German,</hi> nor any other Northern Nation Vaunt of their scarcity of theives (nor those of <hi>Delf</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> who when the Town Mason had desired them to chuse a day to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the publick Gallows which he had made, said, that they would serve for them and their Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but attribute the same scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to that defence they are wont to make against Theives; but that defence consists not in a


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30449:125"/>
superfluous care of putting locks and bolts upon doores or wooden shutters to windows, not iron bars in them that will serve turn, except those locks, bolts, shutting windows, and barrs are made and set on as they ought to be.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> wooden shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are double deal-borded wainscot-like-framed within, with Battens, fluted without as the body of a Dorick Column; that the rain beating on them, may the better run down and carry away the dust which may be gathered on them, and that they may not rot so soon as they would, otherwise if they were garnished without with battens; they paint them also in strong oyl colour thrice over to resist the weather the better; the Carpenters do frame them so


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30449:125"/>
exact to the witdth and height of the stone casement of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as that scarce a knife could be thrust between them they are not hung with cross garnets; because such are easily taken off, nor are the broad shoulders of an iron hook the onely thing that can hinder theeves to loosen such a window, nor the iron bars; Theeves having a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move iron bars without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or making half so much noise as on a wooden bar.</p>
                     <p>The iron hinges ought to be framed between the two deal bords, whereof the shutting win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is made, and the head of the hinge is to be so well fitted in the stone, as that no access can be had to it, the bolts within strait or crooked, must have a shutter at its tail.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:30449:126"/>
Now if a Builder will not be at the charge of such shutters without doores, they must then have wooden or iron bars to secure those within.</p>
                     <p>Doores may be secured, not onely by a wooden or iron barr, but by a strong chain hung at the one end in an iron ring, at the other end in a like ring, both united with a strong Padlock, then any Porter may open a gate or doore six Inches less or more to receive a Packet in the night when it so happens.</p>
                     <p>Nor do provident Builders ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet locks only at the one side, for that a thief within doores in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with one without makes that single riveting of no use as to security; rivets to locks must be enterlaced with rivets between the double bord, nor should the key-hole of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30449:126"/>
door of a house be left uncovered in the night, for if through the negligence of him that is the keeper of the gate, neither bolts nor barrs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; Why? a pick-lock may soon open such a door or gate; it is an easie contrivance to have a bolt with a large head that shall cover the key-hole of a door or gate, to make fast from without to the inside, and so secure the lock; and if the key of that bolt is brought at night to the owner of the Palace, none can run out a gadding or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>And so much may suffice for the securing of doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, onely this more. That there ought to be an Iron plate of the width of the door, and four foot high, walled in within, so fastned on both sides


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30449:127"/>
as that no violence from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out can make a breach, since in divers places Rogues have taken up the causey or pavement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a doore, and then with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity loosened the bricks under the threshold to make a passage into the House.</p>
                     <p>But as for thieves who do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile houses, such may be keept out, if the seeling be borded or made up with plates of tinn, or arched with brick as is practised in the Banks of <hi>Loane,</hi> which in other parts are erected for the relief of the Necessitous.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, In reference to the main of the contents of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Printed Discourse, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the three first Principles of Magnificent Building; As the well choosing of a fit place for a Building, is a Capital piont, to set it right, and the giving a fit


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30449:127"/>
extent to the Court, so the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to it a Porch ought to be well considered, For as a Porch serves to a Hall to distribute Almes to the Poore; a porch proves often cumbersome, being the receptacle of foul creatures, who as soon gotten into a Court make it their randevouze; Nor is a porch so convenient to the Palace of a Prince, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be attended by a great retenue, and no man to stand in his passage; But if a porch be affected, let it then be a vaste <hi>Portuco,</hi> as that of <hi>Solomons</hi> House was. and that he Built for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the placing a Gate or Door to enter into the Hall of a Palace; None will deny but that Greatnesse and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency being conjoynt fits best. The enterance into a Hall is not


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30449:128"/>
so proper in the middle as at the end, when the ground plot is yet to chuse and to be ordered; But if there be a constraint, which is most prejudicious to a Building, the entrance must be set as much towards the end as possible can be, to set the Chimney well, and the main Stair-case in so fit a place as that it may not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a like fatal accident as happened to <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at <hi>Delf,</hi> when he was shot by one who stood behind a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, opposite to the Stairs of that Prince his house.</p>
                     <p>The rise, width, and depth of steps, shall not need to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, since they have been descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and reasons alledged for their dimension, mentioned both in the former printed, and in this discourse; nor shall repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions be necessary concerning


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30449:128"/>
the reason why the first Floor of a building should not lye le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with the ground; The first for health; the second for neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, since any floor level with the ground receives more dirt from abroad; the third for greatness, which appears more by an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; the fourth for the Vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sellars or any other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the fifth, to have the floors more dry: Onely I shall insert this story of one in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Who passing by a Town wherein the people generally did not out-live the thirtieth year of their Age, caused all the back of their Houses to be made the Front, and the windows which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be made up, to free them from that infectious Air that did shorten their Lives, which had its effect accordingly;</hi> and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do so much insist on the


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30449:129"/>
point of placing a Building where good Aire is, &amp; that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chimnies nor doores may be so placed as to serve for the attracting of infectious Aire which kills more then the sword or the Seas overturnes ships.</p>
                     <p>To take my leave of all Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I must conclude with what followeth,</p>
                     <p>First that when they shall be pleased, to take a Posey out of the former Printed Discourse, and joyne it, to what may please them, out of this they will finde, that both hit the main marke, to wit, <hi>Solidity, Conveniency,</hi> and <hi>Ornament,</hi> altogether to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in true Building. That all what is represented is for their profit and satisfaction, that the manner and phrase of the first discourse, was to that end inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with recreative passages, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>


                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:30449:129"/>
the Reader should not be tired with the Mechanicks their phrase, and proper Names of their several Trades, though some of them are wont to scoff at those whose language is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht; as if a person of Eminent Quality, (Born to the Highest Concernment of a State) should have learned their words, and have spent therein part of his pretious time; And therefore I have now offered, to write, in such workman-like termes, as may serve for a Clark of the works to speak unto them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That all owners of Buildings, shall do well to make choice of such a person for their Clark as the Master workmen will endure, which they will not, if he be a Master workman, whom they will not only suspect to have a design to undermine


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30449:130"/>
and supplant them, but obey not, pretending to know more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; Nor is it fit that there should be such a controuler over a Master Workman, as a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: The same is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a Surveyor to prevent all quarrels and contests: for as every Cook commends his own Sauce; more then one Cook to a dish will spoil it; there cannot be two Suns in the Firmament, one General over another; nay two Cocks among Hens.</p>
                     <p>In a word, an Owner must trust, or never make choice of Trustees; For if otherwise, let him be certain that his purse will be incessantly abused.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Let all Owners be prepared to <hi>Repent,</hi> whether they build or not, for it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the fate of many that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or marry not.</p>

Let both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay (as in a Scale) their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges, vexations, cares, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and pleasures, they will find this to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> If they build they must be at great present disbursements, vext with as many oversights (as Printer-Setters will commit faults, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Errataes</hi> at the end of Books) and to be over-reacht in Bargains concerning their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, as also in work done by the Great, or Day.</p>
                     <p>If they build not, they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inconveniencies of Houses built according unto the fancies of the Owners, and when they shall cast up the summs of money spent in the rent (besides many chargeable alterations) they shall find that they might have built a better and more fit habitation for them and their
