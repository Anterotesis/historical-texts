            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO
OVID's
EPISTLES.</head>
            <p>THe Life of <hi>Ovid</hi> being already writen in
our Language before the Translation of
his <hi>Metamorphoses,</hi> I will not presume so
far upon my self, to think I can add any
thing to Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> his undertaking. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Reader may there be satisfied, that he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
in the Reign of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he
was Extracted from an Antient Family of
<hi>Roman</hi> Knights; that he was born to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of a Splendid Fortune, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to the Study of the Law; and had made
<pb facs="tcp:53770:3"/>
considerable progress in it, before he quitted that
Profession, for this of <hi>Poetry,</hi> to which he was
more naturally form'd. The Cause of his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is unknown; because he was himself unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
further to provoke the Emperour, by ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to any other reason, than what was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Augustus,</hi> which was the Lasciviousness
of his Elegies, and his Art of Love. 'Tis true
they are not to be Excus'd in the severity of
Manners, as being able to Corrupt a larger Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
if there were any, than that of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet
this may be said in behalf of <hi>Ovid,</hi> that no man
has ever treated the Passion of Love with so
much Delicacy of Thought, and of Expression,
or search'd into the nature of it more Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
than he. And the Emperour who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him,
had as little reason as another man
to punish that fault with so much severity, if at
least he were the Authour of a certain <hi>Epigram,</hi>
which is ascrib'd to him, relating to the Cause of
the first Civil War betwixt himself and <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> the Triumvir, which is more fulsome
than any pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age I have met with in our Poet.
To pass by the naked Familiarity of his Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to <hi>Horace,</hi> which are cited in that Authours
Life, I need only mention one notorious Act of
his in taking <hi>Livia</hi> to his Bed, when she was not
only Married, but with Child by her Husband,
then living. But Deeds, it seems, may be Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Arbitrary Power, when words are
question'd in a Poet. There is another ghess of
the <hi>Grammarians,</hi> as far from truth as the first
<pb facs="tcp:53770:3"/>
from Reason; they will have him Banish'd for
ome favours, which they say he receiv'd from
<hi>Julia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Augustus,</hi> whom they
think he Celebrates under the Name of <hi>Corinna</hi>
in his <hi>Elegies:</hi> but he who will observe the Verses
which are made to that Mistress, may gather
from the whole Contexture of them, that <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
was not a Woman of the highest Quality: If
<hi>Julia</hi> were then Married to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> why
should our Poet make his Petition to Isis, for
her safe Delivery, and afterwards, Condole
her Miscarriage; which for ought he knew
might be by her own Husband? Or indeed
how durst he be so bold to make the least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovery
of such a Crime, which was no less than
Capital, especially Committed against a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Rank? Or if it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Marriage, he would surely have been
more discreet, than to have publish'd an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
which must have been fatal to them
both. But what most Confirms me against this
Opinion is, that <hi>Ovid</hi> himself complains that
the true Person of <hi>Corinna</hi> was found out by
the Fame of his Verses to her: which if it
had been <hi>Julia,</hi> he durst not have own'd; and
besides, an immediate punishment m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.
He seems himself more truly to have
touch'd at the Cause of his Exile in those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Verses,
<q>Cur àliquid vidi, cur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oxia Lumina f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:4"/>
Namely, that he had either seen, or was
Conscious to somewhat, which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
him his disgrace. But neither am I
satisfyed that this was the Incest of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
with his own Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For <hi>Augustus</hi>
was of a Nature too vindicative to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himself with so small a Revenge, or
so unsafe to himself, as that of simple Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would certainly have secur'd his
Crimes from publick notice by the death of
him who was witness to them. Neither
have Histories given us any sight into such an
Action of this Emperour: nor would he (the
greatest Polititian of his time,) in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
have manag'd his Crimes with so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
secresie, as not to shun the Observation of
any man. It seems more probable that <hi>Ovid</hi>
was either the Confident of some other passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or that he had stumbled by some inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
upon the privacies of <hi>Livia,</hi> and seen
her in a Bath: For the words
<q>Nudam sine veste Dianam,</q>
agree better with <hi>Livia,</hi> who had the
Fame of Chastity, than with either of the
<hi>Julias,</hi> who were both noted of Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The first Verses which were made by him
in his Youth, and recited publickly, according to
the Custom were, as he himself assures us to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinna:</hi>
his Banishment happen'd not till the Age
of fifty; from which it may be deduc'd, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
<pb facs="tcp:53770:4"/>
enough, that the love of <hi>Corinna,</hi> did
not occasion it: Nay he tells us plainly,
that his offence was that of Errour only, not
of wickedness: and in the same paper of
Verses also, that the cause was notoriously
known at <hi>Rome,</hi> though it be left so obscure to
after Ages.</p>
            <p>But to leave Conjectures on a Subject so
incertain, and to write somewhat more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
of this Poet: That he frequented
the Court of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and was well receiv'd
in it, is most undoubted: all his Poems bear
the Character of a Court, and appear to be
written as the <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Cavalierement:</hi>
Add to this, that the Titles of many of his
Elegies, and more of his Letters in his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are address'd to persons well known to
us, even at this distance, to have been conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in that Court.</p>
            <p>Nor was his acquaintance less with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Poets of his Age, than with the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Ladies; he tells you himself, in a
particular Account of his own Life, that
<hi>Macer, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others of them were his familiar Friends,
and that some of them communicated their
Writings to him: but that he had only seen
<hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:5"/>
If the Imitation of Nature be the business
of a Poet, I know no Authour who can justly
be compar'd with ours, especially in the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Passions. And to prove this, I
shall need no other Iudges than the generality
of his Readers: for all Passions being inborn
with us, we are almost equally Iudges when
we are concern'd in the representation of them:
Now I will appeal to any man who has read
this Poet, whether he find not the natural
Emotion of the same Passion in himself, which
the Poet describes in his feign'd Persons? His
thoughts which are the Pictures and results
of those Passions, are generally such as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arise from those disorderly Motions of our
Spirits. Yet, not to speak too partially in his
behalf, I will confess that the Copiousness of
his Wit was such, that he often writ too poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
for his Subject, and made his persons
speak more Eloquently than the violence of
their Passion would admit: so that he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
witty out of season: leaving the Imitation
of Nature, and the cooler dictates of his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the false applause of Fancy. Yet he
seems to have found out this Imperfection in
his riper age: for why else should he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that his <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> was left unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd?
Nothing sure can be added to the
Wit of that Poem, or of the rest: but many
things ought to have been retrench'd; which
I suppose would have been the business of his
<pb facs="tcp:53770:5"/>
Age, if his Misfortunes had not come too fast
upon him. But take him uncorrected as he
is transmitted to us, and it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
in spight of his <hi>Dutch</hi> Friends, the
Commentators, even of <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> himself,
that <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Censure will stand good against
him;
<q>Nescivit quod bene cessit relinquere:</q>
he never knew how to give over, when he had
done well: but continually varying the same
sence an hundred waies, and taking up in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, what he had more than enough
inculcated before, he sometimes cloys his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
instead of satisfying them: and gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to his Translators, who dare not Cover
him, to blush at the nakedness of their Father.
This then is the Allay of <hi>Ovids</hi> writing,
which is sufficiently recompenc'd by his other
Excellencys; nay this very fault is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it's Beauties: for the most severe Censor
cannot but be pleas'd with the prodigality of
his wit, though at the same time he could have
wish'd, that the Master of it had been a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Menager. Every thing which he does, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him, and if sometimes he appear too
gay, yet there is a secret gracefulness of youth,
which accompanies his Writings, though the
staydness and sobriety of Age be wanting. In
the most material part, which is the Conduct,
'tis certain that he seldom has miscarried:
<pb facs="tcp:53770:6"/>
for if his Elegies be compar'd with those of
<hi>Tibullus,</hi> and <hi>Propertius</hi> his Contemporaries,
it will be found that those Poets seldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
before they writ; And though the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of <hi>Tibullus</hi> be more polish'd, and the
Learning of <hi>Propertius,</hi> especially in his Fourth
Book, more set out to ostentation: Yet their
common practice, was to look no further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them than the next Line: whence it will
inevitably follow, that they can drive to no
certain point, but ramble from one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to another, and conclude with some
what which is not of a piece with their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<q>Purpureus late qui splendeat, unus &amp; alter
Assuitur pannus: <hi>As</hi> Horace <hi>says,</hi>
               </q>
though the Verses are golden, they are but
patch'd into the Garment. But our Poet has
always the Goal in his Eye, which directs
him in his Race; some Beautiful design, which
he first establishes, and then contrives the
means, which will naturally conduct it to his
end. This will be Evident to Iudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in this work of his Epistles, of which
somewhat, at least in general, will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:6"/>
The Title of them in our late Editions is
<hi>Epistolae Heroidum,</hi> The Letters of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roines.</hi>
But <hi>Heinsius</hi> has Iudg'd more truly,
that the <hi>Inscription</hi> of our Authour was bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Epistles;</hi> which he concludes from his
cited Verses, where <hi>Ovid</hi> asserts this work
as his own Invention, and not borrow'd
from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom (as the Masters of
their Learning,) the <hi>Romans</hi> usually did
imitate. But it appears not from their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that any of the <hi>Grecians</hi> ever touch'd
upon this way, which our Poet therefore just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has vindicated to himself. I quarrel not
at the word <hi>Heroidum,</hi> because 'tis us'd by <hi>Ovid</hi>
in his Art of Love:
<q>Jupiter ad veteres supplex <hi>Heroidas</hi> ibat.</q>
But sure he cou'd not be guilty of such an
Oversight, to call his Work by the Name of
<hi>Heroines,</hi> when there are divers men or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi>
as Namely <hi>Paris, Leander,</hi> and <hi>Aconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
joyn'd in it. Except <hi>Sabinus,</hi> who writ
some Answers to <hi>Ovids</hi> Letters,
<q>(Quam celer è toto rediit meus orbe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,)</q>
I remember not any of the <hi>Romans</hi> who have
treated this Subject, save only <hi>Propertius,</hi>
and that but once, in his Epistle of <hi>Arethusa</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:7"/>
to <hi>Lycotas,</hi> which is written so near the
Style of <hi>Ovid,</hi> that it seems to be but an
Imitation, and therefore ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
our Poet of the Glory of his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Concerning this work of the Epistles, I shall
content my self to observe these few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
First, that they are generally granted
to be the most perfect piece of <hi>Ovid,</hi> and that
the Style of them is tenderly passionate and
Courtly; two properties well agreeing with
the Persons which were <hi>Heroines,</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
Yet where the Characters were lower,
as in <hi>Oenone,</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> he has kept close to
Nature in drawing his Images after a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Life, though perhaps he has Romaniz'd
his <hi>Grecian</hi> Dames too much, and made them
speak sometimes as if they had been born in
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and under the Empire of
<hi>Augustus.</hi> There seems to be no great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in the particular Subjects which he has
chosen: most of the Epistles being written
from Ladies who were forsaken by their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
which is the reason that many of
the same thoughts come back upon us in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Letters: But of the general Character
of Women which is Modesty, he has taken
a most becoming care; for his amorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
go no further than virtue may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and therefore may be read, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them, by Matrons without a blush.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:7"/>Thus much concerning the Poet: whom you
find translated by divers hands, that you
may at least have that variety in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
which the Subject denyed to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the <hi>Latine.</hi> It remains that I should
say somewhat of Poetical Translations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and give my Opinion (with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to better Iudgments) which way of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
seems to me most proper.</p>
            <p>All Translation I suppose may be reduced to
these three heads.</p>
            <p>First, that of Metaphrase, or turning an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
word by word, and Line by Line, from
one Language into another. Thus, or near this
manner, was <hi>Horace</hi> his Art of Poetry tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
by <hi>Ben. Johnson.</hi> The second way is
that of Paraphrase, or Translation with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
where the Authour is kept in view
by the Translator, so as never to be lost,
but his words are not so strictly follow'd as
his sense, and that too is admitted to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied,
but not alter'd. Such is Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers</hi>
Translation of <hi>Virgils</hi> Fourth <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
The Third way is that of Imitation, where
the Translator (if now he has not lost that
Name) assumes the liberty not only to vary
from the words and sence, but to forsake
them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>both as he sees occasion: and taking
only some general hints from the Original,
<pb facs="tcp:53770:8"/>
to run division on the ground-work, as he
pleases. Such is Mr. <hi>Cowleys</hi> practice in
turning two Odes of <hi>Pindar,</hi> and one of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
into <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the first of these Methods, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Horace</hi> has given us this Caution,
<q>
                  <l>Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus</l>
                  <l>Interpres—</l>
               </q>
               <hi>Nor word for word too faithfully translate.</hi> As
the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Roscommon</hi> has excellently render'd
it. Too faithfully is indeed pedantically: 'tis a
faith like that which proceeds from Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
blind and Zealous: Take it in the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sir <hi>John Denham,</hi> to Sir <hi>Rich Fanshaw,</hi>
on his Version of the Pastor <hi>Fido.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>That servile path, thou nobly do'st decline,</l>
                  <l>Of tracing word by word and Line by Line;</l>
                  <l>A new and nobler way thou do'st pursue,</l>
                  <l>To make Translations, and Translators too:</l>
                  <l>They but preserve the Ashes, thou the Flame,</l>
                  <l>True to his Sence, but truer to his Fame.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis almost impossible to Translate verbally, and
well, at the same time; For the Latin, (a most
severe and Compendious Language) often expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:53770:8"/>
that in one word, which either the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or the narrowness of modern Tongues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
supply it more. 'Tis frequent also that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
is couch'd in some Expression, which will be
lost in <hi>English.</hi>

what Poet of our Nation is so happy as to express
this thought Literally in <hi>English,</hi> and to strike
Wit or almost Sense out of it?</p>
            <p>In short the Verbal Copyer is incumber'd with
so many difficulties at once, that he can never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangle
himself from all. He is to consider at
the same time the thought of his Authour, and his
words, and to find out the Counterpart to each in
another Language: and besides this he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
himself to the compass of Numbers, and the
Slavery of Rhime. 'Tis much like dancing on
Ropes with fetter'd Leggs: A man may shun

is not to be expected: and when we have
said the best of it, 'tis but a foolish Task; for no
sober man would put himself into a danger for
the Applause of scaping without breaking his

            </p>
            <p>The Consideration of these difficulties, in a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
literal Translation, not long since made two
of our famous Wits, <hi>Sir John Denham,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Cowley</hi> to contrive another way of turning Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
into our Tongue, call'd by the latter of them,
<hi>Imitation</hi> As they were Friends, I suppose they
Communicated their thoughts on this Subject to
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch other, and therefore their reasons for it are
little different: though the practice of one is much
more moderate. I take Imitation of an Authour
in their sense to be an Endeavour of a later Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
to write like one who has written before him
on the same Subject: that is, not to Translate his
words, or to be Confin'd to his Sense, but only to set
him as a Patern, and to write, as he supposes,
<pb facs="tcp:53770:9"/>
that Authour would have done, had he liv'd in
our Age, and in our Country. Yet I dare not say
that either of them have carried this libertine
way of rendring Authours (as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> calls
it) so far as my Definition reaches. For in the
<hi>Pindarick Odes,</hi> the Customs and Ceremonies of
Ancient <hi>Greece</hi> are still preserv'd: but I know not
what mischief may arise hereafter from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of such an Innovation, when writers of
unequal parts to him, shall imitate so bold an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
to add and to diminish what we please,
which is the way avow'd by him, ought only to be
granted to Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> and that too only in his
Translation of <hi>Pindar,</hi> because he alone was able
to make him amends, by giving him better of his
own, when ever he refus'd his Authours thoughts.
<hi>Pindar</hi> is generally known to be a dark writer, to
want Connexion, (I mean as to our understanding)
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oar out of sight, and leave his Reader at a
Gaze: So wild and ungovernable a Poet cannot
be Translated litterally, his Genius is too strong to
bear a Chain, and <hi>Sampson</hi> like he shakes it off:
A Genius so Elevated and unconfin'd as Mr.
<hi>Cowley</hi>'s, was but necessary to make <hi>Pindar</hi> speak
<hi>English,</hi> and that was to be perform'd by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way than Imitation. But if <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or
any regular intelligible Authours be thus us'd,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis no longer to be call'd their work, when neither
the thoughts nor words are drawn from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:
but instead of them there is something new
produc'd, which is almost the creation of another
hand. By this way 'tis true, somewhat that is
<pb facs="tcp:53770:10"/>
Excellent may be invented perhaps more Exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than the first design, though <hi>Virgil</hi> must
be still excepted, when that perhaps takes plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Let he who is inquisitive to know an Authours
thoughts will be disapointed in his expectation.
And 'tis not always that a man will be contented
to have a Present made him, when he expects
the payment of a Debt. To state it fairly, Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Authour is the most advantagious way
for a Translator to shew himself, but the greatest
wrong which can be done to the Memory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the dead. Sir <hi>John Denham</hi> (who
advis'd more Liberty than he took himself,) gives
this Reason for his Innovation, in his admirable
Preface before the Translation of the second Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid:
<q>Poetry is of so subtila Spirit, that in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of one Language into another, it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll
Evaporate; and if a new Spirit be not added in
the transfusion, there will remain nothing but a
<hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
               </q> I confess this Argument holds
good against a litteral Translation, but who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it?
Imitation and verbal Version are in my
Opinion the two Extreams, which ought to be
avoided: and therefore when I have propos'd
the mean betwixt them, it will be seen how far
his Argument will reach.</p>
            <p>No man is capable of Translating Poetry, who
besides a Genius to that Art, is not a Master both
of his Authours Language, and of his own: Nor
must we understand the Language only of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
but his particular turn of Thoughts, and of
Expression, which are the Characters that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish,
<pb facs="tcp:53770:10"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> When we are come thus far
'tis time to look into our selves to conform our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to his, to give his thought either the same
turn if our tongue will bear it, or if not, to vary
but the dress, not to alter or destroy the substance.
The like Care must be taken of the more outward
Ornaments, the Words: when they appear (which
is but seldom) litterally graceful, it were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to the Authour that they should be chang'd:
But since every Language is so full of its own
proprieties, that what is Beautiful in one, is
often Barbarous, nay sometimes Nonsence in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it would be unreasonable to limit a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
to the narrow compass of his Authours
words: 'tis enough if he choose out some Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which does not vitiate the Sense. I suppose
he may stretch his Chain to such a Latitude, but
by innovation of thoughts, methinks he breaks it.
By this means the Spirit of an Authour may be
transfus'd, and yet not lost: and thus 'tis plain
that the reason alledg'd by Sir. <hi>John Denham,</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
no farther force than to Expression: for thought,
if it be Translated truly, cannot be lost in another
Language, but the words that convey it to our
apprehension (which are the Image and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that thought) may be so ill chosen as to
make it appear in an unhandsome dress, and rob
it of its native Lustre. There is therefore a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to be allow'd for the Expression, neither is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it necessary that Wordes, and Lines should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to the measure of their Original. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:53770:11"/>
of an Authour, generally speaking, is to be Sacred
and inviolable. If the Fancy of <hi>Ovid</hi> be luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
'tis his Character ot be so, and if I retrench
it, he is no longer <hi>Ovid.</hi> It will be replyed that
he receives advantage by this lopping of his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
branches, but I rejoyn that a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has no such Right: when a <hi>Painter</hi> Copies
form the life, I suppose he has no priviledge to
alter Features, and Lineaments, under pretence
that his Picture will look better: perhaps the
Face which he has drawn would be more Exact,
if the Eyes, or Nose were alter'd, but 'tis his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to make it resemble the Original. In two
Cases only there may a seeming difficulty arise,
that is, if the thought be notoriously trivial or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonest;
But he same Answer will serve for
both, that then they ought not to be Translated.
<q>
                  <l>Et quae—</l>
                  <l>Desperes tractata nitescere posse, relinquas.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ventur'd to give my Opinion on
this Subject against the Authority of two great
men, but I hope without offence to either of their
Memories, for I both lov'd them living, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
them now they are dead. But if after
what I have urg'd, it be thought by better Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that the praise of a Translation Consists in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
new Beauties to the piece, thereby to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the loss which it sustains by change of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
I shall be willing to be taught better, and
to recant. In the mean time it seems to me, that
<pb facs="tcp:53770:11"/>
the true reason why we have so few Versions
which are tolerable, is not from the too close
persuing of the Authours Sence: but because there
are so few who have all the Talents which are
requisite for Translation: and that there is so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
praise and so small Encouragement for so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a part of Learning.</p>
            <p>To apply in short, what has been said, to this
present work, the Reader will here find most of
the Translations, with some little Latitude or
variation from the Authours Sence: That of <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none</hi>
to <hi>Paris</hi> is in Mr. <hi>Cowleys</hi> way of Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only. I was desir'd to say that the Authour
who is of the <hi>Fair Sex,</hi> understood not <hi>Latine.</hi>
But if she doe not, I am afraid she has given us
occasion to be asham'd who do.</p>
            <p>For my own part I am ready to acknowledge
that I have transgress'd the Rules which I have
given; and taken more liberty than a just Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
will allow. But so many Gentlemen whose
Wit and Learning are well known, being Ioyn'd
in it, I doubt not but that their Excellencies will
make you ample Satisfaction for my Errours.</p>

My Muse and Lute can now no longer please,</l>
            <l>They are th' Employments of a mind at ease.</l>
            <l>Wandring from thought to thought I sit alone</l>
            <l>All day, and my once dear Companions shun.</l>
            <l>In vain the <hi>Lesbian</hi> Maids claim each a part,</l>
            <l>Where thou alone hast ta'ne up all the heart.</l>
            <l>Ah lovely Youth! how can'st thou cruel prove,</l>
            <l>When blooming years and beauty bid thee love?</l>
            <l>If none but equal Charms thy heart can bind,</l>
            <l>Then to thy self alone thou must be kind.</l>
            <l>Yet worthless as I am, there was a time</l>
            <l>When <hi>Phaon</hi> thought me worthy his Esteem.</l>
            <l>A thousand tender things to mind I call,</l>
            <l>For they who truly Love remember all.</l>
            <l>Delighted with the Musick of my Tongue,</l>
            <l>Upon my words with silent Joy he hung,</l>
            <l>And snatching Kisses, stop'd me as I sung.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53770:13"/>
Kisses, whose melting touch, his Soul did move,</l>
            <l>The earnest of the coming joyes of Love.</l>
            <l>Then tender words, short sighs, &amp; thousand charms</l>
            <l>Of wanton Arts endear'd me to his Arms;</l>
            <l>Till both expiring with tumultuous Joys,</l>
            <l>A gentle faintness did our Limbs surprize.</l>
            <l>Beware, <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ladies, Ah! beware</l>
            <l>How you receive my faithless Wanderer.</l>
            <l>You too will be abus'd, if you believe</l>
            <l>The flattering words that he so well can give.</l>
            <l>Loose to the Winds I let my flowing Hair,</l>
            <l>No more with fragrant scents perfume the Air,</l>
            <l>But all my Dress discovers wild Despair.</l>
            <l>For whom alas! should now my Art be shown?</l>
            <l>The only Man I car'd to please is gone.</l>
            <l>Oh let me once more see those Eyes of thine,</l>

Thou might'st at least have ta'ne thy last farewel,</l>
            <l>And feign'd a sorrow which thou didst not feel.</l>
            <l>No kind remembring Pledge was ask'd by thee,</l>
            <l>And nothing left but Injuries with me.</l>
            <l>Witness ye Gods, with what a Death-like cold</l>
            <l>My heart was seiz'd when first thy flight was told.</l>
            <l>Speechless and stupid for a while I lay,</l>
            <l>And neither words, nor tears could find their way.</l>
            <l>But when my swelling Passion forc'd a vent,</l>
            <l>With Hair dishevel'd, Clothes in pieces rent;</l>
            <l>Like some sad Mother through the Streets I run,</l>
            <l>Who to his Grave attends her only Son.</l>
            <l>Expos'd to all the World my self I see,</l>
            <l>Forgetting Vertue, Fame, and all but thee;</l>
            <l>So ill alas! do Love and Shame agree!</l>
            <l>'Tis thou alone that art my constant care,</l>
            <l>In pleasing Dreams thou comfort'st my Despair;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53770:14"/>
And mak'st the night, that does thy form convey,</l>
            <l>Welcome to me above the fairest day.</l>
            <l>Then 'spight of absence I thy Love enjoy,</l>
            <l>In close embraces lockt, methinks, we lye;</l>
            <l>Thy tender words I hear, thy Kisses feel,</l>
            <l>With all the Joys that shame forbids to tell.</l>
            <l>But when I waking miss thee from my bed,</l>
            <l>And all my pleasing Images are fled;</l>
            <l>The dear deluding Vision to retain,</l>
            <l>I lay me down, and try to sleep again.</l>
            <l>Soon as I rise, I haunt the Caves and Groves</l>
            <l>(Those conscious scenes of our once happy loves)</l>
            <l>There like some frantick <hi>Bacchanal</hi> I walk,</l>
            <l>And to my self with sad distraction talk.</l>
            <l>Then big with grief I throw me on the ground,</l>
            <l>And view the melancholy <hi>Grotto</hi> round;</l>
            <l>Whose hanging roof of Moss and craggy Stone</l>
            <l>Delights my eyes above the brightest Throne.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53770:15"/>
But when I spy the bank, whose grassy bed</l>
            <l>Retains the print our weary bodies made,</l>
            <l>On thy forsaken side I lay me down,</l>
            <l>And with a shower of tears the place I drown.</l>
            <l>The Trees are wither'd all since thou art gone,</l>
            <l>As if for thee they put their Mourning on.</l>
            <l>No warbling <hi>Bird</hi> does now with Musick fill</l>
            <l>The Woods, except the mournful <hi>Philomel.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With hers my dismal Notes all night agree,</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Tereus</hi> she complains, and I of thee.</l>
            <l>Ungentle Youth! did'st thou but see me mourn,</l>
            <l>Hard as thou art, thou would'st, thou would'st return.</l>
            <l>My constant falling tears the Paper stain,</l>
            <l>And my weak hand can scarce direct my Pen.</l>
            <l>Oh could thy eyes but reach my dreadful slate,</l>
            <l>As now I stand prepar'd for sudden Fate,</l>
            <l>Thou couldst not see this naked breast of mine</l>

Peace, <hi>Sapho,</hi> peace! thou send'st thy fruitless crys</l>

            <l>The flying Winds bear thy Complaints away,</l>
            <l>But none will ever back his Sails convey.</l>
            <l>No longer then thy hopeless Love attend,</l>

                  <hi>Macareus</hi> and <hi>Canace</hi> Son and Daughter
to Aeolus, God of the Winds, lov'd each
other Incestuously: <hi>Canace</hi> was delivered of
a Son, and committed him to her Nurse, to
be secretly convey'd away. The Infant cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </hi>
who inrag'd at the wickedness of his Children,
commanded the Babe to be expos'd to Wild
Beasts on the Mountains: and, withal, sent
a Sword to <hi>Canace,</hi> with this Message, That
her Crimes would instruct her how to use it.
With this Sword she slew her self: but before
she died, she writ the following Letter to
her Brother <hi>Macareus,</hi> who had taken San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
in the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi>

            <l>Might see &amp; urge the death which he commands,</l>

            <l>His Peoples temper is so like his own.</l>
            <l>The <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and each contending blast</l>
            <l>Are underneath his wide Dominion cast:</l>
            <l>Those he can rule; but his tempestuous mind</l>
            <l>Is, like his airy Kingdom, unconfin'd.</l>
            <l>Ah! what avail my Kindred Gods above,</l>

            <l>What help will all my heav'nly friends afford,</l>
            <l>When to my breast I lift the pointed Sword?</l>
            <l>That hour which joyn'd us came before its time,</l>
            <l>In death we had been one without a crime:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53770:17"/>
Why did thy flames beyond a <hi>Brothers</hi> move?</l>
            <l>Why lov'd I thee with more than <hi>Sisters</hi> love?</l>
            <l>For I lov'd too; and knowing not my wound,</l>
            <l>A secret pleasure in thy Kisses found:</l>
            <l>My Cheeks no longer did their colour boast,</l>
            <l>My Food grew loathsom, and my strength I lost:</l>
            <l>Still er'e I spoke, a sigh wou'd stop my tongue;</l>
            <l>Short were my slumbers, &amp; my nights were long.</l>
            <l>I knew not from my love these griefs did grow,</l>
            <l>Yet was, alas, the thing I did not know.</l>
            <l>My wily Nurse by long experience found,</l>
            <l>And first discover'd to my Soul its wound.</l>
            <l>'Tis Love, said she; and then my down-cast eyes,</l>
            <l>And guilty dumbness, witness'd my surprize.</l>
            <l>Forc'd at the last, my shameful pain I tell:</l>
            <l>And, oh, what follow'd we both know too well!</l>
            <l>'When half denying, more than half content,</l>
            <l>'Embraces warm'd me to a full consent:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53770:17"/>
Then with Tumultuous Joyes my Heart did beat,</l>
            <l>And guilt that made them anxious, made them great.</l>
            <l>But now my swelling womb heav'd up my breast,</l>
            <l>And rising weight my sinking Limbs opprest.</l>
            <l>What Herbs, what Plants, did not my Nurse produce</l>
            <l>To make Abortion by their pow'rful Juice?</l>
            <l>What Medicines try'd we not to thee unknown?</l>
            <l>Our first crime common; this was mine alone.</l>
            <l>But the strong Child, secure in his dark Cell,</l>
            <l>With Natures vigour did our arts repell.</l>
            <l>And now the pale-fac'd Empress of the Night</l>
            <l>Nine times had fill'd her Orb with borrow'd light:</l>
            <l>Not knowing 'twas my Labour, I complain</l>
            <l>Of sudden shootings, and of grinding pain:</l>
            <l>My throws came thicker, and my cryes increast,</l>
            <l>Which with her hand the conscious Nurse sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53770:18"/>
To that unhappy fortune was I come,</l>
            <l>Pain urg'd my clamours; but fear kept me dumb.</l>
            <l>With inward struggling I restrain'd my cries;</l>
            <l>And drunk the tears that trickled from my eyes.</l>
            <l>Death was in sight, <hi>Lucina</hi> gave no aid;</l>
            <l>And ev'n my dying had my guilt betray'd.</l>
            <l>Thou cam'st; and in thy Count'nance sate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair:</l>
            <l>Rent were thy Garments all, and torn thy Hair:</l>
            <l>Yet, feigning comfort which thou cou'dst not give,</l>
            <l>(Prest in thy Arms, and whisp'ring me to live)</l>
            <l>For both our sakes, (said'st thou) preserve thy life;</l>
            <l>Live, my dear Sister, and my dearer Wife.</l>
            <l>Rais'd by that name, with my last pangs I strove:</l>
            <l>Such pow'r have words, when spoke by those we love.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Babe,</hi> as if he heard what thou hadst sworn,</l>
            <l>With hasty joy sprung forward to be born.</l>

What helps it to have weather'd out one Storm?</l>
            <l>Fear of our <hi>Father</hi> does another form.</l>
            <l>High in his Hall, rock'd in a Chair of State,</l>
            <l>The King with his tempestuous Council sate:</l>
            <l>Through this large Room our only passage lay,</l>
            <l>By which we cou'd the new-born <hi>Babe</hi> convey.</l>
            <l>Swath'd, in her lap, the bold Nurse bore him out;</l>
            <l>With Olive branches cover'd round about:</l>
            <l>And, mutt'ring pray'rs, as holy Rites she meant,</l>
            <l>Through the divided Crowd, unquestion'd, went.</l>
            <l>Just at the door th' unhappy Infant cry'd:</l>

            <l>Swift as a Whirl-wind to the Nurse he flyes;</l>
            <l>And deafs his stormy Subjects with his cries.</l>
            <l>With one fierce puff, he blows the leaves away:</l>

Not Ships at Sea with winds are shaken more,</l>

            <l>He rush'd upon me, and divulg'd my stain;</l>
            <l>Scarce from my Murther cou'd his hands refrain.</l>
            <l>I only answer'd him with silent tears;</l>
            <l>They flow'd; my tongue was frozen up with fears</l>
            <l>His little Grandchild he commands away,</l>
            <l>To Mountain Wolves, and every Bird of prey.</l>
            <l>The Babe cry'd out, as if he understood,</l>
            <l>And beg'd his pardon with what voice he cou'd.</l>
            <l>By what expressions can my grief be shown?</l>
            <l>(Yet you may guess my anguish by your own)</l>
            <l>To see my bowels, and what yet was worse,</l>
            <l>Your bowels too, condemn'd to such a Curse!</l>
            <l>Out went the King; my voice its freedom found,</l>

And now appear'd the Messenger of death,</l>
            <l>Sad were his Looks, and scarce he drew his Breath,</l>
            <l>To say, <hi>Your Father sends you</hi>—(with that word</l>

            <l>Your Father sends you this: and lets you know</l>

                  <hi>Minos,</hi> King of <hi>Creet,</hi> by a sharp Warr, compell'd
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> (who had treacherously slain

young men, and as many Virgins to be devour'd
by the <hi>Minotaure;</hi> a Monster begotten by a Bull
upon his wife <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> while he was engaged
in that Warr. The Chance at last fell up on
<hi>Theseus</hi> to be sent among those youths; who, by
the Instructions of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> escaped out of the
Labyrinth, after he had kill'd the <hi>Minotaure,</hi>
and, together with her, fled to the Isle of <hi>Naxos.</hi>
But, being commanded by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he forsook
her, while she slept. When she awaked and found
herself deserted, she writes this Letter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Demophoon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Phaedra</hi>'
returning from the Trojan Wars, was by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Winds driv's on the <hi>Thracian</hi> shore,
where he was royally entertained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into familiarity by <hi>Phillis</hi> Daughter
of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Crustumena,</hi> King and
Queen of <hi>Thrace:</hi> with whom, after he had
a while remain'd, hearing of the death of
<hi>Mnestheus</hi> (the Deposer of his Father) he
went to take possession of his own Realm of
<hi>Athens,</hi> yet with earnest protestations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
within the space of one month. But
being detain'd past the appointed time by the
distractions his people were under, he gave
occasion to <hi>Phillis</hi> (impatient of delays) to
write him this Epistle.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>PHillis (who entertain'd thy Love and Thee,</l>
            <l>Faithless <hi>Demophoon</hi>) blames thy Periury:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53770:56"/>
How when withpain we parted didst thou mourn,</l>
            <l>And seem'dst to live alone for thy return!</l>
            <l>How didst thou limit my distress, and swear</l>
            <l>Within one month thy speedy presence here!</l>
            <l>Yet now four Moons are weary'd out, and see</l>
            <l>Thee still regardless of thy Vows and me.</l>
            <l>Hadst thou a tender sense to know the pain</l>
            <l>Of absent Lovers, who expect in vain,</l>
            <l>Thou wouldst not call me hasty, nor upbraid</l>
            <l>These humble murmurs of a wife betray'd.</l>
            <l>We're slow in our believing Ills, for I</l>
            <l>Flatter'd my self that yet I shou'd not dye:</l>
            <l>My self I've oft deluded,—thought thee kind—</l>
            <l>—Thy Ship returning with a prosp'rous wind:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Theseus</hi> I've curst, and yet unjustly him,</l>
            <l>For thou perhaps art Author of thy Crime.</l>
            <l>The dang'rous shoals of <hi>Hebrus</hi> made me mourn,</l>
            <l>As fancying thee expos'd in thy return.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:53770:56"/>
Oft for thy health I've sought the Gods by pray'r,</l>
            <l>And Incense burnt to place thee in their care.</l>
            <l>When e're the Wind stood fair, I fancy'd streight</l>
            <l>Thy sudden presence or thy certain fate.</l>
            <l>Then have I study'd reasons for thy stay,</l>
            <l>And urg'd my wit to savour thy delay:</l>
            <l>Yet dost not thou the sense of Vows retain,</l>
            <l>To Gods, and me, made equally in vain.</l>
            <l>Thy strictest Vows did mix with common Air,</l>
            <l>Nor does thy tardy Fleet the fault repair.</l>
            <l>Thy absence fully does my Crime reprove,</l>
            <l>And seems design'd to pay so cheap a Love.</l>
            <l>My only fault was loving easily,</l>
            <l>And yet that fault claims gratitude in Thee.</l>
            <l>Where's now thy faith,—thy supplyant hands, and where</l>
            <l>The God prophan'd by thy fallacious pray'r?</l>

Where's <hi>Hymen</hi> now that should our hearts unite,</l>
            <l>Bless and secure our conjugal delight?</l>
            <l>First, by the Sea thou swor'st thy meaning just,</l>
            <l>The Sea that then thou wert about to trust:</l>
            <l>Thou swor'st by thy prentended Grandsire's name</l>
            <l>The God that does rebellious storms reclaim:</l>
            <l>By <hi>Venus</hi> and by Love's Artillery,</l>
            <l>The Instruments of mighty woes to me:</l>
            <l>By <hi>Iuno,</hi> who of marriage Vows takes care,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Ceres,</hi> who the hallow'd Torch does bear:</l>
            <l>Shou'd these wrong'd Pow'rs be just, cou'dst thou</l>
            <l>withstand</l>
            <l>The angry stroke of an Almighty hand?</l>
            <l>Thy Ships I did repair, thy Sails improve,</l>
            <l>And strengthen'd the deserter of my Love.</l>
            <l>I gave thee Oars as Instruments of speed,</l>
            <l>And sharpen'd all the darts by which I bleed.</l>

Thy Words,—Thy Kindred Gods—whate're was fain'd,</l>
            <l>With Joy I heard, with Faith I entertain'd:</l>
            <l>View'd with regard thy false commanded tears,</l>
            <l>Thy artful sorrow, and thy seeming fears.</l>
            <l>Thy Arts of Love to me thou might'st have spar'd,</l>
            <l>For I was too unhappily prepar'd.</l>
            <l>Nor shou'd I grieve to have well treated Thee,</l>
            <l>And limited my hospitality,</l>
            <l>But to admit thee loosely to my breast,</l>
            <l>Is Treason, fatal to my present rest.</l>

My unambitious Heart no Flame had known,</l>

Heavens, how you swore! by ev'ry Pow'r Divine</l>
            <l>You wou'd be ever true! be ever mine:</l>
            <l>Each God, a sacred witness you invoke,</l>
            <l>And wish'd their Curse when e're these Vows you broke.</l>
            <l>Quick to my Heart the perjur'd Accents ran,</l>

            <l>"Vows are Loves poyson'd Arrows, &amp; the heart</l>

            <l>At least this heart which Fate has destin'd yours,</l>
            <l>This heart unpractic'd in Loves mystick pow'rs,</l>
            <l>For I am soft, and young as <hi>April</hi> Flowers.</l>
            <l>Now uncontroul'd we meet, uncheck't improve</l>
            <l>Each happier Minute in new Joys of Love!</l>
            <l>Soft were our hours! and lavishly the Day</l>
            <l>We gave intirely up to Love, and Play.</l>
            <l>Oft to the cooling Groves, our Flocks we led,</l>
            <l>And seated on some shaded, flowry Bed;</l>

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53770:63"/>
And all the Day my list'ning Soul I hung,</l>
            <l>Upon the charming Musick of thy Tongue,</l>
            <l>And never thought the blessed hours too long.</l>
            <l>No Swain, no God like thee cou'd ever move,</l>
            <l>Or had so soft an Art in whispering Love,</l>

            <l>Thus whilst all hearts you rul'd without Controul,</l>

Shall I then speak? or is it needless grown</l>

            <l>Do's not my Love it self too open lay,</l>

For fear of this among the Swains expos'd,</l>
            <l>My native greatness every thing disclos'd.</l>
            <l>Beauty and strength and courage joyn'd in one,</l>
            <l>Through all disguise spoke me a Monarchs Son.</l>
            <l>A place there is in <hi>Ida</hi>'s thickest Grove</l>
            <l>With Oaks and Firr-trees shaded all above,</l>
            <l>The grass here grows untoucht by bleating flocks,</l>
            <l>Or Mountain Goat, or the laborious Ox,</l>
            <l>From hence <hi>Troys</hi> Tow'rs magnificence &amp; pride,</l>
            <l>Leaning against an aged Oak, I spy'd.</l>
            <l>When straight methought I heard the trembling ground</l>
            <l>With the strange noise of trampling feet refound.</l>
            <l>In the same instant <hi>Iove</hi>'s great Messenger,</l>
            <l>On all his Wings born through the yielding Air,</l>
            <l>Lighting before my wondring Eyes did stand,</l>
            <l>His golden Rod shone in his sacred Hand:</l>
            <l>With him three charming Goddesses there came,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> and the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Dame.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53770:73"/>
With an unusual fear I stood amaz'd,</l>
            <l>Till thus the God my sinking Courage rais'd;</l>
            <l>Fear not; Thou art <hi>Jove's</hi> substitute below,</l>

            <l>Ah! would these hands have ever let you go?</l>
            <l>Or could I live and be divorc't from you?</l>
            <l>No, sooner I with life it self could part,</l>

TO
PARIS.</head>

Mr. <hi>DRYDEN.</hi>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helen,</hi> having received the foregoing Epistle
from <hi>Paris,</hi> returns the following Answer:
wherein she seems at first to chide him for his
Presumption in Writing, as he had done,
which could only proceed from his low Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Vertue; then owns her self to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Passion, which he had expressed for
her, tho she much suspect his Constancy; and at
last discovers her Inclinations to be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him. The whole Letter shewing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
artifice of Woman-kind.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>WHen loose Epistles violate Chast Eyes,</l>
            <l>She half Consents, who silently denies:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:53770:84"/>
How dares a Stranger with designs so vain,</l>
            <l>Marriage and Hospitable Rights Prophane?</l>
            <l>Was it for this, your Fate did shelter find</l>
            <l>From swelling Seas and every faithless wind?</l>
            <l>(For tho a distant Country brought you forth,</l>
            <l>Your usage here was equal to your worth.)</l>
            <l>Does this deserve to be rewarded so?</l>
            <l>Did you come here a Stranger, or a Foe?</l>
            <l>Your partial Judgment may perhaps complain;</l>
            <l>And think me barbarous for my just disdain;</l>
            <l>Ill-bred then let me be, but not unchast,</l>
            <l>Nor my clear fame with any spot defac'd:</l>
            <l>Tho in my face there's no affected Frown,</l>
            <l>Nor in my Carriage a feign'd niceness shown,</l>
            <l>I keep my Honor still without a stain,</l>
            <l>Nor has my Love made any Coxcomb vain.</l>
            <l>Your Boldness I with admiration see;</l>
            <l>What hope had you to gain a Queen like me?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53770:84"/>
Because a Hero forc'd me once away,</l>
            <l>Am I thought fit to be a second prey?</l>
            <l>Had I been won, I had deserv'd your blame,</l>
            <l>But sure my part was nothing but the shame:</l>
            <l>Yet the base theft to him no fruit did bear,</l>
            <l>I scap'd unhurt by any thing but fear.</l>
            <l>Rude force might some unwilling Kisses gain,</l>
            <l>But that was all he ever cou'd obtain.</l>
            <l>You on such terms would nere have let me go,</l>
            <l>Were he like you, we had not parted so.</l>
            <l>Untouch'd the Youth restor'd me to my Friends,</l>
            <l>And modest usage made me some amends;</l>
            <l>'Tis vertue to repent a vicious deed;</l>
            <l>Did he repent that <hi>Paris</hi> might succeed?</l>
            <l>Sure 'tis some Fate that sets me above wrongs,</l>
            <l>Yet still exposes me to busie tongues.</l>
            <l>Il'e not complain, for whose's displeas'd with Love,</l>
            <l>If it sincere, discreet, and Constant prove?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:53770:85"/>
But that I fear; not that I think you base,</l>
            <l>Or doubt the blooming beauties of my face?</l>
            <l>But all your Sex is subject to deceive,</l>
            <l>And ours alas, too willing to believe.</l>
            <l>Yet others yield: and Love o'recomes the best,</l>
            <l>But why should I not shine above the rest?</l>
            <l>Fair <hi>Leda</hi>'s Story seems at first to be</l>
            <l>A fit example ready found for me;</l>
            <l>But she was Cousen'd by a borrow'd shape,</l>
            <l>And under harmless Feathers felt a Rape:</l>
            <l>If I should yield, what Reason could I use?</l>
            <l>By what mistake the Loving Crime excuse?</l>
            <l>Her fault was in her pow'rful Lover lost,</l>
            <l>But of what <hi>Iupiter</hi> have I to boast?</l>
            <l>Tho you to Heroes, and to Kings succeed,</l>
            <l>Our Famous Race does no addition need,</l>
            <l>And great Alliances but useless prove</l>
            <l>To one that's come her self from mighty <hi>Iove.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53770:85"/>
Go then and boast in some less haughty place,</l>
            <l>Your <hi>Phrygian</hi> Blood, and <hi>Priam</hi>'s Ancient race,</l>
            <l>Which I wou'd shew I valu'd, if I durst;</l>
            <l>You are the fifth from <hi>Iove,</hi> but I the first,</l>
            <l>The Crown of <hi>Troy</hi> is pow'rful I confess,</l>
            <l>But I have reason to think ours no less.</l>
            <l>Your Letter fill'd with promises of all,</l>
            <l>That Men can good, or Women pleasant call,</l>
            <l>Gives expectation such an ample field,</l>
            <l>As wou'd move Goddesses themselves to yield.</l>
            <l>But if I e're offend great <hi>Iuno</hi>'s Laws,</l>
            <l>Your self shall be the Dear, the only Cause;</l>
            <l>Either my Honour I'll to death maintain,</l>
            <l>Or follow you, without mean thoughts of Gain.</l>
            <l>Not that so fair a Present I despise,</l>
            <l>We like the Gift, when we the giver prize.</l>
            <l>But 'tis your Love moves me, which made you take,</l>
            <l>Such pains, &amp; run such hazards for my sake;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53770:86"/>
I have perceiv'd (though I dissembled too)</l>
            <l>A Thousand things that Love has made you do;</l>
            <l>Your eager Eyes would almost dazle mine,</l>
            <l>In which (wild man) your wanton thoughts wou'd shine.</l>
            <l>Sometimes you'd sigh, sometimes disorder'd stand,</l>
            <l>And with unusual ardor, press my hand;</l>
            <l>Contrive just after me to take the Glass,</l>
            <l>Nor wou'd you let the least occasion pass,</l>
            <l>Which oft I fear'd, I did not mind alone,</l>
            <l>And blushing sate for things which you have done;</l>
            <l>Then murmur'd to my self, he'll for my sake</l>
            <l>Do any thing, I hope 'twas no mistake:</l>
            <l>Oft have I read within this pleasing Grove,</l>
            <l>Under my Name those Charming words, I <hi>Love,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I frowning, seem'd not to believe your Flame,</l>
            <l>But now, alas, am come to write the same.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53770:86"/>
If I were capable to do amiss,</l>
            <l>I could not but be sensible of this.</l>
            <l>For oh! your Face has such peculiar charms,</l>
            <l>That who can hold from flying to your arms?</l>
            <l>But what I ner'e can have without offence,</l>
            <l>May some blest Maid possess with innocence.</l>
            <l>Pleasure may tempt, but vertue more should move,</l>
            <l>O Learn of me to want the thing you Love.</l>
            <l>What you desire is sought by all mankind:</l>
            <l>As you have eyes, so others are not blind.</l>
            <l>Like you they see, like you my charms adore,</l>
            <l>They wish not less, but you dare venture more:</l>
            <l>Oh! had you then upon our Coasts been brought,</l>
            <l>My Virgin Love, when thousand Rivals sought,</l>
            <l>You had I seen, you should have had my voice;</l>
            <l>Nor could my Husband justly blame my Choice,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:53770:87"/>
For both our hopes, alas you come to late!</l>
            <l>Another now is Master of my Fate.</l>
            <l>More to my wish I cou'd have liv'd with you,</l>
            <l>And yet my present lot can undergo.</l>
            <l>Cease to solicit a weak Woman's will,</l>
            <l>And urge not her you Love, to so much ill.</l>
            <l>But let me live contented as I may,</l>
            <l>And make not my unspotted fame your prey.</l>
            <l>Some Right you claim, since naked to your eyes</l>
            <l>Three Goddesses disputed Beauties prize;</l>
            <l>One offer'd Valour, to'ther Crowns, but she</l>
            <l>Obtain'd her Cause, who smiling promis'd me.</l>
            <l>But first I am not of belief so light,</l>
            <l>To think such Nymphs wou'd shew you such a sight.</l>
            <l>Yet granting this, the other part is feign'd:</l>
            <l>A Bribe so mean, your sentence had not gain'd.</l>
            <l>With partial eyes I shou'd my self regard,</l>
            <l>To think that <hi>Venus</hi> made me her reward:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53770:87"/>
I humbly am content with human praise;</l>
            <l>A Goddesse's applause wou'd envy raise:</l>
            <l>But be it as you say, for 'tis confest,</l>
            <l>The Men who flatter highest, please us best.</l>
            <l>That I suspect it, ought not to displease;</l>
            <l>For Miracles are not believ'd with ease.</l>
            <l>One joy I have, that I have <hi>Venus</hi> voice;</l>
            <l>A greater yet, that you confirm'd her Choice;</l>
            <l>That proffer'd Laurels, promis'd Sov'raignty,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> you contemn'd for me.</l>
            <l>Am I your Empire then, and your renown?</l>
            <l>What heart of Rock but must by this be won?</l>
            <l>And yet bear witness, O you Powr's above,</l>
            <l>How rude I am in all the Arts of Love!</l>
            <l>My hand is yet untaught to write to men;</l>

Ev'n while I write, my fearful conscious eyes</l>

            <l>For now the Rumour spreads among the Croud,</l>

            <l>Yet if you will dissemble it, you may.</l>
            <l>Love secretly: the absence of my Lord,</l>

            <l>To go or not when unresolv'd he stood,</l>

            <l>Then Kissing me, he said I recommend</l>
            <l>All to thy Care, but most my <hi>Trojan</hi> Friend.</l>
            <l>I smil'd at what he innocently said,</l>

I from your rage, a Strumpet's Name shall hear,</l>

            <l>You my Crimes Authour, will my Crime upbraid:</l>

               <p>The Desire of gaining the Golden Fleece, put <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

<hi>Hypsipyle</hi> was then Queen, famed for her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
saving of her Father <hi>Thoas,</hi> in a general
Massacre of the Men there by the Women of
that Country. Her Entertainment of <hi>Jason</hi>
so kind, as induced him to stay there two years,
at the end of which he left the Island, and the
Queen, (then big with Child;) and after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Vows of Constancy, and a speedy return,
persues his first intended Voyage, and arrives
at <hi>Cholchos,</hi> where <hi>Aeta</hi> was King. <hi>Medea</hi> his

I would congratulate your safe return;</l>
            <l>But from your pen I should that safety learn.</l>
            <l>When from my slighted Coast you bore away,</l>
            <l>Spight of the winds; you show'd less Faith, than They.</l>
            <l>If't was too much t'enjoy my dearest Lord,</l>
            <l>Sure I deserv'd one Line, one tender word.</l>
            <l>Why did Fame first, and not their Conqueror, show,</l>
            <l>How Wars Fierce God saw his tam'd Bulls at Plough.</l>
            <l>How th'Earthborn Warriours rose, and how they fell</l>
            <l>By their own Swords, without your Conquering steel.</l>
            <l>How in your Charms the fetter'd Dragon lay,</l>

            <l>Would I could say I guiltless <hi>Iason</hi> wrong.</l>
            <l>Lately a Guest came from th' <hi>Hemonian</hi> Land:</l>
            <l>My door scarce reacht, with transport I demand</l>
            <l>How fares my <hi>Iason?</hi> His sad look he bore,</l>
            <l>Fixt with an ominous silence on the floor.</l>
            <l>My Robes I tore, and thus, with Horrour, cry'd,</l>
            <l>Lives he! or with one wound both hearts must bleed?</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jason</hi> arrives with his Companions at <hi>Cho'chos</hi>
where the Golden Fleece was kept, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can obtain, he is to undertake several
Adventures; first to yoke the Wild Bulls, then
to sow the Serpents Teeth, from whence should
instantly rise an Army, with which he must
encounter; and lastly, to make his passage by
the Dragon that never slept. In order to this,
he solicits <hi>Medea</hi> Daughter to the King, and
skilful in Charms, by whose assistance (on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Love) he gains the Prize. Then flies
with her; the King pursues them, <hi>Medea</hi> kills
her little Brother, scatters his Limbs, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53770:102"/>
whilst the King stays to gather them up, escapes
with her Lover into <hi>Thessaly;</hi> where she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores
decrepit <hi>Aeson</hi> to his Youth. On the same
promise perswades Pelias his Daughters to let
out their Fathers Blood, but deceitfully leaves
them Guilty of Parricide. For this and other
Crimes, <hi>Jason</hi> casts her off: Marries <hi>Crëusa</hi>
Daughter to <hi>Creon</hi> King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> on which
the enrag'd <hi>Medea,</hi> according to the various
Transports of her Passion, writes this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
soothing and menacing Epistle.</p>

               <p>In the War of <hi>Troy, Achilles</hi> having taken and
Sackt <hi>Chrynesium,</hi> a Town in the <hi>Lyrnesian</hi>
Country, amongst his other Booty, he took
two very fair Women, <hi>Chryseis,</hi> and <hi>Briseis: Chryseis</hi> he Presented to King <hi>Agamemnon,</hi>
and <hi>Briseis</hi> he reserved for himself. <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
after some time was forced by the Oracle
to restore <hi>Chryseis</hi> to her Father, who was
one of the Priests of <hi>Apollo;</hi> whereupon the
King by violence took away <hi>Briseis</hi> from <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi>
at which <hi>Achilles</hi> incenst, left the Camp
of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and prepared to Sail home;
in whose absence the <hi>Trojans</hi> prevailing upon
the <hi>Grecians, Agamemnon</hi> was compell'd to
send <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and others to offer him rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
and <hi>Briseis:</hi> that he would return again
to the Army: But <hi>Achilles</hi> with disdain reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them all. This Letter therefore is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Briseis,</hi> to move him, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her, and return to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp.</p>

But her Father not knowing what had
past, and having not long after promised her
to another, just as the Solemnities of Marriage
were to be perform'd, she was taken with a
suddain and violent Feavour, which <hi>Aconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
endeavours to perswade her was sent
from <hi>Diana,</hi> as a punishment of the breach of
the Vow made in her presence. And this,
with the rest of the Arguments which on such
an occasion would occur to a Lover, is the
Subject of the following Epistle.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>REad boldly this; here you shall Swear no more,</l>
            <l>For that's enough which you have Sworn before.</l>
            <l>Read it; so may that violent Disease,</l>
            <l>Which thy dear body, but my soul doth seise,</l>
            <l>Forget its too long practis'd Crueltie,</l>
            <l>And health to you restore, and you to me.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:53770:139"/>
Why do you blush? for blush you do, I fear,</l>
            <l>As when you first did in the Temple Swear:</l>
            <l>Truth to your plighted Faith is all I claim;</l>
            <l>And truth can never be the cause of shame.</l>
            <l>Shame lives with guilt, but you your virtue prove</l>
            <l>In favouring mine, for mine's a Husbands love.</l>
            <l>Ah! to your self those binding words repeat</l>
            <l>That once your wishing Eyes ev'nlong'd to meet,</l>
            <l>When th'Apple brought 'em dancing to your feet.</l>
            <l>There you will find the Solemn Vow you made,</l>
            <l>Which, if your health, or mine can ought perswade,</l>
            <l>You to perform should rather mindful be,</l>
            <l>Than great <hi>Diana</hi> to rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ge on Thee.</l>
            <l>My fears for you encrease with my desire,</l>
            <l>And Hope blows that already raging fire;</l>
            <l>For hope you gave; nor can you this deny,</l>
            <l>For the great Goddess of the Fane was by;</l>

               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53770:139"/>
She was, and heard, &amp; from her hallowed Shrine</l>
            <l>A suddain kind Auspicious light did shine.</l>
            <l>Her Statue seem'd to nod its awful head,</l>
            <l>And give its glad consent to what you said;</l>
            <l>Now, if you please, accuse my prosperous cheat,</l>
            <l>Yet still confess 'twas Love that taught me it.</l>
            <l>In that deceit what did I else design,</l>
            <l>But with your own consent to make you mine?</l>
            <l>What you my Crime, I call my Innocence,</l>
            <l>Since Loving you has been my sole offence.</l>
            <l>Nor nature gave me, nor has practice taught</l>
            <l>The Nets with which young Virgins hearts are caught.</l>
            <l>You my accuser taught me to deceive,</l>
            <l>And Love, with you, did his assistance give;</l>
            <l>For Love stood by, and smiling bad me write</l>
            <l>The cunning words he did himself indite:</l>
            <l>Again, you see I write by his Command,</l>
            <l>He guides my Pen, and rules my willing hand,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53770:140"/>
Again such kind, such loving words I send,</l>
            <l>As makes me fear that I again offend.</l>
            <l>Yet if my Love's my Crime, I must confess,</l>
            <l>Great is my Guilt, but never shall be less.</l>
            <l>Oh that I thus might ever guilty prove,</l>
            <l>In finding out new paths to reach thy Love.</l>
            <l>A thousand waies to that steep Mountain lead,</l>
            <l>Tho hard to find, and difficult to tread.</l>
            <l>All these will I find out and break through all,</l>
            <l>For with my Flames compar'd, the danger's small.</l>
            <l>The Gods alone know what the end will be,</l>
            <l>Yet if we Mortals any thing foresee,</l>
            <l>One way or other you must yield to me.</l>
            <l>If all my Arts should fail, to Arms I'le fly,</l>
            <l>And snatch by force what you my Prayers deny:</l>

            </l>
            <l>Worse Ills I could not for your sake sustain,</l>
            <l>Tho you had merit equal to my Pain.</l>
            <l>Your Love betrays, my Beauty proves my Snare,</l>
            <l>I had been happy had I seem'd less Fair:</l>
            <l>Whilst with your Rival you contend to raise</l>
            <l>My Beauty's Fame, I perish by your Praise:</l>
            <l>Whilst neither will admit the others Claim,</l>
            <l>The Chase is hinder'd, and both miss the Game.</l>
            <l>My Nuptial day draws on, my Parents press</l>
            <l>The Sacred Rights, my blooming years no less.</l>
            <l>But whilst glad <hi>Hymen</hi> at my door attends,</l>
            <l>Grim Death waits near to force me from his Hands.</l>
            <l>Some call my Sickness Chance, and some pretend</l>
            <l>The Gods this Lett to cross my Nuptials send;</l>
            <l>Whilst by severer Censure you are ghest,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Philtra</hi>'s, to have wrought upon my Breast.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:53770:146"/>
If then your love such mischief can create,</l>
            <l>What Miserie is reserv'd for her you Hate!</l>
            <l>Wou'd I to <hi>Delos</hi> nere had found the way,</l>
            <l>At least not found it on that fatal Day!</l>
            <l>When in our Port our Anchors first we weigh'd,</l>
            <l>Th' unwilling Vessel still i'th Harbour staid;</l>
            <l>Twice did cross winds beat back our flagging Sails,</l>
            <l>Said I, cross winds? no! those were prosprous Gales!</l>
            <l>Those winds alone blew fair, that back convey'd</l>
            <l>Our Ship, and those that oft our Passage stay'd.</l>
            <l>Yet I to see sam'd <hi>Delos</hi> am in pain,</l>
            <l>And fondly of each hindring blast complain.</l>
            <l>By <hi>Tenos</hi> Isle, and <hi>Mycone</hi> we Steer'd,</l>
            <l>At last fair <hi>Delos</hi> winding Clifts appear'd;</l>
            <l>And much I fear left now the <hi>Fairy</hi> Shore,</l>
            <l>Shou'd vanish, as 'tis said t'have done before.</l>
            <l>At night we Land, soon as the day return'd</l>
            <l>My platted Tresses are with Gemms adorn'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:53770:146"/>
Then to attend the Sacred Rites we go,</l>
            <l>And pious Incense on each Altar throw,</l>
            <l>My Parents there at their Devotion stay;</l>
            <l>My Nurse and I through all the Temple stray:</l>
            <l>We view each Court, &amp; each, fresh wonder brings;</l>
            <l>Pictures, and Statues, Gifts of Ancient Kings.</l>
            <l>But whilst into these Rarities I pry'd,</l>
            <l>I am my self by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly <hi>Acontius</hi> spy'd.</l>
            <l>Thence to the inmost Temple we remove,</l>
            <l>The place that should a Sanctuary prove.</l>
            <l>Yet there I find the Apple with this Rhime—</l>
            <l>Ah! me, I'de like to have Sworn the second time!</l>
            <l>The Name of Wedlock I no sooner read,</l>
            <l>But through my Cheeks a troubled blush was spread.</l>
            <l>Why didst Thou Cheat an unsuspecting Maid?</l>
            <l>I shou'd have been entreated, not betray'd:</l>
            <l>Is then the Goddess bound to take thy part?</l>
            <l>And ratifie an Oath without the Heart?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:53770:147"/>
The Will Consents, but that was Absent There;</l>
            <l>I read indeed the Oath, but did not Swear.</l>
            <l>Yet cannot I deny that I suspect</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Dianas</hi> Rage this Sickness do's inflict;</l>
            <l>Glad <hi>Hymen</hi> thrice did to our Courts repair,</l>
            <l>Thrice frighted fled to find Death planted there.</l>
            <l>Thin Cov'rings on my Feaverish Limbs are spread,</l>
            <l>My Parents mourn me as already Dead.</l>
            <l>What have I done to merit this distress,</l>
            <l>That read but words whose fraud I cou'd not ghess!</l>
            <l>Do Thou, ev'n Thou from whom my suffrings spring,</l>
            <l>T'appease the Goddess Rage thine Offrings bring.</l>
            <l>When will those Hands that writ the fatal Rhime,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Bear</hi> Incense to remove my Pain, thy Crime!</l>
            <l>Nor think that thy rich Rival tho' allow'd</l>
            <l>To Visit, is of greater Favours proud.</l>
            <l>By me he sits, but still just distance keeps,</l>
            <l>Restless as I, Talks seldom, often weeps:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:53770:147"/>
Blushing he takes a Kiss, and leaves a Tear,</l>
            <l>And once his Courage serv'd to Cry—My Dear.</l>
            <l>But from his Arms still by Degrees I creep,</l>
            <l>And to prevent Discourse pretend to sleep.</l>
            <l>He finds, but wou'd his sense o'th flight disguise,</l>
            <l>He checks his Tongue, butchides me with his Eyes.</l>
            <l>With grief he wasts, and I with Feavours pine,</l>
            <l>'Tis we that suffer, but th' Offence was Thine.</l>
            <l>You write for leave to come and see me Here,</l>
            <l>Yet know your former Visit cost me Dear.</l>
            <l>Why wouldst thou hither come, thou canst but see</l>
            <l>The double Trophies of thy Cruelty.</l>
            <l>My flesh consum'd, my Cheeks of bloodless Hue,</l>
            <l>Such as I once did in thy Apple view,</l>
            <l>Shou'dst see me now thou woud'st repent thy cheat,</l>
            <l>Nor think me worth such exquisite Deceit.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Delos</hi> back with greater hast wou'dst go,</l>
            <l>And beg the Goddess to release my Vow,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:53770:148"/>
On new designs thy fancy would'st employ,</l>
            <l>Contrive new Oaths the former to destroy.</l>
            <l>No Means have been omitted to procure</l>
            <l>My health, but still my Feav'rish Fits endure.</l>
            <l>We ask'd the Oracle what caus'd my Pains?</l>
            <l>The Oracle of broken Vows complains!</l>
            <l>The Gods themselves on your behalf declare:</l>
            <l>What hast thou done to merit this their Care?</l>
            <l>But so it is—and I at last incline,</l>
            <l>Since that Thou art their Choice, to make Thee Mine.</l>
            <l>Already to my Mother I've declar'd,</l>
            <l>How by your Cunning I have been ensnar'd.</l>
            <l>I've done, and what I have already said,</l>
            <l>I fear is more than will become a Maid.</l>
            <l>My Thoughts are now confus'd, and can indite</l>
            <l>No more, my feeble hand no more can write.</l>
            <l>Nor need I more subscribe, but this, Be True!</l>
            <l>And (since it must be so) <hi>my Dear Adieu.</hi>
