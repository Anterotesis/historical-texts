            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A commemoration
of the generall mone, the honorable
and solemne funerall made for and of
the most worthy Sir Phillip Sidney
Knight by B. W. esquire,</head>
            <l>VVHen winters bitter blast,<note place="margin">He was woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded about the faule of the leafe.</note> the trees began to bare,</l>
            <l>Sweet Sydney slaine, downe fell our hope &amp; piller of welfare:</l>
            <l>He was the rising sunne that made all <hi>England</hi> glad,</l>
            <l>He was the life, and light, of those that any vertues had.</l>
            <l>He was the muses ioy, he was <hi>Bellonas</hi> sheilde,<note place="margin">His vertues and vallor.</note>
            </l>
            <l>With in the Towne he was a Lambe, a Lion in the Feild:</l>
            <l>His Life bewraed a loue, that matched Curtius zeale,</l>
            <l>His Life, no Life, contempt of death, to serue the common weale,</l>
            <l>No gift, nor grace, there was, but in his vertues shind,</l>
            <l>His worth more worth than <hi>Flaunders</hi> wealth now by his lasse we finde:</l>
            <l>For when his sacred soule,<note place="margin">Mone at his departure.</note> did forth his bodie flie,</l>
            <l>Ten thousand shrikes persude the same, vnto the starry Skie,</l>
            <l>The stowtest Souldier then shewed feminine dismay,</l>
            <l>And with their teares, did wash his wound, that brought him to decay:</l>
            <l>Some kist his breathlesse mouth, where wisdome flowed at will,</l>
            <l>Some raysd his head, that lately was the treasurhowse of skill,</l>
            <l>Where truth and cowrage liu'd his Noble hart some fealt,</l>
            <l>Some layd their hands vppon his breast, where all the vertues dwelt</l>
            <l>Some eid his closed eyne, that wacht the poore-mans need,</l>
            <l>And when they did vnwrap his thygh, his wound did make them bleed.</l>
            <l>O honer derely bought they crid, &amp; monde this chaunce,</l>
            <l>So shoke his hand, and sayd farewell, thow glory of the Launce:</l>

            <l>It was too much he lost his life, his Corse they would not leaue:</l>

            <l>The winde and Seas did mourne, to see this heauie sight,</l>
            <l>And into <hi>Thames</hi> did conuey this much lamented Knight:</l>
            <l>Vnto the <hi>Minories,</hi> his bodie was conuayde,</l>
            <l>And there vnder a martiall hearse, three Monthes, or more was staide.</l>
            <l>But when the day was come, he to his graue must goe,</l>
            <l>An host of heauy men repair'd, to see the sollome showe:</l>

            <l>To see his coulers late aduaunst, lie trayling on the ground.</l>
            <l>Each ornament of war thus out of order borne,</l>
            <l>Did pearce ten thousand harts with griefe, which were not namd to mourne:</l>
            <l>Some markt the great dismay, that charg'd his martiall bande,</l>
            <l>And how some horsemen walkt on foote, with battel-axe in hand.</l>
            <l>Some tould the mourning clockes his gentlemen did weare,</l>
            <l>What Knights, &amp; captaines, were in gownes &amp; what the haralds beare</l>
            <l>Some markt his stately Horse, how they hong downe their head,</l>
            <l>As if they mourned for their Knight that followed after dead.</l>
            <l>But when his noble corps, in sollom wise past by,</l>
            <l>Farewell the worthiest Knight, that liu'd, the multitude did crie:</l>
