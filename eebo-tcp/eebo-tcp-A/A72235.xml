         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Truely my brethren and Countreymen, if God haue at any time requyred that his mercies ſhould vniuerſally be knowen &amp; celebrated of his people, (as no doubt with ſuch ſacrifices he is wel pleaſed): He hath in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this our Soueraigne, called for, and exacted a thankefull memoriall of his ſo memorable and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable benefites, not of Prince onely, but of all and euery her highnes Subiects. Looke vpon your peaces Hath there ben like peace with any the nations about you, ſo firme, ſo ſound, and of ſuch continuance? Haue
<pb facs="tcp:150403:4"/>
either domeſticall attempts, or foreyne practiſes as yet preuailed to the ouerthrow of the ſame? Hath either am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſire of Conqueſt drawen you forth to warres abroad? or vnſatiable deſyre of greedy myndes broken aſunder or vntwyned your ſafetie at home? what ſhould I ſay? Who getteth and enioyeth not? Who encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and poſſeſſeth not? In whoſe hands (my brethren) hath the aboundance of ryches as yet bene ſayd to be the danger of his lyfe, or the ouerthrowe of his welfare?</p>
            <p>Nowe then, if theſe benefites, be benefites which you delite in: if the continuance of them be comfortable: and the onely inſtrument hereof, be our deare Soueraigne, Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> what els doeth wiſedome then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but that we ſhould wiſely foreſee to doe the things towards God and her Maieſtie that may eſtabliſhe an happie continuance thereof? And what els doeth thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes looke for at our handes, but that there be in vs a readines to accompliſh the wyll of the higheſt, to hym warde in the obediente of his worde: and to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie warde, in the obedience of her Lawes?</p>
            <p>I knowe there are of the faythfull watchmen and good ſhepheards of this lande, that exceedingly feare the continuaunce of theſe ſo glorious benefites: They feare I ſay, that the vnrecouerable wickednes of the people of this tyme and Nation is ſo oppoſed agaynſt the great mercifulneſſe of our God, that theſe heaped tranquilities are nothing els but iudgementes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runnyng the approchyng dayes of deſolation. I would God therefore, the wayes of Engliſh people were once called to accompt, O I woulde to God we coulde once ſet before vs, on the one ſide, a ſingle view of theſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; marueylous things, which the Lord, the <hi>Iehouah,</hi> hath wrought and brought to paſſe for our Prince and vs: and on the other ſide, what we haue done, or rather what (like wretches) we haue left vndone of that which mere duetie in common thankefulnes hath requyred at our handes. Touching the one, beſides the miraculous preſeruation of our Prince, euen in thoſe dayes wherein
<pb facs="tcp:150403:4"/>
Antichriſts tyrannie ſwylled vp the blood of Saintes, ſparyng neither ſexe, age, condition nor degree: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſet farre beyonde the reache and reaſon of man, that her Maieſtie beyng euer ſince placed, as it were in a <hi>Goshen,</hi> enuironed about with Egyptians, malitious, aſpyring &amp; blooddy: her royal perſon, her Religion and Peace ſhould neuertheles ſtyl be preſerued from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments of thoſe aduerſaries, &amp; that in ſuch degree, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies them ſelues haue bene rather tyred in their practiſes, then the one or other of theſe benefites weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theyr attemptes. The Rebellion of <hi>Abſolon</hi> and his complices hath bene ſuppreſſed at home. The tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous counſailes of <hi>Achitophel</hi> haue bene confounded both abroad and at home. <hi>Dauid</hi> hath had an <hi>Huſay:</hi> yea, the annoynted our <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hath had and alwayes ſhall haue a <hi>Sobi,</hi> a <hi>Machir</hi> and a <hi>Berſelai,</hi> which wyl laye both goods and lyues at her feete. As for the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring rage and terrours of Antichriſt and his Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what better or greater iſſue hath there ben of them, then of the crackling of thornes flaming vnder a potte? And touchyng the Enchauntments of Egypt, (ſome curſed practiſers whereof haue bene lately ſurpriſed) the true myracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> haue from tyme to tyme ſtil deuoured them. Briefly, the enemies haue wearyed them ſelues in the wayes of trecherie &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and haue not yet preuayled: They haue graſped at vnhappie conqueſts, and haue bene alwayes yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: their glory hath bene no better yet then the glory of graſſe vpon the houſe toppe, whereof the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked reapers neuer hytherto fylled their handes, muche leſſe haue layd vp fruits thereof in their impious barnes. <hi>O that men would therefore prayſe the Lord<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note> for his goodnes, &amp; declare the wonders that he hath done for the children of men: That they would exalt him alſo in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, and loue him in the Seate of the Elders.</hi>

            <p>But nowe, that you may ſome way anſwere the name of a Patron of this my Booke: although the matter of the ſame hath defence ſufficient in it ſelfe, &amp; in the truth thereof, is able enough to ſtand againſt the faces of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies of truth: Yet becauſe there is a ſorte of people, which I feare me, more of enuy, then of any true zeale or care of my well doynge (as hauyng an awſtere regard vnto my vocation, which in deede, reſteth in the Study, or rather in a meane place of practiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes of this Realme) will recken it a matter more then ordinary that I ſhould after this ſorte ſo tranſcende the limits of my ſayd vocation, as ſpendyng my time, or at the leaſt, ſome parte of the ſame, in thyngs by ſemblaunce, ſo far diſcrepaunte from my profeſſion: let my defenſe be ſo made, I beſeeche you, that it may in equall ſort be conſidered, or at the leaſt wiſe by you enforced, not only how muche and how largely loue and zeale are hable to woorke and brynge to paſſe in men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whyles conuerſaunt in the conſideration of thynges high and precious, but alſo how ſeemely a thyng it is and how well agreeable with euery vocation to aduaunce and ſet foorth the high prayſes of vertue and vertuous perſonages, as alſo to batter &amp; beate downe the enforcementes of vyce and vicious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>And for my ſelfe, I haue boldly to affirme vnto all ſuche diſcontented myndes (eſpecially vnto thoſe that haue the common lawes for theyr profeſſion) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the matter of this my littel booke is not ſo voyde of excuſe, but that by view of the ſubſtaunce &amp; ful ſcope

therof, it may yeelde foorth a ſtronge and ryghtfull defenſe agaynſt theſe nice and ouer curious repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: for, as it concerneth the ſpeciall prayſe of God in the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the Queenes Maieſties moſt proſperous and peaceable gouernment: So, it is not vnknowne that touchinge the Regiment of Princes, the nature of Lawes, the office of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylers, and the authorytie of Iudges, the volumes of our Lawes are not ſo barrein, but that they may and do miniſter matter aboundantlye to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and ſtudents of the ſame, whereby to diſcerne and to deeme indifferently of them all: for whether we would conſider the good and godly gouernment of a Prince by often pardoning of offences in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, or by ſharplie puniſhing of offenders in iuſtice, by planting of good &amp; wholeſome lawes, or by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of euill and vnneceſſary Statutes: Not onely <hi>Bracton,</hi> but alſo the worthy and worſhipfull Knight maſter <hi>Foreſcue</hi> in ſundrye places of his litle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, verie copiouſly geue foorth matter for the furtherynge of ſtudious wittes in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion thereof. And no leſſe may be gathered tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng a difference and ſownd cenſure of honourable Counſayllers: but eſpecially of Iudges &amp; of lawes.

thought diſcrepaunt or impertinent for a ſtudent of the lawes to treat or to write of.</p>
            <p>But wherfore ſhould I thus carefully ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that which I ſuppoſe, nedeth no reprehenſion? why ſhuld I not rather challenge that liberty that is graunted to euery vocation of learninge, yea to the lawyer himſelf? namely, to intermingle with painful trauayles of the minde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſures of ſome exerciſe more plauſible and milde, eſpecially, where the ſame may be practiſed to the glory of god &amp; to the profit of our brethren, as I truſt, this is, or at the leaſt wyſe was intended. Well, if all this notwithſtanding, theſe curious carpers wil neuer be ſatiſfied, let them at their pleaſures blow abroade what they liſt, and holde on in their myſlikings, vntyll in the vanytie of their purpoſes, and the rage of their enuie, they ſhal at the length be glutted with the fulneſſe of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure and vnciuill reproches.
