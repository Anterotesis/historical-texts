            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All the foreſaid Nine Altars had their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shrines, and covers of Wainſcot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, in a very decent and comely form; having likewiſe betwixt every Altar a very fair, and large Partition of Wainſcot, all varniſhed over with fine branches and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other Imagery-work, moſt finely, and artificially Pictur'd, and gilt; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Lockers, or Ambries, for the ſafe keeping of the Veſtments, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to every Altar; with three, or four little Ambries in the Wall, pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of the ſaid Altars, for the ſame uſe and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the Eaſt end of the ſaid Church there is a goodly fair round Window, called St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Window; the breadth of the Quire all of ſtone, and cunningly wrought, and glaz'd, having in it twenty four lights, very artificially made; and the Picture of St. <hi>Catharine</hi> is ſet in Glaſs on the right ſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the ſaid Window, in another glaz'd Window, as ſhe was ſet upon the Wheel, to be tormented to death; which Wheel did burſt in pieces, and caught the turners of it, and with the pikes thereof rent them all to pieces; St. <hi>Catharine</hi> being ſafe her

               <p>At the Weſt end of the Shrine of St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was a little Altar adjoyn'd to it for Maſs to be ſaid, only on the great and Holy Feaſt of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s day in Lent.

And at this Feaſt, and certain other Feſtival dayes, in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they were accuſtomed to draw up the cover of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Shrine, being of Wainſcot, whereunto was faſten'd, unto every corner of the ſaid cover, to a loop of Iron, a very ſtrong cord, which cords were all faſten'd together at the end over the midſt of the cover; and a ſtrong Rope was faſten'd unto the loops, or binding of the ſaid cord; which Rope did run up and down in a pulley under the Vault, above St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Fereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the drawing up of the cover of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Shrine.

ſuch a goodly ſonnd, that it ſtirr'd all the Peoples hearts within the Church to repair unto it, and to make their prayers unto God, and the Holy man, St. <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> And that the beholders might ſee the glory and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, the ſaid cover had at every corner two hoops of Iron made faſt to every corner of the Cover, which did run up and down on four round ſtaves of Iron, when it was drawing, which were made faſt in every corner of the Marble that St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Coffin did lye upon; which ſaid cover on the out-ſide was all over very finely, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially gilt; and alſo on either ſide of the ſaid cover were painted four lively Images, curiouſly wrought, and miraculous to all the beholders thereof. And on the Eaſt end was painted the Picture of our Saviour ſitting in the Rain-bow to give Judgment, very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, and lively to behold; and on the Weſt end of the ſaid cover, was the Picture of our Lady, and the Picture of Chriſt on her knee; and on the height of the ſaid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from end to end, was a moſt fine bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing of carved work cut throughout with Dragons, and Fowls, and Beaſts, moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially wrought, and ſet forth to the

And the in-ſide of the ſaid cover was all varniſhed and colour'd with a moſt fine ſanguine colour, that the Beholders might ſee all the glory, and all the ornaments thereof; and at every corner of the ſaid cover there was a lock to lock it down, from opening and drawing the ſame up.</p>
               <p>Alſo within the ſaid Feretory, on both North and South ſide, there were Ambries of fine Wainſcot, varniſhed and finely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and gilt over with fine little Images, very beautiful to behold, for the Reliques belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> to lye in.

               <p>Within this Feretory of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> were many fine little Pictures of ſeveral Saints, of Imagery work, all being of Alabaſter, ſet in the <hi>French Pierre,</hi> in their ſeveral places, the Pictures being curiouſly wrought, engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and gilt; and the <hi>Nevil's Croſs,</hi> and <hi>Bull's Head</hi> ſet upon the height, and on the other ſide of the two doors in the ſaid <hi>French pierre,</hi> and alſo in divers other places of the <hi>French pierre</hi> beſides; which Feretory, and <hi>French pierre,</hi> were made at the charges of <hi>John,</hi> Lord <hi>Nevil,</hi> as may appear at large, in the Hiſtory of the Church.</p>
               <p>At the Eaſt end of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Feretory were wrought upon the height of the Irons, towards the Nine Altars, very fine Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of Iron, like Sockets, which had lights ſet in them before day, that every Monk might have the more light to ſee to reade upon their books at the ſaid Nine Altars, when they ſaid Maſs; and alſo to give light to all others that came thither to hear and ſee the Divine Service.</p>

               <p>In the Eaſt end of the Quire joyning upon St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Feretory, ſtood the high Altar, the goodlieſt in all the Church, being a very Rich thing, with many precious and coſtly Ornaments appertaining to it, as well for every principal day, as for every of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's dayes. The ſaid High Altar, and St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Feretory, is all of the <hi>French Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> curiouſly wrought, both in-ſide, and out-ſide, with fair Images of Alabaſter, and gilt, being called in the Ancient Hiſtory, the <hi>Lardoſe;</hi> the ſaid curious workmanſhip of the <hi>French Pierre,</hi> or <hi>Lardoſe,</hi> reaching in height almoſt to the middle Vault, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the breadth of the Quire in length. In the midſt whereof, right over the ſaid High Altar, were artificially plac'd, in very fine Alabaſter, the Picture of our Lady ſtanding in the midſt, and the Picture of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> on one ſide, and the Picture of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> on the other, all richly gilt. And at either end of the ſaid Altar was a wand of Iron faſten'd in the Wall, whereon did hang<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Curtains, or Hangings of white ſilk
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40876:12"/>
daily. The daily Ornaments that were hung both before the Altar, and above, were of red Velvet, with great flowers of gold in embroider'd work, with many goodly Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures beſides, very finely gilt: but the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the principal Feaſt, which was the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of our Lady, were all white Damask, all beſet with Pearl, and precious Stones; which made the Ornaments more glorious to behold.</p>
               <p>Within the Quire, over the high Altar, hung a rich, and moſt ſumptuous Canopy for the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> to hang within it, which had two Irons faſten'd in the <hi>French Pierre</hi> very finely gilt, which held the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py over the midſt of the ſaid high Altar that the <hi>Pix</hi> did hang in, that it could not ſtir, nor move; whereon did ſtand a Pelican, all of Silver, upon the height of the ſaid Canopy, finely gilt, giving her blood to her young ones, in token of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who gave his blood for the ſins of the World; and it was goodly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, for the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> to hang in. And the <hi>Pix,</hi> wherein the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> did hang, was of pure gold, curiouſly wrought of Gold-ſmith's work; and the white cloath that hung over the <hi>Pix</hi> was of very fine Lawn,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40876:13"/>
all embroidered, and wrought about with gold and red ſilk, and four great knobs of gold, curiouſly wrought, with great taſſels of gold and red ſilk hanging at them, and at the four corners of the white Lawn cloath. And the Crock that did hang within the cloath, on which the <hi>Pix</hi> hung, was of gold; and the cord that drew it up and down, was made of fine ſtrong white ſilk. And when the Monks went to ſay, or ſing high Maſs, they put on their Veſtments in the Reveſtry, both the Epiſtlers and the Goſpellers; they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reveſted in the ſame place. And when the Office of the Maſs was begun to be ſung, the Epiſtlers came forth of the Reveſtry, and the other two Monks following him, all three arow at the South Quire door, and there did ſtand to the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, begun to be ſung. And then, with great Reverence and Devotion, they went all three up to the high Altar; and one of the Vergers that kept the Reveſtry did go before them with a tipt ſtaff in his hand, as it was his Office so to do, bowing themſelves moſt reverently to the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Altar; the one on the one ſide of him that ſaid Maſs, and the other on the other.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40876:13"/>
Alſo the Goſpeller did carry a marvellous fair Book, which had the Goſpels and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in it, and did lay it on the Altar; which Book had on the out-ſide of the covering the Picture of our Saviour Chriſt all of Silver, of Gold-ſmith's work, all parcel-gilt, very fine to behold; which Book did ſerve for the <hi>Pax</hi> in the Maſs. The Epiſtler, when he had ſung the Epiſtle, did lay the Book again upon the Altar; and afterward, when the Goſpel was ſung, the Goſpeller laid it down upon the Altar likewiſe, untill the Maſs was done. Maſs being ended, they went all three into the Reveſtry, from whence they came, and carried the Book with them; and one of the Vergers meeting them at the South Quire door, after the ſame ſort, went before them into the Reveſtry.</p>
               <p>There pertained alſo to the high Altar two goodly Chalices, one of gold, the other of ſilver, double gilt, and all the foot of it ſet full of precious ſtones. That of gold was for principal dayes, and the other to ſerve every day. Likewiſe there were pertaining to the ſaid high Altar two goodly great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſilver; one for principal dayes, double gilt, a great large one; and the other Baſon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40876:14"/>
for every day, not ſo large, being parcel-gilt, and engraven all over; and two great Crew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of ſilver, containing quarts apiece, parcel-gilt, and graven all over; and other two leſſer Crewets for every day, all of ſilver; one pair of ſilver Cenſers for every day, and two pair of ſilver Cenſers for every double Feaſt, double gilt; and two pair of ſilver Cenſers, parcel-gilt, and the Chains alſo, for every principal day, with two Ships of ſilver, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-gilt, for principal dayes, and other two of ſilver ungilt for every day, to carry Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe in; and two ſilver double-gilt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks for two Tapers very finely wrought, of three quarters height, to be taken aſunder with wreſts; other two ſilver Candleſticks for every dayes Service, parcel-gilt, with goodly, and rich, and ſumptuous Furniture, for every Feſtival day, of changeable ſuits. Divers of the Veſtments were ſet all round about with Pearl, Stoles, and Fannels. There were alſo other very rich and coſtly Jewels and Ornaments pertaining to the ſaid high Altar.</p>
               <p>There were alſo two Croſſes to be born on principal dayes for Proceſſion; one all of gold, and the ſtaff it ſtood in was of ſilver,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40876:14"/>
and of Gold-ſmith's work, very curiouſly, and very finely wrought, and double gilt. The other Croſs was of ſilver, and double gilt, and the ſtaff was of wood, after the ſame workmanſhip, and double gilt alſo. There was another Croſs of Chryſtal, that ſerved for every day in the week. There was born before the Croſs, every principal day, a Holy-water-font, all of ſilver, very finely engraven, and parcel-gilt; which one of the Novices did carry.</p>
               <p>In the North-ſide of the Quire there is an Ambrie nigh to the high Altar, faſten'd in the Wall, for to lay any thing in pertaining to the high Altar.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe another Ambrie in the South ſide of the Quire, nigh the high Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, encloſed in the Wall, to ſet the Chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Baſons, and the Crewets in, that they did miniſter withal at the high Maſs; with locks and keyes for the ſame Ambries.</p>
               <p>At the North end of the high Altar there was a goodly fine Lantern, or Letteron, of Braſs, where they ſung the Epiſtle and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, with a great Pelican on the height of it, finely gilt, billing her blood out of her breaſt, to feed her young ones, and her wings ſpread
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40876:15"/>
abroad, whereon did lye the Book, in which they ſung the Epiſtle, and the Goſpel. It was thought to be the goodlieſt Letteron of Braſs in all this Countrey. It was all to be taken aſunder with wreſts, every joynt, one from the other.</p>
               <p>Alſo there was lower down in the Quire another Lantern of Braſs, not ſo curiouſly wrought, ſtanding in the midſt againſt the Stalls, a marvellous fair one, of Braſs, with an Eagle on the height of it, and her wings ſpread abroad; whereon the Monks did lay their Books, when they ſung their Legends at Mattins, or at other times of Service.</p>
               <p>Before the high Altar, within the Quire above-mentioned, were three marvellous fair ſilver Baſons, hanging in chains of ſilver; one of them did hang on the South ſide of the Quire, above the ſteps that go up to the high Altar; the ſecond on the North ſide, oppoſite to the former; and the third in the midſt betwixt them both, and juſt before the high Altar. Theſe three ſilver Baſons had latten Baſons within them, having pricks for Serges, or great waxen Candles to ſtand on, the Latten Baſons being to receive the drops of the three Candles, which did burn
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40876:15"/>
continually, day and night, in token that the Houſe was alwayes watching to God.</p>
               <p>There was alſo another ſilver Baſon, which hung in ſilver Chains before the Sacrament of the foreſaid high Altar, but nearer to the Altar than the others, hanging almoſt over the Prieſt's back; which was only lighted in time of Maſs, and, that ended, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>There was further a goodly Monument, belonging to the Church, called the <hi>Paſchal;</hi> which was wont to be ſet up in the Quire, and there to remain from the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> called <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> till the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> after <hi>Aſcention-day.</hi> It ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a four-ſquare thick plank of wood, againſt the firſt greeſe, or ſtep, hard behind the three Baſons of ſilver that hung before the high Altar. In the midſt of the ſaid greeſe is a nick, wherein one of the corners of the ſaid plank was placed; and at every corner of the ſaid plank was an Iron Ring, whereunto the foot of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> was adjoyned, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Pictures of the four flying Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; as alſo the Pictures of the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, above the top of the Dragons, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the nethermoſt Boſs; all ſupporting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40876:16"/>
the whole <hi>Paſchal;</hi> and the four quarters have been four Chryſtal ſtones, &amp; in the four ſmall Dragons fore-heads four Chryſtal ſtones; as by the holes do appear. And on every ſide of the four Dragons there is curious Antick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; as Beaſts, and Men upon Horſes backs, with Bucklers, Bows, Shafts, and Knots, with broad leaves ſpread upon the knots, very finely wrought; all being of moſt fine, and curious Candleſtick-metal, or Latten-metal, gliſtering as the gold it ſelf, having ſix Candleſticks for flowers, of Candleſtick-metal, coming from it, three on either ſide; whereon did ſtand, in every of the ſaid flowers, or Candleſticks, a Taper of wax. And on the height of the ſaid Candleſticks, or <hi>Paſchal</hi> of Latten, was a fair large flower, being the principal flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which was the ſeventh Candleſtick. The <hi>Paſchal,</hi> in Latitude, did contain almoſt the breadth of the Quire; in Longitude, it did extend to the height of the lower Vault, whereon did ſtand a long piece of wood, reaching within a mans length to the upper Vault, or Roof of the Church; whereon did ſtand a great long ſquared Taper of wax, called the <hi>Paſchal;</hi> having a fine conveyance through the Roof of the Church to light the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40876:16"/>
Taper withal. In concluſion, the <hi>Paſchal</hi> was eſteemed to be one of the rareſt Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all <hi>England.</hi>

               <head>An Ancient Memorial, Collected forth of the beſt Antiquaries, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Battel of <hi>Durham,</hi> in <hi>John Foſſer's</hi> time.</head>
               <p>In the Night before the Battel of <hi>Durham</hi> strucken and begun the ſeventeenth day of <hi>October, Anno Dom.</hi> 1346. There did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>John Foſſer,</hi> then Prior of the Abbey at <hi>Durham,</hi> a Viſion commanding him to take the Holy <hi>Corporax-</hi>cloath, which was within the <hi>Corporax,</hi> where with St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> did cover the Chalice, when he uſed to ſay Maſs, and to put the ſame holy Relique like unto a Banner-cloath upon a Spear point, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40876:25"/>
on the Morning after to go and repair to a place on the Weſt part of the City of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> called the <hi>Red-Hills,</hi> and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and abide till the end of the ſaid Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. To which Viſion the Prior obeying, and taking the ſame for a Revelation of Gods grace and mercy, by the Mediation of Holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> did accordingly early the next Morning, together with the Monks of the ſaid Abbey, repair to the ſaid place, called <hi>Red-Hills,</hi> there moſt devoutly humbling, and proſtrating themſelves in Prayer, for the Victory in the ſaid Battel; a great number, and multitude of <hi>Scots</hi> running, and paſſing by them, with intention to have ſpoiled them, yet they had no power, or ſufferance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any violence and force to ſuch Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo occupied in Prayers, being protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and defended by the mighty providence of Almighty God, and by the Mediation of Holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> and the preſence of the ſaid Holy Relique. And after many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and warlike exploits there had, and done betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> and his Company, the ſaid Battel ended, and the Victory was obtained, to the great overthrow, and confuſion of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40876:25"/>
                  <hi>Scots,</hi> their Enemies. And when the ſaid Prior, and Monks, accompany'd with <hi>Ralph,</hi> Lord <hi>Nevil,</hi> and <hi>John Nevil,</hi> his Son, the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> and many other Nobles of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> returned home, and went to the Abbey-Church, there joyning in hearty prayer, and thankſgiving to God, and holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> for the Conqueſt, and Victory atchieved that day; a Holy Croſs, which had been taken out of the Holy-Rood-Houſe in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by King <hi>David Bruce,</hi> was won, and taken upon the ſaid King of <hi>Scots,</hi> at the ſaid Battel. Which Croſs, by moſt Ancient, and credible Writers, is Recorded to have come to the ſaid King moſt miraculouſly; and to have happened, and chanced into his hand; being Hunting the Wild Hart in a Forreſt, nigh <hi>Edinborough,</hi> upon <hi>Holy-Rood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> commonly called, <hi>The Exaltation of the Holy Croſs;</hi> the ſaid King ſeparated, and parted from his Nobles, and Company, ſuddenly there appeared unto him, as it ſeemed, a moſt fair Hart, running towards him, in a full, and ſpeedy Courſe; which ſo affrighted the King's Horſe, that he violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſed away; whom the Hart ſo fiercely, and ſwiftly follow'd, that he bare forcibly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40876:26"/>
both the King, and his Horſe to the ground. He being much diſmay'd thereat, did caſt back his hands betwixt the tynes of the ſaid Hart, to ſtay himſelf; and then, and there, the ſaid Croſs moſt ſtrangely, and moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly ſlipped into the King's Hands; at the view whereof the Hart immediately vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, and was never ſeen after, no man knowing certainly what metal, or wood the ſaid Croſs was made of. In the place where that Miracle was ſo wrought doth now ſpring a Fountain, called the <hi>Rood-Well.</hi> And the next night after that the ſaid Croſs ſo bechanced unto him, the ſaid King was charged, and warned in his ſleep, by a Viſion, to build an Abbey in the ſame place; which he moſt diligently obſerved, as a true Meſſage from Almighty God; and ſo did ſend for Work-men into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> who at their coming were retained, and did erect, and build the ſaid Abbey accordingly; which the King cauſed to be Furniſhed with Canons Regular, and Dedicated the ſame in honour of the Croſs, and placed the ſaid Croſs moſt ſumptuouſly, and richly in the ſaid Abbey, there to remain as a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Monument. And it ſo there remained,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40876:26"/>
till the ſaid King, the night before he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him forward to the ſaid Battel, was in a Dream admoniſhed, that in any wiſe he ſhould not attempt to ſpoil, or violate the Church Goods of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> or any thing that appertained unto that Holy Saint; which for that he moſt contemptuouſly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly did diſdain, and contemn, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and deſtroying, ſo much as he could, the ſaid Goods and Lands belonging to St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> he was not only puniſhed by God Almighty by his own Captivity, being taken at the ſame Battel, in the Field, and therein ſore wounded, having firſt valiantly fought; but there were alſo taken with him four Earls, two Lords, the Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> one other Biſhop, one Knight, with many others; and in the ſame Battel were ſlain ſeven Earls of <hi>Scotland,</hi> beſides many Lords, and <hi>Scoth-men,</hi> to the number of, one and other, fifteen thouſand; as alſo by the loſs of the ſaid Croſs, which was taken upon him, and many other moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Jewels, and Monuments, which were brought from <hi>Scotland;</hi> as his own Banner, and other Noble-mens Ancients, all which were offer'd up at the Shrine of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40876:27"/>
for the beautifying, and adorning thereof, together with the Black Rood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo termed, with <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> made of ſilver; being, as it were, ſmoaked all over; which was placed, and ſet up moſt exactly in the Pillar next St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Shrine, in the South Alley of the ſaid Abbey. And ſhortly after that, the ſaid Prior cauſed a goodly, and ſumptuous Banner to be made with pipes of ſilver, to be put on a ſtaff, being five yards long, with a device to take off and on the ſaid Pipes at pleaſure, and to be kept in a Cheſt in the Feretory, when they were taken down; which Banner was ſhew'd, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the ſaid Abbey on Feſtival, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal dayes. On the height of the over-moſt Pipes was a fair pretty Croſs, of ſilver, and a wand of ſilver, having a fine wrought knob of ſilver at either end, that went under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Banner-cloath, whereunto the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-cloath was faſtened, and tyed; which wand was of the thickneſs of a man's finger, and at either end of the ſaid wand there was a fine ſilver Bell. The wand was faſten'd by the middle to the Banner-ſtaff, hard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs; the Banner-cloath was a yard broad, and five quarters deep; and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40876:27"/>
nether part of it was indented in five parts, and fring'd, and made faſt all about with red ſilk, and gold. And alſo the ſaid Banner-cloath was made of red Velvet, on both ſides moſt ſumptuouſly embroider'd, and wrought with flowers of green ſilk and gold; and in the midſt of the ſaid Banner-cloath was the ſaid holy Relique, and <hi>Corporax-</hi>cloath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, and placed therein; which <hi>Corporax-</hi>cloath was covered over with white Velvet, half a yard ſquare every way, having a red Croſs, of red Velvet, on both ſides over the ſame holy Relique, moſt artificially, and cunningly compiled, and framed, being fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fringed about the skirts and edges with fringe of red ſilk, and gold, and three little fine ſilver Bells faſten'd to the skirts of the ſaid Banner-cloath, like unto ſacring-Bells; and being ſo ſumptuouſly finiſhed, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfected, was dedicated to holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> to the intent, and purpoſe, that the ſame ſhould be preſented, and carried alwayes after to any Battel, as occaſion ſhould ſerve; and which was never carried, or ſhew'd at any Battel, but, by the eſpecial grace of God Almighty, and the Mediation of holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> it brought home the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40876:28"/>
Victory. Which Banner-cloath, after the diſſolution of the Abbey, fell into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of one <hi>Dean whittingham;</hi> whoſe Wife, called <hi>Catharine,</hi> being a <hi>French-</hi>woman, as is moſt credibly reported by thoſe who were eye-witneſſes, did moſt injuriouſly burn, and conſume the ſame in her fire; to the notable contempt, and diſgrace of all Ancient, and godly Reliques.</p>
               <p>Further on the Weſt ſide of the City of <hi>Durham,</hi> there was a moſt notable, famous, and goodly large Croſs, of Stone-work, erected, and ſet up, to the honour of God, and for the Victory had, ſhortly after the Battel of <hi>Durham,</hi> in the ſame place where the Battel was fought; called, and known by the name of <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Croſs, as having been ſet up at the coſt and charges of the ſaid Lord <hi>Ralph Nevell,</hi> being one of the moſt excellent, and chief perſons in the ſaid Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and Field. Which Croſs had ſeven ſteps about every way ſquare to the Sockets, that the ſtalk of the Croſs did ſtand in; which Socket was made faſt to a four-ſquare broad ſtone, being the ſole, or bottom-ſtone, of a large thickneſs, that the Socket did ſtand upon, which is a yard and an half ſquare about every
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40876:28"/>
way; which ſtone was one of the ſteps, and the eighth in number. Alſo the ſaid Socket was made faſt with Iron and Lead to the ſaid ſole-ſtone in every ſide of the ſaid corner of the Socket-ſtone, which was three quarters deep, and a yard and a quarter ſquare about every way, and the ſtalk of the Croſs going upward, containing in length three yards and a half up to the Boſs, being eight-ſquare about, all of one piece of ſtone, from the Socket that it did ſtand on, to the Boſs above, into the which Boſs the ſaid ſtalk was deeply ſoldered with Lead, and Solder. In the midſt of the ſtalk, in every ſecond ſquare, was the <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Croſs, in a Scutcheon, being the Lord <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Arms, very finely cut out, and wrought, in that ſaid ſtalk of ſtone. Alſo the nether end of the ſtalk was ſolder'd deep in the hole of the ſaid Socket that it did ſtand in with Lead, and Solder; and at every of the four corners of the ſaid Socket below, was one of the Pictures of the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> very finely ſet forth, and carved in ſtone, Maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. And on the height of the ſaid ſtalk did ſtand a moſt large fine Poſs, of ſtone, being eight-ſquare, round about finely cut
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40876:29"/>
out, and bordered, and marvellous curiouſly wrought; and in every ſquare of the nether ſide of the Boſs, in the Maſon's work, was the <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Croſs in a Scutcheon, in one ſquare, and the Bull's Head, having no Scutcheon, in another ſquare; and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in every ſquare after the ſame ſort round about the Boſs. And on the height of the ſaid Boſs, having a ſtalk of ſtone (being a Croſs ſtanding a little higher than the reſt) which was ſolder'd deeply with Lead, and Solder, into the hole of the ſaid Boſs above, whereon was finely cut out, and Pictur'd on both ſides of the ſtalk of the ſaid Croſs, the Picture of our Saviour Chriſt Crucified, with his Arms ſtretch'd abroad, his Hands nayl'd to the Croſs, and his Feet nayl'd to the ſtalk of the ſame Croſs below, almoſt a quarter of a yard from above the Boſs, with the Picture of our Lady, the B. Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> on the one ſide of him, and the Picture of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Evangeliſt, on the other ſide, moſt pitifully lamenting, and beholding his Torments, and cruel Death, ſtanding both on the height of the ſaid Boſs. All which Pictures were very artificially, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought all together, and finely carved
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40876:29"/>
out of one whole entire ſtone, ſome part thereof through carved work, both on the Eaſt ſide, and the Weſt ſide of the ſaid Croſs, with a Cover of ſtone likewiſe over the head, being all moſt finely, and curiouſly wrought together out of the ſaid hollow ſtone; which Cover of ſtone was cover'd over very finely with Lead. And alſo in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and remembrance of the ſaid Battel of <hi>Durham,</hi> and to the perpetual memory, and honour of the ſaid Lord <hi>Nevell,</hi> and his Poſterity for ever, it was termed by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Name of <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Croſs, as is above-ſaid; and ſo did ſtand, and remain moſt notorious to all Paſſengers, till of late, in the year of our Lord God, 1639. in the night time, the ſame was broken down, and defaced by ſome lewd, and contemptuous wicked perſons, thereto encouraged (as it ſeemed) by ſome who loved Chriſt the worſe for the Croſs ſake, as utterly, and ſpightfully deſpiſing all Ancient Ceremonies, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</p>
               <p>And further in the ſaid place, called the <hi>Red Hills,</hi> lying on the North ſide of the ſaid <hi>Nevell</hi>'s Croſs, a little diſtant from a piece of ground, called the <hi>Flaſe,</hi> above a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40876:30"/>
Cloſe lying hard by the <hi>North-Chilton</hi> Pool, and on the North-ſide of the hedge, where the <hi>Mayd-Bower</hi> had wont to be, where the ſaid Prior and Monks ſtanding, and making their prayer to God with the Holy Relique of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> during the time of the ſaid Battel, and after the ſaid Battel finiſhed, and Victory atchieved, there was erected, and ſet up by the ſaid Prior and Monks, a fair Croſs of wood, in the ſame place, where they ſtanding with the holy Relique, made their prayers, in token, and remembrance of the holy Relique of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> which they carried to the Battel. Which being a fair Croſs of wood, finely wrought, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, and of height two yards, which there long ſtood, and continued, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of many now living, the ſaid Prior and Monks ever after, in memory of the ſaid holy Relique, after the ſaid Victory atchieved, did in times of Recreation, as they went, and came to and fro <hi>Beau Park,</hi> to the Monaſtery, and Abbey of <hi>Durham,</hi> make their humble, and ſolemn prayers to God, and holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> at the foot of the ſaid Croſs, in perpetual praiſe, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for the ſaid Victory, and recovery of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40876:30"/>
the ſaid Battel; till it was now of late, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe thirty five years, ſuddenly defaced, and thrown down by ſome lewd, and ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perſons, who deſpiſed Antiquities, and Worthineſs of Monuments, after the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Abbey. And the Collection of this Memorial Antiquity was in the year of our Lord God, 1593.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Foſſer</hi> was the firſt Prior that ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be buried within the Abbey-Church, out of the <hi>Centry-Garth.</hi> He was buried in the North-plage before the Altar of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and St. <hi>Giles,</hi> being the laſt of the three Altars in the North-plage, towards the North; over whom was laid a curious, and ſumptuous Marble ſtone, which he prepared in his Life time, with his own Image, and other Imagery work engraven in Braſs upon it, with the Pictures of the twelve Apoſtles in Braſs, divided, and bordered on either ſide of him, with three other Pictures in Braſs.</p>

which was ſung every Friday at night, throughout the whole year, by the Maſters of the Quiriſters, and Deacons of the ſaid Church; and when it was done, the Quiriſters did ſing another Antheme by themſelves, ſitting on their knees all the time that their Antheme was ſinging, before the ſaid <hi>Jeſus-</hi>Altar; which was very devoutly ſung every Friday night, by the knelling of one of the <hi>Galilee</hi> Bells.</p>

               <p>Bleſſed St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> for a long time, led a moſt ſolitary Life, in the Borders of the <hi>Picts,</hi> at which place great concourſe of people daily uſed to viſit him, and from whom, by the providence and grace of God, never any returned without great comfort. This cauſed both young and old to reſort unto him, taking great pleaſure both to ſee him, and hear him ſpeak. In the mean time, it chanced that the King's Daughter of that Province was got with Child by ſome young man in her Father's houſe. Her belly ſwelling, and the King perceiving it, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examined her who was the Author of that fact. Upon examination, ſhe made this anſwer, <q>That ſolitary young man, who dwelleth hereby, is he who hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me, and with whoſe beauty I am thus deceived.</q> Whereupon the King, furiouſly enraged, preſently repaired, with his defloured Daughter, accompani'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Knights, unto the ſolitary place, where he preſently ſpake to the Servant of God in this manner. <q>What, art thou he, who,

under the colour of Religion, prophaneſt the Temple and Sanctuary of God? Art thou he, who, under the title and profeſſion of a ſolitary Life, exerciſeſt all filthineſs of the World in Inceſt? Behold, here is my Daughter, whom thou by thy deceits haſt corrupted, not fearing to make her diſhoneſt. Therefore now at laſt openly confeſs this thy fault, and plainly declare here before this company, in what ſort thou haſt ſeduced her.</q> The King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marking the fierce ſpeeches of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more impudently ſtepped forth, and boldly affirmed, that it was he who had done that wicked fact. At which thing the young man greatly amazed, perceiving that this forgery proceeded from the inſtigation of the Devil, thereupon, though brought into great perplexity, applied his whole Heart unto Almighty God, and ſaid as followeth. <q>My Lord, my God, who only knoweſt all things, and art the ſearcher of all ſecrets, make manifeſt alſo this work of iniquity and indignity, and by ſome example ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove-the ſame, which, though it cannot be done by Humane policy, make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by ſome divine Oracle.</q> When as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40876:37"/>
the young man with great lamentations, and tears, incredible to be reported, had ſpoken theſe words, even ſuddenly, in the ſelf-ſame place where the King's Daughter ſtood, the Earth (making a hiſſing noiſe) preſently opened, and ſwallow'd her up in the preſence of all the beholders.

As ſoon as the King perceived this marvellous chance to happen in the preſence of all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he began to be greatly tormented in his mind, fearing leſt he himſelf ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr the like puniſhment.

And likewiſe the North-Rood-door, which was on the hither-ſide of the Pillar, at the North-end of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Altar, was never opened, but when there was ſome Proceſſion.</p>
               <p>There were two fair Holy-water Stones

               <p>There was betwixt two Pillars on the left hand, in the North-Alley, as you turn into the <hi>Galilee,</hi> from the North-Church-door, our Lady of <hi>Pitty</hi>'s Altar, being incloſed on either ſide with fine Wainſcot, with the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of our Lady carrying our Saviour on her Knee, as he was taken from the Croſs; very lamentable to behold.</p>
               <p>Then on the right hand of the ſaid North-Alley, as you go into the <hi>Galilee,</hi> under the Bellfry, called the <hi>Galilee-</hi>Steeple, was St. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Altar; the North-end of the ſaid Altar-ſtone being wrought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed into the pillar of the Wall, from the firſt Foundation of the Church, for Maſs to be ſaid at, as appeared at the Defacing thereof, and remaineth there to be known till this Day, by a Corner of the ſaid Altar-ſtone, not to be pull'd forth, but by breaking of the wall. In the Weſt-end of the Church, in the North-Alley-end, over the <hi>Galilee-</hi>door, there in a Bellfry, called the <hi>Galilee-</hi>ſteeple, did hang four goodly great Bells, which were never Rung, but on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Feaſts, or at ſuch other times as the

There were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Officers pertaining to the ſaid Houſe, who were always charged, whenſoever the ſaid Bells were Knelled, to be ready for the Ringing of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Two men of the Kitchin were charged with the Ringing of one Bell, and four men of the Church, that did lye always in the Church, were charged with the third Bell, and ſix others were charged with the Ringing of the great Bell, <hi>viz.</hi> Two of the Bake-houſe, two of the Brew-houſe, and two of the Kiln.

               <p>On the North-ſide of the ſaid <hi>Galilee</hi> was an Altar called the Lady of <hi>Pitty</hi>'s Altar, with her Picture carrying our Saviour on her knee as he was taken from the Croſs; a very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous aſpect.

At which time the Corps was convey'd to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe, where the Prior, and the whole Convent met it, and there did ſay their Dirge, and Devotion; it not being permitted that any ſhould come near the Chapter-houſe, during the time of their Devotion, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his Soul. And after their Devotion, the dead Corps was carried by the Monks from the Chapter-houſe, through the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, (a place for Merchants to utter their

The accuſtomed burial of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in thoſe times was, that they ſhould be interr'd with the Habit they were wont to ſay Maſs in, with their Albes, Stoles, and Phannels, and their other Veſtments, with Mitres on their Heads, and their croſier-ſtaffs in their hands, and ſo laid in their Coffins, with a little Chalice of ſilver, other metal, or Wax; which Wax-cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was gilt very finely about the edge, and

               <p>The Prior, and Monks, had the Horſes, Chariot, and all other things which came with the deceas'd Biſhop, being due to them by their Ancient cuſtome; as more plainly doth appear in the Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Durham;</hi> alias <hi>Dunhelme,</hi> at large.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40876:56"/>
Charnell-houſe to caſt dead mens bones in?</p>
               <p>There were alſo divers Gentlemen of good Worſhip buried in the ſaid <hi>Centory-garth,</hi> out of a deſire that they might be buried nigh unto that holy man, St. <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> And amongſt the reſt there was one Gentleman of good Worſhip, called Mr. <hi>Racket,</hi> (who was buried in the ſaid <hi>Centory-garth,</hi> near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nine Altars-door, over againſt the Shrine of the holy man, St. <hi>Cuthbert)</hi> who had a fair Tomb over him, and a fair white Marble ſtone above the ſaid Tomb, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was wrought very curiouſly the Picture of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Racket,</hi> all in Braſs, in his Coat-Armour, with his Sword girt about him, and at every corner of the ſaid Marble ſtone was one of the four Evangeliſts, all in Braſs likewiſe.</p>

               <p>Alſo in the ſame place all the Priors and Monks were buried in Ancient time. All the Priors had every one a fair Through-ſtone
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40876:56"/>
laid upon their Tombs, or graves; ſome of Marble, ſome of Free-ſtone. Which ſtones Dean <hi>Whittingham</hi> cauſed to be pull'd, and taken away; and did alſo break, and deface all ſuch ſtones as had any Pictures of Braſs, or other Imagery-work, or Chalice wrought, and engraven upon them; and the reſidue he took away, and employ'd them to his own uſe, and did make a waſhing-houſe of them at the end of the <hi>Centory-garth;</hi> ſo that it cannot be diſcerned at preſent that ever any were buried in the ſaid <hi>Centory-garth,</hi> it is ſo plain, and ſtrait: for he could not abide any Ancient Monuments, nor any thing that appertained to a goodly Religiouſneſs, or Monaſtical Life.</p>
               <p>Within the ſaid Abbey-Church of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were two Holy-water-ſtones, of fine Marble, very artificially made, and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and boſs'd with hollow boſſes, upon the outer-ſides of the ſtones, very curiouſly wrought. They were both of the ſame work, but one much greater than the other; and they were both taken away by Dean <hi>Whittingham,</hi> and carried into his Kitchin, and employ'd to profane uſes, and there ſtood during his Life; and his people ſteeped
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40876:57"/>
their Beef, and Salt-fiſh in them, having a conveyance in the bottoms of them to let forth the Water, as they had when they were in the Church. And after his death, the greater of the two Holy-water-ſtones was removed to the lower end of the Dean's Buttery, where the water-Conduit is ſet, and next unto the Wine-Cellar, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Servants might waſh and make clean their Pots, and Cups, before they ſerve at the Table. The foot of the ſaid Holy-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtone was laid without the Church door, and was afterwards plac'd in the ground in one <hi>Lamb</hi>'s Shop, a Black-ſmith, upon <hi>Framwell-gate-</hi>bridge-end, and is now there to be ſeen. Moreover, Mrs. <hi>Whittingham,</hi> after the death of her Huband, took away the leſſer Holy-water-ſtone out of the Dean's Kitchin, and brought it into her Houſe in the <hi>North-Baily,</hi> over againſt the Dean's Orchard, at the Eaſt-end of the Church, and ſet it in their Kitchin. And ſhe alſo carried away divers Grave-ſtones, of blew Marble, and other Through-ſtones that lay upon the Priors, and Monks, out of the <hi>Centory-garth,</hi> when ſhe built her houſe in the <hi>Baily</hi> with ſtones. Some of them are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40876:57"/>
laid in the threſholds of the doors, and two great ones did lie without the doors, over againſt the Wall, before the Frontſteed; for which Fact ſhe was complained upon; and ſo ſhe laid thoſe ſtones without the door, which before were made well faſt within her Houſe. Thus were the godly things, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for God's Service in the Church, converted to prophane uſes.</p>
               <p>There was in the <hi>Centry-garth,</hi> under the South-end of the Church, called the South-end of the Nine Altars, betwixt two Pillars, adjoyning to the Nine Altars door, a Song-School, built for ſix Children to be learnt to ſing, for the maintenance of Gods Divine Service in the Abbey-Church; which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had their meat and drink at the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge amongſt the Children of the Ambrie. The ſaid School was built time out of mind before the ſuppreſſion of the Houſe, and was neatly boarded within round about, a man's height above the Walls, and a long Desk from one end of the School to the other, to lay their Books upon; and all the floor was boarded for warmneſs, and long Forms about it ſet faſt for the Children to ſit on. And the place where the Maſter did ſit and teach, was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40876:58"/>
all cloſe boarded, both behind, and on either ſide. And the ſaid Maſter was to teach thoſe ſix Children to ſing, and to play on the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans every principal day, when the Monks did ſing their high Maſs, and at Even-ſong. And the ſaid Maſter was bound to play on the Organs every principal day, when the Monks did ſing their high Maſs, and likewiſe at Even-ſong; but the Monks, when they were at Mattins, and Service at Mid-night, then one of the ſaid Monks did play on the Organs; ſo that the Maſter play'd only upon principal dayes, in the high Maſs time, and at Even-ſong, as aforeſaid. Alſo the ſaid Maſter had his Chamber adjoyning to the ſaid School, where he lodg'd, having his meat and drink in the Prior's Hall, among the Prior's Gentlemen, and all his other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries were found at the charge of the Prior, and the Houſe, till ſuch time as the Houſe was ſuppreſs'd. And ſhortly after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no teaching in that School any longer, but in another place, or School appointed for that purpoſe, the aforeſaid School in the <hi>Centry-garth</hi> fell to decay, and was pull'd down, ſo clearly, that one cannot tell almoſt in what place it ſtood.</p>

               <head>Of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Death, and the Tranſlation of his body to <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The 20. of the Calends of <hi>March,</hi> in the year of Chriſt, 587. St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> ended his Life, and was buried in <hi>Holy Iſland</hi> (where he was Biſhop three years) in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church by the Altar, on the Eaſt-ſide, in a Grave of ſtone purpoſely made for him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus buried in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Holy Iſland,</hi> and having lain there for the ſpace of eleven years, he was taken out of the ground the 20. of the Calends of <hi>March,</hi> in the ſame Calends he had dyed in, entire; lying like a man aſleep, being found ſafe, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, flexible, and leath-wake, and all his Maſs-cloaths ſafe, and freſh, as they were the firſt hour they were put on him; at which time they enſhrined him in a new Sepulchre, or Feretory, a little above the pavement of the Church, and there he ſtood many a day. ſhe is ſaid to be deſcended from the Blood-Royal of the Kings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being Son of one <hi>Muriardach,</hi> and <hi>Sabina</hi> his Wife, who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40876:59"/>
was Daughter to a King there. He was brought up in the Abbey of <hi>Mailroſe;</hi> firſt, under (his Predeceſſor) <hi>Eata,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under <hi>Boiſil,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Eata.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Boiſil,</hi> he was made Abbot of that Monaſtery, which he govern'd with great care and ſincerity. He was Anchorite thirteen years. He was Monk thirty ſeven years, and Abbot fourteen years. Alſo in the year 55. <hi>Eardulf</hi> was Biſhop, at which time certain <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> Infidels of ſundry other Nations, invaded, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Realm of <hi>England</hi> in divers places. And after a certain ſpace, <hi>Halden,</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> with a great part of the Navy, and Army of the Infidels, arrived in <hi>Tinmouth-</hi>Haven, intending to ſojourn there all the Winter following; and the next Spring he meant, with all his power, to invade, ſpoil, and deſtroy the County of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Whereof when <hi>Eardulf,</hi> the Biſhop, had intelligence, with all his Clergy and people, after long conſultation had amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what courſe was to be taken in that extremity, to prevent the barbarous cruelty of the Savage, and mercileſs Infidels, they, in the end, called to mind the words, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40876:59"/>
monition deliver'd by St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> to his Brethren. The ſaid Holy man, before his departure out of this Life, amongſt other wholſom counſels, and godly admonitions, then delivered, uttered theſe, or the like words. <q>If you, my Brethren, ſhall be at any time hereafter, urged, or conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto one of the two extremitics follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do much rather chooſe, and wiſh, that you ſhould take my Bones up, and flye from thoſe places, and take your place of abode, and ſtay whereſoever Almighty God ſhall provide for you, then that you ſhould by any means ſubmit your ſelves to the yoak, and ſervitude of wicked Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</q> Which words he then ſpake by the ſpirit of Propheſie, foreſeeing the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of the time to come.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Eardulf,</hi> and Abbot <hi>Edred</hi> did take, and carry away the Body of St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> from <hi>Holy Iſland</hi> Southward, and fled ſeven years from Town to Town, by reaſon of the great Perſecution, and ſlaughter of the <hi>Painims,</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> And when the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Iſland ſaw that St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Body was gone, they left their Lands, and Goods, and followed after him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40876:60"/>
the Biſhop, the Abbot, and the reſt, being wearied with Travelling, thought to have ſtollen away, and carried St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Body into <hi>Ireland</hi> for its better ſafety. Being upon the Sea in a Ship, three Waves were miraculouſly turned into blood, and the Ship was driven back by tempeſt, and forc'd upon the ſhore. Nay, the ſaid Ship wherein they were, by the greatneſs of the Storm, and the rage of the Waves, was turned on the one ſide; and the Book of the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts fell out of the Ship into the bottom of the Sea. The ſaid Book was moſt curiouſly written, and all adorned with gold, and precious ſtones on the out-ſide. Now, while they were all troubled, and in great perplexity for the loſs of the ſaid Book, St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> being loath to ſee his honourers in ſuch ſorrow, did appear in a Viſion to one <hi>Hundredus,</hi> a Monk, and commanded him that they ſhould diligently ſeek for the Book upon the Coaſts thereabouts; where they did find it three miles from the Sea-ſhore, caſt (as it ſeemed) by the force of ſome Wave, and carried thither by the violence of ſome happy gale of Wind, or by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. They found the book much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40876:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more beautiful than before, both in Letters, and Leaves; and excelling in the outer beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs of the cover, being nothing blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſalt water, but poliſhed rather by ſome Heavenly hand; which did not a little increaſe their joy. But being wearied with ſeeking the book, and with carrying about St. <hi>Cllthbert</hi>'s body, he preſented to their eyes a Bridle hanging up in a Tree, and a red Horſe running towards them, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be Bridled, to eaſe their pains in carrying the Cheſt, wherein St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s body was lay'd. Upon which Horſe they carried him to <hi>Crake-Minſter,</hi> and reſted them four Moneths; from thence they brought him to <hi>Cuneageſter,</hi> (now called <hi>Cheſter) Anno Domini,</hi> 1387. and there they remained with the body of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> 93. years, during the reſt of the time of the <hi>Danes</hi> Wars; at the end whereof <hi>Aldwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Biſhop fled with St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s body to <hi>Rippon,</hi> to lye by the body of holy St. <hi>Wilfrid.</hi> But four Moneths after their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Rippon,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> Wars did ceaſe; and then intending to bring him back again to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and coming with him on the Eaſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40876:61"/>
ſide of <hi>Durham,</hi> to a place called <hi>Wardlaw,</hi> they could not with all their force remove his body from thence, which ſeemed to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd to the ground, for that the Chariot wherein the holy Corps was carried miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſtood unmoveable, either by the ſtrength of man, or beaſt. Which ſtrange, and unexpected accident wrought great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in the hearts of the Biſhop, the Monks, and their Aſſociates. Whereupon the Biſhop faſted three dayes, and pray'd to God with great reverence, and devotion, to know from God by Revelation what to do with him. Which was accordingly granted them, it being revealed unto <hi>Eadmer,</hi> a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, that he ſhould be carried to <hi>Dunholme,</hi> which is compoſed of the two <hi>Saxon</hi> words, <hi>Dun,</hi> ſignifying a Hill, and <hi>Holme,</hi> an Iſland in a River, and there he ſhould be received into a place of Reſt. But being again diſtreſſed, becauſe they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant where <hi>Dunholme</hi> was, as they were going, a Woman, that lacked her Cow, did call aloud to her Companion, to know if ſhe had not ſeen her Cow; who anſwer'd with a loud voice, that her Cow was in <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,</hi> (a happy, and Heavenly eccho to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40876:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſtreſſed Monks, who by that means had intelligence that they were near their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end) where they ſhould find a reſting place for the Body of the Saint. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with great joy and gladneſs, they brought his Body to <hi>Dunholme,</hi> in the year 1499. which was <hi>inculta tellus,</hi> a barbarous, and rude place, repleniſhed with nothing but Thorns, and thick Woods, ſave only in the midſt, where the Church now ſtandeth, which was plain and commodious for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Where they firſt built a little Church of Wands and Branches, wherein they did lay his Body (whence the ſaid Church was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Bough-Church)</hi> till they had built a more ſumptuous Church, wherein they might inſhrine him, which they aſſayed to do with all their power; <hi>Uthred,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> aiding them, and cauſing all the Countrey people to cut down all the wood, and thorn-buſhes which did moleſt them, and ſo made all the place where the City now ſtands habitable, and fit to erect Buildings upon; which gave great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to <hi>Aldwinus</hi> the Biſhop, to haſten the finiſhing of the Church. Which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly being done, he tranſlated the Body
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40876:62"/>
of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> from the wanded, or Bough-Church, to the <hi>White-Chappel</hi> (for ſo it was called) which he had newly built, which was a part of the great Church, not yet finiſhed, where it lay four years. But after the great Church was finiſhed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, upon the 20. of <hi>September,</hi> he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated his Body out of the <hi>White-Chappel</hi> into the great Church, which he made a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, erecting his Biſhop's ſeat at <hi>Durham</hi> (where it ſtill remaineth) about 353. years after it was firſt Founded in the <hi>Holy-Iſland,</hi> by St. <hi>Aidan,</hi> and St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> which was <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 637. and 306. years after the death of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> which was in the year 684. Biſhop <hi>Aldwinus</hi> died thirty years after he had Founded his Biſhop's See at <hi>Durham,</hi> in finiſhed his Cathedral Church in the year 1020. Which Church was famous for the Succeſſion of ſix Biſhops in it; <hi>viz. Eadmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Eadredus, Egelrir, Egelwin, Waltherus</hi> (whom <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> created Earl of <hi>Northumberland)</hi> and <hi>William Carlipho,</hi> or <hi>Carilef</hi> that magnificent Prelate, who not being content with the ſmalneſs, and homli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Edifice which <hi>Aldwinus</hi> built, as being too little for ſo great a Saint, did pull
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40876:62"/>
it all down, 76. years after <hi>Alwinus</hi> had finiſh'd it, and inſtead thereof did erect the magnificent, and famous Structure, which is now to be ſeen. <hi>Malcolm,</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Turgot,</hi> then Prior of the Church, and the Biſhop himſelf lay'd the three firſt ſtones in the new Foundation, upon the 30. of <hi>July</hi> (as ſome ſay) or, on the 11. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> (as others affirm) in the year 1093. For which famous work, <hi>Anthony Beak</hi> (one of his Succeſſors) with a great ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney got him to be Canoniz'd. This Biſhop <hi>Carlipho</hi> cauſed the Monks to labour in the Holy work all the day long, excepting meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and times of Prayer, and Service; King <hi>Malcolm</hi> being the chief Benefactor in the Building thereof. The Biſhop before the people ordained, and appointed <hi>ſurgot,</hi> then Prior, to be his Arch-Deacon, and Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general within his Dioceſs; and going to <hi>Rome</hi> two years before his death, he obtained Licenſe of Popé <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Monks who were at <hi>Wermouth,</hi> and <hi>Jarrow,</hi> and were of the Order of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> to his Church at <hi>Durham,</hi> where he placed them in the room of the Canons, whom he expelled for their lewd and lazy lives. But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40876:63"/>
he did not live to ſee his Church finiſhed, for he dyed in the year 1095. two years after he had laid the Foundation. Then <hi>Ranulph Flambard,</hi> his immediate Succeſſor, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with all his might furthering ſo good a work, did in the 29. years that he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop build the ſaid Church from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation almoſt to the Covering. Yet was it not fully finiſhed till the time that <hi>Nicholas Farnam,</hi> or <hi>Fernham,</hi> was Biſhop, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Melſcome</hi> was Prior, which two good men did Arch it over, <hi>Anno, 1242. viz.</hi> in the 26. year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; and they lye both buried under one ſtone in the Chapter-houſe. But long before the Church was finiſhed, the Body of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was by the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Ranulph</hi> tranſlated again out of the Cloiſter-garth, where the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Carlipho</hi> had made him a very ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tomb to lye in, when he removed him out of the old Church which <hi>Aldwinus</hi> built for him, which was then taken down, that his fair Church, now extant, might be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame place where that old Church was. In which new Church was built a goodly, fair, and ſumptuous Shrine, called the Feretory, or Fereter, about three yards
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40876:63"/>
from the ground, on the back-ſide of the great, or high Altar, which was at the Eaſt-end of the Quire, where his Body was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly placed in an Iron Cheſt within the ſaid Shrine, and lay quietly without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the Suppreſſion of the Church, as is above related. And the ſaid Book of the four Evangeliſts, which fell into the Sea, and was ſo miraculouſly brought to Land, and found again, was laid on the High Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in the ſaid Monaſtical, and Abbey-Church of <hi>Durham,</hi> as a place moſt worthy, and a fit Monument to preſerve the memory of ſo great a Saint. And at the Weſt-end of the ſaid Church, <hi>Hugo,</hi> who was alſo called <hi>Pudeſay, Puſar,</hi> or <hi>de Puteaſo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Nephew, did build a very fair, and beautiful Chappel, which he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was called the <hi>Galilee,</hi> or our Lady's Chappel, but now ſimply called the <hi>Conſiſtory.</hi> And there in a ſilver casket gilt with gold, he laid the Bones of Venerable <hi>Bede;</hi> and erected a coſtly, and magnificent Shrine, of black Marble, over it, as is above declared. He alſo Founded the Priory of <hi>Finkley,</hi> in honour of St. <hi>Gordrick</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:40876:64"/>

                  <hi>William Carlipho,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took down the old Church, built by Biſhop <hi>Aldwinus,</hi> did prepare a fair, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Tomb, of Stone, in the <hi>Cloiſter-garth,</hi> a yard high from the ground, where St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was laid, until his Shrine was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in the new Church, that now is, over which Tomb was laid a great, fair, and comely broad Through-Marble ſtone.

               <p>There is alſo in the Cieling of the ſaid Cloiſter, over head, cut in Wainſcot, the Arms of certain Biſhops, and Noble-men, as alſo Knights, and other men of Worſhip, who had beſtowed any thing upon that Church.</p>
               <p>There was a goodly Ceremony uſed by the Prior, and Monks, every Thursday before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> called <hi>Maundy-Thursday.</hi> There were eighteen poor aged men appointed to come to the Cloiſter-Abbey that day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their feet clean waſhed, there to remain till ſuch time as the Prior, and whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent did come thither, at nine of the Clock, or thereabouts, the Aged men ſitting betwixt the Parlour-door and the Church-door upon a long Form, which ſtood alwayes in the Church, beyond the Reveſtry-door, and was brought only on <hi>Maundy-Thursday</hi> into
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40876:67"/>
the Cloiſter. The Prior and the Convent being come to the Cloiſter, after ſome pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſaid, one of the Prior's Servants brought a Baſin full of fair Water, and the Prior did waſh all the poor mens feet one after a nother, with his own hands, and dryed them with a Towell, and kiſſed their feet. Which done, he liberally beſtow'd thirty pence in money on every one of them, with ſeven Red Herrings a-piece, and did ſerve them himſelf with drink, three loaves of bread, and certain wafer-cakes. All which done, the Form was carried back into the Church, to the place whence it had been taken, that men might alſo ſit on it there, when they came to hear Divine Service; which Form is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining under the <hi>Te-Deum-Window,</hi> and the Clock.</p>
               <p>Alſo, as you go out of the Cloiſter through an Entry to the Deans Lodging, at the head of the ſtairs behind the door, called the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher-door,</hi> on the right hand behind the ſaid door, there is another door going into the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> wherein certain old written Books of Records, and Evidences of the Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal houſe of <hi>Durham</hi> did lye; as alſo a Copy of the Foundation of the Hoſpital of <hi>Greatham,</hi>

               <p>There was a famous Houſe of Hoſpitality, called the Gueſt-Hall, within the Abbey-garth of <hi>Durham,</hi> on the Weſt ſide towards the Water, the <hi>Terrer</hi> of the Houſe being Maſter thereof; as being appointed to give entertainment to all ſorts, Noble, Gentle, and of what Degree ſoever, that came thither as Strangers; their entertainment not being inferiour to any place in <hi>England,</hi> both for the goodneſs of their Diet, the Sweet, and dainty Furniture of their Lodging, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, all things neceſſary for Travellers. And with all this entertainment, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not any one to depart, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued of honeſt, and good behaviour. This Hall is a goodly brave place, like unto the body of a Church, ſupported on either ſide
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40876:76"/>
by very fair Pillars; and in the midſt of the Hall was a large Range for the fire. The Chambers, and Lodgings belonging to it were moſt ſweetly kept, and ſo richly Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that they were not unpleaſant to lye in; eſpecially one Chamber, called the <hi>King's Chamber,</hi> deſerving that name, in that a King might well have lain in it. The Victuals that ſerved the Gueſts came from the great Kitchin of the Prior, the Bread, and Beer from his Pantry, and Cellar. If they were of Honour, they were ſerved as Honourably as the Prior himſelf; otherwiſe, according to their ſeveral Qualities. The <hi>Terrer</hi> had certain men appointed to wait at his Table, and to attend upon all his Gueſts, and Strangers; and for their better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he had evermore a Hogſhead, or two, of Wines lying in a Cellar appertaining to the ſaid Hall.</p>
               <p>The Prior (whoſe Hoſpitality was ſuch as that there needed no Gueſt-Hall for the entertainment of thoſe that came to him) kept a moſt honourable, and noble Houſe, being attended by Gentlemen, and Yeomen, and the beſt of the Countrey, ſo great were the liberalities, and benevolences of his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40876:76"/>
Houſe-keeping, that conſtant Relief, and Alms were alwayes open, and free; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the poor of the City of <hi>Durham,</hi> but to all the poor people of the Countrey beſides.</p>
               <p>The Lord Prior had two Porters, one of his Hall-door, called <hi>Robert Smith;</hi> the other of the Uſher-door, as you go from the great Chamber to the Church, called <hi>Robert Clark;</hi> which two were the laſt Porters to the laſt Prior.</p>
               <p>There were certain Children, called the Children of the <hi>Almery,</hi> who only were brought up in Learning, and relieved with the Alms, and Benevolence of the whole Houſe; having their meat and Drink in a Loft on the North-ſide of the Abbey-Gates, before the Suppreſſion of the ſaid Houſe, or Abbey; which Loft had a long Porch over the Stair-head, ſlated over; and at either ſide of the ſaid Porch, or Entry, there was a ſtairs to go up to it, and a Stable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the ſaid Almery, or Loft, having a door, and an Entry into it under the Stair-head; which at the Suppreſſion of the Houſe became Mr. <hi>Stephen Morley</hi>'s Lodging. Not long after the Suppreſſion he alter'd it, and took down the Porch, and the two Greeces,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40876:77"/>
that went to the ſaid Almery, or Loft, and made his Kitchin where the Stable was, and his Buttery where the ſaid Almery, or Loft was above. And the ſaid Children went daily to School to the Farmary-School with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Abbey-Gates; which School was Founded by the Priors of the ſaid Abbey, and at the charges of the ſaid Houſe. The laſt School-Maſter was called St. <hi>Robert Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> who continued Maſter to the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Houſe, or Abbey. And the ſaid Maſter was bound to ſay Maſs twice in the Week at <hi>Magdalen's</hi> Chappel, nigh <hi>Keap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>year,</hi> and once in the week at a Chappel at <hi>Rimbleſnorth.</hi> And the meat and drink of the foreſaid Children was what the Maſter of the Novices, and the Monks had left, and reſerved; and it was carried in at a door ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the great Kitchin-window, into a little Vault at the Weſt-end of the <hi>Frater-Houſe,</hi> like unto a Pantry, called the <hi>Covey,</hi> and had a window within it, where one, or two of the Children did receive their meat and drink of the ſaid Clerk out of the ſaid <hi>Covey,</hi> or Pantry-window ſo called, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to the Almery, or Loft; which Clerk did wait upon them every meal, to ſee they kept good order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:40876:77"/>
There were four Aged Women, who liv'd in the <hi>Farmary,</hi> without the South-gate of the Abbey of <hi>Durham,</hi> every one having her ſeveral Chamber to lye in, being found and fed only with the Relief that came from the Prior's own Table.</p>
               <p>There was alſo in the <hi>Farmary</hi> a Chappel, where the School-Maſter of the <hi>Farmary</hi> (having his Chamber, and Scool above it) or ſome other Prieſt, for him, was appointed to ſay Maſs to the four Aged Women, every Holy-day, and Friday.</p>

And his Office was to go every night, as a privy-watch, before mid-night, and after mid-night, to every Monks Chamber-door, and to call upon him by his name, to ſee whether any were wanting, or ſtollen forth, to go about any kind of Vice, or naughtineſs. The Sub-Prior alſo ſate alwayes amongſt the Monks at meat, to ſee that every man did

uſe himſelf according to the Order he had taken him to. He alwayes ſaid Grace at Dinner, and Supper. And after five of the Clock at night, he was to ſee all the Doors lock'd; as the Cellar-door, the <hi>Frater-Houſe-</hi>door, the Fauden-gates, and the Cloiſter-doors, he kept the keyes of all the foreſaid doors all night, till ſix in the morning, and then return'd them to the Porters, others, who had them all the day.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>William Watſon,</hi> alias <hi>William Wylome,</hi> Maſter, and Keeper of the Feretory, and Vice-Prior. The Maſter of the Feretory's Chamber was in the Dorter, and he was Keeper of the Holy Shrine of St. <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> His Office was, when any man of Honour, or Worſhip, was diſpoſed to make their Prayers to God, or St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> or to Offer any thing to his Sacred Shrine, to have it drawn up, that they might ſee it. Then the Clerk of the Feretory (called <hi>George Bates)</hi> gave notice to his Maſter, the Vice-Prior, the Keeper of the Feretory, and then the ſaid Maſter brought the Keys of the Shrine with him, giving them to the Clerk, to open the Shrine. His Office was to ſtand by and ſee it drawn, commanding the ſaid Clerk to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40876:78"/>
draw it. It was alwayes drawn up in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins time, when the <hi>Magnificat</hi> was ſung, and when they made Prayers, and did offer any thing to it. If it were Gold, Silver, or Jewels, it was ſtraitway hung on the Shrine; and if it were any other thing, as an Unicorn's horn, Elephant's tooth, or ſuch like, it was hung within the Feretory, at the end of the Shrine. And when they had ended their Prayers the Clerk let down the cover there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and lock'd it at every corner, returning the Keyes to the Vice-Prior. The ſaid <hi>George Bates</hi> was Regiſter of the Houſe, and did all that pertained to the Regiſter's Office. Many goodly Reliques belonged to the ſaid Shrine.</p>
               <p>There belong'd alſo a Banner to the ſaid Shrine (in the keeping of the ſaid Vice-Prior) called St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Banner, five yards in length. All the pipes were of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to be ſliven on a long ſilver croſs-ſpear, on the over-moſt pipe. On the top of it was a little fine ſtaff, and a goodly Banner-cloath pertaining to it, and the midſt of the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-cloath was all of white Velvet, half a yard ſquare every way, and a fair Croſs of red Velvet over it; and within the ſaid white
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40876:79"/>
Velvet was the Holy Relique, the <hi>Corporax-</hi>cloath, that the Holy man, St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> did cover the Chalice withall when he ſaid Maſs; and the reſidue of the Banner-cloath was of red Velvet, embroider'd with gold and green ſilk. The ſaid Banner was, at the winning of <hi>Branfield,</hi> or <hi>Brankinfield</hi> Battel, in King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eight's time, and did bring home the King of <hi>Scot's</hi> Banner with it, and divers other of their Noblemen's Auncients of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that were loſt that day; which Banner, and Auncients, were ſet up at St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Feretory, where they all ſtood, and hung till the Suppreſſion of the Houſe. And at the Suppreſſion of the Houſe, the aforeſaid Banner of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> and all the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the Noblemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after clearly defaced, to the intent there ſhould be no memory of the ſaid Battel, and of their Auncients being ſpoiled, which were won at the ſaid Battel at <hi>Branfield,</hi> that there ſhould be no remembrance of them in the Monaſtical Church of <hi>Durham.</hi> And the ſaid Saint <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Banner was at many other places. Beſides, it was thought to be one of the goodlieſt Reliques of any in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and it was born only upon principal
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40876:79"/>
dayes, when there was a general Proceſſion; as on <hi>Eaſter-day, Aſcention-day, Whitſunday, Corpus-Chriſti-day,</hi> and St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s day, and ſome other Feſtival dayes. It was ſt up at the Eaſt-end of the Shrine, becauſe it was ſo weighty. Alſo, whenſoever it was born, it was the Clerk's Office to wait upon it with his Surplice on, with a fair red painted ſtaff, having a fork, or cleft at the upper end of the ſtaff, which cleft was lined with ſilk, and down under the ſilk (to prevent the hurting, or bruiſing of the pipes of the Banner, which were of ſilver) to take it down, and raiſe it up again, by reaſon of the weightineſs thereof.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a ſtrong girdle of white Leather worn by him who carried St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s Banner, when it was carried abroad, and it was made faſt to the ſaid Girdle by two pieces of white leather, and at either end of the two pieces of white leather a Socket of Horn was made faſt to them, that the end of the Banner-ſtaff might be put into it. For to eaſe him who carried the ſaid Banner of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> (becauſe it was ſo heavy) there were four men alwayes appointed to wait upon it, beſides the Clerk, and the perſon who bore it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:40876:80"/>
The Vice-Prior had the keyes, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine, which ſtood in the <hi>Galilee.</hi> And whenſoever there was any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proceſſion, he commanded his Clerk (giving him the keyes of St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine) to draw up the cover of it, and to take it down, and carry it into the Reveſtry. Thence it was carried by four Monks in time of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, every principal day; and when the Proceſſion was done, it was brought back into the <hi>Galilee,</hi> and the cover let down, the keyes being return'd by the Clerk to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Feretory.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Richard Croſſeby,</hi> Maſter of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. There were alwayes ſix Novices, who went daily to School within the Houſe, for the ſpace of ſeven years together; and one of the eldeſt Monks, that was learned, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be their Tutor. The ſaid Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had no wages, but meat, and drink, and cloathing for that ſpace. The Maſter, or Tutor's Office was to ſee that they lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; as Cowls, Frocks, Stamyne, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Boots, Socks; and when they did want any of theſe Neceſſaries, the Maſter had charge to call upon one of the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, for ſuch things, for they never received
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40876:80"/>
wages, nor handled any money in that ſpace, but went daily to their Books within the Cloiſter. And if the Maſter found any of them apt to learn, and that he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Book, and had a pregnant wit, he gave notice thereof to thé Prior. And ſome time after he was ſent to <hi>Oxford</hi> to School, and there he did learn, and ſtudy Divinity; and the reſidue of the Novices were kept at their Books, till they could underſtand their Service, and the Scriptures. Then at the ſeven years end they did ſing their firſt Maſs. The Houſe was no longer charged with find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Apparel, for then they entred into wages, to find themſelves Apparel, which wages was twenty ſhillings in the year. He had no more to find himſelf Apparel withal. The eldeſt Monk in the Houſe had no more, except he had an Office. His Chamber was in the <hi>Dorter.</hi>

All theſe things were to be call'd for at the Sexton's hands. His Office was alſo, every day to lock up all the keyes of every Altar in the Church (every Altar having its peculiar Ambrie, and ſome two) and to lay them forth every morning betwixt ſeven and eight of the clock, upon the height of the Ambrie (being of Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot) wherein they were lock'd, ſtanding within the North-Quire-door, that every Monk might take the key, and go to what Altar he was diſpos'd to ſay Maſs at. They alſo went to the Chapter-houſe every day (where all the Biſhops in the old time were
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40876:81"/>
Buried) betwixt eight and nine of the Clock, and there pray'd for all their Benefactors, and Founders, who had beſtowed any thing on that Church. And at nine of the Clock there rung a Bell to Maſs, called the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſs, which was alwayes ſung at the high Altar; and he that ſung the Maſs had alwayes in his <hi>Memento</hi> all thoſe that had given any thing to the Church. One half of the Monks ſaid Maſs in the Chapter-Maſs time, and the other half that ſung the Chapter-Maſs ſaid Maſs in the high-Maſs time. There were at every Altar two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, and two ſilver Crewets appertaining to it, with Albes, and Veſtments for the principal Feaſts, as alſo for all other dayes beſides. Every Altar had its double Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for adorning all parts of the Altar, ſerving both for holy dayes, and principal Feaſts. Their Founders, and Benefactors were pray'd for every day, and had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in the time of Maſs.

He had his Crutch, (or Croſier-ſtaff) in his hand, being of ſilver, double-gilt, with a rich Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre on his head. Alſo St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine, that holy Relique, was carried in the ſaid Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by four Monks on their ſhoulders. Other Monks carried about with them in the ſaid
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40876:85"/>
Proceſſion divers other holy Reliques; as the Picture of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> of ſilver, gilt, and St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Croſs, of ſilver, double-gilt. The Proceſſion came out of the North-door of the Abbey-Church, &amp; went through the Church-yard, &amp; down <hi>Ly-gate,</hi> by the <hi>Bow-Church-</hi>end, and up the <hi>Souch-Baily,</hi> and in at the Abbey-gates, where ſtood a great number of people, men, and women, and Children, with great Reverence, and Devotion; a good ſight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: and ſo it went through the <hi>Abbey-garth,</hi> with a number of men following it, but no Women were ſuffer'd to go further then the Abbey-gates; and ſo through the Cloiſter into the Church.</p>
               <p>And upon <hi>Whitſunday</hi> there was the like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proceſſion, with the ſame ſolemnities as had been obſerved on <hi>Holy-Thursday,</hi> with St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine, St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s Banner, and all the holy Reliques; as the Image of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> and the Image of St. <hi>Aidan,</hi> and the holy Relique of St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Croſs, with divers others.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> alſo, there was another general Proceſſion, as aforeſaid, with all the foreſaid Reliques, taking the ſame circuit as the fore-mentioned.</p>

               <head>St. <hi>Cuthbert's</hi> Shrine defaced.</head>
               <p>The ſacred Shrine of holy St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> before mentioned, was defaced at the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Dr. <hi>Lee,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blithman</hi> held at <hi>Durham,</hi> for the ſubverting of ſuch Monuments, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> at his ſuppreſſion of the Abbeys. They there found many worthy, and goodly Jewels, but eſpecially one precious ſtone, which, by the eſtimate of thoſe three Viſitors, and their skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lapidaries, was of value ſufficient to Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom a Prince. After the ſpoil of his ornaments, &amp; Jewels, coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> near unto his Body, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have found nothing but duſt, and bones, &amp; finding the Cheſt that he lay in very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound with Iron, the Goldſmith taking a great fore-hammer of a Smith, broke the ſaid Cheſt; and when they had opened it, they found him lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and his beard, as it were of a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's growth, and all his Veſtments about him, as he was accuſtomed to ſay Maſs, &amp; his Metwand of gold lying by him. When the Goldſmith perceived he had broken one of his leggs, as he broke open the Cheſt, he was troubled at it, and cried, Alas! I have broken one of his leggs. Dr. <hi>Henly,</hi> hearing him ſay ſo, called upon him, and bid him caſt down
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40876:86"/>
his Bones. Whereto the other anſwer'd, that he could not get them aſunder; for the ſinews and the skin held them ſo that they would not come aſunder. Then Dr. <hi>Lee</hi> ſtep'd up to ſee whether it were ſo, and turning about, ſpake in <hi>Latine</hi> to Dr. <hi>Henley,</hi> that he was entire; yet Dr. <hi>Henley</hi> would not give credit to his words, but ſtill cry'd to have his bones caſt down. Then Dr. <hi>Lee</hi> made anſwer, if you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not believe me, come up your ſelf, and ſee him. Whereupon Dr. <hi>Henley</hi> ſtep'd up to him, and did handle him, and found that he lay whole. Then he commanded them to take him down; and ſo it happened, contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that not only his Body was whole, and uncorrupted, but alſo that the Veſtments, wherein his Body lay, and wherein he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſay Maſs, were freſh, ſafe, and not conſumed. Whereupon the Viſitors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be carried into the Reveſtry, where he was cloſe and ſafely kept in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Reveſtry, till they knew the King's further pleaſure, what to do with him; and upon notice of the King's further pleaſure, the Prior, and the Monks buried him in the ground under the ſame place where his Shrine was exalted.</p>

               <p>In like manner the Shrine of holy St. <hi>Bede,</hi> before mentioned, was alſo defaced by the ſaid Viſitors, and at the ſame ſuppreſſion, his bones being interr'd under the ſame place where his Shrine was before erected. There are two ſtones that were of St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine in the <hi>Galilee,</hi> of blew Marble, which after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing thereof, were brought into the Body of the Church, and lye now over againſt the Eaſt-moſt Tomb of the <hi>Nevels,</hi> joyned both together. The upper-moſt ſtone of the ſaid Shrine hath three holes in every corner, for Irons to be faſten'd in, to guide the covering when it was drawn up, or let down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon did ſtand St. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Shrine. The other is a plain Marble-ſtone, which was loweſt, &amp; lay above a little Marble Tomb, whereon the lower end of the five ſmall Pillars did ſtand; which Pillars did alſo ſupport the upper-moſt ſtone.
