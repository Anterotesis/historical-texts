            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>'Tis true (to answer the first part of your answer) that it is my office to inform and actuat you, which operations are emanations from me; I am, I confess being undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, inextensive, without parts and inorganical, <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in qualibet parte,</hi> I am diffused up &amp; down throughout that fabrick of flesh, I am all in the whole, and all in every part; you have no move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all without me, but <hi>you,</hi> yielding more obedience, and being more plyable to the <hi>sensual appetit,</hi> and the <hi>Will,</hi> than to the dictates and directions of the <hi>Intellect</hi> my

principal facultie, have brought me to this pass; whereas those <hi>eyes</hi> of yours should be as crystal case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, through which I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glorious firmament, and studie my Creator in the Volumes of Nature, you have made them to intromit, and let out beams of vanity and lightness; They are foyl'd so thick with earth, that I can scarce discern Heaven through them; Those <hi>ears</hi> of yours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they should let in holy Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wholsom Precepts, you have used them as trunks to receive any idle discourses, and vain sounds, they have delighted more to hear Carrolls and Catches than Hymns and Anthems. That <hi>mouth, tongue</hi> and voice of yours, whereas they were given you for Organs to sound out the glory of your Creator, and sing Halelujahs unto Him, you have made them Instruments of equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and profaness; Those <hi>hands</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57277:9"/>
of yours, whereas they were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be stretched forth to do deeds of Charitie, and to pen Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, you have employed them to work your own revenges, and to scribble idle frivilous fancies; That <hi>throat</hi> of yours, whereas it was created for a conduit-pipe to let out Pious Ejaculations, you have made it the gullet of luxury and excess; Those <hi>feet</hi> of yours, whereas they were made you to walk in the paths of Pietie and Vertue, and lead you to Gods holy House, you have us'd them to run into the road of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness; When I examine your <hi>heart,</hi> the seat of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereas you should have made it a Closet for your Creator to reside in, and kept it sweet and cleanly for that purpose, I find you have made it a cage of unclean birds, of hatred, hypocrisie, choller and spirituall pride, the fuliginous evaporation whereof hath fum'd

               <p>A frail vessel indeed, yet, under favour, you sit at the helm of it; but I confess you cannot give me terms low and vile enough in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of your self, who are of an infinitly more noble extraction, the <hi>rational soul</hi> being <hi>Queen of forms,</hi> and the <hi>bodie,</hi> when she departs from it, the gastliest, and most noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of things, yet though <hi>you</hi> be a ray of Divinitie, and I but a rag of mortalitie, though you bear God Almighties image, &amp; I but <hi>Adams,</hi> though you be in me as a Diamond set in Horn, though you be by a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious heavenly infusion, and I by a seminarie traduction, yet we have the same Creator, (as <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> have) his hands have made me, and fashioned me in the womb, and the holy Text tells me, that I am <hi>wonderfully made; Nature</hi> his subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate minister took much pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57277:11"/>
me, she used great deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the business, for the passed four several successive acts before I was compleated.</p>
               <p>First there was a <hi>conjunction</hi> and cooperation of the sexes, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some require divers years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the work take effect, as the present King of <hi>France</hi> was two and twentie years a getting; and the last Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> thirteen moneths in the womb.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then followed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> which required a well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered vessel to conserve the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sperm by occlusion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringement of the orifice of the Matrix, which sperm being first bloud, and afterwards cream, was by a gentle ebullition coagulated into a cruddie lump, which the womb by its natural heat made fit to receive form, and to be organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, whereupon <hi>Nature</hi> fell a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to delineate all the members
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57277:11"/>
and other parts, beginning with those that are most noble, as the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>brain,</hi> and the <hi>liver,</hi> whereof the <hi>Galenists</hi> would have the <hi>liver</hi> to be first framed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it is the source and shop of bloud; but the <hi>Peripatetiques</hi> held the <hi>heart</hi> to have the precedencie, because it is the first thing that lives and the last that dies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nature</hi> continued in this operation until a perfect shape was introduced, which was the third Act, and is called <hi>Formation,</hi> being nought else but a production of an organical shapen bodie out of the spermatical substance caused by the plastick virtue, and vigour of the vital spirits, nor can I tell whether this Act was finished in thirtie, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, fourtie two, or fourtie five days after the Conception, for the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists allow such varietie of times according to the disposition of the matter before the Embrion be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57277:12"/>
formed; moreover, they observe, that Nature proceeds with those deliberate pawses, that fourtie days after the Conception, the creature is no bigger than a grain of wheat.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This being done, I was wrapped in three tunicles or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, then I was animated with three souls, the first with that of Plants, called the <hi>vegetative</hi> soul, then with a <hi>sensitive,</hi> wherein I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with brute animals, and lastly, with the <hi>rational</hi> soul, was immitted; The two first were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>ex Radice,</hi> as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers term it, <hi>viz.</hi> from the seeds of the Parents, but the last, which is your self, was by immediate infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from God himself, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturallists nor Divines have yet positively determined when this Infusion is made; Nor could ever any Anatomists, by their curious dissections, and inspections, find yet any organ in the bodie, or crannie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57277:12"/>
and receptacle in the brain, or any distinct place differing from other Animals where this <hi>rationall</hi> soul should reside in the Humane body: Thus hath man an <hi>intellectuall soul</hi> he knows not where, and infused he knows not how, nor when, so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant he is of the manner of his Creation; This last Act is call'd <hi>Animation,</hi> and as the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans allow <hi>Animation</hi> double the time that <hi>Formation</hi> had, which sometimes happeneth in eight moneths, sometimes in ten, but most commonly in nine: By these degrees and pauses was I made, and casting off my secundine, I came into the world to be a <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> not a <hi>dungeon</hi> for you, to be a kind of <hi>ark</hi> to carry you to the port of Bliss, to be a <hi>tabernacle</hi> for you, nay, to be a <hi>Temple</hi> for the Holy Ghost to dwell in: Nor did <hi>Nature</hi> altogether play the Bungler in doing her work, for she was <hi>pia
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57277:13"/>
Mater,</hi> a Pious Mother in framing the cells of my brain, and though she set me forth in no great volume, yet by this slenderness &amp; gracilitie of constitution, I have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to carry less corruption about me, for the more flesh, the more corruption; Now, touching those fraylties you speak of, whereunto I am subject, you know they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me to the world, and that I derive them from the <hi>protoplast,</hi> from the loins of my Gransire <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the rust and canker of whose skin and <hi>sin,</hi> stick unto me, being moulded of the same matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Soul.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, that you are moulded of Earth as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but the earth it self which gave him his composition and <hi>denomination,</hi> did <hi>blush</hi> when she went to make him, fore-seeing, as it were his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and propensity to all ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57277:13"/>But I find by this reply of yours, that you are well acquainted with your self, by the account you give me of the method that Nature used in your Generation; Now, self-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance is, after the knowledge of the Creator, the wisest; it is one of the paths, though a slabbie one, that leads us to the high road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, (which is a rougher way than that you found ore the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean</hi> mountains; The speculations whereof would make you truely value and vilifie your self, it should prick those tumours, and timpanies of pride that use to rise up in the humane creature, when he contemplates how near that ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel wherein he slept so long in the bosom of his causes, is to the <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious</hi> parts.</p>
               <p>Now, out of your discourse may be inferred, that Man is that great <hi>Amphibion</hi> of Nature, he passeth through the degrees of all creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57277:14"/>
He was first but meer <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> then he grew up to be a <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> afterwards a <hi>sensitive,</hi> then a <hi>Human</hi> Creature, in which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is capable of a <hi>regeneration,</hi> and he is to be at last a Spirit, good or bad;</p>
               <p>Now, you have two things that distinguish and specificat you from the first three; the one is outward, which is that erect upright Posture and shape you bear to behold Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your last and indeed your one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Countrey, this being but a transitory passage to that, whereas your other fellow Cretures have their faces looking upon the earth; The 2 is inward, <hi>viz.</hi> the faculty of <hi>Reson,</hi> which makes you a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for some inconveniences and weaknesses, whereby you are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to other elementary Creatures; By <hi>Reason</hi> man tames the <hi>Libian</hi> Lion, he puts Castles upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants back, makes the huge Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57277:14"/>
to kneel and take up his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by <hi>Reason</hi> he fetches the Eagle out of the Air, and with his Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-iron draggs up the great Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than out of the deeps; by <hi>Reason</hi> he rules and curbs Nature her self, making her pliable to his ends; Now all the operations of <hi>Reason,</hi> which are the best of human acts, you derive from me; But whereas you say that there can be no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place found out either within you, or without you, more than there is in the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Creature where I should reside, you must know, that as the Solar Light dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playeth it self throughout the whole Hemisphere, yet it cannot be said to possess any place more than another; so I, being a beam of immortality, am diffused through that little World of yours to quicken and heat all parts, yet I confine my self to no peculiar cell, and this inorganitie sheweth, that I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57277:15"/>
can live separat from you (though you by no means without me) as appears already by some functions that I exercise, and those abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed speculations that I use without the help or concurrence of matter, and quantitie, which are my instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely in <hi>ordine ad sensibilia,</hi> not <hi>Intelligibilia</hi>: yet I let you know that I have some closets in that Fabrick of yours, more choice than others, I am <hi>radically</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> where the <hi>vital</hi> spirits have their residence, where the arterial and most illustrious bloud doth run in the left ventricle; But I am <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> in the <hi>brain,</hi> where the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> Spirits inhabit, and whereon I cast my intellectual influences for Discourse and Reason, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, the brain of a brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is not capable of, or adapted by Nature to receive; Moreover, the veins are branched up &amp; down the body, the bloud is in the veins,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57277:15"/>
the spirits in the bloud, and I am much in the spirits.</p>
               <p>By this intimacie of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am polluted daily more and more, I am infected hereby and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prified with sin, and I fear me, that as the wounds of my Saviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon his bodie after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, so those gashes and black spots which I have received from you, will appear upon me after my separation; And whereas you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that you are liable to future punishment as well as I for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errations and transgressions of this life, I must tell you, that when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my devorcement from you, I become a spirit, a simple substance and a sphere of my self, the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and activity, the simpleness &amp; subtility of my pain being purely spiritual will be farr more grievous and cruciatory than, any those gross members of yours can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, I shall endure all torments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57277:16"/>
at once with certain knowledge of a succeeding perpetuity, without any hopes of the least discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or relaxation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas you say that I sit in the box to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern that chariot of yours, tis true I do so, but as the divine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher said, <hi>that</hi> chariot of the body is led by two horses, the one black, the other white, this last which are your good inclinations I can easily rule, but the black one, which are your turbulent wild passions and and obliquities I cannot govern, so that I am afraid he is oftentimes so headstrong &amp; furious that he will at last tumble us both down the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of destruction; Lastly whereas you alledge that I sit at the stern of that leaking bark of yours, t'is true I do so, but I sayl in her as one passing upon some part of the <hi>Danubius,</hi> where she meets with the River <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and the two Rivers running in

collaterall consortship many miles without intermingling, the Boats that row along the stream, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, on the one side, a black muddie water, and on the <hi>Danubs</hi> side, a clear stream. In this manner do I sail in that bodie of yours, through good and bad affections, through clear and turbid humours (though the last be more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) whence such vapours arise, that cause strange tempests in me, and disturb the calm of my mind, which makes me wearie of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, when I think on those pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and black specks wherewith I am contaminated, whereunto my meditations tended lately in these few Stanzas of multifarious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>

               <p>You are beholden to my frailties for this and such like Meditations, who raise them in you, as rusty steel useth to strike sparks of fire; <hi>sin</hi> it self becomes an advantage to us somtimes; nay, mankind may be said to be beholden to the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>

                     </gap>alvarie</hi> for the crucifying of our Saviour, was the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Altar that ever was erected, and it may be well doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that hates the Altar, shall ever have benefit of the Sacrifice, as one said. But I am sorry to hear from you, that your dwelling in me is so tedious unto you, all that I can say, is, I could wish you were better hous'd; Now touching those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Affections you speak of, (which are also my Inmates) they are to the soul, as sayls to a ship, they are also as so many gales to fill those sayls, as so many breezes to blow this small Vessel of mine, wherein you are embarked to the haven of happiness, and as I said before, they are meer Emanations from you; for there is nothing of motion in me, but what I derive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57277:19"/>
from you; Now touching Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Passions, how uncoth would all human actions be, unless they were sweetned by them: how stupid and slumbering would our Spirits be without them? What a dull thing were Generation, if there were no Concupiscence? What comfort would there be in educating children, if there were not a natural love that affected us? Charitie would grow key-cold, if Pity did not heat her to action; and that Souldier fights best, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field, is possess'd with the Passion of anger, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher calls the <hi>Whetstone of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>; He cannot becom a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that is not affecte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with sorrow nor a true Convert, who is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with hatred of sin.</p>
               <p>Touching other infirmities you charge me withall, you know I have them by natural and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary propagation from my first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57277:19"/>
whose corruption was entail'd upon all mankind, which may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so excuse, at least extenuat my faults. But besides these Resons, I have another that may serve for an Apologie in my behalf, which is, that all these members of mine, and that mass of bloud which runs through them, with the cestern of Humors, as likewise all the cells of my brain, are guided and governed by the motions of celestial bodies, whose influxes do perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade me, and are irresistible: Add hereunto, that there is a <hi>malus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> an ill Spirit that is always busie about me, and ready to take all advantages to impel me to acts of weakness. All these things being well considered, and weigh'd in a just balance, conclude me to be of my self but a poor passive thing, and to act by the impulses of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57277:20"/>Touching those Affections and <hi>Passions</hi> you speak of, which are nought else but a <hi>conglobation of the Spirits,</hi> I not onely allow, but am glad of them, they serve as wings to carry me up to heaven (and you after me) or as you say, they are as so many gales to send me thither, provided that the one do onely <hi>blow,</hi> not <hi>bluster</hi> and raise tempests; And that the other be not irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or exorbitant, but directed to their true Object: The <hi>Passions</hi> are as so many pleaders wrangling at a bar, and <hi>Reson,</hi> my chiefest facultie, should be their Chancelor; But oftentimes those troops of furious Spirits, which Passion musters up, and sends up boyling to the brain, are so violent, that those Spirits which are under the jurisdiction of Reson, are not able to encounter them, though she unite all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57277:20"/>Moreover, whereas you would pin your infirmities upon your first <hi>Parents,</hi> 'tis true, that although <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> at first was created in a state of integrity and perfection, being he was the Epitome of the Creation, and a kind of <hi>Microcosm,</hi> a little World of himself, whereunto there may be some allusion in his <hi>name,</hi> which comprehends the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World, the word <hi>Adam</hi> being made up of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> East, West, North and South; Although at first he was compleated to that state, and yet made capable of a higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which capacitie was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, but a seale to a higher; I say, that although he was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd to present happiness, yet by the seducement of the ill Spirit, he fatally fell from it; nor was the fault as much in the <hi>Woman,</hi> being the <hi>weaker vessel,</hi> but in <hi>him</hi> who was the stronger; Now the tryal
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57277:21"/>
of mans universal Obedience, being intended in him, and he failing, the guilt thereof falls upon his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that were all then potentially in his loins, who ever since have brought with them into the world the stains of that original Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet Christians have a way to wash off in the Font of Baptism, the <hi>lavoir of Regeneration</hi>: yet there is an <hi>Eve</hi> lurking still within the humane body, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Will,</hi> which is so full of obliquities and fraylties, that while I lie at close ward against one infirmitie, another is ready to wound me; which makes me so great a sinner, that the Indulgences of a whole Jubile (had they such a virtue as some believe they have) were not able to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve me.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whereas you averr the Stars to bear sway, and to have an incontroulable predominance over all sublunary Cretures, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57277:21"/>
over that body of yours; It is a truth that cannot be denied, as we find by daily experience, that all Elementary Cretures depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the motion and virtue of the heavenly: but though these influx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from above do by their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toss and tumble the humors as they lift, and work upon corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real things in man; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it cannot be said that these operations do extend to those inclinations and actions, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend immediately upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Will,</hi> with the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Powers of the Mind, which are immanent, and meerly spiritual; yet I confess, if we observe the order and method that the <hi>Understanding</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> do use in the production of their functions, it will be found, that the influence of the Celestial Luminaries, and the impressions that they make, must have something to do herein;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57277:22"/>
but it is <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>accidently,</hi> in regard that all terrestrial bodies by a gradual kind of subordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing govern'd, as was said before, by the superior, it must be inferred of necessitie, that whatsoever is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the humane Creture, as the organs of that body of yours, must feel the Power of their influences; In regard that the spiritual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are so united, and have such an entercourse with the corporeal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that they cannot operate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the said organs ministerially concur, and contribute thereunto, by presenting the objects, which are the sensible species; but I except the abstracted ideas and speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind; whence it inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably comes to pass, that in regard of this strict league, and natural correspondence, which is between them, the inward faculties partake somewhat of, and submits to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that the Planets and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57277:22"/>
have over the sensual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which together with the <hi>will,</hi> are disposed often, and incited, I will not say <hi>constrained,</hi> by their influxes.</p>
               <p>Out of these premisses this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion doth follow, that the Stars do operate, and make impressions upon the humane creture (as well as other productions of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) both outwardly and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but they serve themselves of those <hi>material</hi> parts and organs of yours, that are as portholes to let in the influxes which they dart from above to work upon the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to incline and incite them to good or ill, according to their dispositions, though not by way of enforcement, for they have not such a tyrannical and absolute supremacie, but there is a freedom still left to a well-ordered <hi>Will</hi>; And as there are outward Bongraces, to preserve the face from being tanned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57277:23"/>
by the violence of Solar heat, so there are intern Graces to keep the inward parts from all ill and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant influences that are lanced from above; according to the Poet, —<hi>Sapiens dominabitur Astris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Wise man sways ore the Stars</hi>; Therefore it was a very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent answer that one gave to a Genethliacal Astrologer, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken much pains to prie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the horoscope for the calculating of his Nativitie, and telling the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that in regard such and such stars were in conjunction at the hour of his Birth, therefore he must be subject to such and such ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and dispositions. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> said he, <hi>that I was born such a one, but I was born again,</hi> meaning his spiritual <hi>regeneration:</hi> For as we find that a virtuous education doth oftentimes correct the infirmities, and rectifie the obliquities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so there be interior motions of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57277:23"/>
Grace, which come from a higher power than the Stars, that curb and check the operations which proceed from the supern influxes: Yet are the intellectual powers easily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be transported, and snatched away by the sensual appetit, and the natural allurements thereof, for the humane soul is not <hi>sui juris,</hi> she is not so independent and absolut of her self, but that she may be said to depend upon the <hi>Totum composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> upon the bodie in general, by the mediation of whose instruments she imploys her faculties, end exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth her actions in order to <hi>sensible</hi> things.</p>
               <p>But as the stars in this firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are whirled away by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling motion of the <hi>Primum mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> the first mover from East to West, yet they have a particular and contrarie motion of their own from West to East, wherein they, proceed notwithstanding, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57277:24"/>
interrupted pace; so I may be said to be oftentimes whirld away by the irregular and violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that <hi>Compositum,</hi> that fleshly sphere of yours, yet I go on still in my own motion towards my last goal, and my sovereign good.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the Heavens work on inferior bodies, by three instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Light, Motion,</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> the first ingendering heat in the Ayr by attrition and rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is done by a simple or compounded ray, to wit, reflection; The second, by measuring our times and seasons, both which may be said to be external visible instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The third, which is <hi>influence,</hi> is a hidden intern qualitie, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth metals, causeth fluxes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes, ripens the Embrion in the womb, with such like effects, and as it was discoursed before, it operates in the human creture upon his very intellectuals, through the exterior
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57277:24"/>
material parts; yet not by way of compulsion, but inclination, as was said before, therefore the influxes of Heaven are no excuse for you, as you alledg, because they are resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable.</p>
               <p>Lastly, touching the <hi>Malus genius</hi> an ill spirit, which you say doth haunt you, and is ever at your el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to push you forward to ill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and suggest into you bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, I must tel you there is also a <hi>Bonus genius</hi> or daemon, a good spirit that always attends you, whose infusions, precepts, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions if you would obey, you would not onely <hi>see</hi> the best, and approve of it, but <hi>follow</hi> and put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>

               <p>This discourse doth administer me but small comfort, yet I thank you that you make me know my self better by displaying unto me
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57277:25"/>
my own condition, and that maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin of infirmities which are stored up in this little tabernacle of yours, yet I shall never make those infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, nor all the effects thereof, were they more in number, greater than my Creators <hi>mercie,</hi> either out of any despondencie of Spirit, and despair, in <hi>rejecting</hi> it as some do, or by presumption, in <hi>slighting</hi> it as others do: For if the <hi>first</hi> Man, who was immediatly moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made by God himself in such a state of perfection, had his frailties; If <hi>Samson</hi> the <hi>strongest</hi> man had also his; If <hi>Salomon</hi> the <hi>wisest</hi> man had his; If <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>holiest</hi> of men, who had so many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as to be a Prophet, and so anointed with oyl above others; if that Prophet who came of the chosen seed, and consequently, was not cast in so corrupt a mold as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I say, if the Prophet <hi>David</hi> who was a <hi>Man after Gods own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57277:25"/>
heart,</hi> a character, the like whereof was never given to any but unto him, I say if such a man, and such men had infirmities in so high a measure, how is it possible but that I should have them in a greater number? therefore my transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but deeds of my defects, and effects of those general frailties that have attended, and are entail'd upon the best of men.</p>
               <p>Now, touching my corporeal Organs and Senses which you tax so much, 'tis true that my eyes have oftentimes gazed upon earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and <hi>grass-green</hi> objects, yet at other times they have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>sky-colour.</hi> I have cast them up towards Heaven, and fixing them a good while (with some ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) upon a part of the deepest <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure</hi> I could spy, they cur'd me once of a shrewd defluxion (by which experiment, I also found that such a fixation doth much corroberat the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57277:26"/>
nerves and conserve the sight) that distil'd into them. I have by <hi>Them</hi> oft admir'd the fair fabrick of the Universs, surveing all the parts thereof round about as farr as my opticks could reach, &amp; stood asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht at their Excellencies, as beams streaming from a heavenly <hi>Creator</hi> (&amp; refracting on the visible world) on whom their preservation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and in whom they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred intentionally before they had any existence; I observe how Nature is here and there check'd by Him, when I see how he sets bounds to the vast tumbling Ocean, and that those mountains of snow, which hang in the Ayrie Region, &amp; those floud-gates of waters do not fall down and precipitate at once to over-whelm the earth, which is so little a thing in comparison of the vast expansion of the Air; As also in the operation of divers other productions of Hers. For if <hi>Nature</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57277:26"/>
did go on still in her own course &amp; constant method of effects and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, this might induce a belief, that <hi>she</hi> were Governness of all things; but when we see, that sometimes she hath not her full swing, intending things that she is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but falls short of her purposes, as also that her ordinarie operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are restrained, and grow lame, We must conclude, that there is a predominant Power that ore-sways her, and moves the sphere of her activitie as he lift. Thus by the opticks of the Ey, (the eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of my senses) I make the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Universe my Universitie to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die my Maker, breaking out often (when I go into the fields, and find all things subservient to Man) into that ejaculation of the Psalmist, <hi>Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonders he doth for the children of men.</hi> Nor do I by the benefit of the Ey read
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57277:27"/>
Divinitie among sublunarie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where every spire of grass may serve for a letter, but I spel my Creator among the stars, and indeed there is not any mundane object doth delight and ravish me so much, as to contemplate those glorious lamps of Heven in a clear night, wherewith I find my self so much affected, that with <hi>Emilius</hi> I could find in my heart to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Moons deliverie from an Eclips; therefore it may stand well with Christianitie, to hold those the best of Pagans, that ask blessing of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Touching my Organs of hearing, 'tis true as you say, they serve too often to let in every frivolous tale, or sonet, yet as the Philosopher calls the Hearing <hi>sensum disciplinae,</hi> the sence of learning, whereby the soul, as he thought, being at first infusion a kind of <hi>rasa tabula,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all her notions by way of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57277:27"/>
                  <hi>Reminiscence,</hi> I have made it often (let all this be spoken without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) the sense of saving knowledge for Faith comes by hearing; I have set open the anfractuous passages thereof to take in the sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, and the mysteries of salvation, and when I hear a holy anthem it brings all my spirits to my ears in throngs; A grave ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borat sermon works the like effect, such a sermon as he speak of, who coming out of a Church, and being asked whether the sermon was done, yes, said he, 'tis done in the church, but it begins now in me: but while my Faith is fed, I do not love to have my Reson famished, I do not love to be <hi>worded</hi> to death by such tautological &amp; rambling insipid con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fused stuff that some Enthusiasists use to evaporat, wherein it is as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find any coherence in point of matter or methodical contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is to make a rope of that sand whereby they prate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57277:28"/>My feet 'tis true, go too often astray to the by-paths of vanity, but they come back again to the right track, as one going on a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and hearing by the way a pack of hounds, he goes and follows the sport a while, and then returns to his road; I have the grace to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them often to Gods holy house, where with leggs and knees I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in the humblest manner of genu-flection, to offer him sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of prayer and prayses;</p>
               <p>I reach out my hands sometimes to lend unto the Lord, by relieving the poor (according to my pittance) knowing that Charity doth cover a multitude of sins: my fingers also I find pliable now and then to write divine meditations, whereunto I employ them altogether upon the holy Saboth.</p>
               <p>My <hi>mouth,</hi> my <hi>toung,</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> also joyn (be it still spoke without vainness) at least to ejaculat my

guilt and his glory; and I find the arterial bloud, which is in the least ventricle thereof boyling, me thinks, within me in affection towards him, the exhalations whereof rise up, and fill all the cells of my brain to contemplat his goodness, as will appear unto you in these few terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Stanzas.</p>

               <p>Touching my interior Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I confess, they have too great a dominion in me, <hi>choler,</hi> which hath more <hi>heat</hi> than <hi>light</hi> in it, doth too often transport me, som fires glow in me, as if they were flown from hell, and such a fire no meaner man than Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though a <hi>Convert,</hi> and one that had been <hi>a Traveller</hi> in the other world, felt within him, impatience and rashness, intemperance, self-conceit, and hatred have reigned in me, I have other odd things (and indeed all things which attend human weakness) that I am subject unto, as too much credulitie and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; sadness contracts, and mirth too suddenly dilates my spirits, and makes them break out into violent fits of laughter, which though it be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57277:29"/>
a harmless Passion, yet there is none that distorts a man so much, for it extends the fore-head, declines the brow, half shuts the eye, raising a kind of splendor about them, it crumples up the nose, drives back the cheeks, and makes pits in them, it shews the teeth, makes the toung pendant in the mouth, it hindereth the swallowing by contracting and shutting the muscles which serve that action, it gives such girds to the Diaphragma that it obstructs the respiration for the time, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts all the members, and beats upon the flancks, it puts forth arms, leggs and hands in strange posturs; It causeth Syncopes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and raiseth an irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the pulse; thus this Passion disguiseth me too often, &amp; betrays my folly, though one, apologizing for this Passion, saith, that laughter doth not as much discover a man to be a fool, but that there is a fool

upon her, least if <hi>devotion</hi> shold produce too much welth, the <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> wold devour the <hi>Mother.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charitable conceit you bear towards those sects of Christians which you have nam'd, discovers a candid &amp; charitable nature in you, for though the number of the <hi>Elect</hi> be few, yet to confine them to one clime, and coop them up in one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Earth, is a presumption; Yet every one shold be so confident of his own religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to wish that all Mankinde were of the same as He.</p>
               <p>I like it extremely well that you reserve the best and purest motions of love for your Creator, who is the source and wide sea, who is the sum and center of all happiness; This love you may be well assured will not be lost towards him who taketh delight in nothing more than in the good of his cretures, and to see them do well; He is always more ready to <hi>open</hi> than they to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57277:40"/>
                  <hi>knock,</hi> more ready to <hi>hear</hi> than they to <hi>cry,</hi> more ready to <hi>bestow</hi> than they to <hi>begg</hi>; moreover I like well those submissive and decent postures wherein you prostrat your self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, there can be no exces of humility in your comportment that way, the inward man is known by the outward carriage, and when the members bow without, 'tis a signe that the heart doth so also within: I like it well also that your praises are more frequent than your <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>; prayers <hi>bend</hi> God, but prayses <hi>bind</hi> him; <hi>prayer</hi> concerns our own interest, but praise aymes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally at his glory, and they who doth truly preform this part of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, may be saied to discharge the duty of an Angell upon earth; God, who is omniscious, knows all our wants before hand, and what's fitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, therfore to be too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunat and over-tedious in one praier, to eflagitat him with reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57277:41"/>
of the same thing discovers a doubting and diffident heart, therefore it more becomes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to be more vehement in <hi>prayse</hi> rather than in <hi>prayer,</hi> the one issuing out of the foggy vapours of sin, the other from the pure exhalations of piety and gratitude, which sooner ascend to heaven; Therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should not stand always knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and begging at the gates of heaven, but endeavour to <hi>bestow</hi> some thing upon his Creator, and there cannot be a better gift than praise, with expressions of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and with admiration of his longanimity and love, of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and providence, of his power and greatness; yet <hi>prayer</hi> should have a longer preparation than <hi>praise,</hi> in regard by it we make our addresses immediatly to God in the <hi>second person,</hi> and familiarly speaks to him as it were face to face; whereas oblations of <hi>praise</hi> are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57277:41"/>
commonly in the <hi>third</hi> person; Therefore under favour I do not much approve of their custom who before and after meat, when their brains are ful of worldly thoughts, and tied to civil compliances do rush rashly into a speech with him in the <hi>second person</hi> having no time for a fitting praemeditation; At such times a short ejaculation expressed in the third person (though it be only <hi>mental</hi> if the case requiers) may be more acceptable, and freer from presumption than a long grace, For among those innumerable sins which man is subject unto, the sin in prayer, though least thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is one of the greatest, when without trembling precogitations, God Almightie is spoken unto, and <hi>thou'd</hi> in the <hi>Vocative</hi> case. Now, those Benedictions, and strains of prayses which are utterd in the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative</hi> and other Cases, have a larger scope of boldness, and a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57277:42"/>
greater latitude of notion, they keep at a further distance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently require not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and recollection of the thoughts beforehand, but may be extemporal; 'Tis one thing to say <hi>God be praisd,</hi> another thing to say, <hi>O God I praise thee:</hi> the latter requires much more premeditation, for one presupposeth he is as it were locally and presentially before him, though the first may have as much of the heart, &amp; be as effectual as the other. This makes me to take some paines when I invoke God in the second person by my orison, to obstract my self from all commerce with <hi>you</hi> for the present, and elevat my self upon the wings of Faith in the sublimest posture I can towards He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven taking the choicest affections and ideas with me along where I figure to my self a huge mountain of most pure and inexpressible light wherein me thinks I discern a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57277:42"/>
majesty, but the more I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, the more he dazles mine eyes, that I cannot make him a fix'd object, or discover any shape in him, in regard of the refulgencie of his glory; during this action, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to mingle with that light, for true love is nothing else but an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit of Vnion,</hi> and if I hold my self to be a spark, or part of that light from the beginning, and to be dart thence into that body of yours, and made a <hi>soul,</hi> may be no extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant speculation.</p>
               <p>Now touching this last Notion, and the other concerning extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prayer, it is not utter'd to give the least occasion of scandal to any other soul, but onely to intimat, that there are for Acts of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as for all things else, fit places and times, where there may be a greater opportunitie for one to summon his spirits, to marshall his irregular thoughts, and raise

               <p>Dear soul, my spirits are raised to an exceeding great height of comfort, that in the first part of this last discours, you are pleas'd with the method of my Devotions, and carriage towards Heaven; that I reserve my purest and most intense Affections for my Creator, which I shall be most carefull ever to do, —<hi>dum spiritus hos regit artus</hi>; He being my sole &amp; soverain good; and truly, I must tell you, that when by my lubricities, as by too free a <hi>genius</hi> in the fruition of a friend or otherwise, I chance to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, I can never be friends with my self, till I am reconcil'd to him, and that I conceive his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to be turn'd again towards me; yet, I had once a long fit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

               <p>I like it very well, that you make the <hi>Conscience</hi> your Guide, and that you use to listen to his counsell; for he is my <hi>Dictator,</hi> &amp; may be said to have a coordinat Power with God himself. Therefore it is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of a wise Christian, to take his Conscience for his <hi>Admonisher</hi> here, least he become his <hi>Accuser</hi> hereafter, He is <hi>Fraenum,</hi> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum,</hi> he is a bridle before, but a Scourge after sin. But I hope, those turbid intervalls of grief and gripings bettered you afterward; for confession and sorrow without amendment (as one truely said) is like the pumping of a Ship without stopping the leaks: It is a pithy and ponderous advice that an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

Father gives, <hi>Commissa dole, dolenda non committe,</hi> repent of things committed, and commit not things to be repented; there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other saying, that administreth both comfort and caution, that if <hi>sins present do not delight thee, sins passed will never destroy thee.</hi> There is a third which reflects upon God and man; <hi>Qui promittit poenitenti veniam non promittit peccanti poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam.</hi> He who promiseth pardon to the penitent, doth not promise repentance to the peccant.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57277:52"/>
joyes thereof, while he is enditing them; Now, in those holy Hymns of <hi>David</hi>'s, there is a coincidence of Prayer, and Prayse, which like two currents falling into one channel, makes the stream the stronger. But to inlarge my self a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that point whereon I insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little before, touching the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of divine knowledge, which is the <hi>unicum necessarium,</hi> I advise you again, now that you have stepp'd a good way in the Autumne of your age, and that a little bark of yours hath been toss'd and shatter'd with so many tempests, It were wisdom that you wold think upon your last Port, and ballast her accordingly to arrive thither; Therefore whereas you have courted the <hi>Hand-maids</hi> so long, you shold now make your principal applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the Mistress, you shold devote your self to the theory of divine things, which is the true <hi>fruit</hi> of the tree of knowledge,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57277:52"/>
whereas the other are but the <hi>leafs</hi> thereof. Now Christianity of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions hath the hardest and highest reaches, the purest Ideas and abstracted furthest from sense, and harshest to flesh and bloud, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of sundry transcendencies, and mystical tenents she contains, as the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> in the re-serches of which points the quickest sight, may be said to be but one degree above blindness, therefore in the discussion and investigation of these, it is fit that you make <hi>reson</hi> (whose utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ken can reach no higher than the sphere of nature) to lye succum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent at faiths feet, and so <hi>conclude certainties out of impossibilities,</hi> and God being <hi>omnipotent</hi> may in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice demand such beliefs from us. Nor must you be too presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by prying into the Power, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and nature of the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Deity; for if all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57277:53"/>
that ever were yet in the world, could not come to the knowledge of the least star in heaven, so far as to tell what substance she is made of: how is it possible for any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacitie to ascend so high, as to the knowledge of the immense Majestie which created them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the safest and certainest knowledge touching God, is to confess, That <hi>we cannot know</hi> Him in any perfection.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57277:53"/>
contribute their help to direct him; Therefore it is a far securer way for a sober minded Christian to sit down in an humble astonishment, and to vent forth this interjection of wonder, O the inscrutableness &amp; immensity of God, his ways are past finding out <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore you must be modest in your indagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this way, and cautious how you go awry into any by-path from the beaten road, and so wander in the wilderness of your own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For it is the common practise of the Devil, when it pleaseth God to give him the reins to punish a nation, to tamper first with their intellectualls, and puzzle the brain with new doubts, and peremptory conceits, till he leads them into a maze of confusions, where at last he seizeth upon them for their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride. You must take heed of such an insobriety, and insolent zeal, but seek after singleness of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57277:54"/>
heart, rather than after singularity of opinion; Be wary also how you meddle with <hi>classical</hi> divinity, but leave it to them whose holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it is to controvert such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and doubtles are specially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired for that purpose, employ your chiefest howers in penning or perusing things that may elevat the thoughts above the Elements, and fill them with pious raptures; But what Authors so ever you read whither old or new, whither Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, polemical, or paraenetical, take this rule along with you to <hi>believe Them for the Holy scriptures sake, and the scriptures for Themselves.</hi> Antiquity is venerable, therefore the older the Author is, the more to be valued, it being a maxim that may bear sway in divinity as well as in Heralday, <hi>Tutius est cum patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quàm cum fratribus errare.</hi>

Rational Soul, Let me tell you that not only Christian Divines but the best of Pagan writers both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, Philosophers, and Orators have done Her that right. One calls Her — <hi>Divinae particulam aurae.</hi> Another sings, <hi>Igneus est olli vigor, &amp; coelestis imago</hi>; Another <hi>Mens infusa Deo, mortalis nescia sortis.</hi> And <hi>Cicero</hi> among other hath a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble saying to this purpose, <hi>si erro, credendo Animam esse Immortalem, libenter erro</hi>; If I err in beleeving the soul to be immortall, I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erre. Moreover the Intellectuall humane soul doth prove Her self to be immortall both by her <hi>desires,</hi> her <hi>apprehensions</hi> and <hi>operations</hi>; Her <hi>desires</hi> are infinit, and still longing after <hi>eternity</hi>; now ther is no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall passion given to any finit Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bee frustraneous; Her apprehending of notions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truth which are her chiefest
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57277:84"/>
employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and most adaequat objects, declare her immortall; Al corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes from matter and from the clashing of contraries, now, when the soul is sever'd from the body, she is beyond the sphere of matter, therefore no causes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality can reach her, ther is nothing in her that can tend to a not being: Her <hi>operations</hi> also pronounce her immortall, which she doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise without the ministery of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall organs, for they are rather a clogg to Her; she doth use to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualize materiall things in the understanding, to abstract ideas from all Individuals; she is an engin that can apprehend <hi>negations,</hi> and <hi>privations,</hi> she can frame <hi>colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive notions,</hi> all which conclude her immateriality, and where no matter is found ther's no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wher ther is no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness ther must be an immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57277:85"/>
now her prime operations being without any concurrence of matter, she may be concluded immortall by that common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>Modus operandi sequitur modum essendi:</hi> for in the world to come the state of the soul shall be a state of pure Being, nor will ther be either action or passion in that state; whence may be inferr'd she shall never perish, in regard that all corruption comes from the action of another thing upon that which is corruptible, therfore that thing must be capable of being made better or worse, now, if a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate soul be in her utmost final estate that she can be made neither, it follows she can never lose the <hi>being</hi> she hath; Moreover, since the egress out of the body doth not alter her <hi>Nature</hi> but only her <hi>condition,</hi> it must be granted that she was of the same nature while
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57277:85"/>
shee continued incorporated, though in that imprisonment of hers, she was subject to be forg'd as it were by the hammers of materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all objects beating upon her, yet so, as she was still of her self what she was; Therfore when she goes out of the passible ore wherin she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers by reason of the foulness and impurity of that ore, she imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly becomes impassible and a fix'd subject of her own nature, that is, a simple <hi>pure Being</hi>; Both which states of the soul may be illustrated<note place="margin">Sir K.D.</note> in som measure by what we find passeth in the coppelling of a fix'd mettall, for as long as any lead or dross, or any allay remains with it, it continueth melting, flowing, and in motion under the muffle, but as soon as they are parted from it, and that it is become pure without mixture, and single of it self, it contracteth it self to a narrower

               <p>Add hereunto that every humane Soul is still breath'd, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly created by God Almighty himself, for though the sacred Code tells us that he rested from all his works the sixth day, yet touching Rational souls he may be said to be still a perpetuall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent touching their creation, not

ranking all the parts of motion in their compleat order, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once what is to happen in every one of them, wheras when I was immers'd in the body, and confin'd to the use of exterior sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, I could look but upon one definit place or time at once, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a long chain of various dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses to comprehend the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of any one singular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

to endeavour to relate them in their perfection, were the same task as to go about to measure the Ocean in Cockle shels, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the number of the sands with pebble stones.</p>
               <p>Touching these faint and fading earthly pleasures, wee covet them when we need them, and the desire languisheth in the fruition; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, worldly things when wee want them wee use to love them most, but lesse when we have them; meats and drinks they nauseat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fulness, carnall delights cause sadnesse after the enjoyment, all pleasures breed not only a satiety but a disgust, and the contentment terminats with the act: 'Tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise with celestiall things, they are most lov'd when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, and most coveted when they are had, they are alwaiesful of what is desir'd, and the desire still la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,

but it is a desire of <hi>compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> and <hi>continuance,</hi> not an <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> of more, because they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of themselves; Yet there is still a desire, and satiety, but the one findes no want, nor can the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breed a surfet: The higher the pleasure is, the more intense is the fruition, and the oftner repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the greater the appetite will be; whence this inference may be made, that ther can be no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all' twixt the delights of a separate and an embodyed Soul.</p>
               <p>But it must not bee forgotten, that as good Soules being become purely spirituall, and beatified as soon as they are separate from the body, do by their simplicity and acutenesse apprehend and enjoy the blisses of Heaven in their true nature, beyond the extent of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and above all conceit of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:

So a damned Soul being a <hi>simple Act</hi> also, and nothing but <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth apprehend and endure the torments of Hell, with all the activity, subtlenesse and energy that can bee, still receiving new strength and vigor to bee able to lie under the said torments: And as the assurance of a succeeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity delights the one, so it doth torture the other. Moreover, as the greatest straines of anguish which torments the one, is to have lost Heaven, so one of the highest conceptions of joy to the other, is to have escap'd Hell; Insomuch that <hi>Heaven</hi> in som sort may be called the <hi>Hell</hi> of the <hi>damned,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> the Heaven of the <hi>Blessed.</hi>

of Humane souls in time of sleep and the silent listning night to go oftentimes abroad, and exercise their abstracted notions, as also to try here (as it was touch'd before) how they can live separate hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by these noctivagations.
