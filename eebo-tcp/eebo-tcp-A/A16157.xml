         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Ethicall</hi> ſolidity, than ſuperficiall <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> which gained ſo much on
the <hi>Italian</hi> humour, as it induced divers of that Nobility to procure him

their fancy, &amp; having found to gather &amp; crop them off their proper ſtems,
where they naturally grew (for doubt of receiving them at a ſecond hand
withered, vertueleſſe, or adulterate) though neceſsitated for arriving at
them, to force a paſſage through many a buſhie brake, and thorny thicket,
beſides the often hazarding the pricking of their fingers to the quick, in
reaching at them, ſo fenced and entertwined with ſharp-pointed brambles,
and ſmart-ſtinging briers; Howbeit, thou maiſt hereafter expect a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the gleaning of ſome of them, not much perhaps declined from
their native beauty, odor, and vertue: For the ſooner accompliſhing
whereof, it ſhall prove no ſlender encouragement to have prevailed ſo farre

my own incapability may be accepted in excuſe of my not voluntary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going

more for the ſatisfaction of ſome noble Friends of mine, (if the
weakneſſe of my deſerts, ſupported onely with a deſire of honouring merit
in the proper ſphere, where it both reſides and moves, may preſume ſo to

which (perhaps) ere thou haſt brought to a finall period, will give thee
cauſe to entertain a milder opinion of the no leſſe well-meaning than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

without preſumption too) averre the ſame to be, though (in reſpect of my
not yet fully renew'd acquaintaince with my native tongue) not elegantly;
yet (by the furtherance of my twice two Summers aſsiduall converſing
with that Nation at their native home) faithfully (not paraphraſed, but)
tranſlated. Seeing that I have (as oft as they would endure the being new

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Attalampo</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> had by his
wife <hi>Algidoſia</hi> (the <hi>Numidian</hi> Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
a goodly, though too too numerous a
progenie; Becauſe the law of birthright
(in that kingdome inviolable) was not liberall
to yonger brothers, of other patrimony, than
ſword and horſe. The youngeſt among them,
was a babe of exquiſite beauty, to whom
together with perfections of body, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was bountifull of thoſe vertues of the minde, which beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed
a well-meriting Prince. <hi>Polimero</hi> (for ſo was he called) in
growth preuented his yeares, and in knowledge and diſcretion the
age of diſcretion; ſo as (though a child) he knew already what it
imported him to be laſt borne, <hi>and what it was to bee a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
Whereof although his naturall generoſity made him in ſome
ſort careleſſe, yet the ſame influence that gaue him a great ſpirit,
made him alſo penſive in finding out the meanes, how he might with
vertue ore-match deſtiny; and by making himſelfe the forget of his
owne fortunes, verifie, that <hi>the Wiſe man rules theſtarres;</hi> his nature
then being equaliz'd with an education conformable, induced
his Parents (allured with the ſplendor of ſo many graces) to dote on
him as a creature ſingular, in whom the heavens had (with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7477:9"/>
partiality placed all theſe good gifts, which they ordinarily
vſed to ſhare among many. <hi>Metaneone</hi> the eldeſt brother (obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this their inclination, became iealous thereof) began ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hate <hi>Polimero,</hi> that he (borne to endure rather any misfortune,
than domeſtike hatred) purpoſed (though not as then arived to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeeres of age) to leave the countrey; and the effect had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
his deliberation, had not the reverence which he owed his
father, perſwaded him to a diſcreet diſſimulation thereof.</p>
               <p>It hapned that the Queene of <hi>Ireland, Catalampo's</hi> ſiſter, (by
relation enamored of the toward lineſſe of her Nephew) ſent him
ſome pretious gifts, and among thoſe two Iriſh Greyhounds, of the
goodlieſt, and beſt, that were in her kingdome: <hi>Polimero</hi> deſirous to
try them, commanded, that a Lion and Leopard ſhould be led out of
the den of the Lions, into an incloſure, neere the kings Quiry, railed
in with pales for ſuch like baitings; which was no ſooner performed,
but that the Prince came unexpectedly thither. <hi>Polimero</hi> (cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
and affectionatly entertaining him, and leaning on the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
with him,) cauſed one of the Greyhounds to be led in, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Lion. The dogge, as ſoone as hee ſaw the ſauage
beaſt, ſlipt eagerly off, with a great leape. The Lion (laſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his tayle) went on to encounter him; th' other (as if hee
had beene accuſtomed, (all his life time) to wreſtle with ſuch like
beaſts) ſeeing the fierce beaſt make ſtealing-wiſe towards him,
flung himſelfe furiouſly on him, and with his fore feet keeping down
his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm'd pawes, pinch'd him in the eye, with ſo terrible a ſhake, that
the Lion (not able to recover from under him, orecome with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
convuiſion) was conſtrained to forſake himſelfe. If the
wonder of the Prince was great, greater yet was the content of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limero,</hi>
who (having cauſed the railes to be removed away) willed
that th' other Greyhound ſhould be led in, with the Leopard. This
dogge (as if hee envied his fellow) to ſhun the diſadvantagious dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his enemy, encountered ſo furiouſly in the aire, that he ſhookt
his backe againſt the ground, and ere he could get up againe, (ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
on his ſhoulder) tore it ſheere off his body with ſuch facility,
that an hatchet could not have done it more neately. The Prince
(well pleaſed with the fierceneſſe of the Greyhounds, and deſirous to
have them) could not ſatisfie himſelfe in commending them, which
<hi>Polimero</hi> obſerving, profered them unto him, and praying him to
accept of them, the Prince ſaid, <hi>Infante Polimero,</hi> I will not accept them
as a gift, If I have them at all, I will owe fortune for them: chooſe you
out of my ſtable two ſteeds, ſuch as like you beſt; thoſe I will play
againſt your doggs at ſuch a game as we ſhall agree on. <hi>Polimero</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that his gifts (meerely for ill will's ſake) were not accepted, and
that (by law of inferiority) it behooved him to accept the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
replied, My Lord, ſithence that you will not vouchſafe me
this favour that the doggs be immediatly yours, as I am, I cannot
but obey you; But two horſes are too much for a couple of doggs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7477:9"/>
It ſhall ſuffice me (ſo you be therewith contented) to chooſe out
for my ſelfe onely <hi>Flammauro.</hi> (This was a horſe kept in the ſtable
as a thing excellent, whom never any man till then was able
throughly to tame; though he had already diſmounted and kild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twenty Knights: all which <hi>Polimero</hi> knew well, and perſwaded
himſelfe that (in winning this ſteede) he might content himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcontenting his brother; confident withall that himſelfe alone
was able to tame him.)</p>
               <p>The Prince therewith contented, the wager was agreed on, but
not the game, whereof many (that were diſliked of) were propoſed.
<hi>Met aneone</hi> would have it be three carrieres at the Ring; when Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to ſtay the ſadling of the horſes, he ſaw (as he paſſed through
<hi>Polimero's</hi> hall) ſome foiles and blunt ſwords to fence withall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(his minde being altered) he ſaid, <hi>Infante,</hi> Let him of us twaine
loſe his wager, that ſhall with theſe foyles receive the firſt foine of
th' other. Be it as it pleaſe you (My LORD) anſwered <hi>Polimero;</hi> On
this each of them having taken one, the Prince advanced himſelfe
forwards, making with his point towards the others face, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a paſſage (by ſtamping on the ground with his right foote)
ſtood ſtill, expecting his advantage. <hi>Polimero</hi> (who well knew what
opinion the Prince had of himſelfe) making a ſhew of fearing him,
ſtood cloſe in his guard, forbidding him entrance; The Prince (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to dazle him) and ſo put him from his ward) fained at him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
foynes, but with ſo little Iudgement, that the <hi>Infante</hi> (ſeeing him
lye open) touched at two thruſts his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and hat: But the Prince loth
to acknowledge himſelfe the looſer (every one crying <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſuch
thruſts could never have drawne bloud, becauſe they had not made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<hi>Polimero,</hi> who warding his blowes, and ſtanding in a ſteddy guard,
with his point received the Prince in the midſt of his breaſt (as
he advanced forwards with a ſteppe:) who thereupon, all in a chafe
threw away the foyle, and (confeſſing to have loſt) bade leade forth
the horſe. The <hi>Infante</hi> (ſeeing him in ſo fiery a mood) ſaid unto
him, My LORD; ſince that it hath pleaſed you, to let me winne,
that ſo you might beſtow on me your ſteed, I beſeech you to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
me in accepting the Greyhounds: (which the Prince refuſing)
they deſcended the ſtaires into the Court of the Quiry where they

from him) he remained naked ſo well ſhapen and exquiſitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,

of all the horſes in the world) could never have painted one more
perfect <hi>Flammauro</hi> (ſeeing himſelfe at liberty) made no more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
of his bridle, than if it had beene a ſmall thread, and giving
a buſling ſhake (wherewith he threw to the gaound the two horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that held him) after hee had many times raiſed himſelfe in the

and (trampling down many of them, ſhrewdly maimed) he then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7477:10"/>
(wheeling about,) bore downe the Prince himſelfe, who deſirous to
revenge his fall cried, Kill him, kill him. Every man with ſword in
hand ſtrove to obey him. But the fierce courſer (like a skilfull fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer)
kept them aloofe off; untill upon the appearing of ſome lances
(as if he had knowen that his hurt could not be redreſſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
he then quietly (laying aſide all fierceneſſe) drew neere
<hi>Polimero.</hi> Who (taking him gently by the reines, and turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Prince) ſaid: I beſeech your highneſſe, ſeeing (through
the favour of the gods) you haue received no hurt, to grant life
to this faire beaſt for my ſake. I will not, (anſwered irefully the
Prince) but will, that hee dye. Vpon this every man ſtrove who
ſhould be formoſt to come to ſtrike him, which <hi>Polimero</hi> perceiving
to be done in ſcorne of him, and not being able to endure it, lightly
vaulted on the courſer, and gallopping a maine ſpeede out of the
Quirie entred into the Kings ſtables, where (finding by chance the
chiefe rider) he deliuered the horſe into his charge, as a ſpeciall ſteed
of the Kings; denouncing him his Maieſties indignation, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any one (not excepting any man breathing) to lay hands on
him. The rider) aſtoniſhed to ſee one of the Kings ſonnes come ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on ſuch a horſe, imagining that the exception comprehended
no ordinary perſons) anſwered, that he would obey him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
him to ſend for thoſe horſemen, that were accuſtomed to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
him, whereto the <hi>Infante</hi> would not conſent, but cauſed him to
put the horſe (now grown to be gentle) into a good place of ſtanding.
The Prince (in the meane time having underſtood whither the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi>
was gone,) ſtood a good while doubtfull whether hee ſhould
purſue him or no, but pride and diſdaine boyling within him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the palace.</p>
               <p>Some there were in that very inſtant, that acquainted the King
of theſe paſſages, who made as though he knew nothing thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
at the houre of dinner the comming of his ſonnes (according
to the accuſtomed manner) but obſerving <hi>Polimero's</hi> roome void,
and inquiring for him of one of his ſervants (come thither expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that purpoſe) hee was anſwered, that he was in his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chamber, (come newly from abroad, ſomewhat hot and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
but that he was well, and deſired (with his Maieſties good leave)
to dine alone.</p>
               <p>The King (attentively looking on the Prince) perceived his
colour altered. In the meane time, <hi>Polimero</hi> returned from the Kings
ſtables, and (reaſoning with himſelfe upon the matter) was viſited
unawares by his governour the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi> who told him how
the Prince (as hee returned towards the palace) had raſhly let ſlip
that the death of ſome body ſhould redeeme the life of the horſe;
and therefore beſought him to be circumſpect, and for a few daies to
retire himſelfe to (a countrey palace of the Queens cald) <hi>Poggio;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he beleeved that theſe words aimed at no man but him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> (ſeeing the buſineſſe fall out worſe than hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
making ſhew of embracing his aduice) reſolved to depart for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7477:10"/>
good and all, and (taking leave of him) cauſed to be called unto him
<hi>Caraſio.</hi> (This <hi>Caraſio</hi> was a ſquire given him by his father, who
(having ſerved him from his cradle) beſides that he was by nature
loyall, ſo deerely loved him, as he judged that he could not truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other more faithfull and more loving.) Wherefore he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caraſio,</hi> You ſee on what tearmes I ſtand with the Prince my
brother. I am reſolued to give fortune place; Only two things grieve
me, the one is that I muſt part without the conſent of my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
the King, and my Mother; the other, that I have not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the order of Knighthood; But now neceſſity muſt excuſe me
in the one, and aſſiſt me in the other; See that thoſe armes which we
over-ſaw ſome daies agoe be put in a readineſſe, with that little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that I have, and ſuch jewels as you thinke may beſt ſtead, and leſſe
comber me. Chooſe you out for your ſelfe one of my ſteeds, the

of my exile. And as <hi>Caraſio</hi> would haue ſaid ſomething, <hi>Polimero</hi>
(interrupting him) replied; I know what you would ſay, It greeves
you that I part, in reſpect of the diſcontent my father will conceive
there-from. It ſeems that my reſolution is raſh and overhaſty not (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beene adviſed thereon) proceeding (as you believe from ſome

(being of age to diſcerne and know my owne danger) were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſimple if want of yeeres ſhould hinder me to eſchew it. My father
I will ſatisfie, (not with my preſence, becauſe I may not) but by my
letters, and much more with my actions. Here is not any patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for me: we are to many brothers, my ſelfe the yongeſt of all, and
not like to enioy othe eportion than my brothers hatred; my fathers
love ſhould not make me hope for any thing, who (being aged) muſt
by courſe of nature dye ſhortly; and he once gone, who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
me againſt ſuch an one, as is naturally inclined to tyrannize over
me: and beleeveth, that the deceitfull love of the vulgar ſhould edge
me on to cauſe him leade a life full of miſery and ſuſpition? Fortune
(<hi>Caraſio</hi>) is a woman, and conſequently a lover of youth, ſeeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               <p>To waite irreſolutely for time, is but to loſe time, and to bring

And though I were not in ſuch danger as I am, yet muſt I goe get
my ſelfe a patrimony elſewhere, ſince that the ſpite of fortune made
me bee borne laſt, and the rigor of the law makes mee (for being
borne ſuch) poore and miſerable. Ther's none can deny, but that I

queſtioned of the cauſe of his comming to the City, whileſt he ought
to have beene an aſſiſtant in the ſervice of the <hi>Infante Polimero</hi>) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
He was come for ſome ſervice of the houſe: And that as
touching the <hi>Infante Polimero,</hi> he underſtood not his Maieſties mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>How, underſtandeſt thou me not? (replied the King) what I
would tell thee is; that, when any of my ſonnes come to <hi>Poggio,</hi>
thou depart not thence, but ſerve them as cauſe ſhall require. Even
ſo doe I, my Leige, (anſwered the houſekeeper) and acknowledge
my ſelfe blame-worthy if I did otherwiſe: But, my Lord, the <hi>Infante
Polimero</hi> is not at <hi>Poggio.</hi> How? is he not there, (ſaid the King ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
angrily) and having eſpied the Gentleman that had told him he
was gone thither, he ſaid; Did you not tell me that <hi>Polimero</hi> was gone
to <hi>Poggio?</hi> I did ſo, my Liege (anſwered the Gentleman) citing with
that his authors, who were ſome of the <hi>Infante's</hi> ſervants there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
who joyntly proteſted that they ſaw him mount on horſeback,
and that he would not ſuffer any man come with him, but gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>My dread Soveraigne (ſaid he) my Lord the <hi>Infante Polimero</hi>
parted yeſterday in the evening to goe to <hi>Poggio,</hi> I know not where
he may be; he came not the laſt evening, nor this laſt night, much
leſſe this morning; for I dined there, neither is it above an houre ſince
I parted thence. The King (fixing his eyes on the table) knew not
what to imagine, he thought firſt hee might be gone to his uncle in
<hi>Numidia,</hi> but that ſeemed impoſſible; conſidering the diſcommodity
of the journey becauſe of the ſands: it being not likely he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
that journey ſecretly with ſo much danger, and beſides he
would have feared to be purſued and overtane.</p>
               <p>Afterwards (reaſoning on the old deſires he had to travell) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in that alſo appeared difficulty, being he could not doe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a great proviſion of monies: But (the remembrance of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Queene of <hi>Ireland</hi> come into his fancy) he imagined that for
certaine, he was imbarqued to goe to her, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſee what manner of ſhipping had ſet out of the Port that
night, and whither they went; and from whence they were; but
finding that there parted no other than a ſhip of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more confuſed than before, not judging it a thing likely that he
was gone for <hi>Sardegna,</hi> but that the ſhip had rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

griefe,) beganne the pitifulleſt complaint that could be.</p>
               <p>The King (not able to endure the ſight of her in that plight)

               <p>Being come to the ſtudy he cauſed it to be opened, wherein the

ſaid,</p>
               <p>Sir; Among all the misfortunes, which I have hitherto in theſe
my few yeeres partaked of, the greateſt is that I part without your
Maieſties royall licence, which if I had done in way of diſobedience,
or other ſuch like thing, my life would be loathſome unto me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could that joy be found that might any way caſe me. But (Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Sir,) I hitherto ever have and henceforth ever will ſtudy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
you: whereof although the obligation takes away the merit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7477:12"/>
yet bereaves it not me of that comfort which a noble minde receives
in doing his duty: I am gone away, not for any curioſities ſake to ſee
my ſelfe free; nor for any deſire I had to exerciſe my ſelfe in the
profeſſion of armes; Since that in the one I aſpire to no greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
than to ſerve your Maieſtie, neither had your clemency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me (in its time fit) in the other ſuch reaſonable ſatisfaction, and
in ſuch an equipage, as had beene anſwerable to the honor I have in
being your ſonne. The ſole cauſe of my going away is, Becauſe the
ſmall fortune I have in the favour of my LORD the Prince, hath ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
adviſed me; Had I thought I could be able to have bettered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I owe him, and ſo becom more gracious in his favor, heavens be
my witneſſe, I had never entertained ſuch a reſolution, knowing that
next your Maieſtie he is that only one whom I ought to ſerve and
honour. But ſeeing my conſcience doth not accuſe me of miſdoing,
I muſt needs confeſſe, my behaviour to be ſuch as cannot pleaſe him:
And if my duty be to pleaſe him, but cannot, then am I obliged to
what I can, which is, to abſent farre from him my preſence, which
ſo much diſlikes him. Touching the laſt occaſion of my departure I
am not willing to ſay any thing, not meaning to excuſe my ſelfe, by
pretending, that I could not find any reaſon in my LORD the Prince,
who indeed cannot doe amiſſe in any thing he doth againſt me; But

               <p>The King ſtrangely mooved at this letter (having called for the
Prince) with an Irefull countenance thus ſpake unto him. <hi>Metaneone,</hi>
I intended (many daies agoe) to make knowne unto you your ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards your brother the <hi>Infante Polimero:</hi> but misfortune hath
ſo prevailed, that I have differ'd it ſo long as it is now paſt remedy
you are the cauſe that I have loſt him, in which loſſe I yet enjoy this
comfort, that you alſo have loſt him, and that beſides 'tis you that
ſhall repent it; you are firſt borne, 'tis true; but by meere fortune;
And hee is laſt borne; by the ſame reaſon: But for his vertues
worthy to be the firſt; And thou for thy vices worthy to be, not the
laſt, but none at all; ſo much exceeds he thee in worth, that thou (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou couldſt not match him in equality of deſerts) didſt (of
meere malice) endevour to reduce him to thoſe termes of deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Neither had thy fault beene ſo inſupportable, if what induced
thee thereto had not beene unworthy of a Prince; (who is
obliged to love vertue, and not to abhorre it:) yet if thou would'ſt
needs offend in ſuch a caſe, then ſhould thy fault have beene a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
envy to emulate vertue, where it was; now with what face canſt
thou ſhew thy ſelfe to the world? with what reaſons canſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7477:12"/>
thy ſelfe? with thy hopes (perhaps) and intereſſes to the crown?
Intereſſes of a Tyrant and no Prince. Think'ſt thou thy ſelfe ſurer of
ſucceſſion if thou wer'ſt alone? peradventure thou doſt imagine the
being of many brothers to be prejudiciall unto thee, and among them
eſpecially him, that is moſt worthy: knoweſt thou not that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

good, ſaving them a labour of ſeeking a maſter elſewhere, which
cannot be done without endangering a ſtate? Neither art thou depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the meanes of avoiding this hazard by out-going the reſt in
goodneſſe, being a matter that lies in thy owne power; and although
it were granted that all thy ſuppoſitions were indeed as thou wouldſt

to diſaffect him, and yet haſt hated him, thou haſt made thy ſelfe
unworthy to be ſuch an one as nature hath made thee to be. And let
thus much ſuffice, for what concernes thee.</p>
               <p>Now touching what concerns me, I thee tell that in this caſe I am
doubly intereſſed, both as a father and as a Iudge; as a father, I accuſe
thee that thou haſt rob'd me of my ſonne, that thou haſt made him a

                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> (hearing theſe cruell words of the King) was even
halfe dead for grief, becauſe the ingenuity of his bloud working in
him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irred up from the more internall parts of the heart the ſeeds of
vertue, ſowed there by education, and till then dead and buried; but

your affections (deſerving all immoderation for ſo wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to exerciſe the rigor worthy for ſo great a fault, againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
perſon of that caytive wretch that hath ſo maliciouſly commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it: I beſeech you (My LORD) that (ſtript naked of all pitty)
you cloath your ſelfe with the robes of juſtice, and that you ſeverely
puniſh me that have ſo highly offended you, I having not deſerved to
have any place (much leſſe the firſt) in the book of your generation:
I know not (My LORD) how it is poſſible that I (your ſonne, and
nurſt with the crums of your royall vertues) have ſuffered my ſelfe
to precipitate into ſo baſe a fault, borne to bee a ſlave to my owne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7477:13"/>
ſenſuality (without having participated of any of your perfections)
but dazled with the lightſome ſplendor of thoſe of my noble bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
My Liege, had not your Majeſtie condemned me to ſeeke him
out, I had beſought you to favour we with that imployment, not as
a puniſhment or penance (for ſuch to mee could it not have beene)
but as a ſupreame favour, being aſſured that if I find him not, and
though I finde him, if I obtaine not his gratious pardon (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend of other than a <hi>Polimero</hi>) I ſhall leade but an ever-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life: And if my ill behaviour have offended you (my Leige)
loſt you a ſonne and therewithal ſcandalized the world. I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with my future actions to deſerve your Majeſties pardon: And
that both my love and reſpect towards my brother may yeeld a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
teſtimony of my repentance; and alſo that my future courſe
of life (contrary to that I formerly affected) may give the world a
good example. And although I be not worthy to be called your
ſonne, yet (ſeeing it lies not in the power of my fault to cancell that
character of nature) I beſeech your Maieſtie to favour me with ſome
ſigne or aſſurance of my future reintegration into your royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to the end that my conſcience (ſtung with the foulneſſe of it's

as overcome with its infirmity, procure mee that have loſt
you a worthy ſon by malice, to loſe you alſo an unworthy one by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
which ſaid, imbracing the knees of his father (which ſtood
as a Rocke immovable) he humbly kiſſed them, weeping ſo piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
that the King (not able longer to containe himſelfe) raiſed him
up from the ground, and (having firſt turned aſide to drie the teares
of his eyes;) <hi>Metaneone</hi> (ſaid he) I am not a father ſo inexorable,
but that I (ſeeing thy unfained repentance) can pardon thee.</p>
               <p>And though the departure of <hi>Polimero</hi> be grievous unto me, yet
nevertheleſſe ſo much prize l thy repentance, that thy becomming a
new man doth temperate the griefe I conceive of his loſſe: Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I will in any caſe have him againe, for my comfort, and thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I cannot yet imagine where he may be gone. Neither can I
(by this letter found in his ſtudy) gather any thing of his journey:
Reade it, and to morrow wee will reſolve of what ſhall bee
done.</p>
               <p>The Prince (having read the letter) was well pleaſed with his
brothers modeſty, and thought the time long of imbarking himſelfe
to goe finde him out, and bring him home againe. But the Queene
(being informed by the King of the conference had with his ſonne,
of the humble ſpeeches he uſed, and of the unfained teares which he
ſaw ſpring from his heart) prayed the King not to ſuffer him
to goe: wherto he had willingly condeſcended, if the doubt of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe too credulous (leſt this repentance were counterfeited)
had not confirm'd him in his former deliberation: But the Queene
(urging earneſtly the buſineſſe) with many reaſons drew
him at laſt to be of her opinion, they agreeing to ſend in his ſtead
the <hi>Count of Bona,</hi> who in a well arm'd galley ſhould ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7477:13"/>
The Prince (as ſoone as hee underſtood that the King was
gone from his mother) went thither: And in the ſame manner as he
had done with his father, (accuſing himſelfe of his ill carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his brother) beſought her pardon: But (perceiving that ſhe
conſented not to what was propoſed, touching his going to ſeeke his
brother) proſtrating himſelfe before her, he beſought her with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo lively, and teares ſo effectuall, that ſhe (mollified in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſee her ſonnes reconciled) was content to let him goe.</p>
               <p>The Prince forthwith cauſed to be rig'd and trim'd up the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
which was a baſtard Galley of three and thirty banks with ſixe
men to an oare, he armed her with twiſe as many croſſebow-men as
ſouldiers, and furniſhed the remnant with knights, and adorning her
with double harneſſe, tackling and furniture, he choſe to take along
with him for counſellor the ſame <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona.</hi> By whom though
hee were adviſed that the Galley would onely ſerve in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi>
ſea, as farre as the ſtraights, but that (being to paſſe thence to
Ireland in reſpect of incommodity and perill of the long veſſels in
thoſe ſeas,) it would be good to take a-long with them a ſpare ſhippe
for that purpoſe; yet reſolved hee to bring with him no other but
the Galley, becauſe ſhe (being well rig'd and man'd) might overtake
<hi>Polimero's</hi> ſhippe ere ſhe could reach to the ſtraights (being that ſhe
parted but a day and two nights before them; in which time ſhe had
no good wind, but onely one night and ſome few houres the day
following, the reſt of the time being calme as it continued to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſtant:) And if hee ſhould neede to paſſe any further, he might
then either leave the Galley in the ſtraights, or ſend her backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and there hire or buy a round veſſell.</p>
               <p>The Prince having kiſſed the King and Queens hands aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Galley, and (cauſing the ghing to ply the ſea with their oares)
vaniſhed in an inſtant out of the channell of <hi>Birſa,</hi> and leaving on one
hand <hi>Porto-Farina, Biſerta,</hi> and <hi>Capo di ferro,</hi> and on the other the Iland
of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> ſteer'd a courſe right on towards the ſtraights, the Galley
ſlaues being eaſed by a little gale that blew from the ſhoreward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> in the meane ſeaſon ſayled very penſive (his veſſell run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the courſe of <hi>Sardegna,</hi>) hee could find in himſelfe no comfort
becauſe of the diſcurteſies of his brother, nor quietneſſe for having
in ſuch a faſhion forſaken his parents: The noble Pilot (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
much in his generous preſence) knew well who he was, and
(ſeeing him ſo heavy) imagined that there was ſome thing occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it (his age and conſtitution not being ſuch as might argue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.)
Whereupon (deſirous to make him merry) he ſaid,
Sir, If you were conſtrained to make this voyage of neceſſity,
which (I beleeve) you doe onely of your owne free will, I would
imagine you could not be exempt from feare, being you goe to a
place where the landing is ſomewhat dangerous: If ſuch be the cauſe
of your heavineſſe (which I beleeve not) I beſeech you be of good
courage: Becauſe (God willing) I hope (if you vouchſafe to marke
what I ſhall tell you) to direct you in ſuch a manner, as you may

enjoy the ſight of the warres without participating the perills there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> (that purpoſed to goe for Ireland, and had put himſelfe
in that ſhippe only to get out the ſpeedier from <hi>Birſa;</hi> and that till
then underſtood nothing of that warre) deſired to heare: the relation
thereof. The Pilot moſt willing to obey him, and aſſuring him
that he ſhould underſtand a memorable (though a pittifull) hiſtory,
thus began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arato</hi> King of <hi>Sardegna</hi> (whither we are going) had two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the one a male named <hi>Peroſphilo,</hi> and the other a female called
<hi>Eromena:</hi> both ſo beautifull, as that the world never produced a
goodlier couple; But that which chiefly adorned their fading and
corruptible beauties were the everlaſting perfections of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mort
all ſoules, whereby the one hath already, and the other doth
at this preſent ſhew her ſelfe admirable to ſuch as know her.</p>
               <p>The prince <hi>Peroſphilo</hi> was growne up to about your yeeres (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I conceive not above ſixteene) when after he was dub'd an
arm'd Knight, he ſo manifeſted the dexterity or his body, as (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his home, and ſpending ſower yeares time abroad in moſt
noble atchievements) he made himſelfe therby (though unknowne)
famous and knowne over all the world. But (recalled by often meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
from his father) he returned home with ſuch rich tropheyes,
ſtore of good manners and languages, that (diſplaying them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
without oſtentation) he both amazed and delighted ſuch as
were ſo fortunate as to enioy the happineſſe either of his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or ſervice: whilſt he thus travelled abroad to paſſe the time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
loſing it; <hi>Eromena</hi> at home made ſuch a benefit and uſe of hers,
as every man thought he could not make a richer gaine of his time
than to ſpend it in admiring her; whoſe imployments were a noble
and ſolid curioſity of knowing things in their beginnings; a ſtrict
vigilancy to accuſe and correct her ſelfe, if her perfections could
have beene capable of the leaſt error; To ſpeculate the meanes of
negotiating with diverſity of perſons, and to put the ſame in practiſe
with the meaſure of more and leſſe, according to the difference and
merits of each one: and to yeeld every one ſatisfaction, ſo as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(how highly ſoever favoured) could preſume to judge himſelfe

that ſhee participated it to all with a proportion ſo regular, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(how meane conditioned ſoever) came thereby to loſe or gaine in

               <p>This court then (by meanes of theſe two princes) ſo flouriſhed,

Iouſts and tourneyes, entertainements of armes and love: ſo as ſuch

               <p>Among the principall dames of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> among the faireſt
and beſt eſteemed of the Princeſſe, was <hi>Talaſia,</hi> Lady Marqueſſe of
<hi>Saſſari,</hi> a young Lady of nineteene yeares of age, brought up with
the Princeſſe <hi>Eromena.</hi> Who though married, had yet no occaſion
to leave the court, becauſe her husband (a harſh fellow, but of a great
ſpirit) ſerved the King as Admirall of his fleete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peroſphilo</hi> at his returne home was two and twentie yeere old, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all which time Love could never get any victory over him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ever till then daunted with the Maieſty of his vertues, imployed
in ſo many heroike actions: But (eſpying him now idle) thought it
the fitteſt time to bring him under his obeyſance, and (becauſe
hee had beene his wilfull enemy) with a miſerable and tragicall
ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>The Lady Admiral kept continually the Princeſſe her company,
neither came the Prince ever to the lodging of his ſiſter, but that hee
there found her; And finding in her at firſt ſight regard-worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
hee thought well of her, ere the deſtinies compled him to love
her, neither imagined ſhee ever that the favours of the Prince were
other than meere termes of gentility; wherewith ſhe being caught,
began to love him, ere ſhee thought her ſelfe belov'd of him; yet as
the native vertue of the one, ſerved as a remedy to quell downe the
growing fire; ſo the ſeemely modeſty of the other (fearing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
too high made her conceale that flame, which in the end redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to aſhes both her life and honor.</p>
               <p>The Prince (in his long travels) lighted on a thouſand occaſions
of love, which he eſchewed, to ſhunne any thing that might diſturbe
the honorable courſe of his worthy enterpriſes; and now, freed
from this care (as though other occaſions deſerved not ſuch or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obſtacles) hee ſuffered himſelfe to bee bound, and being but a
Noviſt in that practiſe, thought at firſt, there was no ſuch matter
to bee doubted of, but deceiving himſelfe (and beleeving that faire
parts in a beloved object, were onely faire for being vertuous) hee
perceived not how the more he eſteemed it, the more it pleaſed him,
and the more it pleaſed him, the more it inflamed him.</p>
               <p>After that vertue (a greenefu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll for ſuch a fire) was ſomewhat
dry'd up, and that it's ſmoake (which were good inſpirations) eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
away through the chimni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of youth, the flame of the one
began ſo lively to communicate it ſelfe with the flame of the other,
that joyned both in one they became to be (by little and little) an
infernall <hi>Mongibello.</hi> The Prince meditating with himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
(as a preſager of what was to enſue) all the miſchiefe that
afterwards befell him. There lay repreſented before him his
Illuſtrious deeds, his renowne acquir'd, with thoſe his royall vertues
that purchaſed him the good opinion of the world, then the quality
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7477:15"/>
of the woman (not for being his inferior, but for being married) and
becauſe her husband was a noble and valiant knight, the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſervant, and a well deſerver of the crowne.</p>
               <p>But that which more than all the reſt tormented him was his
conſcience, gnawing him ſo ſhrewdly, and ſtinging him ſo deepely,
that the very Imagination of the ſinne was to him both penance
and torment.</p>
               <p>This conflict betweene him and reaſon, laſted well-nigh two
yeeres, during which time he did as much as a well governed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
could doe, and thought to eaſe his heart of this conceit by
liſtning to the marriage which his father treated for him with the
Princeſſe of <hi>Maiorica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſubtile Lady Admirall (who was long before aware of
the Prince's love to her-ward; and did oft hope that the heate of
youth, and delight of enjoying would in time vanquiſh all the
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> of vertue and reaſon) when ſhe underſtood that hee had
condeſcended to the concluſion of the marriage (ſo long for her ſake
ſuſpended) was ready to grow franticke with the very thought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
But honeſty ſo tempered her affctions, that concealing inwardly
her griefe ſhee ſeemed in outward ſhew to be more joyfull than ever
before: Meane time the diſeaſe creeping inwardly, brought her to her
bed for not bringing her to her Beere, which had been better for her.
The Phyſitians knew not what to doe, her impairing was manifeſt,
her diſeaſe unknowne and ſtrange, yea meere conjectures were defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
becauſe the meanes (whereby to coniecture) were wanting; they
applied vnto her foments, but not ſuch as ſhe required, they gave her
cordialls, but not proportionable to her melancholy: ſo as (ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the evill and deſpairing of the cure) they left her in the hands
of fortune; The Princeſſe (that truly loved her) conceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
an extreame griefe, not omitting to viſite her dayly, having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her to bee brought to the Palace in a covered chaire, and couch'd
her in a withdrawing chamber neer her owne.</p>
               <p>The Prince (for all his reſolution made never more to thinke
of her) could take no reſt, neither thought he that hee could poſſibly
live if ſhe died, he asked for her often of <hi>Eromena,</hi> and was ſomewhat
ſolaced in hearing the ſweete harmony of her name. But finding one
day his ſiſter with bitter ſobs bemoaning her as dead, hee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her, intermingling among the offices of conſoling, an expreſſion
of a certaine pious deſire he had to ſee her: wherupon his ſiſter ſaid,
Alas, my LORD and brother, and well are you thereto obliged, for
you owne not that ſubject that is more obſervant of you than <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi> with much a-doe could the Prince refraine from teares, when
(concealing his griefe) hee ſaid, Let us goe (<hi>Madam</hi>) to doe this
charitable office, which I had done long ere this, had not the due
reſpects of her ſexe withheld me.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe would firſt know what ſhe did, and would goe
give her notice how that the Prince would come viſit her. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<hi>Talaſia,</hi> that ſtood on the point of death, and who (having
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7477:15"/>
abandoned all earthly things) retaind only the love of her <hi>Peroſphilo;</hi>
underſtanding that ſhe ſhould ſee him before her death, was the beſt
contented woman in the world; and not wanting her gentile ſpirits
(although deprived of all the reſt;) ſent him word, that ſhe having
never merited much, and now (being a carkaſſe) nothing at all ſhould
exceedingly joy to carry with her to her grave the honour of being
ſo highly and gratiouſly favoured of her LORD and Prince.</p>
               <p>The chamber-windowes were all ſhut, ſo that whoſoever came
therein, ſaw nothing, but onely heard a pitifull murmure of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by, and ſometimes the languiſhing ſighs of the ſicke Lady.
<hi>Peroſphilo</hi> was conducted unto her bed whilſt the Princeſſe would
needs goe know of the women what ſhe ſaid or did ſince ſhe had
left her.</p>
               <p>The grieved Prince knew not how to frame his ſpeech, yet (with
a pittifull accent) enquired of her diſeaſe; Shee (with an amorous
hearts griefe able to become viſible in darkneſſe it ſelfe, thanking
him for having ſo much abaſed himſelfe as to come viſite her
his moſt humble handmaid) anſwered him; that ſhee knew it not
otherwiſe, but that ſhe muſt needs die. The Prince (in a manner
illuminated by this anſwer, but much more by her manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
it) ſuſpected what the matter was indeed; but (deſirous to be
better cleared of his doub:) having beſought her to comfort and
cheere up her ſelfe, hee prayed her to len<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> him her pulſe, and there
withall leſt ſhe night take cold by putting forth her arme;) he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in his hand gently to it</p>
               <p>But ſhe (feeling her ſelfe touched with that hand which ſhee ſo
much deſired) not able longer to refraine, tooke it betweene her
two hands, and (ſweetly kiſſing it and bathing it with her teares) ſaid
unto him; Behold LORD, how that I, a dead woman have now
more courage, than I had when I was lively: I beſeech your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to pardon me, I preſume too much, I know it I offend againſt
mine own honeſty, but much more againſt your reſolution (which is
by not loving me to compell me to die) yet this doth me good, that
you (being the cauſe of my death) doe now know it; you neede
feele no other pulſe than my heart, which (being in you) you may
keepe (as you pleaſe) dead or alive, and by it give mee either life
or death.</p>
               <p>The Prince (orecome with ſupreame tenderneſſe of affection)
anſwered, (<hi>Madam</hi>) I have, and doe love you, and if I reſolved to
ſtrive to conceale my affection, yet did I it not with an intent to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
it from you, I beſeech you, recover, and be well, otherwiſe
my life ſhall end with your death. Scarce had he finiſhed the laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of his ſpeech, when the Princeſſe came unto them: Who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
asked her how ſhe felt her ſelfe, ſaid unto her, <hi>Talaſia,</hi> I pray
you torment me not by depriving me of you. All the world will
have your ſickneſſe to be nothing elſe but a meere melancholy, and
therfore the remedy lies in your owne power; what want you wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will you be your owne murthereſſe? If you will not recover for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7477:16"/>
any others ſake, yet doe it for mine. See (my LORD and brother) the
Prince is come to viſite you, and I am ſure that you cannot pleaſe
him better than in recovering. The Lady Admirall (who had
already chaſed away all melancholy, and who full of content
thought the time long that ſhe left not her bed) anſwered; The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
(<hi>Madam</hi>) you doe me are ſuch, as it is impoſſible for me to
die, though I would; I am not ſo fooliſh but that I know, that it is
better for mee to ſtay here, and ſerve you, than to lie in the grave
with my anceſtors: I will endeavour to obey you; and doe already
perceive my ſelfe to have that ability which before I had not, I am
toomuch obliged to my LORD the Prince, by whoſe gratious viſit I
acknowledge my ſelfe revived, for at his comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng in, I felt my ſelfe
ſo amend, as I now hold my ſelfe fully recovered.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe very gladſome (embracing her about the necke)
kiſſed her, and (having together with the Prince accompained her
a good while) left her, being well pleaſed to ſee manifeſt ſignes of her
amendment, neither deceived ſhe her ſelfe therein; for in eight
daies ſpace ſhee returned in her former plight both of health and
beauty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peroſphilo,</hi> having thus (under the pretext of pitty) given reines
to ſenſe, thought the time tedious till he ſhould enjoy her; and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her at his ſiſters, agreed to ſpeake with her that night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter into her houſe through a ſecret doore, (ſtanding towards
an alley frequented of few;) her husband was then executing his
charge in the fleete on ſuſpition of the King of <hi>Corſica,</hi> who gave no
obſcure ſignes of enmity: Becauſe he requiring for wife <hi>Eromena</hi> the
Princeſſe, <hi>Arato</hi> denied her him (ſeeing his daughter not thereto
inclined) this King (who is called <hi>Epicamedo</hi>) being of a crabbed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
pimple-faced and a creple: Whereupon pretending old titles
to the Iland of <hi>Aſinara,</hi> a naturall member of <hi>Sardegna</hi> (it ſeemed)
he would by this pretext moleſt that kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now the Lady Admirall had in her houſe many maids and
women, to whom ſhe would not truſt her ſelfe, beleeving ſhe might
better commit her life and honour both into the hands of <hi>Prodotima</hi>
her ſlave (with many courteſies obliged unto her;) who withall was
already (ſome time paſt) a ſervant in the Admirals houſe; and ſhee
(ſeeing her ſelfe become her miſtres treaſurer of a ſecret of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance)
was infinitely glad thereof, hoping to reape there-from
no ordinary profit; ſhee was borne in <hi>Orcano</hi> and taken on thoſe
ſhores, when ſhe (running away with her lover) endevoured to ſave
her ſelfe from the fury of her parents, that came purſuing her, not
becauſe they cared either for her or for the honor of their blood
(ſhe being but baſely borne) but becauſe at her parting away ſhe had
broken up the cheſt in the warehouſe (where her father was factor)
and ſtolen there-out the money.</p>
               <p>And (becauſe matters ill begun end worſe) her fortune was to
eſcape her parents, and periſh among ſtrangers, for the galleys of
<hi>Sardegna</hi> being (by a great tempeſt) wether-beaten and driven to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7477:16"/>
that ſhore, the two Fugitives (ſpied by the Galley-ſlaves) were by
them firſt taken and ſtript, and then preſented to the Admirall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andropodo</hi> (which was the ſecret lecher) was put to ſerve in the
ſtable, and ſhe (being an artificiall diſſembler) knew ſo well how to
worke for her ſelfe, that ſhe was withdrawen from baſe ſlavery to
ſervices more civill, about the perſon of her Miſtreſſe. And now
(perceiving her ſelfe imployed in affaires of ſo great conſequence) ſhe
(with well compoſed words) promiſed her utmoſt helpe, and being
rich in invention, diſcourſed upon the manner and means of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Prince with ſuch circumſpection, as the poore <hi>Talaſia</hi>
thought it impoſſible to perceive it her ſelfe, much leſſe her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and gave her forthwith (in earneſt of her liberality) two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
crownes of gold. At the appointed houre came <hi>Perosfilo</hi> (armed
with a ſword, a little buckler, and a halfe coat of maile) ſo ſecretly,
as that not any of his ſervants were any way privy to his going,
becauſe ſome dayes before he had begunne to locke himſelfe in his
chamber, with a deviſe that lying a bed, he could with a little cord,
open and pull towards him the doore; ſo now alſo hee cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be ſet a bed, but as ſoone as the Gentlemen that waited on him
were gone, he put on his cloathes himſelfe, and getting out by a ſecret
ladder went on to the Admirals houſe, where he needed not to touch
the doore, ſo vigilant was the villanous <hi>Prodotima,</hi> who (expecting
him, with the doore under-shut) ſuddenly leade him the way in. It's
needleſſe to tell you of the joy and pleaſure of the two Lovers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the imagination unable to conceive it, deprives the tongue of
the ability of expreſſing it: let it ſuffice, that they did their beſt to
recompence the two yeares time, loſt to their loves, with the perill
of death incurr'd by her in her laſt ſickneſſe; and well might they
doe it, there concurring in them both, love, beauty, and youth, to
make them humanely happy.</p>
               <p>This practiſe continued happily, untill ſuch time as <hi>Prodotima</hi>
(rewarded by her Miſtreſſe, and inriched by the Prince) beganne to
deſire to enjoy in liberty the ſelfeſame pleaſures with her <hi>Andropodo</hi>
But knew not what courſe to take, becauſe to run away was a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter, and to delay time grieved her; not ſo much, becauſe it is
a thing ordinary to expect with impatience, the fruition of diſhoneſt
deſires, as becauſe ſhe (hoording up every day more gifts and coine)
doubted leſt the abundance thereof ſhould redound more to her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
than profit; juſt as it chanced her, when ſhe was taken with the
Galleyes. At length after ſhe had a long time conceited divers
projects, ſhe ran her head into the moſt deteſtable miſchiefe that ever
was heard of in the world; and there, (without paſſing any further)
ſhe ſtaid: this alone ſeeming unto her to be the way to re-have their
liberty, regaine her ſweet-heart, and to enjoy happily her ill-gotten
riches. Wherefore having cauſed <hi>Andropodo</hi> to come unto her, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe came to the purpoſe, ſhe leſſoned him what he ſhould ſay,
if by chance any body had obſerved them talke together,) and then
afterwards ſhe thus began.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:7477:17"/>
                  <hi>Andropodo,</hi> I will not make thee any long ſtories of my
love, nor of the loſſes and ſufferings I have endured for thy
loves ſake, as well becauſe thou already knoweſt them, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have no ſpare time at this preſent to loſe in matters ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
it ſhall ſuffice me onely to remember thee, how that I
have beene rob'd, and that I am now a ſlave, for nothing elſe but for
loving and following thee; not making any reckoning of the reſt, as
the loſſe of honor, countrey and friends, becauſe I ever have, and
yet doe prize all as nothing in compariſon of thy deare ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>What I have to tell thee is, that I, deſirous we might recover
againe our liberty, (among many waies by mee thought of) have
found out onely one eaſie, and (as I beleeve) without any danger.
But that which ſhould cauſe us to deſire it the more (although it bee
of it ſelfe deſireable) is, becauſe we now are in caſe and ability of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
it ſweetly, without being beholding to any, my ſelfe being
worth between Iewels and money neere about ſix thouſand crowns,
by what meanes I came by them, thou ſhalt underſtand with the
reſt: But firſt, thou ſhould'ſt not marvaile, why I have till now
concealed this from thee, becauſe it was a matter of exceeding great
importance, and though I well know that I may aſſuredly truſt thee
in any thing, yet know I alſo, that if I had made thee privy thereto,
I could not have refrained from being good unto thee, and thou by
ſpending, had'ſt given occaſion to others of being inquiſitive, how
thou couldſt come by thoſe monies, and ſo our affaires might have
beene peradventure indangered.</p>
               <p>Then diſcovered ſhe unto him the love between the Prince and
her miſtreſſe, ſhewing him all the preſents beſtowed on her by them,
and (taking out of her cheſt a purſe) ſhe ſaid unto him, What I
have thought of to be done, is this; that thou goe to our Maſter, and
tell him that upon condition that he grant us our liberty, thou wilt
diſcloſe unto him a matter of great importance, neerly concerning
the principall of his intereſſes; thou muſt ſpeake of me, not as if
I knew the ſecret, but as thy fellow-ſlave and taken in thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
aſſuring him that to know it he would not ſtand on granting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
not onely to two but even to two hundred ſlaves; which
if hee promiſe (and that thou gheſſe it bee made in ſuch ſort as if he
meant really to performe it,) then tell him, that I, (not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to ſee him ſo highly injuried) have ſent thee unto him, wherein
if he doubt of being deceived, beſeech him to come ſecretly, and his
owne eyes ſhall ſee the manifeſtation thereof. But if he chance to
deny thee, and will needs by all meanes know the matter, then ſet
not thy ſelfe about this enterpriſe, if thou haſt not the courage to
reſolve to die in torments, rather than to confeſſe it.</p>
               <p>The hazard I confeſſe is great, but well recompenced with thy
liberty, my perſon, and thoſe riches thou here ſeeſt, wherewithall
we will live all our lives time moſt happily. Here take theſe hundred
crownes, if thou wilt goe, let them ſerve thee in thy journey; But if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7477:17"/>
thou canſt not finde in thy heart to goe, then enjoy them, (but with
ſuch ſobriety, as the aire perceive thee not to have them) untill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
offer us ſome other occaſion.</p>
               <p>The ſlave as raſh as malicious (having ſuddenly made a briefe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with himſelfe, and ballanced the danger with the benefit,) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to goe, aſſuring her that no torment in the world, ſhould
force one word out of his mouth: onely it ſeemed unto him a matter
worthy of conſideration, whether they might truſt to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their maſters promiſe, ſeeing it lay not in their power to
force him thereto. And <hi>Prodotima</hi> judging the conſideration to be
of moment, (after ſhe had awhile ſtood ſomewhat doubtfull) ſaid
unto him: We (my <hi>Andropodo</hi>) can never aſpire to our liberty, but
by ſome ſtrange and unexpected accident, which the gods alone
know, when any ſuch may happen; as for me I can well ſtay for it,
for though I be a ſlave by name, yet am I in effect a free woman:
my miſtreſſe being my ſlave upon the matter, neither can ſhe deale
otherwiſe than well with me, who have in my hands both her heart
and life: but thou, that leadeſt a painefull life, canſt no long time
prolong it, without danger of thy health, yea, and of thy life it ſelfe;
wherefore beleeve me, that what I doe, that doe I not for my owne
ſake (becauſe I can never have a happier nor better fortune than I
already enjoy) but it is for thy ſake I doe it, without whom I can
take no joy, neither in fortune, nor in any goods whatſoever; and
albeit in an eſtate ſo highly raiſed, we ought to governe our ſelves
with all prudencie, yet, if thou thinkeſt that it lies in our power to
prevent all dangers, thou art deceived, for fortune will have a ſhare
in our actions, and for the moſt part wee ſhould referre our ſelves
to her. On theſe ſpeeches <hi>Andropodo</hi> reſolved to goe.</p>
               <p>The fleete rode then hard by <hi>Iſoletta Aſinara</hi> (to which the King
of <hi>Corſica</hi> pretended title) in the port of <hi>Torre,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Calari</hi>
a hundred and ſixteene miles: and the way to goe thither, paſſed
through <hi>Saſſari</hi> (a place of the Admirals) where he then reſided for
its commodiouſneſſe, who being there in his owne houſe, was not
above eight mile diſtant from the fleete.</p>
               <p>There accompanied him in that inſtant a high ſpirited young
gentleman (his owne cozen) the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montevero,</hi> and with him
the Baron of <hi>Friſano</hi> (his kinſman, brought thither by him to ſee
the Admirall.)</p>
               <p>The ſlave noting his maſter all alone, preſented himſelfe before
him, and ſaid; My Lord, you wonder to ſee me here unſent for, but
the occaſion that drew me hither is of ſuch importance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
you ſo neerely, that I reſolved by all meanes to come hither;
being well aſſured that when you ſhall know it, you will not onely
take it in good part, but will alſo courteouſly grant me what I ſhall
demand of you.</p>
               <p>The Admirall, who (ſeeing him come unawares) had ey'd him
with a dogged looke, ſuſpecting that he meant to flie into <hi>Corſica,</hi> but
that being diſcovered, he reſolved to come to <hi>Saſſari;</hi> or elſe that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7477:18"/>
ſomebody had enticed him to runne away (which might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
done under colour and pretext of being his ſlave) yet hearing
theſe words, permitted him to ſpeake all that he would. The ſlave
(obſerving the comming of others into the roome,) with a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
voice beſought him to make a ſhew of bidding him doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
till ſuch time as the company were gone away. The Admirall
ſeeing him ſo circumſpect, thought his ſuſpition might be vaine, and
(his hart telling him that ſomething was amiſſe) he bade him do ſome
ſervices about the chamber, to ſet him aworke till he were rid of
thoſe that were there; then (having made him follow him alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the garden) he commanded him to tell him the occaſion of his
comming. Whereat he kneeling downe, thus ſaid unto him;</p>
               <p>My Lord, the thing I have to tell you is of ſuch importance, as,
if it ſhould be knowne, there is no man living could ſave my life:
although then I (as your ſlave, and as a ſlave well uſed) am in
all things obliged unto you, without having any reaſon of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any reward from you; nevertheleſſe, I beſeech you to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that (before I tell it you) I begge the liberties of my ſelfe and
<hi>Prodotima,</hi> who (to tell you the truth) is my wife; and though libertie
be the onely thing that ought to be moſt deſired of every one in the
world, yet would I not in this caſe deſire it, were I not of neceſſitie
(for the ſaving of my owne life) conſtrained ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>The Admirall (having heard theſe well compact reaſons) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
promiſed him all that he requeſted; in caſe, the matter were
ſuch as he made it to be. Whereupon the ſlave kiſſing his feete, ſaid
vnto him; My Lord, <hi>Prodotima</hi> ſent me unto you, and (out of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
ſhe owes you) lets you know, that your bed is violated by
the Prince, which (if you beleeve not) ſhe offers to let you ſee.</p>
               <p>The Admirall (who expected no ſuch newes) was ready to fall
dead for griefe thereof; but ſtriving to encourage himſelfe the beſt
he could, he demanded of him many things touching that purpoſe:
but the other (fearing to faile) ſaid, he knew no more thereof, but
that <hi>Prodotima</hi> could fully ſatisfie him of all. The Admirall (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
what he felt in himſelfe) ſent him to the ſtables, bidding him
ſay, that he himſelf had ſent for him thither. Afterwards (ſetling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ruminate, or rather to rave on the caſe of the buſineſſe) he
could not imagine that the ſlave came to tell him a lie: neither held
he him to be ſo ſimple, as not to know his owne danger.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he thus ſtood, there came to him unlookt for, the <hi>Coant</hi>
of <hi>Montevero;</hi> who (ſeeing him changed as if he had beene ſicke a
whole moneths time) asked him, if he felt not himſelfe well? And
being anſwered with, no; The <hi>Count</hi> ſaid, that it might be, that he
was not ſicke, but that it could not otherwiſe be, but that ſome great
ill had befallen him. The Admirall (ſuffering at theſe words a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
impreſſion of griefe) burſt out like a child into an extremitie
of weeping: whereupon the <hi>Count</hi> (taking him by the hand) led him
to the end of the walke, and having firſt ſeated themſelves in the
thicket of a grove, beſought him to tell him the occaſion of his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7477:18"/>
griefe, to the end that he might either comfort, counſell, or aſſiſt him.
The Admirall bluſhing for ſhame of being found in ſuch a plight,
(after he had dried his eyes) related unto him all that the ſlave had
told him: whereupon the <hi>Count</hi> (after a ſhort pawſe) ſaid unto him,
Cozen, the occaſion of your griefe is great, not in reſpect of what is
already happened you, (you being not the firſt that had a diſhoneſt
wife) but in regard of what may befall you, if you thinke to repaire
your honour; whereof (becauſe of its difficulty) you cannot eaſily
reſolve: ſuſpend (I pray you) your ſorrow, leſt by bewraying it,
you marre all your buſineſſe. Only this much Ile tell you, that though
in revenging your wrong I were ſure to loſe my life and goods, yet
would I moſt willingly forgoe them, and thinke them well ſpent for
your honors ſake. The Admirall (framing the beſt countenance he
could) departed thence, to which place both of them returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
after ſupper, under pretence that the <hi>Baron</hi> was diſpoſed to
recreate himſelfe: where after much conſultation, they reſolved that
the Admirall ſhould goe diſguiſed to <hi>Caleri,</hi> to aſſure himſelfe of the
act, before they would thinke of the reſt, and to the end that this
his journey might not be any way ſuſpected; they tooke on them to
goe thence alone to <hi>Montelione,</hi> without any attendance, that thoſe
of the houſehold might thinke they made this journey for ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
pleaſure. The ſlave ſent they two dayes before with a ſpare
Barbar horſe, which the Admirall was to ride on; lead by him a

through the ſtables conducted him to the houſe (to the lodgings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for ſtrangers,) <hi>Prodotima</hi> came to finde him out.</p>
               <p>The words were few, becauſe they were to goe thence to watch
the comming of the Prince: ſhe led him into the fore-chamber of
her miſtreſſe (who was already laid in bed) and there hid him in
the ſtudy, where-hence he might firſt ſee the Prince, as he paſſed by,
and then through the doore (which was to ſtand open) heare and ſee
all the ſpeeches and actions of his wife. He was well armed, becauſe
he came of purpoſe about a buſineſſe of ſuch importance, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
neither valour nor courage, had ſoone reſolved with himſelfe
to kill them both; if his Cozen (foreſeeing the danger) had not
made him promiſe to do nothing elſe but aſſure himſelfe of the fact.</p>
               <p>In leſſe than a quarter of an houre came the Prince, and paſſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7477:19"/>
through the fore-chamber with a light that <hi>Prodotima</hi> bore before
him. The Admirall ſaw him, and knew him he heard their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
complements, their reciprocall affections, the ſmacking of
their kiſſes, his putting off his clothes, and going to bed. I wonder
that madneſſe, jealouſie, and fury, made him not forget his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prodotima</hi> gone out, he would not ſtay to heare any more (not
willing to truſt too much to his owne patience.) Of her would he
needs know in many particulars, and (amongſt other things) the
time and continuance of this practice. She, concealing ſuch things
as might condemne her ſelfe for a mediatrix, told him, that it had
not laſted many daies, and that ſhe (for her part) had abſolutely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her aſſiſtance, when ſhe was thereto requeſted by her miſtreſſe,
who therefore (miſtruſting her) had cauſed the Prince to threaten
her, the ſelfe ſame evening, when her miſtreſſe went her ſelfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to open him the dore (as ſhe beleeved ſhe had done ofttimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her being made privy thereto) ſo that ſhe for feare of her life
could not chooſe but obey her.</p>
               <p>The Admirall, after he had ſeene and heard too much, went his
way, charging her to ſerve them with a good countenance, untill
ſuch time as he gave her further order; promiſing her, that (over
and beſides her liberty) hee would therefore well reward
her.</p>
               <p>The ſlave having put the horſe to ſtand in a ſtable without the
houſe, found him (when he went to ſaddle him) ſo tired and weary, as
he could not poſſibly cauſe him to get up on his feet, ſo as the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
knew not what to doe, and (not able to endure any longer the
ſight of his houſe, or of <hi>Calari,</hi> no nor of the skie that covered them)
went out of the citty on foot; giving the ſlave money to hire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
horſe, as farre as <hi>Geneui,</hi> whitherward he was to come after
him and overtake him by the way.</p>
               <p>The ſubtle hangman (well knowing where to finde choiſe of
horſes,) choſe out an excellent good one, paying well for him, and
leaving the other in pawne thereof, received of his maſter when he
overtooke him, the counter-token for getting againe the horſe at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neui;</hi>
whither he walked at his leaſure. But the Admirall carried by
Furies road thoſe five and thirty miles in two houres, and with the
other two horſes came to <hi>Montecouo</hi> ere the <hi>Count</hi> was ſtirring
out of his bed; where (almoſt dead with wearineſſe, hunger, and
griefe) he told him of all that had happened him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> (although aſtoniſhed to heare him) anſwered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but that he had well done to hold his hands, praying him
to repoſe himſelfe a little, as he had need for not having ſlept a winke
the two former nights, and that afterwards they would diſcourſe of
the buſineſſe with more conveniency and leaſure.</p>
               <p>The Admirall (although he had more deſire to die than to live,
yet orecome by neceſſity having refreſhed himſelfe with a little
meate,) without ſtripping himſelfe of his cloathes, lay him downe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7477:19"/>
to ſleepe a nap on the beds ſide. And afterwards awaking with a
a ſhivering feare, cauſed by his imagination and paſſion, he found the
<hi>Count</hi> awake, who ſpake thus unto him:</p>
               <p>Cozen, I have thought on your caſe, wherein I finde you may
proceede two manner of waies, the one profitable, but contrary to
the common opinion of our countrey; the other (by the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
honorable, but ruinous: in the firſt, is laid before you; how
that he who offends you is your Prince, &amp; ſuch a Prince, as (this fault
excepted) might be entitled the worthieſt that the world enjoyes.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto his diſcretion in doing what he doth, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſo ſecret, that no living creature can come to know it, and what
you eſteem an offence is rather an amorous treſpaſſe, than an injury.
Moreover if we ought to ground our reſolutions on the common
opinion, we ſhall finde that a Prince takes not away the honor of his
ſubject in enjoying his wife; which if it be allowed, though all the
world know it, why will not you allow it now that no body knowes
it? Infinite truly are the number of ſuch, as will laugh at you in their
ſleeves, if you but doe otherwiſe; becauſe honor is indeed in the end
nothing elſe, but a mecre opinion, and many nations mocke and
leere at us, who with ſo great and ſo many dangers endevour to
protect the chaſtity of our wives, perſwaded in our ſelves that their
diſhoneſty ſpots us with infamy.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if you will follow this courſe, you ſhall (beſides the
ſaving of your honour) reape therby many commodities, you ſhall
find your ſelfe freed of a griefe that ſo much troubles you; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
letting all things paſſe, you neede not thinke of any thing
elſe, than of your courſe of life.</p>
               <p>And may withall (if jealouſie ſhould yet torment you) in ſome
ſeemely faſhion th wart thoſe loves by cauſing your wife to come to
<hi>Saſſari;</hi> you ſhall ſave your owne patrimony, and the eſtates of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others; and beſides free from danger your own life with thoſe
of your friends and kindred.</p>
               <p>The other way of proceeding is, for ſuch as beleeve, that this
caſe marcheth in the very front of the firſt files of honor, which if
you'l follow, you'l uncloath your owne ſhame, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your ſelfe many loſſes and diſgraces, as to be branded with the
infamous name of a Traitor, and utterly loſe your goods, countrey,
honor, dignities and friends. The choiſe therefore lies in your owne
hand, and on you alone depends the election thereof.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, he pawz'd awhile, till (ſeeing the Marqueſſe ſtand ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
without making any anſwer) he thus proceeded: I beleeve, that
theſe reaſons ſhall not (peradventure) obtaine of you that credit, as
I wiſh they could; in that you may perſwade your ſelfe that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, onely to free my ſelfe from the communitie of your
perils; but (to cleare you of that doubt) I heare ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
unto you, that I am moſt willing to incurre with you any
danger whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Admirall (looking ſomewhat more cheerefull) anſwered,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7477:20"/>
(Cozen) I have not ſo little judgement, but that I know you; though
your reaſons indeede are more profitable than honourable, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
caries with it no other ballance than that of honour, which if
in this caſe it cannot be taken from me by the Prince, becauſe he is a
Prince; no more can he deprive me thereof in another caſe, for being
ſuch a perſon: and Princes by this reaſon ſhould be leſſe powerfull
than private men, for ſuch (for being private men,) might and are
able to doe injuries, if they would, whereas Princes cannot ſo doe
(for being Princes.) But this (cozen) is a falſe reaſon, found out and
invented either by the Princes themſelves, or by the women, who
(being diſhoneſt) would thereby defend their honeſtie; or by their
husbands, who faine would under that veile hide their owne diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
As concerning vertue, I confeſſe the Prince hath heretofore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
of ſome part thereof, whereof he is at this preſent deprived,
becauſe true vertues are perpetuall, neither are they ever found unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with others like themſelves, ſo that when one of them is
corrupted, all the reſidue are thereby blemiſhed. Touching honour, I
allow what you ſay thereof: but the ſelfeſame argument of yours
is ſufficient to give you ſatisfaction; True honour (as you terme or
limit it) is that, which is found common in every one, as the law of
nature is common to every man; obſerving this rule, I ſhould have
but ſmall reaſon to finde my ſelfe aggrieved. But there are certaine
particular lawes, which although they be not obſerved elſewhere,
than in places where they are eſtabliſhed, yet can it not be denied, but
that they are lawes; and ought to bee knowne and obſerved of every
one for ſuch. When cuſtome hath brought a thing to become, (or
be eſteemed) a branch of honour, whoſoever is not obſervant and
obedient thereto, is diſhonored, not becauſe it ought to bee ſo in
effect, but becauſe we have conſented that it ſhould be ſo. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that to watch over womens honeſty, with ſo great curioſitie,
is a cuſtome altogether prejudiciall: but wee being thereto ſubject,
muſt needs endure it; and ſo much the rather, by how much we are
the more conſpicuous &amp; eminent in our callings. And if I would free
my ſelfe from the bonds thereof, then would it not be ſaid that I did
it, becauſe the Philoſophie of honour taught me to deſpiſe this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
opinion; but rather for that avarice and ambition had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me to become patient: ſo as I ſhall not onely make my ſelfe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſottiſh talke of the vulgar, but ſhall alſo bee accounted
of my Peeres ſcorne-worthy, and infamous. As for my life and
goods, the ſelfe-ſame cuſtome will anſwer for me; which cuſtome
will, that I preferre my ſelfe, and my owne honor before all things:
and that with loſing all, I declare my ſelfe a rebell to Nature, which
commands us to looke to our owne profit, and to conſerve what we
enjoy of hers. Touching my friends, I know not what to anſwer
you, ſaving only, that the diſgrace I ſuffer doth alſo reflect on them;
what is my caſe to day, may be theirs to morrow. It reſts that I
tell you, that the Prince might have allowed himſelfe pleaſures
without offending any man, as wiſe Princes doe, who jeſt not, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7477:20"/>
where ſuch ieſts are received for favours. The ſumme of all is, that I
am reſolved, that the lives of both the Prince and my wife ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the vengeance of my wronged honour.</p>
               <p>Seeing that ſuch is your reſolution (replied the <hi>Count</hi>) mine alſo
ſhall be conformable to yours. And after they had propoſed divers
meanes for effecting it, at length they concluded on theſe; that the
Admirall ſhould ſell a good part of his goods, who to give a colour
to the ſale thereof, was to loſe publikely at play with the <hi>Count,</hi> ſixty
thouſand crownes. That he ſhould practize a plot with the King of
<hi>Corſica,</hi> by the mediation of <hi>Mortiro</hi> (one of the Ambaſſadors that
came to demand the Princeſſe) a friend to them both, whom they
were to procure to come diſguiſed, and give them the meeting. That
the aſſiſtance of that King ſhould be ſued for, with proffering him
in recompence, the Kingdome of <hi>Sardegna.</hi> That they ſhould in
the meane time inſinuate into the love of the Captaines, Souldiers,
and Mariners; but ſo diſcreetly, as their unaccuſtomed liberality
might not cauſe them to be ſuſpected. All which accompliſhed,
the laſt thing ſhould be the death of the Prince.</p>
               <p>The Admirall, after this agreement, ſeemed to be of better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and conſidering how it would be well done to prepare thereto
their friends; and particularly the Baron of <hi>Friſano,</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
agreed not; but ſaid that the foundations being once well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(which were the moneyes and the backing of the King of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica</hi>)
their friends would bee thereunto afterwards more eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.</p>
               <p>The day following they returned to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> where taking on
them to be merry, and ſetting themſelves to gaming; the Admirall
loſt ſome monies, which he tooke out of his pocket, and then play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on ticket, loſt twenty thouſand crownes: under which pretext
he had leaſure to give himſelfe over to his melancholy, and holding
on his game (although the Baron with many Captaines would have
ſet themſelves in betweene them, and the <hi>Count</hi> himſelfe made as
though he plaid unwillingly) in a few dayes, the Admirall reſolutely
loſt threeſcore thouſand crownes.</p>
               <p>The newes of theſe loſſes were ſuddenly rumored about the
Court, and came to the eares of the Admirals wife, who grieved
extremely thereat; and not long after received from her husband a
letter, with order, to finde out ſuch as would buy ſo much of his
goods, as might make up the ſumme of ſixty thouſand crownes.
Now the Prince being that night come unto her, ſhe with be-teared
eyes, ſhewed him the letter: and he (glad of having occaſion to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
in any thing his <hi>Talaſia</hi>) wiſhed her not to trouble her minde
therewith. Having therefore ſent for the Admirall to <hi>Calari,</hi> (who
came thither very unwillingly) he beſpake him in this wiſe: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that your Steward hath offered to ſale your goods, which
have for theſe many yeares belonged unto your honour, for which
I am indeede ſorry, more for the occaſion, that for the thing it ſelfe;
the King (my father) will not that you (being the ſecond Baron
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7477:21"/>
of <hi>Sardegna</hi>) ſhould (by being ruinated) become unable to ſerve
him: repaire therefore unto the Treaſurer generall, who hath order
to deliver you ſixty thouſand crownes; make uſe thereof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
it againe, by little and little, without diſcommodating your
eſtate. The Admirall (who well knew the cauſe of this liberalitie)
diſſembling, kneeled downe before him, and with moſt humble
ſpeeches, thanked him, doing the ſelfeſame to the King; who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
him not to ſuffer himſelfe by play, to be any more reduced to
ſuch neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>The Admirall continued at home but a very ſmall time, where
it behooved him to make much of his wife, with no leſſe art, than
diſguſt. Returned backe to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> he wrote to his Cozen, to whom
(as ſoone as hee was come) he publikely disburſed ſixty thouſand
crownes, acquiring thereby the praiſe and reputation of a loyall and
gene<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Afterwards retired aſide, the <hi>Count</hi> ſhewed him the anſwer of
<hi>Mutriro,</hi> the contents whereof was, that he would goe to <hi>Aſsinara,</hi>
in the habit of a Fiſherman, where they were to expect him; they
therefore retired to the fleete, and (taking on them to goe a fiſhing)
went ſo farreonwards till they came to <hi>Aſsinara,</hi> where the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
ſhepheard expected them, and landing a bowſhot diſtant
from him, (leaving their Squires buſied in making dinner ready) they
walked along the ſtrond, till they came to his Barke; where (diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the matter before his ſervants, there preſent, and asking him
what he was? and what he there did?) they ſingled him from them;
and he (with a ſeeming humility) followed them, till ſuch time as
the Admirall perceiving himſelfe out of ſight, told him; that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
wherefore he had prayed him to come thither was, for that he
(reſolved to avenge his wrong'd honour) was deſirous to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
it to King <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> who by that occaſion, might not onely
be revenged for the refuſall of the Princeſſe <hi>Eromena,</hi> but alſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
himſelfe of that kingdome, which they offered him, telling
him, that they demanded no moneys; howbeit he might doe well to
imploy ſuch as hee ſhould have given them, in reinforcing of the
fleete with more men and munition to paſſe over into <hi>Sardegna,</hi> when
he ſhould be thereof advertized. That the Admirall would ſtirre up
to rebellion the fleete under his command (having already purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the love and affection of the Captaines and Souldiers thereof)
which he could the eaſier accompliſh, becauſe his was no rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
but a juſt revenge. That as ſoone as he received an anſwer, he
would communicate the buſineſſe to all his friends, whereof ſome
of them had their lands and caſtles lying in the Province of <hi>Lougo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dori,</hi>
over againſt <hi>Corſica,</hi> ſo as at their landing in the Iland, they
ſhould find no reſiſtance. That in theſe conſiſted all the ſtrength of
the kingdome; in that (the Prince being once dead) there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
to King <hi>Arato,</hi> but very few ſouldiers, without either Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or Captaines.</p>
               <p>Glad was <hi>Mortiro</hi> of ſo goodly an imployment, whereof when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7477:21"/>
when they had ſufficiently diſcourſed, every one returned to his
owne barke, agreeing within ſix dayes to meete againe in the ſame
place, where being accordingly returned, <hi>Murtriro</hi> preſented the
Admirall with a letter from King <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> whereby he accepted
of their offer, promiſing all whatſoever they had required of him,
ſpecifying withall, how that he would ſend into the Iland, twentie
thouſand ſouldiers, and increaſe the fleete to the number of five and
twenty Galleyes, together with this meſſage ſent he him for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
a rich ſword with the hilts, inlaied with many diamonds, and
unto the <hi>Count</hi> a rich Iewell to weare in his hat.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, having more particularly ordered a ſetled courſe
for what was to be effected; the Admirall together with the <hi>Count,</hi>
returned to the Fleet, and thence went away as if it had beene to
recreate themſelves, together with the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Friſano:</hi> to whom
when they had communicated the buſineſſe, he remained ſo troubled
in mind to here of ſuch an unexpected act done by the Prince, that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
both the Admirall and his Cozen (as it were) with an equall
affection, he eaſily conſented to make one in this conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>Thence compaſſing about <hi>Capo Luogodori,</hi> they infected all
thoſe tributaries thereabout, whereof the principalleſt were, the
<hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Reparata,</hi> of <hi>Puſsinera,</hi> and of <hi>Caſtle Rabone,</hi> with the <hi>Barons</hi>
of <hi>Ianque,</hi> of <hi>Lilaraba,</hi> of <hi>Lagoſardo,</hi> and of <hi>Villapeires.</hi> All theſe
were preſent at the death of the Prince, except the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vero,</hi>
who (with the occaſion of apparant receit of ſixtie thouſand
crownes, having (by the Admirals appointment,) liberally given
as largeſſe of his winnings in the army, more than ſix thouſand of
them) had ſo obliged the Captaines, and all the reſt, that it
was thought fit to leave him in the cuſtody and governement
thereof.</p>
               <p>The Admirall in the meane time, ſent the King and Prince often
intelligence of the great preparations of the King of <hi>Corſica,</hi> deſiring
to be authorized with greater power, to the end he might give order
in the country of <hi>Luogodori,</hi> for the defence of that <hi>Cape</hi> (dangerous
in time of invaſion) as the neereſt unto the enemy. Whereupon he
received greater authoritie than he deſired, and began firſt to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his owne holds (namely) <hi>Saſſari</hi> and <hi>Porta Torre.</hi> Thence (with
title of Commiſſary Generall) he viſited the Conſpirers, and cauſed
their townes to be fortified, their battalions armed, and many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of ſouldiers to be levied all at the charge of the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
without a penny of expence, of either his, or his complices.
All which accompliſhed (and nothing but the execution leſt unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected)
he ſent for the ſlave (under pretence of having the horſe
which he governed) who come, and inſtructed of what he had to do,
returned to expect him at <hi>Caleri.</hi> Where the Admirall with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirers,
came by night at the houre appointed, and were hidden by
<hi>Prodotima,</hi> (after <hi>Talaſia</hi> was a bed) in the ſtudy of the fore-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
After that the Prince had received intelligence from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
of the King of <hi>Corſica's</hi> being up in armes, he felt in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7477:22"/>
heart (although he was the moſt valourous Knight in the world) a
new effect of melancholy, withiſome conceit or feeling of feare,
whereat he was aſtoniſhed: It ſeemed to him unlikely that <hi>Epicamedo</hi>
(alone without forraine aide) durſt move warre againſt <hi>Sardegna</hi> (a
kingdome well-neere thrice greater than his, and withall abounding
with warrelike ſubjects.) And (being deſirous to proceede on ſure
ground) he had ſent many ſpies into <hi>Corſica,</hi> who conformably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized
him of the great preparations there, and how that all the
troopes marched towards <hi>Baſilica,</hi> over againſt <hi>Sardegna;</hi> whereupon
he often ſollicited the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> by ſundry poaſts, to aſſure that
Countrey of <hi>Luogoderi,</hi> till ſuch time as he (having muſtered up the
horſe, and armed men) came thither in perſon.</p>
               <p>All that morning, which preceded his death, ſpent he with the
King and Queene (who grieved to ſee him ſo changed) and he angry
at himſelfe, ſtrove to force himſelfe to be merry; but his joyes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>In the evening he determined to goe ſport himſelfe with his <hi>Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;
Prodotima</hi> led him to the chamber as ſhe was accuſtomed, all
trembling (as knowing what was to befall him,) and paſſed before
the Conſpirers. The Prince diſarm'd and uncloath'd himſelfe: but
the Admirall (not able to hold any longer) ruſh't into the chamber,
juſt as the Prince thought to lay himſelfe downe, and (without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a word) thruſt at him a full <hi>ſtocada,</hi> which although it pierced
him quite through the other ſide, yet was it not mortall: The Prince
(ſeazing ſuddenly on his ſword that lay by him) ſtroke at the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
head with ſo maine a force, that he (warding with his buckler)
was not able to beare off the blow, but yeelding thereto, the ſword
came to charge him ſo furiouſly on the head, that cutting through
the Helmet, it ſomewhat wounded him. But the Prince ſeeing ſo
many about him, and among thoſe, the <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Reparata</hi> and <hi>Caſtel
Robone,</hi> (both his ſpeciall Favorites) deteſting, and wroth to ſee ſo
great ingratitude, he ſaid unto them; And to you Traitors, what have
I done that you thus murther me? Thou haſt done too much in
maculating our bloud, (anſwered <hi>Reparata;</hi>) now theſe were all of
them of kinne, either to the Lady, or to the Admirall; and the <hi>Count</hi>
of <hi>Reparata</hi> was her owne Cozen-germaine, who thought this fatall
ſhame concerned him neareſt, in that ſhe had neither father nor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
living. The Admirall (who had fore-thought of the manner
of conducting this enterprize) had before-hand furniſhed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
with Iavelings, becauſe, having conſidered the valour of the
Prince, he judged it folly to regard the faire termes of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
much rather, in that he doubted leſt the noiſe and buſtling of
their blowes might indanger them; ſo as the poore Prince pierced at
once with ſix darts, was not any more able, either to ſtrike or ſpeake.
The <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Iangue,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Puſsinera,</hi> were (from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning)
runne to the bed, who (leſt the Lady Admirall ſhould cry
out) held cloſe her mouth ſtopt up with the ſheetes: her husband,
(having made her riſe up, and put on a chamber-weede) intending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7477:22"/>
(becauſe he diſdained to kill her himſelfe) to cauſe her to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
by the ſlave, ſeeing the Prince not yet quite dead, grew deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
(for his greater anguiſh) that ſhe ſhould give him his laſt wound,
and having therefore made her take a Poyniard in hand, he told her,
his will was, that to revenge the death he had given her honour, ſhe
ſhould reſolve to kill him with her owne hands; ſhe (ſeeing him
wallowing in a lake of bloud, and how he though gaſping for life, yet
beheld her) laying aſide all feare, ſtab'd her husband with the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
in the face, thinking to ſtrike him in the throat-pipes (for well
deemed ſhe him arm'd every where elſe) and had therewithall ſped
him, had he not fallen flat on the ground; then turning towards the
next unto her, which was the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Vellapetres,</hi> ſhe ranne him in
the flanke, and kil'd him. The Admirall (in the meane while gotten
up) gave her a thruſt in the ſide, which puſhed her upon the <hi>Baron</hi>
of <hi>Lybaraba;</hi> in whoſe belly, ſhe without loſſe of time, buried the
Poyniard up to the hilts, (aiming her thruſt low, for doubt of ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it in his coat of maile) and therewith ſped him; but then, ſhee
beaten downe with divers blowes (and ſtruggling to ſet her ſelfe
forwards againe to kill her husband) came to fall upon the Prince,
where faintly kiſſing him, ſhe breathed out her life with him; in that
very inſtant, as he breathed out his laſt gaſpe.</p>
               <p>The Admirall ſeeing his plot brought to paſſe, at ſo deere a rate,
as to have two of his companions ſlaine, and himſelfe wounded;
knew not what courſe to take with their bodies, and yet needs muſt
he have reſolved to get him thence: when every one adviſing him
not to loſe any time about two inutile carcaſſes, he thought his beſt
and ſafeſt courſe was to be ruled by them. Having therefore bound
up his wounds, hee wiſhed them all to goe out into the Hall, to the
end that thoſe of the houſe (wakened with their buſtling) ſeeing them
jeſt (beating one the other with pillowes) might beleeve that thence
began the firſt noiſe: The beds being made ready they called for
dice, commanding the ſervants to goe ſleepe, under colour of having
no man to over-looke their game; and becauſe many of them (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how unfit it was to leave Lords of ſuch a ranke, not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with aſmuch as one ſervant) would have waited out of the Hall;
they conſtrained them to get them thence, and by locking the
doores after them, had thereby conveniencie a little after to ſhift
themſelves away thence, without being obſerved of any. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
had fore-thought of all things (except the two ſlaves,) whom
then alſo he had not remembred, had they not preſented themſelves
before him, ſo as they muſt have taken them up behind them on
their horſe-croppers, had not the death of the two <hi>Barons</hi> remedied
that inconvenience. And becauſe <hi>Caleri</hi> for the ſuſpition it had
of <hi>Corſica,</hi> ſtood then guarded with ſome watch; it behooved the
Admirall to make himſelfe knowen unto the Porter of the Citie.
They rode all night, having twiſe changed horſe, and taking the way
of <hi>Montevero,</hi> arrived there the day following. There were they
inforced to leave behind them <hi>Prodotima</hi> (accompanied with the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7477:23"/>
ſlave) all galled and bruiſed with riding; to embarke themſelves ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
at the mouth of the river <hi>Thirſis,</hi> diſtant but eight miles from
<hi>Montevero,</hi> and thence to get them to <hi>Porto Torre,</hi> themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one minutes ſtay, (holding on their journey with incredible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence)
arrived the night following at <hi>Saſſari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Pilate held on his diſcourſe, there appeared in ſight a ſmall
<hi>Barke,</hi> ſayling here and there without any order or direct courſe,
which being ſhewed them by <hi>Polimero,</hi> they judged it to be ſome
one, that had beene rob'd by Pirates, and left as a play-game to the
windes; (deſirous to know the truth) they bore up to her. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe was yet afarre off, the Pilate (requeſted to continue his
Hiſtory) thus proceeded.</p>
               <p>It grew to be farre dayes, and <hi>Talaſia's</hi> Gentlewomen expected
that <hi>Prodotima</hi> ſhould come to call them up, as ſhe was wont to doe:
but dinnertime being come, and no <hi>Prodotima</hi> as yet appearing, and
the Serving-men on the other ſide (marvelling they ſaw not in
the ſtrangers lodgings, the Knights come thither with their Maſter
the night before) went on towards the fore-chamber, where <hi>Prodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima</hi>
lay, where knocking many times, and hearing no body ſtirre
within, they began to doubt, of I know not what. Whereupon,
bouncing againe many times and often, they reſolved without any
reſpect, to throw downe the doore, which when they had done, and
found not their <hi>Prodotima,</hi> onwards they went into the chamber, and
there they ſaw the pittifull ſpectacle of foure bodies lying weltred
in bloud; whereof (to their great horror) they knew at the firſt ſight
their <hi>Miſtreſſe</hi> and the <hi>Prince.</hi> My tongue cannot expreſſe the effects
of griefe and amazement, that ſeazed on theſe poore people, neither
beleeve I, that they can be imagined, unleſſe the imagination had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
a like diſaſter: they could not as much as gheſſe how
the matter ſtood, becauſe they never were any way privie to the
<hi>Prince</hi> his love: but ſeeing him now in ſuch a plight, and knowing
that their Maſter came to the houſe that night, and thence ſhifted
himſelfe away privily, they beganne to doubt of what was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>The Steward (having cauſed the gate to be ſhut, with charge not
to open it to any man) went to the Kings Councell, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the fact, conformable to his conjectures.</p>
               <p>The Councell (not knowing by what meanes they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
acquaint the King,) were adviſed by the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Boſſa,</hi>
Lord high Chamberlaine, not to informe the King of any
thing, ere they had ſeene themſelves the body of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and
with more certainetie informed themſelves of the caſe, wiſhing
therefore, all, or ſome of them, to goe to the Admirals houſe, whilſt
he rooke care that no man came neere the King. His Councell was
imbraced; The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> retiring to the Kings chamber, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(as ſoone as their coaches came) hurrying to the Admirals
houſe, where cauſing it to be cloſe ſhut up, and the chamber opened,
they ſaw the relation prove but too too true; there being not any of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7477:23"/>
them preſent, who by the place, perſons and qualities of the dead,
comprehend not the caſe.</p>
               <p>Having afterwards examined the houſehold, they underſtood of
the Admirals being there that night, accompanied with <hi>Reparata,</hi>
and the reſt, and how that the ſlaves were not ſithence ſeene, by
whom they beleeved the <hi>Prince</hi> to bee betraied, and ſo by the
helpe of the reſt murthered, by the Admirall. They ſent ſuddenly
to the gates, where they underſtood that the Admirall, with eight
Companons all well horſed, went out at the gate of <hi>Caſtlemuni.</hi>
They reſolved to ſend after him, and having to that end ſent for the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montereale,</hi> Generall of the horſe, and ſhewed him the body
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> they committed to his charge what he was to doe. The
<hi>Count</hi> (who adored him living, and now being dead, could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himſelfe in bemoaning him) conſidering that the preſent ſtate
of the buſineſſe required ſomewhat elſe than teares, went on his way
moſt reſolute to uſe all poſſible diligence to revenge his death. The
Lords of the Councell in the meane time, (after they had taken ſuch
order, as was requiſite, touching the bodies of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and of the
guiltie Traitors) returned to the Palace. But the Citizens having
(I know not how) underſtood of the accident, and telling it one
unto another, were ſeene to ſhut up all their ſhops in an inſtant,
with lamentations ſo manifeſt, that the King perceiving it, asked the
Marqueſſe, what was the matter, who anſwered him that he knew
not: but the King (ſeeing it more and more increaſe) bade him goe
call the <hi>Prince,</hi> and learne what the matter was. Wherein, whilſt
the Marqueſſe tooke on him to obey him, there appeared in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
the Privie Counſellors, who when the King ſaw come
thronging ſo many together, he imagined that ſome great diſaſter
had hapned; for all of them pitifully lamented, inſomuch as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi>
(who was to be the Speaker) could not utter a word; whereat
the King impatient, turning towards the Marqueſſe, and ſeeing him
make greater moane than any of the reſt; asked him angerly, if the
King of <hi>Corſica</hi> were in <hi>Caleri,</hi> or if the Kingdome were loſt. My
Soveraigne Leige, (anſwered then the Preſident) would to God, I
could bring you that newes in exchange of this other, a thouſand
times more wofull; for there might be hope to recover againe the
Realme, whereas the loſſe that both you and the Kingdome have
now ſuſtained, is irrecoverable. What can it then be? (replied the
King) Is <hi>Perosfilo</hi> dead? At which demand all of them kneeling
downe, and pitifully lamenting him with grieuous ſobs, and morne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cries, anſwered that he was.</p>
               <p>The King hereat aſtoniſhed, would have runne towards the Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> thinking to ſee him there: Whene the Queene
(comming out thence, accompanied with <hi>Eromena,</hi> with their heire
hanging diſorderly about their eares, more like <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> or mad
women than themſelves) met him at a doore, full-but. The Queene
ſtrangely gazing on the ſtanders by, with reiterated words, cried out,
<hi>Perosfilo?</hi> Where is hee? where is my Sonne? Come, give him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7477:24"/>
mee: withhold him not rom mee, for I will have him.</p>
               <p>This incounter was to the King, even as a fire which come neere
a dry tow-like matter, fuming, and halfe conſumed, puffs it up in a
flame in an inſtant, for ſeeing his wife and daughter in ſo ſtrange a
faſhion, his ſpirits and courage ſo failed him, as he ſunke downe to
the ground. But the Queene without taking any notice of him, (run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about, while here, while there) continued in calling out for her
Sonne, till become all hoarſe with crying, ſhe held her eyes,
immoveably fixt where once ſhe let fall her ſight, without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a teare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena</hi> (the mirrour of beauty and Prudence) ſtood in that
inſtant (with her faire eyes concentrated) pale, and wan. She wept
not, and yet ſhe wept, for her weeping were exclamations and
ſighes, ſhe called on the beloved name of her brother, ſhe ſought for
him all over his Lodgings, and hehind the Tapiſtrie, as if ſhe had
hoped to have found him there hidden.</p>
               <p>The King was raiſed up from the ground, and laid in his bed,
ſo would the Ladies have likewiſe diſpoſed of the Queene; but ſhe
(become frantike) ran up and downe the Palace, and round about
the Lodgings, complaining of the heavens, and curſing men; till ſhe
brought her ſelfe to that paſſe as ſhe was not able any more either
to move or crie. The numerous companie of Ladies, that pittifully
wept about her, had not beene able to re-conduct her to her Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
if <hi>Eromena</hi> (fearing with her brother to loſe alſo her mother)
had not with her preſence and teares, importuned and perſwaded
her to retire her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It boots me not to tell you of the revolt of the Citie, when the
corpes of the <hi>Prince,</hi> were (about midnight) brought to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
               <p>The dolefull <hi>Eromena,</hi> (conſidering how her father was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his great griefe fallen ſicke of a Feaver, and her mother
growne diſtracted of her ſenſes) was not therefore willing to let
them know any thing, but went her ſelfe with a few others, to veiw
the body; but then, although all her vitall powers ran unto her
heart; although all her force and vertues (whereof the heavens were
unto her ſo graciouſly liberall) united themſelves together to fortifie
her courage, yet could not all this ſave or ſuſtaine her ſpirits, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
her life from failing her at that inſtant: ſhe grew pale, ſhee
ſwounded, ſhe fell dead, at leaſt in all likelihood, and died ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if a ſpirit more feeble had given ſhape and being to a leſſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
heart: In the end (come to her ſelfe, and ſitting by the corps
as ſhe watered his breath-loſſe face, with a fountaine of her teares)
ſhe ſaid:</p>
               <p>Are theſe then the joyes (Brother) which we expected of thee? Are
theſe the hopes that the world had of thee, &amp; which with all reaſon
is expected of thy valour? Is this the flouriſhing age, by ſo ſhort a
ſpace of life, ſo cruelly cut off, to bring therewithall to an end with
no leſſe crueltie the lives of thoſe that brought thee into the world?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7477:24"/>
why did not thy reſplendent vertues dazle the eyes of him that ſlew
thee, maugre the ſpectacles of envie? O cruell ſtarres! To what end
ſerved ſuch and ſo great influences of beautie and exquiſite feature in
a body peerleſſe for proweſſe, and adorned with ſo divine a ſoule, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap>ured the corruption and ruine of all thoſe excellent
perfections, to give the whole world cauſe to lament the loſſe of
them: yet are they not loſt, for what aſcends from above muſt
returne to whence it came, ſo as we have no cauſe to grieve for thy
generous ſoule, but yet can we not chuſe (as we are mortall) but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the diſſolution of the perfecteſt compoſure that ever nature put
together: neither can we without death chuſe but bewaile thy death,
depriving us of the life, which from thy ſweet life we received; for in
thee were indiviſible all thoſe graces, which the <hi>Graces</hi> participate
not to others, but in ſuch meaſure as is requiſite for the delight of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
kind. We cannot chuſe but mourne, ſeeing our ſelves threatned
at home and abroad, being (ſince we are deprived of thee) without
force and vigor: neither can we chuſe but lament, when we behold the
ſtate of our drooping kingdome, which by thee alone become once
renowned and famous, returnes (now that it is deprived of thee,
it's light and life) to it's former cloudineſſe, and dimme obſcuritie.
But if every one hath cauſe to lament, why ſhould I not then bewaile
thee with an eternall lamentation; ſeeing I participate of all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
cauſes, and have withall peculiar to my ſelfe alone, a particular
cauſe, as being left, the onely Siſter, of an onely brother, taken from
me ſuddenly unawares, and without all reaſon? Here (overcome
with extremitie of griefe, and being not able to forbeare) ſhe flung
her ſelfe upon him, whence as her Ladies endevored to raiſe her, ſhe
(turning towards them with a fierce and ſevere look) ſaid unto them;
How unſeaſonable, unjuſt, and pittileſſe, is this pitty of yours, that
would defraud ſo worthy a <hi>Prince</hi> of theſe funerall rites I owe him:
Which if I beleeved that I could better ſolemnize with my death, I
would willingly doe it? Then (taking off the ſword from the corpes
ſide, and lifting up her eyes to heaven) ſhe proceeded. But I aſſure my
ſelfe (my noble Brother) that I am not the ſacrifice which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt:
Wherefore if ſo be that thy divine ghoſt doth as yet wander
or hover hereabout thy faire body, &amp; that thou ſeeſt our griefe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us then, (we beſeech thee) whilſt I alſo comfort thee, and aſſure
thee that I will never reſt, till I have executed juſt vengeance on
him that unjuſtly ſlew thee. Which ſaid (girding her ſelfe with the
ſword) ſhe dried away her teares, and ſeeing there was no action to
be hoped for of the King her father, ſhe cauſed the Councell to
come together, and (after a briefe conſultation) commanded the
ſouldiery to be muſtred, reſolving (at the returne of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereale</hi>)
to march in her owne perſon to <hi>Saſſari:</hi> moſt aſſured that the
kingdome would be on that part aſſaulted by King <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whoſe privitie, the Admirall would never have undertaken to
murther the <hi>Prince</hi> her Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:7477:25"/>
The very ſame night ſhe privately cauſed the corps to be interred,
reſerving the ſolemnizing of the funerall rites till her returne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<hi>in</hi> ſo great heavineſſe, one ſole comfort, which was to ſee the
unfained teares of the people.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montereale</hi> uſed all poſſible meanes to ore-take the
Conſpirators. Albeit he perceived that he laboured in vaine, the
purſued having gotten the ſtart of him both in time and riding:
which hee could not recover without change of horſes: and had
therefore returned backe, but that he hoped to blocke them up, either
in <hi>Saſſari</hi> or <hi>Porte Torre,</hi> or at leaſt to chaſe them out of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>The day following he came to <hi>Montevero,</hi> where when the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
newes were ſpred abroad, the lamentation was ſuch, as you
would have judged it to be an effect of one only heart and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt the <hi>Count</hi> could imagine no poſſible meanes to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Admirall (who by that time might have reach't to <hi>Saſſari</hi>) he
was informed how that there was left behind him in that village, a
ſlave of his together with a woman-ſlave bruiſed and galled by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
who (becauſe ſhe could not goe by any other meanes) had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her ſelfe to be carried in a chaire to the ſea coaſt, to take ſhipping,
and that (if it pleaſed him to ſend after them) they might be both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
by the way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count,</hi> although he were wearie, and his horſes tired (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
procured a Guide) would needs perſonally purſue them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rode he five miles, when as he (aſcending a hillocke) deſcried
the ſhe-ſlave in a chaire, who (ſeeing the horſemen) grew pale, and
over-tane by the <hi>Count</hi> (who well knew her in the Admirals houſe)
ſhe beſought him to kill her. But he (thereby better aſſured that ſhe
was the authreſſe of all the miſchiefe) anſwered her; No, miſchievous
and accurſed Traitreſſe, thou ſhalt not enjoy the happineſſe of dying
by my hand, it grieves me that there is no kind of death ſo cruell, as
can equalize thy baſe offence. And inquiring afterward for the ſlave,
he underſtood by the porters, that he was gon before to hire a barke;
The <hi>Count</hi> therefore (leaving the woman in ſafe hold) ſpur'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
to the ſea-ward: but the ſlave (eſpying him deſcending a little
mountaine) having already beſpoken a Barke, imagined that thoſe
horſes came for him; wherefore although all alone without any
Mariners, who were gon to <hi>Boſſa</hi> for proviſion, having got himſelfe
aboord the Barke, he waied anchor, ſpread ſailes before the wind;
whom, though moſt ignorant of that profeſſion, feare made ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as he was gotten more than two miles into the maine, ere the
<hi>Count</hi> could gaine the ſea ſhore; and (which was worſe) there was
not ſo much as one Barke with ſailes to be found at the mouth of the
river <hi>Thirſis,</hi> but onely ſmall fiſhing boates unfurniſht of all things
neceſſarie: Whereat this <hi>Count</hi> was ready to eate his fingers.
But whilſt he ſent for a Barke to <hi>Piſanco,</hi> that of the ſlaves was in a
ſhort time borne away with the wind, ſo as although they had made
after her, yet the night would have taken her out of the ſight of ſuch
as purſued her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:7477:25"/>
The woman ſlave was ſent backe againe to <hi>Caleri:</hi> and onwards
went the <hi>Count</hi> to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> when finding it ſhut, and calling to the
Centrees, he was anſwered with a ſhowre of arrowes; wherewith
were kild eight of his horſes, and many more hurt and wounded:
Whereupon, perceiving the miſchiefe to be greater that he tooke it
for (in that the ſubjects maintained with open Rebellion, the wicked
actions of their Lord) he retired himſelfe with all the ſpeed he
could; and having ſent Scours to ſcoure the field, he received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that the King of <hi>Corſica</hi> in perſon, was paſſing over into the
Iland, with a great army: conſidering therefore that his ſtay there
could be but diſadvantagious (his horſes being already all ſpoild) he
determined to advertize thereof the King, and to retire himſelfe to
the firſt ſecure place.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, the Princeſſe, who onely ſate alone at the
Helme of this weather-beaten ſhip, (having left part of the Lords
of the Councell at <hi>Caleri,</hi> having given order for the marching on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the foot Companies) followed them with two thouſand
horſe, her ſelfe being armed at all pieces, and mounted on a great
Courſer, having firſt commanded the ſhe-ſlave to be ſarely lockt
up in the bottome of a Tower; by meanes of whoſe confeſſion
came to bee knowne all that I have told you: and becauſe wee
ſhall come ſhortly to <hi>Sardegna,</hi> you ſhall there underſtand the
ſequell hereof, and (ſhall perhaps) ſee with your owne eyes, the
generous actions of the faireſt and ſtouteſt Princeſſe the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero,</hi> (who with twiſe ſo much ſweetneſſe had dranke of <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's</hi>
perfections, by how much compaſſion he had liſtened to the
Tragicke ſtory of ſo worthy a Prince) thinking himſelfe not as yet
fully ſatisfied in mind, deſired to know how the Princeſſe came to
have the courage to practiſe, and uſe the handling of armes, an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
not ordinary to her ſex, and though ſhe had naturally ſuch a
ſpirit and will, yet how came ſhe to acquire an apt geſture and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie
ot ſupply the weakneſſe of her ſex, when occaſion required?
Whereto the Pilot ſmiling, anſwered; Thinke not (Sir) that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of our Princeſſe is void of reaſon, or inſufficient to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
whatſoever ſhe takes in hand; I confeſſe it is a thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to her ſex, but not to her: for know, that whilſt ſhe was yet a
girle, and had no other brother, than the unfortunate Prince, ſhee
even then, loved him, and he her ſo heartily deerely, as their frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
became converted to a friendly ſociety, moſt part of their time
ſpent they together, neither had the one any converſation in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
more deare than his Siſters, nor the other any company more
conformable to her inclination than her Brothers: whoſe childiſh
games and delights, being (ſuch as thoſe of all Princes ſhould be)
repreſentations of battels of armes and horſes, ſhe came (by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow)
to ſuch knowledge of the things reall, and ſubſtantiall, that
there is not a Knight can, either in managing a courſer, obſerve bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his times and motions, or breake a Launce with a ſeemelier grace,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7477:26"/>
or bandiſh a Sword with greater cunning or dexteritie, than this our
Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>Continued had they on this diſcourſe (ſo much was <hi>Polimero</hi>
therewith delighted) had it not beene broken off by the drawing
neere of the Barke, by them a little before deſcried; whereunto ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no body therein, they drew neere, and one of the Mariners
boording her, found therein a man ſtretcht all along (by the pumpe)
covered with many cloathes, and gaſping for life; they (pittying to
ſee him in ſuch a plight, and curious to know the occaſion thereof)
began to queſtion him, but he opening his eyes a little, and then clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them againe, made them no anſwer; they hereupon (ſeeing him
not any way wounded) thought that perhaps he wanted ſuſtenance,
ſo much the rather, when having ſearched the Barke, they found
there, neither meat, nor drinke; therefore gave they him a little wine,
and a while after a little more, till they ſaw him beginne to recollect
his ſpirits, and recover ſome vigor; and withall (uncloſing his eyes)
mutter out ſome faint words, ſo as having made him a ſoppe (with
the pith of bread ſokened in Spaniſh wine) he willingly are it,
whereby he recovered ſuch force, as turning up his face, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himſelfe to bee the Admirals ſlave, of the Pilot very well
knowne; who was therfore the gladdeſt man in the world: yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any ſhew thereof, he commanded them to uſe all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
diligence to reſtore him to himſelfe, which they ſo performed,
as in a ſhort time he began to ſpeake. The Pilot, ſeeing him reſtored
to his diſpoſition, cauſed him to be tranſported over into his ſhip,
and the Barke to be tow'd, then after he had given him leave a good
while to repoſe himſelfe, he inquired of him, what he was? and
by what accident he came to be ſo left alone? He (with his eyes
inclined downewards) began to tell them a tale, without either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or end, and ſo by ſtudying for matter, the more diſcloſed
himſelfe to be what he was, neither had they gotten ought elſe out
of him, had not the Pilot (all diſguiſe laid aſide) ſaid unto him, Art
thou <hi>Andropodo,</hi> and knoweſt not him, proſtrating himſelfe, kneeled
downe before him, ſaying, Pardon me (my Lord) for truly I knew
you not in that habite you now weare; and ſithence I am falne into
your hands, I beſeech you rather to kill me, than bring me backe to
<hi>Sardegna;</hi> For albeit I am no wayes guiltie of the <hi>Prince</hi> his death,
nevertheleſſe, I aſſure my ſelfe that becauſe I am the Admirals ſlave,
my innocencie cannot ſave me: No more of this (anſwered the
counterfeit Pilot) but tell us how comes it, that thou haſt continued
ſo long at ſea? haſt thou landed any where? Whereunto <hi>Andropodo</hi>
(all quaking) made anſwer, that about ſome fortie dayes, ſithence he
imbarked himſelf, during which time he had ſuffered all the miſeries
to a body humane inſufferable, that the wind ever kept him (for the
moſt part) in the maine ſea, that ſometimes he ſaw land, and had a
good wind to come almoſt a ſhore, but that it changed in a moment,
and that he (not having any experience in governing the ſailes, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7477:26"/>
withall being all alone) had eſcaped in many tempeſts the danger of
drowning a thouſand times; but that his ill fortune had ſaved him, to
make him die a death more miſerable; that when he came aboord,
he found in the Barke a little bread, which laſted him not two dayes.
That on the <hi>Sardegnan</hi> coaſt, hee met with ſome Fiſher-men, and
(a little farther that way) a ſhip of <hi>Greece,</hi> that furniſhed him with
biſquet and a barrell of water, which he had wanted three dayes
before. That the principall cauſe of his roving up and downe
the ſea, was ſleepe, becauſe the Barke abandoned of her Rother,
ranne whither the wind carried her, ſo loſing (whilſt he ſlept) the
way he had gained waking; and beſide, being in the midſt of the ſea,
and not knowing on which part the land lay, he beleeved, that he
ranne alwayes in a round, going perhaps nothing at all, or very
little wide from the ſame place. And finally, that his ſpirit fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, he was ſtretch't along, expecting death, in manner as they
found him. And being asked why he imbarked not himſelfe in the
ſhip that ſold him the victuals, he anſwered, that they would not
take him aboord, for feare of the plague, whereof thoſe of the Eaſt
were very ſcrupulous, it being not lawfull for them, to commerce or
trafficke without their patent of health, from the place whence
they parted, with the preciſe number of the perſons a-boord
them.</p>
               <p>So be it a-Gods name (anſwered the Pilot) they have well done in
not taking thee with them, to leave thee to me, who will bring thee
where thou ſhalt receive the reward thy treaſons merit. Which ſaid,
he cauſed him to bee bound, and ſet faſt in the loweſt part of the
ſhip, to deprive him thereby of the meanes of doing himſelfe any
harme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> then (turning towards the Pilot, and ſmiling) ſaid; Sir,
you have hitherto repreſented the perſonage of one, whom you are
not: I pray you vouchſafe to favour me ſo much as fully to unmaske
your ſelfe; ſeeing this Villaine hath almoſt wholly diſcovered
you.</p>
               <p>The Knight (who till then had cauſed himſelfe to be called
Pilot) anſwered, I will obey you Sir, knowing you for ſuch as may
command me; for be pleaſed I pray you to know, that if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
your ſelfe masked as well as I, you entertaine then an opinion
that deceives you, you having not ſo ſoone ſet your foot a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord,
but that I knew you for what you are.</p>
               <p>My name is <hi>Eterosſilo,</hi> and am <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> a place on the
ſea coaſt on this part of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> bordering towards <hi>Afſrique:</hi> I was
the <hi>Prince</hi> his ſervant, to whoſe memorie I am ſo much indebted, as
that I ſhall never more content my ſelfe in that I can no longer ſerve
him. And as ſoone as (by the meanes of the conductors backe of the
ſhe-ſlave) the flight of this Villaine was knowne; I reſolved to goe
to ſea, (my heart telling me that I ſhould finde him out) having ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
well knowen him in the houſe of the Admirall, his maſter. I
romed of purpoſe up and downe this ſea, almoſt a moneth, without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7477:27"/>
being any thing the neerer of finding what I ſought for, untill (aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a great tempeſt) I was conſtrained to ſave my ſelfe in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of <hi>Birſa</hi> Where to avoid the being queſtioned of the affaires of
<hi>Sardegna</hi> (whereof I was doubtfull, whether I might without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
relate any thing in neighbouring countries) I charged every one
to call me by the counterfeite name of Pilot. And when I ſaw your
ſervant enquiring out for paſſage in ſome ſhip, for two perſons, and
two horſes; I know not what ſpirit prompt me (knowing him to be
your ſervant) that he ſought them for you, (putting then his hat off
in reverent manner, he proceeded) which are the <hi>Infant Polimero,</hi>
worthy ſonne of the puiſſant King of <hi>Mauritania;</hi> wherein I thought
my ſelfe exceeding fortunate, judging that in our tribulations, the
gods had touched the heart of a youthfull <hi>Prince,</hi> (ſo like both in the
vertues of the mind, and beautifull proportions of body to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
<hi>Prince</hi>) to come to the defence of <hi>Sardegna;</hi> ſo as it was no
difficult matter for us to accord for the paſſage. And now (my
Lord) behold us both unmasked. Here, as he would have kneeled
downe before <hi>Polimero,</hi> he taking him by the hand, beſought him
not to diſcover him; telling him how he would (as unknowne) make
one in thoſe warres; moved ſo to doe, for the intereſt common to
all Princes againſt Traitors, for the revenge due to the vertues of
Prince <hi>Perosſilo,</hi> and for the valour ſake of a Princeſſe ſo renowned,
as <hi>Eromena.</hi> And this was indeed the occaſion of breaking off his
intended voiage into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within two dayes then after, they landed ſafely in <hi>Chia,</hi> to the
great pleaſure and content of both parties.</p>

               <p>The weather was cleare, whereat all the world ſeemed to joy,
except the Galley-ſlaves, who, for being becalmed, were forc'd to
ply their oares.</p>
               <p>The Galley ſcowred away amaine courſe, ſeeming for her riches
and curioſitie of workemanſhip, to be ſome rare inchanted piece of
excellency. She had her poope curiouſly carved with divers Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of fineſt graven worke, gilt all over with gold; her pavement
of Iewels, and richeſt mother of pearle; her hulke painted over with
ſparkling vermilion; her oares of the ſame, but done pompouſly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7477:28"/>
from the midſt downewards with golden flames; her beake, railes,
and window-linternes proportioned to the deviſe of her poop; her
maſt and loope-holes gracefully adorned with banners, and flags of
cloth of gold: on her foreſaile flag-ſtaffe hung of the ſame ſtuffe a
goodly ſtreamer, of ſuch length, as it reach't downe to touch the very
waves; her three lanthornes of marvellous invention, glittering with
gold, afforded the greater luſtre, becauſe of the chryſtal, cut diamond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and artificially in-laid in their footſtals, cubes and columnes: ſo
as ſhe ſeemed to ſuch, as ſaw her a farre off, (both in ſhape and
colours,) a firie Dragon with ſcales and wings of gold.</p>
               <p>Two dayes ſailed the <hi>Prince,</hi> without ſeeing any kinde of veſſell
ſaile before him, on the third he deſcried a galley, which eſpying that
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> ſtrove to gaine the ſhore. But doubting to be overtaken,
ſhe made off towards the Weſt, thinking to eſcape by the benefit of
the night: The <hi>Prince</hi> taking her for ſome Pirats ſhip (as ſhe was
indeed) commanded the Galley-ſlaves of his Royall, to row a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
and they (encouraged with hope of bootie) made her ſcoure
little leſſe than her full length betweene one ſtroake and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Twenty miles off, were the Pirats deſcried by the little top-ſaile
of their top-gallant; and the <hi>Prince</hi> making forward with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſwiftneſſe, (maugre all her force of oares) over-tooke her;
whoſe Commanders ſeeing no meanes to eſcape, reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves, fearing to loſe the great riches they had ſtolne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and purpoſing to make head by tacking about, they could not
doe it ſo ſoone, but that the <hi>Prince</hi> his Galley, running her full courſe,
bore upon theirs at her poope; whence paſſing over her prow, ſhe
plung'd her up to the maſt in the ſea; but the veſſell being good, got
up a floate againe, receiving thereby no other harme, than the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of ſome battlements, with the death and bruiſing of ſuch as
were ſo unfortunate, as to be on that ſide of her: In the ſame encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
were many of the <hi>Prince</hi> his oares broken, a loſſe not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with the gaine of the Galley, which with no great paines, and
leſſe bloudſhed, fell into his hands. Then would he know what they
were, and whence they came, whereto one of them anſwering for
all, ſaid, That they were of <hi>Callo</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and that going
with a Galley of theirs, to get ſome bootie, towards the coaſt of
<hi>Catalogna,</hi> they were by an Eaſt winde driven to land on the ſtrand of
<hi>Dragonera,</hi> a little Iland of <hi>Maiorica;</hi> where having underſtood
how that from <hi>Porto Colombo</hi> to the Weſt part of the Iland, was to
ſet out a Galley, ſent from the King to his daughter; they made the
beſt ſpeed they could to rigge and dreſſe up theirs, which with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the ſhore was almoſt all over crack't, and bruiſed: and that,
having ſet themſelves in ambuſh behind the cliffe of <hi>Cabrera,</hi> they
had aſſailed her unawares, and (not farre off the haven) taken her,
with the death of many, for that being conſtrained to leave behind
them their owne Galley (which was unfit for any ſervice) they had
no roome on this other alone to ſet aboord both all their companie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7477:28"/>
and the ſlaves too; And that yet for all they had kild none, but the
more unſerviceable, ſparing the Knights, Ladies, family and ſervants
of the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi> with an intention to goe thence to the rocke, where
ſhe was her ſelfe (to them very well knowne,) and thence to take her
priſoner, whom they meant not to ſet free ere they had received
for her an exceeding great ranſome.</p>
               <p>Faine would the <hi>Prince</hi> ſee thoſe prizes, and paſſing over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
into their Galley, he found there certaine women, and among
thoſe the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Palomero,</hi> (the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her Governeſſe) with
foure Ladies of honour, and among the men ſix Knights.</p>
               <p>The women rather dead than alive, as ſoone as they ſaw the
<hi>Prince,</hi> kneeled downe before him, who courteouſly entertaining
them, accompanied them in grieving for their misfortunes,
yet joying in that hee was the meanes of their deliverance, he
prayed them to acquaint him with their voiage, and the occaſion
thereof</p>
               <p>The <hi>Counteſſe</hi> (ſomewhat comforting her ſelfe, and aſſured by
the Royall preſence of the <hi>Prince,</hi> whom by many circumſtances ſhe
thus judged to be ſuch) ſaid, My Lord, we, and thoſe Knights are all
Vaſſals and ſervants of the King of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> who having but one
onely daughter (which is one of the faireſt of the world) and ſhee
retired into <hi>Aſrique;</hi> ſent us thither with all proviſion neceſſary to
ſojourne with her in that Countrey; but ſcarce had we iſſued out of
the Port, when we were taken by theſe Pirats. The <hi>Prince</hi> (cauſing her
(though unwilling) to fit her down with all the other Ladies) curious
to underſtand the manner of the caſe, beſought her to relate it him
minutely and particularly, ſaying, that (being now freed) it would
ſerve them to ſhorten and drive away the time. At which word they
would all of them have kiſſed his hands, which he not permitting,
but profering them all further courteſies poſſible, the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
thanking him with the termes of Noble gratitude) thus
beganne.</p>
               <p>Two yeares are now expired, ſithence the King of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of a Marriage betweene the <hi>Prince</hi> his Sonne, and the <hi>Princeſſe
Eromilia</hi> our Miſtreſſe; which was concluded on, to the great
content of both parties, for the commodities of commerce, and
neighbour-hood, but much more for the rare qualities of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couple,
being ſuch, as (I beleeve) whoſoever had ſearched over all
the world, could not have found out ſuch another paire; for <hi>Perosfilo
Prince</hi> of <hi>Sardegna</hi> (beſides the valour of his perſon) was by nature
endowed with parts ſo excellent for beauty, feature, comelineſſe and
grace, as hardly meete all in one man alone. And for <hi>Eromilia</hi> our
<hi>Princeſſe,</hi> Ile not only ſay that who ſo hath ſeene her, beleeves her to
be for beautie matchleſſe; but I will alſo, without error, affirme her
to bee ſuch, as needs not (in that regard) the favourable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any.</p>
               <p>The marriage then concluded, with hope of a ſpeedie perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
ſhe was by her hopefull Bridegroome viſited by letters and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7477:29"/>
preſents, whereunto ſhe reciprocally correſponded, building a moſt
ardent affection on the preſumption of being his wife, and upon two
of his pictures, the one limmed and painted, the other made of ſtuck,
(this later, fully and proportionably repreſenting his naturall linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:)
It fell out afterwards, whileſt the marriage for more than
two yeares was (upon ſome unknowne occaſion) deferr'd, that the
infortunate <hi>Prince</hi> was by the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Saſſari</hi> (Admirall of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degna</hi>)
in the night time found a bed with his wife, and by him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſlaine, which newes ſpread abroad in <hi>Maiorica,</hi> manifeſted the
cauſe of ſo long putting off the mariage; which neuertheleſſe was not
ſufficient to take away from our <hi>Princeſſe</hi> all occaſion of griefe, as it
had done to any other: whereas ſhe no ſooner heard it, than ſhe
ſunke downe to the ground ſenſeleſle, and breathleſſe, ſo as there
was much adoe to reſtore her to her ſpirits, that had ſuddenly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
her. Impoſſible it is to expreſſe the extremitie of her lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſuffice it, that two dayes after ſhe went her wayes, whither no
body knew, except one very aged and truſty Prieſt of hers, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
(untill he was a good way of the Iland) never knew any thing of
her reſolution, (which was) to retire her ſelfe from the world, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more to thinke of father and mother, realme, ſubjects, or ought
elſe ſave onely on her dead husband, whom becauſe ſhe could not
owne living, ſhe reſolv'd to enjoy now dead and gone, ſpending a
coine quite contrarie to his, both in ſtampe and metal: for wheras he
had obſcured the puritie of his cuſtomes, by falſifying his faith (for
love of another woman) before he had maried her; ſhe on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(though now a freewoman, and he dead and buried) would reſerve
her ſelfe conſtantly his ſpouſe, reſolved never to change her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for any mans ſake in the world.</p>
               <p>The good old man could not with any arguments perſwade her
to returne; he ſhewed how ſhe (abiding in <hi>Maiorica</hi>) might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
her intention, telling her how that to goe wander about to ſeeke
places of aboad in ſtrange countries, was neither commendable nor
ſecure for a woman of ordinarie condition, much leſſe for a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi>
ordained, both by birth and deſert, to a royall dignitie; moreover
that in ſo doing ſhe could not pleaſe the gods; to whom ſhe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to devote her ſelfe, within the limitation of whoſe ſervice were
not comprehended the diſobedience and crueltie to parents-ward,
who, without doubt, would for this occaſion die with griefe; that
her reaſon of neglecting her parents for divine love, was not in this
caſe approueable, but that ſhe ſhould and ought to underſtand it
rightly, in a wholſome conſtruction, which was not to neglect
their ſervice for any affect of bloud, which ought not to be held in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
eſteeme with them, who admit of no comparatives, much leſſe
of ſuperlatives in their love; and that under ſuch a pretence to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
our parents, (eſpecially growne aged, deſolate, and charged
with a family) was rather to diſpleaſe, than to ſerve the gods, who
by the law they gave us by nature, require at our hands, reverence
and obedience towards our parents, being ſtrong, and vigorous,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7477:29"/>
and pitty, comfort and ſuſtenance, being become weake and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and that then the eldeſt child ought, together with the family,
ſuſtaine and undergoe the charge and burthen of parents; and if this
were the true meaning and manner of diſcharging on's dutie, even in
private families, how much rather ſhould it be obſerved in hers,
that was Royall, wherein ſhe being an onely child, had forſaken her
parents (growne now aged) and with them alſo the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
being her family, which being by her means made an Orphan,
lay ſubject to the tyranny of whoſoever would oppreſſe it? Beſides,
that this reſolution of hers ſprang not from any true affection ſhe
had of ſerving the gods, but from a deſpaire and diſcontent, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelfe deprived of ſuch a husband, whoſe companie ſhe hoped
would have endowed her with a bleſſed life; which effect ſhe deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to finde in any other, had ſuffered her ſelfe to be beguiled by
her evill <hi>Genius,</hi> who perſwaded her under the colour of pitty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
cruell againſt father, ſubjects, and her owne ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But to all theſe arguments, the good old man found her eares
deafe: for ſhe accompanied with one onely Damſell, and two of her
ancient ſervants (by whoſe meanes ſhe had found out that veſſell,
and put therein many things of her deerely eſteemed, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the ſtatue of the deceaſed <hi>Prince</hi>) paſſed over into <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique;</hi>
where landing at <hi>Velez,</hi> ſhe bought of the Lord of that place,
a Rocke, which ſhe then cauſed to be named <hi>Pegno della morte</hi> (or the
pledge of death:) whereupon ſhe cauſed immediatly a Chappell to
be built, with an intention to erect afterwards a Temple, by this
time begun, where ſhe intended to finiſh her dayes. By the Prieſts
perſwaſion, ſhe wrote to the King her father, to rid him from the
anxietie and vexation of minde; wherewith he was troubled becauſe
of her departure.</p>
               <p>Her father (ſomewhat conſolated in ſeeing the evill was not ſo
great as he beleeved it to be, and hoping that time would alter her
mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) being informed of the ſituation of the place, and of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
inhabitants, would needs ſend her (although he knew it to
be againſt her will) all her houſehold, to the end he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
alſo furniſh her with companie ſufficient to defend her, from
ſuch as might goe about to take her into their power; and with theſe
ſent hee alſo ſome Maſons, who under pretext of building the
Temple, might fortifie and aſſure the place with ſtrong wall-workes,
which reared up on the acceſſible parts of the rocke, might be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of a few perſons: Howbeit before he ſent us, he would know of
every one of us, whether we were willing to goe or no; but there
was not any one who was not willing to dwell in the fire, much leſſe
on a rocke, in the ſervice of ſo gracious and amiable a Miſtreſſe.
Wherupon, the King having cauſed this galley to be rig'd up, and put
in a readineſſe, and ſet aboord therein all kind of houſehold-ſtuffe
hangings, and furnitures neceſſarie for a new houſe, beſides a good
ſumme of money; we departed, when on a ſuddaine (ere we could
put our ſelves in defence) we were taken by theſe Pirats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7477:30"/>
The <hi>Prince</hi> (aſtoniſhed at a reſolution ſo ſtrange in ſuch a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi>
and enamoured of her extolled beautie, whereof he had alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
heard talke of) bethought himſelfe that he might conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
now goe ſee her, the way to goe where ſhe was abiding, being
the ſelfeſame courſe hee was to hold. Wherefore (after he had
thanked the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> for the relation ſhe imparted him) he told them
all that (ſo it were not diſcommodious unto them,) they might
without any feare abide ſtill in that Galley, becauſe of the great
number of men aboord his, and wiſhed them to ſee they had againe
all their things (as well thoſe of every particular perſon, as alſo
thoſe of their <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) reſtor'd them, whereof whatſoever was
wanting, he would ſee by all meanes found out; promiſing them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that their way being the ſame with his, he would not leave
them, untill he had landed them ſafely in the place where reſided the
<hi>Princeſſe,</hi> whoſe hands he (conformable to the dutie of a knight) was
deſirous to kiſſe, whereat they all kneeled before him on the ground,
and to the <hi>Prince</hi> raiſing them up, the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> after ſhe had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him convenient thanks, thus ſpake on.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in telling you the Hiſtorie of my Miſtreſſe, I forgot
one eſſentiall point thereof, which is, that after her reſolution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her wayes, and leading that kind of life ſhe now lives, ſhe made
a third reſolution, more ſtrange than all the reſt, which was, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
a whole yeare unſeene of any mankind in the world, except
ſuch as were admitted to ſerve her: ſo that the King himſelfe (her
father) (deſirous to come in perſon to bring her backe againe)
chuſed rather (as the leſſer evill) not to come, condemning that
ſmall time to the griefe of his daughter, who having experimented
the bitterneſſe thereof, and vented the extremitie of her heavineſſe,
would (as he hoped) become more ſupple and pliant to wholſome
perſwaſions. And of this (My Lord) I thought good to informe you,
to the end that to you being ſo courteous, it might not ſeeme a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie
meant towards you, when you encounter an effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your deſert. The <hi>Prince</hi> ſomewhat amazed hereat, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
tooke his leave of them, ſending the Pirats, being his ſubjects
to the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> to be by her chaſtiſed, as ſhe thought good, who
being importuned and preſſed to accept them, and foreſeeing the uſe
and imployment her <hi>Princeſſe</hi> might have of ſlaves, cauſed them to be
put to the chaines, abhorring to chaſtiſe them with any other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
though they well deſerved it.</p>
               <p>In the three dayes following, the <hi>Prince</hi> encountred with many
veſſels, of whom he could heare no newes of her he ſought after.
But now drawing neere to the <hi>Pegno della morte</hi> (which after a long
progreſſe of time, I know not if by corruption of language or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
it came to be called the <hi>Pagnone</hi>) he overtooke a ſhip of <hi>Sardeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
which in that ſhe came not from <hi>Birſa</hi> made him ſomewhat pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive:
whereupon the maſter of the ſhip ſaid, (My Lord) if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to heare any newes of the <hi>Sardegnan</hi> ſhip, that came from <hi>Birſa,</hi>
I have here one can ſatisfie you, for I met her in her returne, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7477:30"/>
ſhe belong'd to the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> of whom I obtained the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of getting this young man (my brother) from aboord her; who
will relate unto you, what he knowes, to ſatisfie you in what you
ſhall pleaſe to require of him. The <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Count</hi> both (having
queſtioned him particularly touching the paſſengers aboord that ſhip)
comprehended by the qualities of the horſe, and of the ſquire; but
more probably by the features of the youth &amp; reſpect borne him by
the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> that without doubt, that ſame was <hi>Polimero,</hi> whereof
they cauſing him to relate the ſame againe, were yet more than fully
aſſur'd that it could be no other than he. <hi>Metaneone</hi> therefore the
gladdeſt man now that ever he was all his life time, reſolved (as
ſoone as he had accompanied thoſe people to their journies end, and
ſeene the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) to ſteere thence to <hi>Sardegna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arrived at the <hi>Pegno,</hi> he would not come a ſhore for feare of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi> but calling one of her Knights, whom in that
ſmall time his good liking reputed confident, he ſaid unto him;</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Perſeno,</hi> one thing that I deſire moſt in this world, is to
ſerve your Lady the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> it grieves me that I may not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
perſonally to offer her my ſervice to ſuch an honeſt and hououra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
end, as befits a Knight of my qualitie; ſeeing that her vow forbids
me it: It would grieve me extremely to part without ſeeing her, I'le
therefore intreate you to further me to the accompliſhment of my
deſire. And ſeeing ſhe is reſolved to ſee no man, I will not bind you
to an impoſſibilitie, but onely to bring me to ſee her without letting
her know it; wherein I promiſe you not to ſtray from your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſeno</hi> (that held himſelfe obliged to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and well concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the honeſtie of his intentions,) made him this anſwer.</p>
               <p>My Lord, ſo much I hold my ſelfe obliged unto you, for the
favour you ſhew me in commending me, that if I owed you not
that great obligation, (as doe all the reſt in generall, and withall
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her ſelfe, my Miſtreſſe) yet were this a ſufficient tie to
oblige me eternally; howbeit, I beſeech you, give me leave to tell
you, that I cannot as yet abſolutely promiſe you any thing in this
purpoſe, having not as yet ſeene the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> nor knowing how ſhe
lives, neither am I acquainted with the place whereby I might make
uſe of ſuch occaſions as would be requiſite in ſuch a buſineſſe: but if
you pleaſe to give me time to ſee her, and to diſcover and obſerve
her manner of life, I promiſe you then, that I will endeavour to obey
you, to the utmoſt of my power, aſſuring my ſelfe, that you will
not command me any thing wherein I may not ſerve you without
blemiſhing my honour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> well ſatisfied with the reaſons of <hi>Perſeno,</hi> told him
that he would willingly attend, and withal would not ſtray from his
directions. Afterwards, having ſent for the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> he told her he
was glad that ſhe was ſafely arrived to her Lady and <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> to
whom though he could not be permitted to come to kiſſe her hands
(as his duty bound him) he hoped nevertheleſſe to be favored with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7477:31"/>
ſome command of hers, ere his departure, which would be about
three dayes thence, during which time he had need to repoſe his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-ſlaves,
that he might then after hold on a ſtraight courſe to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degna,</hi>
where he hoped to finde out his Brother.</p>
               <p>The Lady (who was of right noble behaviour) anſwered him;
that ſhe found her ſelfe confuſed in the confuſed being and ſtate of
her Miſtreſſe, for that ſhe well knew, that to ſuffer him to depart
thence, without being for his noble favours, courteouſly thanked by
her herſelfe, was no otherwiſe than to ſatisfie a great obligation
with the coine of a greater ingratitude, and therefore beſought him
to be pleaſed to excuſe with the perfection of his courteſie, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of the times, and to aſſure himſelfe that ſhe (for her part)
would not faile to manifeſt to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> to the King her father,
and to all the world, how deepely, and for how great a good turne
ſhe remained engaged to his Highneſſe. Wherunto the <hi>Prince</hi> replied,
that he deemed himſelfe moſt happy, in being ſo fortunate, as to
happen to doe ſo ſlender a ſervice for ſo worthy a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> for
which he pretended no other guerdon, than the favour of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
that he might more effectually ſerve her, and ſo tooke his
leave, abiding below without offering either to goe up himſelfe, or
permit any other to aſcend the Rocke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (in the meane time) according to the cuſtome of
melancholy folkes (who either ſtand ſtone-ſtill, or elſe are never
quiet nor content with any place) roaming up and downe, (now
here, now there) about the upper part of the rocke, vouchſafed not
once to move herſelfe at the newes, which was brought her of the
ſplendor deſcried afarre off, although it made towards, and drew
neere that place; till ſeeing the Galley appeare from under the cliffe,
and marvelling at a piece ſo rich and gallant, ſhe could not chuſe (for
all her griefe) but behold it, yet fretting with her ſelfe for giving
her ſenſes way, to taſte of the leaſt content, (contrarie to her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
made, of never taking delight in any thing) ſhe returned to her
lodgings, become (in reſpect of its garniſhment, ſituation, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe)
gaſtly and hideous to behold; ſhe could not beleeve
that they were company ſent her from her father, for well knew ſhe
that his <hi>Arcenall</hi> affoorded no ſuch Galleyes. And whilſt ſhe, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to know whoſe it was, was angry with her ſelfe for being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
deſirous to reſt naked of any other affect, than of griefe alone,
<hi>Gierofando</hi> the Prieſt came unto her, with newes, that the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of
<hi>Palomera</hi> was at the foot of the rocke (with all thoſe of her houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
ſent her from her father) accompanied with a great <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromilia</hi> (doubtfull in her minde, what ſhe ſhould doe, and
wrought on by the tenderneſſe of her affections, being not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indulgent, nor yet altogether repugnant to her naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
knew not whether ſhe ſhould rather joy for the comming of
the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> (her Governeſſe) or fret her ſelfe, that any <hi>Prince</hi>
would (contrarie to her deliberation) proffer to come to that place.
Nevertheleſſe, the ſtocke of her naturall prudence remaining yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7477:31"/>
livily, after being awhlle amazed to ſee her houſehold come unſent
for, imagining the cauſe thereof, which diſpleaſed her not, in that
ſhe began already to conceive the danger ſhe incurr'd in, by living ſo
alone, ſhe made no other anſwer, than that the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> was well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and that ſhe onely ſhould be admitted to come to her. But
that for ſtrangers, he well knew himſelfe, that ſhe could not be ſeene
of her owne father, and therefore referr'd to him the ſatisfying of
that <hi>Prince</hi> in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt then with crooked and tortuous interrogations <hi>Gierofando</hi>
endevoured to tell her what ſhe required not; thither came the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe,</hi>
whom the Prieſt went to meet, conducting her in, all-alone.
The teares (here ſhed) were in ſuch abundance, as there was not for
a good while any roome left for ſpeech: but as ſoone as any was, the
wittie Lady (knowing that the time ſerved but to things generall)
preſented her with the letters of the King and Queene, giving her
withall ſuccinct newes of the houſes, of ſuch things as were ſent her
by her father, and of the love of the family. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in affection) would needs ſee them all, who came one by one
to kiſſe her hands, waxen ſo moiſt with the teares of every one of
them, as ſhe could not reſtraine hers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Counteſſe</hi> then afterwards related unto her, how they had
beene taken by Pirats, and freed by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the humanitie of his behaviour, his Royall manners, and the
features of his perſon; acquainting her further of the deſire he had
to kiſſe her hand, or at leaſt, to receive from her ſome command,
ere his departure thence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> anſwered, ſhe was ſorry ſhe could nor might not ſee
him, to acknowledge the obligation ſhe owed him. But hoped, that
(he being a courteous Knight) would accept of her excuſes, in ſtead
of more eſſentiall reaſons. With which embaſſage, to ſatisfie him in
that behalfe; ſhe willed there ſhould be ſent him ſome Knight (in
her name) ſuch as ſhould to the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> ſeeme fitteſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Counteſſe</hi> having obſerved in their voiage, the affectionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
the <hi>Prince</hi> had ſhewed towards <hi>Perſeno,</hi> cauſed him to be
called in, to whom the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſeno,</hi> the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> hath told me what great favour, both I and
all you have received at the hands of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and
how by his meanes have beene ſaved, both your lives and liberties.
If I were now, as heretofore I have beene, I would endeavour with
my owne mouth to aſſure him, how highly I eſteeme his favours;
but I being now no more my ſelfe, am (among other defects) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabled
herein (which at this preſent inwardly grieves me) my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſtate being more capable of receiving, than in doing courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies;
and ſeeing (becauſe of my vow) I may not ſee any man, I cannot
therefore content my ſelfe, in partly ſatisfying ſo great a ſervice.</p>
               <p>Then (wiping off her teares which the imagination of her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
made her powre out in abundance) ſhe further ſaid.</p>
               <p>I can tell you no more, you know my minde, and therewithall the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7477:32"/>
condition of my hard fortune, you ſhall therefore with your
ſpeech, ſupply the defect of mine. And becauſe the place is not
furniſhed with any thing worth the preſenting him, nor my ſelfe
ſtored with any thing to honour him withall, you ſhall endevour to
aſſure him of the griefe I conceive thereof Afterwards, when ſhee
had opened her fathers letter, ſhe found it thus ſaid.</p>
               <p>Onely and beloved daughter, by your abſence have I obſcurely
gheſſed, and by your letters clearely underſtood of the ſtrange reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
by you undertaken, ſo that if I knew you not well, or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not that I knew you more than paſſing well, I know not what
I could thinke of you; for firſt, for the loſſe of one thing in hazard
or uncertaine, and which might well not be (that is, your husband)
you have deſpiſed many things certaine, and which could not chuſe
but be; and ſuch am I, your mother, our ſubjects and kingdome.
And albeit the gods have endued you with a ſpirit tranſcending the
ordinary, nevertheleſſe I beleeve for a certaine, that if a man would at
this preſent demand your reaſon, why you have ſo done, you would
anſwer him with <hi>I cannot tell,</hi> and therefore the firſt eſſence that was
in you is neceſſarily corrupted, ſeeing the actions thereon depending
are corrupted: for although it were granted, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degna</hi>
had beene already your husband, and that the poſſeſſion of his
perſon had redoubled your love, yet what reaſon ſhould move you
to grieve for him in ſuch a faſhion, as that becauſe you cannot enjoy
him, you will not enjoy the world? Nay, though even this were alſo
granted you, yet who will grant you, that you may live, and not
live to the world? If then you ought to make uſe of the world, then
ought you doubtleſſe to exchange a Cliffe for the Iland <hi>Baleari,</hi>
which ought to be ſo much the worthier of your aſhes, by how
much the neerer they are to the tombes of thoſe you love ſo well:
And though your judgement were ſo unequall, as to judge, that you
ought for the place where you are, leave the place where you ſhould
be, and that you may live, and yet not live to the world: yet tell me
(I pray you) what reaſon, what law, or what god have ever heard
grant or allow ſuch injuſtice, offence, or crueltie, as you, an onely
daughter, uſe towards me your father, that never gave you any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
therefore? Which if you had no reaſon to have done, although
I had uſed you ill, what cauſe or colour have you then for it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I eſteemed you not onely as a daughter, but as mine owne
heart, you being withall even in my life's time (excepting the title)
Soveraigne Queene of my people? In that you loved him, that was
to be your husband, it is a ſigne of a good and laudable nature, I
blame you not therefore; but to have ſo loved him, as becauſe you
cannot love him any longer, you will not love either me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you ſhall finde this to be an obſtinate contradiction of nature:
You ſay, you are retired, becauſe you would not be interrupted in
your griefe; Truly if nature were as conſtant as ſhe's variable in our
affections, then had you wiſely deliberated, and I would have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commended you; for if a man could ſhunne all griefes for the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7477:32"/>
price of one griefe alone, though the ſame were moſt violent, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he ought to purchaſe it at any rate, becauſe it is impoſſible that
it can of its nature laſt long: and paſſions paſſe away even as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
doe, though not ſo ſoone, which though they did not, yet
paines, abſtractions, and buſineſſes, but (above all things) time (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating
it by little and little) would at length reduce it to nothing.
Whence it proceeds, that who ſo beleeveth to prefix and give him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſelfe
a law for his life, founded upon a running griefe, imagining it to
be everlaſting (as you have done) ſuch an one doth not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himſelfe; but alſo (as ſoone as his underſtanding is cleared
from the cloud of paſſion) he firſt repents himſelfe thereof, and
then lookes in the face of his owne ignorance, which inſtructs him
how humane nature is changeable in all things, and yet rather in
love, than in hatred. But let us ſuppoſe it be not ſo, and let's grant,
that you may be in time poſſeſſed, if not of a greater griefe, at leaſt of
a more worthy reſolution, occaſioned by ſome danger of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
of my death, of the loſſe of your ſubjects, and of many other
accidents which cannot be imagined: Tell me, which of them would
you judge more worthy the entertaining, the firſt, or the laſt? That
which toucheth you very neere, or that which nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
you? That, whereto you (applying the remedy) may bring
to nothing, or that, which (being irremediable) can receive no other
being than that of your imagination? But yet, this is not all, it is a
thing ordinary for one evill to produce many others. Your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
griefe may beget deſperation, and deſperation the loathing
of all things; hence ſprung your diſobedience, your ſtealing away,
your new courſe of life, and finally your vow of depriving your ſelfe
of your ſelfe, and of ſeeing you, every man (my ſelfe not excepted.)
If this be the ladder to climbe up to heaven, and the way to pleaſe
the gods, as you pretend, then would I thinke that humane actions
were to them indifferent, and that their favour might be acquaired as
well by working iniquitie, as by doing good and vertuous deeds.
Perceive you not, alas, what opinions your actions manifeſt you to
hold; (which is) to forme by degrees this monſtrous, horrid and
blaſphemous conſequence? If you had a deſire to ſerve the gods,
how then to marrie? Or will you, that I beare ſomething with
your love (truly lawfull, and in its limits vertuous?) well, I am ſo
content; but what hinders you to ſerve the gods, abiding at home
in your owne houſe? Are <hi>Maiorica</hi> and <hi>Minorica</hi> not to your liking,
for being more ſpacious and fairer than your <hi>Pegno della morte?</hi>
And why ſo I pray you? Have the gods (perhaps) ſuch eyes as we?
Or reſpect they more the outward appearance than the inward reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
Thinke you that they eſteeme more an erected Temple, than
a contrire heart? No ſurely, we may as well ſerve the gods in our
delicious and ſumptuous palaces, as offend them in Caves and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Much was the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> aſtoniſhed at the reaſons of this letter, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
when ſhe more lively conſidered the danger, wherein ſhe
ſtood, wherefore ſhe reſolved, as ſoone as her husbands funerall rites
were ſolemnized, to wall about the rock on the parts of its aſcent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every where elſe ſo fortified by nature, as it needed not to be
doubted of. <hi>Perſeno</hi> in the interim joyfull for the commandement he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7477:33"/>
had received, went to preſent the <hi>Prince</hi> with his embaſſage, who (after
correſponding of affectionate diſcourſes) thus ſaid unto him. And
muſt I then (my kinde friend) depart hence without ſeeing your Lady
the <hi>Princeſſe?</hi> I much doubt it (anſwered <hi>Perſeno</hi>) unleſſe you would
vouchſafe to abaſe your ſelfe to doe one thing I have thought of;
without the which it is impoſſible that any man in the world come
to the ſight of her: And (being demanded what that was) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
ſaying,</p>
               <p>Two things my Miſtreſſe intends to doe; the one is the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Chappell, for the celebrating of ſacrifice; the other, the
ſolemnization of <hi>Prince Pirosfilo's</hi> funerall, when (among other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies)
ſhe will, that all, aſwell her Knights as Squires, be cloathed
(conformable to the cuſtome of our Countrey in the like occaſions)
in a mourning garment with a <hi>Cappuccio</hi> or hood which covers the
face, ſaving the eyes; for whoſe uſe there is an opening in that part
reſerved. What I have thought of, is, to give you mine, and to
take for my ſelfe one of one of my ſervants; If this device pleaſe you,
the matter is then accompliſhed, for to conduct you in, is a thing I
can eaſily performe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (embracing him) with great joy told him, that hee
could not have thought on a better meanes, deſiring to have it by all
meanes effected. The order they therefore tooke was, that the
<hi>Prince</hi> ſhould launch out thence, to ſome place not farre off, and that
within ſix dayes then after (which was the terme prefixt) leaving
his Galley behinde him, he ſhould come in a Frigat about midnight,
there (ſhewing him the place with his finger) where he with a little
Barke would be ready to receive him. Which concluded on, <hi>Perſeno</hi>
returning to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> reported unto her ſuch ſpeeches, which
even of blinde folkes could not be taken for other than conceits of
curteſie, &amp; by a good eye might eaſily be diſcerned to implie conceits
of love, neither diſpleaſed they her; for that truly gentle hearts are
ever ambitious of other mens good opinions. But the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they exceedingly, who earneſtly deſired that ſome new affection
of ſome effectuall love in her Lady and <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> might rid the old of
it's deſperate humor: for the better grounding whereof ſhe neglected
not the opportunitie of extolling the <hi>Prince,</hi> with ſuch commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as had beene ſufficient to have enamoured any heart not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
reſolved not to love at all.</p>
               <p>Now the time for repoſing the Galley-ſlaves being expired, the
<hi>Prince</hi> cauſed the <hi>March</hi> or <hi>Levata</hi> to be ſounded, continued with
the conſort of all his trumpets, with ſuch exquiſite melodie, that the
hollow concavitie of the rocke thereat reſounding, the ecchoes were
heard make anſwer from every part thereof. Whereupon every
one ran out to ſee the Galley, except the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who was jealous
leſt her griefe ſhould grow to be diſpleaſed with her, for adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her ſelfe to the guſt of a curious ſight; yet would ſhe have the
<hi>Counteſſe</hi> goe thither with the reſt, to whom (refuſing to goe, and
leave her all alone) ſhe ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7477:34"/>
Mother, the time that was is now no more, ſolitarineſſe is now
my paſtime: And albeit you are (as you know your ſelfe to be)
right deare unto me; nevertheleſſe ſeeing I hate my owne company,
the being deprived of anothers cannot grieve me: Recreate your ſelfe
then, and take no care of me, and ſo ſhall you beſt pleaſe me, for in
doing otherwiſe you will diſpleaſe me. Whereat the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſorrie, without any more words went out.</p>
               <p>Then ſtood the Galley beaten upon by the beames of the Sunne
in her glittering parts, ſo as ſhe ſeemed with her ſplendors to warre
againſt <hi>Phaebus,</hi> and to dart to him-wards, as many radiant glimps, as
ſhe received of him. Being afterwards diſanchored, whileſt the
ghinge ſtood readie with oares in hand at the whiſtle of the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaine,
ſhe ſaluted (according to the cuſtome) the place thrice with
cries and trumpets; the windowes above them appeared full of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Knights, that ſtanding bare ſaluted the <hi>Prince,</hi> who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them with the like, and cauſing the ghing plie the water with
their oares in tenne ſtroakes vaniſhed out of the Port: whence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the <hi>Promontory</hi> towards the Eaſt, landing at <hi>Budema</hi> twentie
miles off, he ſmiling ſaid to the <hi>Count,</hi> What thinke you? Have we
not made a long dayes journey? And upon this acquainting him
of what he meant to doe, he there entertained himſelfe untill the day
appointed, which ſeemed to him a tedious yeares time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
armed and mann'd a Frigat with men and oars, he went aboord
her, taking a ſpeciall care when he came neere the rocke, to glide on
ſo ſilently that the noiſe of rowing might not diſcover him: arrived
to the place appointed, he had no cauſe to attend, for there found
he the diligent <hi>Perſeno</hi> with a little Whirry, wherein both of them
paſſed over to the Rocke, having firſt taken order, that the Frigat
ſhould returne the night following to the ſelfeſame place to fetch
him backe againe. Thence gotten up on high with no ſmall paines to
the <hi>Prince,</hi> being unacquainted with that ſteepie aſcent, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo darke and not otherwiſe illuminated than by ſtarlight; he
ſlept that night with <hi>Perſeno,</hi> becauſe he could not be better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated,
yet was ſo merry in that he hoped to obtaine his deſire, that
he never thought of any toile or diſcommoditie.</p>
               <p>The day come, the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who ſlept little or nothing, roſe up
early in the morning, and after the Chappell was dedicated (which
was without any ceremony, and where the <hi>Prince</hi> could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come) every oneretired himſelfe to his owne lodgings, till
ſuch time as the funerall Beere was put in order.</p>
               <p>Then appeared the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> in the Hall, where the ceremony was
to begin, clad in a blacke gowne ſtraight waſted with large ſleeves,
and ſo long, as they reached downe to the ground, it was lined quite
through with whiteſilke cipres, pleated and criſped about the
necke, with a deepe fringe round about it: the body of her garment,
and the ſleeves of her waſcot, were cut from the higheſt to the loweſt
part thereof, and rejoind with ſmall blacke loope-lace, betweene
which cuts the ſame cipres came puckering out in equall ſmall pleats;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7477:34"/>
attracting the eies of the beholders with the comelines of her perſon,
the ſtrangeneſſe of the habit, and the proportion of contrary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
her head, necke, and breſt were covered with a kind of robe
of exceeding fine linnen, foulded in waves, which reached no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
downe than the knee: her ſweete face reſtrain'd in its owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
had allowed it for obſervers and keepers (as it was not fit it
ſhould be left all alone) ſome few of her faire haire, which the
more they were confuſed in the <hi>Chaos</hi> of ſo comely a melancholy,
the more orderly were they diſpoſed to proportionate the faireſt of
all other beauties: yet were they no golden haires, becauſe nature fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
or peradventure emulating thoſe accidentall colours of her
habit; &amp; being deſirous to ſure naturally the ſame deviſe, had framed
her countenance as white as the driven ſnow, and her haire like the
glittering browne of fineſt ſilke; this robe of hers, together with her
face were covered all over with a tranſparent veile; which although
it was blacke, yet did it not moderate, but rather augment thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
beauties: that being neither altogether apparant, nor yet alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
hidden,
could not either be concealed in their being ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or conceived in their full perfections; for their raies, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
through the pores of the heart, made themſelves knowen, and
yet dazling the eyes of the capacitie depriv'd it of the meanes of
well-knowing and fully diſcerning them. This her habit was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed
with the pearles that drop'd in chaines from her chryſtall
eyes, which (united together in a milke-white piece of fine linnen
under the black veile) were motives ſufficient to change even mirth
and laughter it ſelfe into plaint and griefe.</p>
               <p>The family came to the Hall a little before, to waite on their
Miſtreſſe, and among them <hi>Metaneone</hi> and <hi>Perſeno</hi> in the very inſtant
of her comming forth of her chamber (as private as they could to
ſhun the occaſion of diſcourſe with any one.) The <hi>Prince</hi> ſeeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
ſuch a tree cloath'd with a ſhadow, purpurized under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie
of veiles, betweene two contrary colours (no otherwiſe
than <hi>Aurora</hi> when ſhe begins (at the approach of the Sun-beames)
to ſhew forth her ornamentall graces, having beſprinkled the eyes
attracted with unknowen violence, in ſtead of dew with a treaſure of
teares, ſignes (not obſcure, of an amorous heart) became thereat
ſo aſtoniſhed, as that if he had beene ſo forgetfull of the qualitie
of the place, as he was of his owne condition, hee had no doubt
in that place quite forgotten himſelfe. But <hi>Perſeno</hi> (that with
a vigilant eye beheld him) ſeeing him beginne to ſtagger, ſet him
right againe by bringing him to himſelfe with a becke; Iuſt as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Courſer (forgetting his exerciſe) is ſuddenly brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the voice and hand.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of the Hall ſtood a <hi>Beere,</hi> repreſenting the body of
the dead <hi>Prince</hi> raiſed up from the ground, with a large Beere-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of blacke velvet, fringed round about with divers Tropheies of
armes and inſtruments of warre, with the Eſcocheons of <hi>Sardegna</hi>
and <hi>Maiorica</hi> quartered, and richly embrodered with gold at each of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7477:35"/>
it's foure corners. The ſuperficies of the Beere-cloath was ſprinkled
all over with drops of bloud, repreſented to the life by a curious
hollow-ſtich of vermilion ſilke. The Hall hang'd all over with
blacke Arras, not onely the walls, but alſo the ſeeling and pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof. So as amongſt all theſe obſcure colours, there was
not any white diſcernable, but onely that which (ſhaming all blacks)
was not onely tranſparent, but reſplendent from under the veiles of
the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At one end of this Hall right over againſt the <hi>Beere</hi> ſtood placed a
Canopy of State, with a little bench, and two great cuſhions, all
covered over with blacke velvet: here ſtood ſtill the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and
kneeled downe; where after ſhe had a while fixed her waterie eyes
to heaven-wards, then (as if ſhe hated the light) bent them downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to celebrate the funerall, weeping out amaine ſuch muſicke, as
with i'ts mournefull and compaſſionate tone, drew humid lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from the drieſt eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> uncertaine with himſelfe, whether he was in a dreame,
or awake, nere tooke his eyes off the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and (forming in
his minde a rapſody of the things he ſaw) was not aware that he ſaw
them, ſo great was the confuſion hee toſſed too and fro, in his
minde.</p>
               <p>The muſicke ended, there were diſtributed torches, which
(though of pure white wax) were yet all artificially made obſcurely
browne. Then the Prieſt, having firſt invocated the God of gods
with the attributes of onely incomprehenſible, and eternall, thus
prayed:</p>
               <p>Receive (O Lord) our prayers, and accept our teares, which becauſe they
are not worthy of thy ſight, vouchſafe to make them worthy, for thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
ſake; ſeeing we, becauſe of our corruption, cannot make them worthy,
but acknowledge thee to be both the worke, and the workeman, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and end of all things, and that in thee is perfect happineſſe, which
we hope to enjoy in thee, by thee, and with thee, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Which ſaid, taking out of a golden Chalice, a ſpoonefull of moſt
pretious ſweete incenſe, he powred it on the kindled embers, that
ſtood by him in a great veſſell of ſilver, and then made a ſigne to
them all to ſtand up, and goe forward with their tapers lighted;
thoſe of meaner qualitie going firſt in rancke, were followed by ſuch
as carried the Beere; next after which followed the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with her Ladies.</p>
               <p>The little Chappell was all over illuminated with no other light
than wax candles, having its windowes ſhut up with cloath cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
to make the ceremonies ſeeme more lugubrous, and the office
more devout: In the end thereof ſtood a great Altar, hung round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with blacke velvet, whereon in ſtead of fringe, were richly
embrodered divers tropheies of death. On this Altar was not any
god, onely there ſtood faſtened in the wall a large Tablet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
picture-worke, whereon with aſtronomicall proportions was
repreſented the Vniverſe: in whoſe poles ſtood two hands full of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7477:35"/>
light, that gave it motion, made in ſuch a faſhion as they ſeemed to
be of a greater body than the world. And this body became invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by being hidden by the interpoſition of the machine of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
but much more by its owne ſplendent raies; the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe raies were fild up with good Angels, having ſundry co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loured
wings, and about it might be reade,
<q>And in perpetuall working I<lb/>
Finde ſweete repoſe eternally.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoone as they came hither, they laid downe the Beere upon
a rais'd-worke mourning Coverlet, adorned with many pieces of
armes. The Prieſt having in his hand a ſilver veſſell (that hung at
ſmall chaines of the ſame, wherein was fineſt incenſe on fired
coales) went thriſe about the Beere, invocating the greateſt <hi>Iove.</hi>
Whereto being anſwered by the Quire of muſicke, he made a ſtand
before the Altar, where (after a long ſilence) lifting up his eyes
towards heaven, he ſaid:</p>
               <p>O Lord, that art the true love wherewith thou joineſt together in an
inviſible ſociety, the things become incorruptible and immortall, we pray
thee ſo to ſtrengthen us as that wee being divided from our corruptible and

               </p>
               <p>In the meane time got up the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and <hi>Metaneone</hi> (before
advertized by <hi>Perſeno</hi> to whom that duty belonged) was ready to
helpe to raiſe her; ſupporting her to his ſo great content, as he might
well in diſparity (or in a contrary kind) contend to paralell her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
               <p>Come to the Altar, ſhe taking in her faire hands the Incenſe, and

her of the King her father; but I doubt it will prove but loſt labour,
unleſſe ſhe alter her opinion: I am not of my ſelfe a man to reſolve
of any thing, without your adviſe, as well for my ingagement to

you much oblige me. Beſides you may well judge, that the little
ſervice I did you, tended indeed to the ſervice of my Miſtreſſe; and
therefore the foundations of what you thinke your ſelfe obliged for
to me-wards, is quite demoliſhed. For I fore-thought (moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>prince</hi>) that you becomming enamored of her (as I was ſure you
would be, conſidering her perfections) might prove a meane to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
her from her ſo ſtrange a courſe of life. Becauſe her being
ſought for, by ſo great and worthy <hi>Prince,</hi> as your Highneſſe is,
might open away to the buſineſſe of freeing her hence. Of your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of demanding her of the King her father I approve right well,
which the ſooner it be done, would be the better; albeit I could wiſh it
were caried in ſuch a faſhion, as the demand might not occaſion any
delay, (that is) that ſhe were demanded by the gratious mediation
of the King your father, and that with his owne privity: becauſe
ſince ſuch muſt be the iſſue of it, it is as good it be done firſt as laſt;
as well to eſchew loſſe of time, as alſo becauſe the buſineſſe may goe
forwards under the ſhadow, protection and dignitie of both parties.
Neither ſhould her preſent humor give you any cauſe of diſincou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,

and as for others, when they come to know her to be yours, they

               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> embracing him about the necke, expreſſes his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
with the moſt affectionate tearmes that could be, and (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
their diſcourſe) asked him, what new and ſtrange manner of
ſervice was that which the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> uſed in worſhipping the gods?
Wherto <hi>Perſeno</hi> anſwered, my Miſtres, as in materiall things ſhe hath
not any one thing ordinary or common unto others: ſo alſo in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
of ſpirit there is none can paragonize or equall her; for ſhe,
(not contenting herſelfe with the common opinion) examines the
cauſes of things with ſuch an elevated judgement, as there is not a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi>
that can paralell her in the ſpeculation of them. And that
which above all other things makes her curious, is not onely the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie,
but rather the contrariety of opinions, almoſt in all ages, and
thoſe ſtiffely maintained by all ſuch as were by the world eſteemed
for the wiſeſt men, ſo as it might (not without good reaſon) be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded,
That <hi>humane wiſdome is meere folly and hath no certaine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And if any man were more prized than the reſt, it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had reaſon to procure him better eſtimation; but becauſe
nature made him more acute than others in <hi>Philoſophizing,</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7477:37"/>
in the art of ſpeaking more <hi>dialecticall</hi> in perſwading. I will give
you a touch of my Miſtreſſe her opinion in the generalitie
of things, to the end you may imagine that the particulars dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
not a whit therefrom. To this her ſound judgement thee
hath conjoyned a Prince-worthy erudition; becauſe ſhee hating
ſuperficiall and ſeeming diſciplines, which puffes up the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
embraces the <hi>ſolid,</hi> wherein conſiſts reall and true
knowledge; And albeit <hi>Philozophizing</hi> on the gods bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dangerous, being it is dangerous to pronounce the truth, in
that wee cannot ſet it forth but according to our capacitie, whence
proceeded (not without ſome ground) that ſaying, <hi>that the truth
thereof is beſt knowne by being not knowen:</hi> yet is it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
lawfull for us to know ſo much thereof, as Pietie and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
permits us; for if wee were thereof altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
then would there not bee among us either devotion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>About ſome two yeares ſithence came from <hi>Lucania</hi> (I know
not by what accident) that Prieſt you ſaw in the Temple, who being
(beſides his knowledge and learning) a man of an upright mind, and
exemplary life, was beſtowed on her by the King, to the end that
by his conference ſhe might be aſſiſted and furthered in her ſtudies,
wherein they are come to ſuch a pitch, as they have concluded,
that the opinion of many gods is falſe, and that there is no more but
one, and him ſuch a one, as no underſtanding can conceive in that he
tranſcends the limits and reach of our intellects. And that is the
reaſon you ſaw no Image in the Temple. The picture (that is
there) repreſents the whole world; and the two hands the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, of God himſelfe: foraſmuch as he is the motor and
originall cauſe of all cauſes. The bloud ſacrifices are abominable in
Gods ſight, neither ought he be otherwiſe worſhipped, than with
odoriferous and ſweet ſmelling offerings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (marveiling not a little hereat) with a ſmiling cheere,

they reſolv'd on a meanes to receive intelligence each from other
And in the evening <hi>Metaneone</hi> (being upon departure) would
have preſented <hi>Perſeno</hi> with an exceeding rich diamond, which
hee could never (either by forced courteſie or courteous force)
worke him to accept: whereby (being no leſſe ſatisfied with
the nobleneſſe of his minde, than with his other gentle quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
taking (in affectionate manner) his leave of him, hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
himſelfe to his Frigat that rode waiting for him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perſeno,</hi> now a glad man, that the buſineſſe had ſo ſucceeded
according as hee deſired it ſhould, went, and acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7477:37"/>
with the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> who aſtoniſhed at the boldneſſe of his reſolution,
could not chuſe but commend it, ſeeing it had ſo well ſucceeded.
And being to render the King an account of their voiage and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall,
they wrote ſo well in commendation of the <hi>Prince,</hi> touching the
purpoſe of his freeing and accompanying them, that more could not
be ſaid thereof, giving him withall an inkling of having diſcovered
in him, a more than ordinarie inclination to the fame and renownc
of the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Perſeno</hi> taking counſell touching the
fortifying of that place, and having noted how <hi>Eromilia</hi> lived not
without feare, deferring the building of the Houſe and Temple, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himſelfe to wall it round; and beginning at the foot of the rocke,
fortified the parts adjoyning to the aſcent, with ſmall paines and leſſe
charge, the rocke it ſelfe ſupplying him with ſtone and lime.</p>
               <p>A little before the peering out of the Sun, came <hi>Metaneone</hi> to his
Galley, where the <hi>Count</hi> with much joy received him: to whom he
related all that befell him, extolling <hi>Eromilia</hi> her ſingularities with
ſuch ſuperlatives, as the <hi>Count</hi> could not chuſe but tell him, ſmiling;
Sobrietie (My Lord) with theſe your commendations, no more I
beſeech you. Two things I want for becomming enamored, and
thoſe are, the being young, and therewithall a <hi>Prince.</hi> If your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
publiſh her to ſuch as want neither of theſe, in ſuch faſhion as
you doe to me, (no doubt) you will have rivals enow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> joying at the <hi>Counts</hi> words, could not ſatisfie himſelfe
in talking of her, reſolving in any caſe to demand her. Neither could
the <hi>Count</hi> therefore blame him, having beene long before informed
(by leſſe aſſionate witneſſes) of the merits of that <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to go on in that match, not ſomuch for the ſatisfaction of the
<hi>Prince,</hi> as for the intereſſes of the kingdome of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
then how they had in their voiage too much digreſſed, he (as
ſoone as the <hi>Prince</hi> went to ſleepe) cauſed to wigh up anchor and
ſteere on a ſtraight courſe for <hi>Sardegna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There blew from ſhore-ward a ſweet gale of wind, and the Veſſell
ſcoured away amaine, on each ſide courted with wanton Dolphins:
when after having two dayes ſailed with moſt proſperous weather,
they were aſſailed by a tempeſt, ſo terrible, as the Maſters-mate
(with all his counſell) could not reſolve of any courſe that could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
them, obſerving the winds ſo outragiouſly unſtable, as when
by the helpe of any one gale, they ranne a courſe towards any part,
they were ſuddenly rebutted and driven backe by another: ſo as,
not being able to obey any one particular, but forced to yeeld to the
violence of all indifferently, they were conſtrained to rome up and
downe, with an order ſo diſorderly, that dejected and ſuppreſſed
both in courage and force, they had given themſelves over for loſt,
had not the goodneſſe of the Veſſell and ghing ſomewhat conſolated
them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> no whit diſmaied, in that he was aſſured of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his Galley, commanded to give her ſea-roome enough, but
ſeeing no meanes of diſobeying the winds, they gave their violence
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7477:38"/>
way, according to their alterations: ſo as, although they had deſired
to come a-ſhore, yet was there not any meanes to doe it, becauſe the
progreſſe of tenne miles was ſeconded with a greater regreſſe. By
meanes whereof, not knowing where they were, they danced at the
ſound of the ruſtling waves, more than eight dayes in the Center
of the ſea, with the loſſe of many of their oares, ſhivered by the
repercuſſion of the ſurging billowes. On the ninth day the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
being ſomewhat appeaſed, they deſcried above them the Iland
of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and a Galley that ſet forth from <hi>Cabrera.</hi> Whereupon
deſirous to know whence they were, imagining her to be ſent from
the King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> to his daughter (by whoſe meanes he might
write ſomething to <hi>Perſeno</hi>) he commanded to make towards her; but
for all they could doe, it was impoſſible to overtake her, for ſhe ſo
poſted with the helpe of both oares and ſailes, that in the beginning
of the night, ſhe got quite out of their ſight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (ſuſpecting in his heart I know not what) ſeeing
that though the tempeſt was calmed, yet the wind was againſt
him, turning towards the <hi>Count,</hi> ſaid unto him, I cannot imagine
why this Galley ſhould ſhun me; I have a great deſire to follow her,
becauſe I cannot poſſibly ſteere onwards any further in my intended
courſe, which I ſhall neglect but for this onely night, during which
time alſo, the Galley-ſlaves may repoſe themſelves; ſeeing he wind
will drive us whither I would goe. The <hi>Earle,</hi> ſeeing him ſo deſirous,
would not contradict him.</p>
               <p>The ſaild all night with their prore towards <hi>Lebecchio</hi> (being the
way they ſaw the Galley hold) when at the breake of day the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
on the maine top-ſaile, told them he deſcried the Galley not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
five miles off. The <hi>Prince,</hi> who lay on a quilt with his cloathes
on, and his armes hard by him, preſently roſe up; and cauſing the
Galley-ſlaves to be meated, and the Knights armed, he purſued her
with ſailes and oares: yet ſhe (being one of the ſwifteſt Galleyes of
all that ſea) had not beene ſo eaſily overtaken, if ſhe had liſted to flie
away; but ſeeing her ſelfe traced after, ſhe holding on her courſe as
the wind carried her away, without putting hand to oare, ſeemed to
ſtay and expect to be boorded. By this time they drew ſo neere her,
that the Sunne (by then riſen) diſcovered her fully; ſo that the
<hi>Prince</hi> ſaw her with her rich lanthornes, in bigneſſe little leſſe than
his; well mann'd with ſouldiers, and numerous for galley-ſlaves;
imagining therefore that ſhe was no Pirat (as he had beleeved) he
bade the oares forbeare, and (with the adviſe of the <hi>Count</hi>) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Tolmido</hi> Captaine of his men, to take a Frigat, and goe ſee what
ſhe was; he (performing the command) quickly overtooke her, as
ſhe ſailed gently, without making any haſte. And demanding what
ſhe was? he was asked againe, who they were that would ſo faine
know? Whereto <hi>Tolmido</hi> anſwering that they were of <hi>Mauritania;</hi>
(juſt at that word) appeared a Knight of a low ſtature, and iron hue,
at whoſe comming all the reſt reverently retired themſelves; whilſt
he fixing his eyes on <hi>Tolmido,</hi> ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:7477:38"/>
Sir Knight, I know not what you are, neither am I curious to
know it; me thinkes you ſhould be as little inquiſitive of me. I can
not imagine wherefore you have ever ſithence yeſterday ſo dog'd
me to no purpoſe. I will not tell you what I am, though I be ſuch,
as can tell how to chaſtiſe your indiſcretion, if you keepe not on
your way. <hi>Tolmido</hi> (although by his garb and appearance, he gheſſed
him to be no ordinarie perſon, yet ſeeing him ſo ſtout) made anſwer.</p>
               <p>Let it not diſpleaſe you (Sir Knight) that I aske what you are, in
that you might be ſuch, that he, who ſent me to you, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
honour you, if you were thereof capable, or did deſerve it.
It is the ordinary faſhion of ſuch as goe by ſea, to haile one another,
and therefore you had no neede to be therewith offended: but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
that you are ſo diſdainefull and proud, as to dare (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the termes of civilitie) thus boldly to threaten us, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to returne with this your anſwer, and doe beleeve that you will
be faine to ſhew, whether you can prove your ſelfe to be ſo brave
and valiant in deeds, as you are raſh and arrogant in words.</p>
               <p>The Knight (not accuſtomed to ſuch anſwers) taking a bow in
hand, aimed at him an arrow, which if it had hit, where he levelled,
diſpatched had beene the life of <hi>Tolmido;</hi> but fortune ſo favoured
him, as it ſlipping by him, razing onely his skinne, and doing him
no other harme, pierced into the water. Whereupon, he retiring
himſelfe with his company (though ſhot at by the Galley) returned
ſafely to the <hi>Prince:</hi> who (ſeeing what violence was offered) advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
forwards, cauſing to be hung out the ſtandard of warre, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
afterwards by <hi>Tolmido</hi> what termes were uſed, he could
not imagine who that Knight might be, till at length he began to
ſuſpect it might be ſome Prince that went about to ſteale away <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi>
neither was he indeed therein any whit miſtaken. This ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made him become more fierce and eager, ſo as having got the
lee of her, he began to ſalute her with ſuch a ſhowre of arrowes, as
obſcured even the midday Sun: Yet found he not her aſleepe, nor her
men with their hands tied at their girdle, for as ſoone as <hi>Tolmido</hi>
was gon, ſhe turn'd backe, and (mainely rowing) came on, to charge
the <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The battle of Archers laſted not long, becauſe <hi>Metaneone</hi> (not
waying a ruſh the furie of the ſhot-men) haſtened to grapple with
the Galley; and (having under him the beſt Veſſell in the world,
and the wind a-poope) encountred her with ſuch a thump, as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
off her ſnout, tottered and bruiſed her all-over: then armed with
a halfe-pike (being backed by his Archers and ſeconded by his
Knights; himſelfe in perſon the firſt among the formoſt gotten up
on her prore) made ſuch a maſſacre of all ſuch as oppoſed him, that
in ſpite of them he boorded her, where followed by his owne
men, hee juſtling and laying about him with ſword in hand, won
her to her maſt, where encountered with a Squadron of chiefe
Knights, hee was forc'd to retire himſelfe ſome ſteps backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
But reſolved either to prevaile or die, he Tiger-like flung
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7477:39"/>
himſelfe on the little Knight, who was Lord of the reſt, and getting
within his pikes point cut it off cloſe at his hand, charging him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
with ſuch and ſo many blowes as conſtrained him to fall downe
at his feete on the hatches; whence <hi>Tolmido</hi> taking him by the heeles
drag'd him betweene two bancks, intending (if he had had time) to
caſt him over boord. Whilſt the <hi>Prince</hi> obſtinately purſuing the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
got againe as farre forwards as the maine Maſt, and thence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but with ſuch difficultie, as he was faine to win the Galley by
inches: for beſides the good ghing, there were aboord her betweene
Knights and ſouldiers, about two hundred, who behaved themſelves
very valiantly: of all which nevertheleſſe there remained but ſixtie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
&amp; thoſe for the moſt part wounded. The <hi>Prince</hi> loſt ſome twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his, beſide ſome of the ghing that were hurt with the arrowes,
and more had been kild and wounded, but that the battlements defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them. Then would the <hi>Prince</hi> forthwith know of the priſoners,
what they were? and who was their Lord? Whereto they made
anſwer, that they were <hi>Catalans,</hi> and that the Knight by him hurt, and
perhaps ſlaine, was <hi>Don Peplaſos Prince</hi> of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> who (enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and underſtanding that by her
good will ſhee would not conſent to any mariage at all,) went to
<hi>Afrique</hi> to ſteale her away, which he reſolved to effect; without
his owne fathers conſent, and therefore unknowne to him, ſet forth
privily from <hi>Barcellona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> (rejoycing for ſo good an encounter, and that fortune,
by ſuch unthought of meanes had ſo favoured his deſires) bleſſed
the tempeſt that drave him thither, joying in himſelfe, that it was
his good fortune (by the inſtigation of an unknowne deſire to cut off
and fruſtrate the deſignes of the <hi>Prince,</hi> which had they beene effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
had made him the unhappieſt man in the world.</p>
               <p>In the meane time lay <hi>Peplaſos</hi> more than halfe dead betweene two
of the ghing-bancks, when <hi>Metaneone</hi> (cauſing him to be tane up,
and his wounds ſearch't and dreſt) ſent the <hi>Count</hi> to viſit him, and
to tell him that he was ſorrie for his hurt, but much more, becauſe
he himſelfe was the occaſioner thereof; for had they but knowen
one another, then that inconvenience had not hapned: whereas his
concealing of himſelfe might have occaſioned a greater diſaſter. But
he, (more vexed at heart for the fruſtrating his deſignes than for his
wounds) having underſtood who his enemie was, diſſembling his
anger, anſwered, That he was not agrieved at his hurts got by the
hands of ſo valorous a <hi>Prince,</hi> but rather thought him well imploied,
in that they gave him occaſion of being acquainted with him: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
therefore that there was not between them any cauſe of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he deſired to be permitted to hold on his way, ſeeing that if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
was occaſioned by his ignorance, he well felt the ſmart
thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> having related this ſuit unto the <hi>Prince</hi> (who then
was upon going himſelfe to viſite him) gave him thereby cauſe to
alter his minde, ſo as he went not, but ſent againe the <hi>Count,</hi> with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7477:39"/>
order to tell him; That he was ſorry he could not ſerve him in that
perticular; underſtanding how he was bound for <hi>Afrique</hi> to ſteale
away the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> an offence that extended it ſelfe to the
King of <hi>Catalogna</hi> his father, the King of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and to all other
Princes; but more particularly to all Knights, expreſly obliged to
defend that ſex. And that therefore he might doe well to ſee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the cure of his wounds, aſſuring himſelfe he ſhould not be
detained priſoner, being there was a good and reciprocall amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt
both their fathers: but that the reaſon why he could not let
him part ſuddenly was, becauſe he could not be acceſſary to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which otherwiſe hee muſt needs have beene, if knowing
his intention, and being able to prevent it, he did it not: Nay,
that he further knew himſelfe tied as he was a <hi>Prince</hi> to remedy it,
and as he was a Knight to chaſtiſe him, if he offered to put his plot
in execution; but that he hoped that the qualities of his birth and
dignity, (with the obligations accompanying them) had already
therefrom ſufficiently diſſwaded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> ſtood a good while after he had heard this embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
without ſpeaking any thing, till at length he burſt forth into
ſuch ſpeeches; The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi> favours me exceedingly in
redoubling the paines of a perſon of your merit, thereby re-obliging
me with the favour of his viſits: But as concerning my voyage,
which (as you tell me from him) was to ſteale away the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of
<hi>Maiorica,</hi> I pray you aſſure him that whoſoever told him ſo, lied
moſt falſely, in that he informed him of an untruth in a matter ſo far
from my thoughts, as that <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (whom I never yet ſaw) is from
my knowledge and acquaintance. And if my voyage hath given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to any ill-minded fellowes to thinke ſo of me, yet cannot any
ſuch conjecture accuſe me, neither am I ſuch as ought to yeeld any
man an account where, or which way I goe, there being in thoſe
parts whither I am bound for, ſo many countries and ſuch diverſitie
of occaſions wherein a Knight may honourably imploy himſelfe:
As I hold my ſelfe greatly injured of ſuch as judge of me rather the
worſt than the beſt; for the reſt, I know the <hi>Prince</hi> for a valiant
Knight, and have tri'd him, but yet armes (as well as other things)
have their both fortunate and fatall dayes, ſo as if I ſhould happen to
affront him; this my preſent misfortune ſhould no whit diſencou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me; Albeit for the occaſion he pretends, there ſhall neither be
cauſe for him to chaſtiſe me (as he ſaith,) nor for me to defend my
ſelfe, as I would doe for any one, that would offer to injure me. If
he pleaſe to leave me to my liberty, there being not betweene us any
cauſe of hoſtility, he will then performe what he owes to the amitie
of our parents. If otherwiſe, and that he will rather credit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
conjectures of ſome villaine, than the royall words of a
<hi>Prince,</hi> I ſhall then have juſt cauſe to thinke my ſelfe hardly uſed
by him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> could doe no leſſe than reporte all theſe ſpeeches
punctually to the <hi>Prince,</hi> who (not as much as moved thereat) ſent
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7477:40"/>
for the <hi>Catalans,</hi> of whom hee would know againe, whither <hi>Don
Peplaſos</hi> intended to goe; thoſe that had already vnadviſedly ſpoken
the truth, could not revoke what they had ſaid; the reſt (who were
ſo fortunate as not to be examined) ſaid, they knew not their Lords
intrinſecall intentions. Howbeit the rumor thereof was ſo publiſhed,
as the more cautelous ſort, knew better how to conceale, than denie
it. Whereupon <hi>Metaneone</hi> (unwilling by conteſtation to multiply
the ruine of theſe men) reſolved (with the advice of the <hi>Count</hi>) not
to ſet him at liberty, untill ſuch time as <hi>Eromilia</hi> were thereof advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and had taken a courſe for the ſecuring of her perſon. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſcourſed of the manner of effecting it, they (conſidering of
their being but ſixtie miles wide from <hi>Maiorica</hi>) concluded to paſſe
that way, and thereof to advertize the King her father, and ſo with
the merit of two ſo great ſervices to give him then an inckling of the
deſire he had to be his Sonne in-law; not that he then meant to treate
of the marriage, but onely to prevent the ſuit of all ſuch others, as
might come thither to demand her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (glad of this counſell) fell off with a contrary wind to
<hi>Fermentera,</hi> where he found a Frigat, that there rode ſequeſtred by
the winds; The Knight that came in her, preſently knowing the
Galley Royall, ran with much joy to kiſſe the <hi>Prince</hi> his hands, who
ſuddenly knew him for one of <hi>Eromilia's</hi> Knights; of whom when he
underſtood of his being ſent from her, with letters to the King her
father, he told him what had hapned betweene him and the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Catalogna,</hi> and how that hee continued not in his voyage, becauſe it
was neceſſarie for him to goe to <hi>Maiorica</hi> there to leave him in the
Kings cuſtodie, till ſuch time as the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> had made ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the ſecuritie of her perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fidele</hi> (for ſuch was this Knights name) was much aſtoniſhed at
this newes, and beſought the <hi>Prince</hi> to grant him ſome odds of time,
to get him gon before him, as ſoone as the wind ſhould turne to be
a little calmer, that the King by reading the letters of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi>
might come to know the other obligation he ow'd him. To which
requeſt the <hi>Prince</hi> was at firſt loth to conſent, ſuppoſing it was but to
give the King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> time to receive him with greater pompe
and honour; till afterwards conſidering the advantage he might
come to receive by meanes of the letters of <hi>Perſeno,</hi> and the <hi>Counteſſe
Palomera,</hi> he was contented to favour his requeſt: and ſuch was the
lucke that the winde in that inſtant (as it were) quite aſſwaged occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
a great calme. Wherof <hi>Fidele</hi> regardleſſe (having a good Frigat
well provided of oares, and preſſing forwards amaine ſpeed) arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Maiorica</hi> a day ſooner than the <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King (who was even dead of longing to heare newes from
his daughter) ſeeing this Knight preſent himſelfe before him, was
exceeding glad thereof, and underſtanding what had hapned them
in their journey as they went, and unto the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi> as he
came) remained thereat ſtrangely amazed, afterwards opening his
daughters letter, he found it thus ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:7477:40"/>
My Lord, if I had beene capable of content, I might ſay I had
received it from your Majeſties letters, delivered me by the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>
of <hi>Palomero,</hi> being the greateſt joy that an obliged and obedient
daughter might poſſibly receive; yet doth not this incapacitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
me of that comfort, which nature in all children, and your
particular love towards me might ſuggeſt or put me in mind of:
Inſomuch therefore as you ſtrive to ſurpaſſe all fathers in loving
your daughter, moſt ungratefull were I, if I endevoured not to
exceed all other daughters, in loving ſo worthy and deſerving a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But now me thinkes I heare you ſay, that the laſt effects ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
the contrary: yet (My Lord) I beſeech you (in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
to give credit even to the incredible, for my affection, which
was the ſource of <hi>paradoxes,</hi> was ſo repugnant to all humane diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as it is no wonder, if with it ſubſiſt contrarieties. Behold then,
how I pretend not to excuſe my fault, but doe beſeech you to impute
it to paſſion: by whoſe meanes (like a raving ſicke woman come to
the worſt point) I wanted force to exerciſe thoſe faculties which
the wiſe make uſe of; ſo as my offence deſerves rather compaſſion
than reproofe, in that it brings with it its owne puniſhment. And
now that I have acknowledged my duty towards you, together with
the fault of my abſence; give me leave (I pray you) to defend my
ſelfe with the worthy occaſion of my errors. Repreſent, Oh repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
before you (My Lord) a <hi>Perosfilo,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> of ſuch exceeding
rare qualities, to whom was dedicated by you, my perſon, and by
me, my ſoule; and then repreſent him before you dead. Alas, how
could I poſſibly in ſo great diſorder, obſerve any order? I, that more
than any other loved him, whom all loved, (and which is more)
with a true and legitimate love: If then he were aſſigned me by you,
to be the companion of my life, why will you not permit me to be
the companion of his death? And where ſhall I ever finde out his
like? Indeede had I aim'd at no other end than ſolitarineſſe, I could
have retired my ſelfe into ſolitarie places, there at home: But what
kinde of a ſolitarie life had that beene, where every one would have
baited and oppoſed me? Beſides, how had I beene able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
authoritie? but much more your ſweete perſwaſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you are able to divert the moſt conſtant reſolutions? Now
whereas you afterwards accuſe me of ſmall love; certainely (My
Lord) if you thinke you have occaſion to ſay ſo, I hope you have
no reaſion to beleeve ſo; for it is right all one, as if you accuſed me
for a dead woman, and reſpectleſſe of your griefe, and of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
love, together with the debt I owe your ſubjects, and doe
you beleeve that it would grieve me leſſe to abandon theſe reſpects,
than it would doe to loſe my life? No ſurely, but the violence
and wrong done me by ſuch a conjecture, is at leaſt as great (if not
greater) than death it ſelfe; ſeeing it is true that love and death are
both of equall power.</p>
               <p>I anſwer not to all the reſidue of your grave and prudent
reaſons, which although they convict mee not, becauſe they are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7477:41"/>
grounded upon common ſuppoſitions, which in my caſe (void of
all rule) give no rule at all; nevertheleſſe the reverence I owe you
obligeth mee to receive them, as if they had already convinced
mee. My loving family I will love, and among them the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe</hi>
above all: little thought they once to ſee mee in the eſtate
of a Miſtreſſe, but of a ſlave for companie with them. It pleaſed
God that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi> freed, and conducted them
here in ſafetie, as ſhall bee told you more at large by <hi>Fidele,</hi>
the bearer hereof, whereto I referre my ſelfe; beſeeching you
that (in reſpect I could not thanke that <hi>Prince</hi> by word of mouth)
you would be pleaſed to ſupply my defect, by ſending to the King
of <hi>Mauritania</hi> his father, and to him ſuch perſonages, as are capable
of executing ſuch an embaſſage. Touching the particular of my
perſon, I know the danger wherein I am, and will fortifie my ſelfe
in ſuch a manner, as I may be able (the place being ſtrong of its
owne ſituation) onely with my owne family to defend my ſelfe,
and live ſecure from all the world, ſo I bee but furniſhed with
victuals. And in the meane time God will provide for all, whom I
pray to grant your Majeſtie the height of felicity, and to me that
comfort, which being abſent from your Majeſtie I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
<hi>Eromilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this letter the King became ſomewhat conſolated, in
that hee thought he had wrought ſomething on his daughters me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:
Albeit ſhe therein made no mention of returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
nevertheleſſe he could not chuſe but be well ſatisfied with
the accidents that had hapned, hoping they would prove a meanes
to induce her to alter her intention. But when afterwards he had
ſeene the letters of the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> and <hi>Perſeno:</hi> he thought than that
the Gods had ſent them that <hi>Prince</hi> to free them from affliction.
Therefore (having given order to receive him with all honour,
and that notice ſhould be given him, when he were deſcried in the
ſight of the Iland) he went the day following himſelfe in perſon
to meete him on the ſea-coaſt. The honors wherewith be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him were ſuch, as might be expected, from an inferior, and
the love ſuch, as could bee hoped for from a loving father. The
Queene (who both by the relation of <hi>Fidele,</hi> and alſo by her owne
letters comprehended the <hi>Prince</hi> his merits) received him with ſuch
tenderneſſe of affection, as a mother is wont to welcome her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Sonne.</p>
               <p>After reciprocall complements, the <hi>Prince</hi> retiring himſelfe aſide
with the King, told him, that the cauſe of his comming thither was
an accident, that chanc'd him with the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> whoſe
ſervants had plainely confeſſed that they went with an intent to
ſteale away the <hi>Princeſſe Eromilia,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Prince</hi> had
no hope of obtaining her by any other meanes. That it
ſeemed not good unto him to take him along with him, leſt he
might thinke himſelfe detained priſoner; much-leſſe would he
by any meanes ſet him at liberty, leſt he ſhould then effect his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7477:41"/>
deſigne: And that being now wounded, his Majeſtie (under the
colour of hoſpitality) might detaine him, and in the meane
time advertize thereof the King of <hi>Catalogna</hi> his father, and
ſend the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> proviſion to aſſure her from ſuch like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>The King not knowing how to finde out words correſpondent to
the qualitie of his beholdingneſſe, omitted no meanes of letting
him ſee, how dearely hee eſteemed ſuch notable and ſo worthy
ſervices.</p>
               <p>And concerning <hi>Don Peplaſos,</hi> told him, that a better courſe could
not be thought of, whom he would detaine, and have a provident eye
to the curing of, his wounds, till ſuch time as he had effected all that
the <hi>Prince</hi> had counſelled him. And ſo paſſing from buſineſſe to
complements, and from complements againe to affectionate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
the <hi>Prince,</hi> who according to the cuſtome of lovers, had not
all this while the boldneſſe to open his mouth in his owne deſire,
(whereat the King marvelled, beleeving that the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> and <hi>Perſeno,</hi>
who had thereof written unto him ſo confidently, were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceived) yet now (having lighted on ſo fit an opportunity) ſaid
unto him,</p>
               <p>Your Majeſtie is together with the title and dignity of a King, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
by the heavens with inclinations ſo Royall as they embolden
me to ſupplicate your Majeſtie for one favour, ſince that you have
beene ſo courteouſly pleaſed, as to command me to aske you any
thing. The King all joyfull (taking him by the hand) made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that he could not doe him a greater favour, than to demand
whatſoever hee deſired, aſſuring him he would not denie him any
thing comprehended within the limits of his power. The <hi>Prince</hi>
then kneeling on one knee, (whence he would not be raiſed up,
doe what the King could, untill hee had firſt expreſſed his
deſire) ſaid unto him; The boone I then begge of your Majeſtie
is, that your Majeſtie would vouchſafe to be pleaſed to accept me
for a ſonne, by giving mee (for wiſe) my Lady the <hi>Princeſſe
Eromilia.</hi> Whereunto the King raiſing him on his feete an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</p>
               <p>Worthy <hi>Prince,</hi> your Highneſſe obligeth me more in diſobliging
me, than I can ever deſerve, much leſſe requite. My daughter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee beſtowed on either a greater or worthier <hi>Prince</hi> than
your ſelfe; and the demanding her, as a boone, in ſo gentle
a manner as you have done, had beene a ſufficient motive to have
induced me to give her you, if nothing elſe had tied mee thereto.
Therefore I tell you, that without asking either counſell or advice
of any one, (bee it the Queene or Councell) as is uſually done
betweene <hi>Princes</hi> of our condition; I will, that ſhee bee yours
for as much as concernes me. Whereat the <hi>Prince</hi> would have
kneeled downe againe to kiſſe his hands, but the King (ſtaying him
up) ſpake on, I told you, for as much as lies in my power, becauſe
for what is in the power of others, I muſt requeſt two things of you,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7477:42"/>
the one is, that there may bee obtained thereto the conſent of the
King your father; and the other is, that therewithall be procured
the good will of my daughter, for well you know in what kinde of
reſolution ſhe lives in, as yet; howbeit I truſt (God willing) by the
meanes of your merits (ſeeing the authoritie of a father could not
hitherto prevaile any thing with her, which I have not as yet made
uſe of, but have reſerved it for a fitter ſeaſon) we ſhall in a ſmall
time obtaine our deſire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> humbling himſelfe againe replied, Sir, I would not
have preſumed to demand her on any other conditions than thoſe
you propoſe, and doe aſſure your Majeſtie that if I had not feared to
have beene prevented by others, I had not thus have asked her of
you, ere I had firſt wrought the King my father to demand her for
me himſelfe by his Ambaſſadors, which ſhall be done in its time fit,
and when it ſhall pleaſe your Majeſtie to command it. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Lady the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> I will comfort my ſelfe with this, that if
ſhe marry at all, then is ſhe (by your Royall liberality) to be mine.
Having afterwards acquainted the King with the occaſion of his
voyage, how hee was bound for <hi>Sardegna</hi> to fetch home his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they accorded, that the one with his daughter, and the other
with his father ſhould labour for the accompliſhment of both their
deſires, which was to be concealed till ſuch time as the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
could be perſwaded to alter her reſolution. Then came they forth
amongſt their attendants very pleaſant and merry, which cauſed all
to rejoyce, being the firſt time that a joyfull looke was ſeene in that
Court, ſithence the departure of the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Catalogna</hi> was in the meane time removed out of
the Galley, and carried to the citie in a horſe-litter; which though
performed with much honour, ſeemed nevertheleſſe ſtrange unto
him, beleeving he ſhould be there detained priſoner. And being now
viſited by them, after that the King had entertained him with ſome
courteous ſpeeches, <hi>Metaneone</hi> thus ſaid unto him,</p>
               <p>My Lord, I grieve more for your hurts than I have cauſe to excuſe
my ſelfe for having given them you; for if you had (when you
knew that my Galley was of <hi>Mauritania</hi>) either uſed me friendly,
and not threatened me, or but as much as in ſome ſort pronounced
(not the name of your perſon) but the place whence your Veſſell
was, then had I not felt the ſorrow and diſpleaſure I now feele, nor
you ſuffered the prejudice and loſſe you have and now doe; for
which if it might be remedied, I would endeavour to give you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
not for that any offence of mine thereto binds me, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
indeed ſuch is the inclination of my nature. The reaſons that
perſwaded me to bring you hither, were your wounds and the ill
plight of your Galley, wherein (wanting ſo many of your folke)
you could not have defended your ſelfe from any one that had liſted
to injure you. Howbeit if the importancie of my buſineſſe could
have permitted me, I my ſelfe would not have feared to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
you home to the King your father, whom I beleeve to be a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7477:42"/>
                  <hi>Prince</hi> ſo juſt, that underſtanding how things paſſed, he would have
had no occaſion to have wiſh'd me any harme; the like hope I of
you alſo: There being then no place neerer your kingdome than
this, nor any King more courteous and friendly to both our fathers,
than its Soveraigne here preſent, I thought good to recommend you
to his Majeſtie, to whom I have related the diſaſter of our encounter,
which grieves him ſo, as he deſires that you ſtirre not hence in any
caſe, till you be fully cured. Whereupon the King (interrupting him)
ſaid, My Lord, <hi>Prince Peplaſos,</hi> I neede not adde any thing to what my
Lord, <hi>Prince Metaneone,</hi> hath ſpoken, neither will indeed your hurts
admit tediouſneſſe: we are (you know) friends and neighbours; lay
aſide then all melancholy, albeit you are in a houſe where dwelt no
mirth theſe many dayes; have but the patience to ſtay till you be
cur'd, and you ſhall then goe whither ſoever it pleaſe you. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
I know you came from <hi>Catalogna</hi> unknowne to your father, yet
pretend I not to correct you therefore, much leſſe to judge betweene
you both; onely I pray you give me leave to acquaint your Royall
father of your being here, and the meſſenger I will ſend, ſhall not
part till you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> (not hearing himſelfe accuſed of his fault) with a
merry countenance, anſwered; That he would willingly write to
his father, thanking therewithall very kindly, the one, and the other,
with words, in ſhew the moſt courteous that could be, reſerving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
inwardly an implacable hatred, rather to the vertue than
perſon of <hi>Metaneone,</hi> who, having taken leave of him, was by the
King entertained with all ſuch honours and paſtimes as the time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him.</p>
               <p>The Queene acquainted by her husband of all paſſages, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
glad thereof, and by his directions, preſented the <hi>Prince</hi>
(at his going away) with a flat box all chaſed over with diamonds,
wherein was incloſed <hi>Eromilia's</hi> picture; which the <hi>Prince</hi> well
knowing, would therefore by all meanes needs kiſſe her hands.
And thence (having embarked himſelfe) with a proſperous gale of
winde paſſed over to <hi>Sardegna.</hi>

not the honour of Knighthood.</p>
               <p>There waited then on his Majeſtie the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Boſſa,</hi> with
ſome other of his Councell, all the reſt accompanying the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:7477:44"/>
which <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> deſirous to underſtand the ſtate of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſithence his departure thence; that other of <hi>Boſſa</hi> (at this his
requeſt) in the preſence of <hi>Polimero,</hi> thus ſaid,</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Prince's</hi> misfortune (whereof I beleeve this noble
Knight hath already beene fully informed) the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out into the field, was advertized how that King <hi>Epicamedo</hi>
was with a ſtrong army paſſed over to <hi>Cape Luogodori,</hi> and that
the <hi>Prince</hi> his murtherers, being united and ſiding with him, had (for
his aſſiſtance) procured all that Countrey to revolt. Whereupon
(imagining that her ſpeedy comming thither might hinder that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to ſpread abroad among the neighbours) ſhe made forwards
to thoſe parts, &amp; found that <hi>Valentino</hi> (a ſmall Caſtle forſaken by the
men thereof, for feare of not being of number ſufficient to keepe it)
was valiantly defended by the women that therein remained, againſt
all the enemies united forces. Whereby ſhe (very joyfull) divined,
and ſeemed to fore-ſee, that ſhe (a woman alſo) was fore-deſtined to
defend that ſtate; with which hope inſpired, ſhe encreaſed her army
with all ſuch as ſhe met by the way, ſhe aſſailed the enemy in the
night-time unawares, making of them ſuch havocke, as <hi>Epicamedo</hi>
was conſtraind by retiring his forces to raiſe the ſiege from <hi>Valentino.</hi>
Which Countrey for being extraordinarie hilly, afforded him the
commodiouſnes of retiring himſelfe without any hazard, till (after
he had gotten out of the mountaines) he was ſet upon afreſh by the
<hi>Princeſſe,</hi> hard by <hi>Villapetres,</hi> who did that day ſo renowned exploits,
that thoſe of <hi>Camilla,</hi> and of a number of other famous women,
were nothing in compariſon of hers. For ſhe had three Courſers
kild under her, and perſonally affronted <hi>Epicamedo</hi> in two ſeverall
encounters; at the firſt whereof ſhe unhorſt him; but reſolving at
the ſecond, either to kill, or take him priſoner, hardly eſcaped the
being kild her ſelfe; for being invironed with the Kings guard, her
horſe being ſlaine, ſhe was like to have beene alſo her ſelfe by them
either ſlaine or taken priſoner, had ſhe not valiantly defended her
ſelfe with the death of more than fifteene of them. Neither perhaps
had all this freed her, hand not a ſquadron of women of <hi>Valentino,</hi>
(who followed her as Voluntaries) reſcuing her from the danger ſhe
was in, remounted her on horſebacke, maugre all thoſe that fought
againſt her; by whoſe example euery man behaved himſelfe ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
that the enemie (with his rancks altogether diſordered) was
faine ſhamefully to retire himſelfe under <hi>Villapetres. Epicamedo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
by the hand of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> wounded with two deepe cuts,
whereof he was not as yet cured.</p>
               <p>Having thus raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Valentino,</hi> chaſed away the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and withall beaten them in open field, ſhe forced them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into the very <hi>Villapetres,</hi> and keepe themſelves cloſe therein, as
if they had beene beſieged.</p>
               <p>In which meane time, those of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her councell of warre
were diverſly opinionated of what was beſt to be done; wherof ſome
would have her purſue the enemie untill he were quite vaquiſhed;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7477:44"/>
others thought beſt, that (having blockt up <hi>Epicamedo</hi> from going
on any further by the oppoſition of the valorous <hi>Valintinean</hi> women
together with one part of the army) they ſhould with the other part
over-run the countrey on the left hand towards <hi>Saſſari,</hi> where they
underſtood the Admirall reſided, who (ere he could be advertized of
her comming and of the diſcomfiture of <hi>Epicamedo</hi>) might (together
with the city) runne the hazard of being taken priſoner; to this laſt
advice the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſomewhat inclined, but was diſſwaded by the
neareneſſe of the enemies Galleyes, doubting leſt they landing
their men, might breake thoſe troopes ſhe left behind her; or elſe
dividing their froces purſue them, and environ them in, betwixt the
King and the Admirall. Whilſt ſhe ſtood thus doubtfull what courſe
to reſolve of, there arrived before her a Knight (to her full well
knowne) who kneeling downe ſaid,</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent Lady, I come from the Fleete which as yet rides
in the Port of <hi>Torre,</hi> where the horrible treaſon againſt the life of the
<hi>Prince</hi> was publiſhed by the Traitors-ſelves, by whom the chiefe
of that countrey (being cald for before them to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> and earneſtly
wrought upon to joyne in the Rebellion) ſeeing themſelves in their
power, could doe no leſſe than promiſe them their ſervice. But now
being retired to the Fleete, and riſen up in armes, have taken the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montevero</hi> priſoner, who was then aboord the Royall, in
the Admirals place, and becauſe there is already a Galley ſent to give
his Majeſtie intelligence thereof along by the Weſt coaſt; I was alſo
diſpatched away in a Frigat, with commandement to coaſt hither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the Eaſterne ſhore. But being by the tempeſt weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
into <hi>Tolata,</hi> I underſtood that your Highneſſe was gon out with
the army; and therefore imagining that the <hi>Galley</hi> might by this
time have performed that ſervice without me: I came poaſt hither,
to acquaint your Highneſſe herewithall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> hereupon (as ſoone as ſhe read the letter, ſent her by
the Commanders of the fleete) determined to put their laſt conſulted
enterpriſe in execution, who (leaving in her campe five hundred
horſe, and five thouſand foote,) about the firſt watch in the night,
ſet her ſelfe with the reſt of her forces on the way to <hi>Saſſari.</hi> And
this is the ſumme of all, that hath beene hitherto done. But we expect
with great deſire further newes, having already received a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what I have now told you, by the Galley that arrived here
the other eventing, who hath ſpent many dayes in comming hither,
by reaſon of thoſe paſt tempeſts, and was alſo chaſed by certaine
Galleyes of <hi>Corſica,</hi> that lay at <hi>Aſinara,</hi> who had already underſtood
of the revolt of the fleete, who never loſt ſight of her, in all the
ſtorme, being winde-driven, or rather, weather-beaten into the ſame
place not far diſtant one from another; but as ſoon as the wind grew
calme, the Galley (being well rigg'd and mann'd) with the favour of
the night got quit out of their ſight, and arrived here in ſafetie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia</hi> lovingly thanked him for this relation,
and then taking <hi>Polimero</hi> aſide, asked him, if his intent was to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7477:45"/>
part ſuddenly for the Campe, which having underſtood ſo to be, he
replied, Mine (indeed) was once the ſame; but the conſervation
of our fleete gives me occaſion to put in the place of Admirall,
wherein (if once I but deſire it) I cannot have any competitor.
Therefore if you pleaſe, either to diſpence with the obligation I
have to ſerve you onely in this particular voyage; or elſe, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
your ſelfe here, till ſuch time as I have diſpatched this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which ſhall ſoone be (I being aſſured to be ſent backe to the
<hi>Princeſſe</hi>) I ſhall receive it as a ſpeciall favour. The <hi>Infante</hi> (affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
embracing him) anſwered, that his company would be
at all times moſt acceptable unto him. Howbeit that, for ſo weighty
an affaire, he went to deprive himſelfe thereof, praying him not to
neglect his buſineſſe, which he would be exceeding glad to heare
he had effected, there being not any neceſſitie of neglecting his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
for ſo ſhort a journey. Having then taken inſtructions for the
way, and licenſed himſelfe from the King, he ſet him forwards on
his journey to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> riding with as much content as could be, to
ſee himſelfe free from domeſticke broiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caraſio,</hi> ſeeing his Lord addreſſed to a warre of every one ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
was very glad thereof; nor joyed it leſſe <hi>Polimero's</hi> youth
to ſurvey a Countrey ſo differing from his, where in ſtead of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſands, and barren downes, he feaſted his eyes with the various
aſpect of moſt fertile hils, nature ſhewing her ſelfe ſo liberall, that
being in other places ſparing, ſhe ſeemed here to be prodigall, which
gave him occaſion of diſcorſing with himſelfe, that the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Poggio,</hi> and others of his fathers ſeates, (compared with
thoſe he now ſaw) were but meere apparances, and beſides but arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
workes, requiring much toyle and paines in conſerving them,
whereas there were here to be ſeene the more than ordinary excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
workes of nature, which cloathed with ſundry deviſes, ſhamed
all artificiall colours, affording ſuch content to the ſenſes, as they
were capable to receive by the fruition of thoſe objects proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to their proportioned incliantions. And if this varietie ſeemed
unto him ſo ſtrange in a countrey ſo litle diſtant from his in latitude,
what would he have thought of others far more fortunate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome?
<hi>Sardegna</hi> being not of it ſelfe one of the beſt Provinces,
though as then well enough inhabited, and ſufficiently rich to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
its inhabitants, and withall to contribute corne to many other
countries, which grew ſuperabundantly in the Province of <hi>Luogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three dayes travelled <hi>Polimero</hi> without encountring any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
on the fourth he ſaw comming riding towards him from afar
off, a Knight on a horſe, droppin wet with ſweate, and quite tired,
which for all that could doe by ſpurring him, he could not make goe
on one ſteppe further. Whereupon, knowing <hi>Polimero</hi> for a ſtrange
Knight (lifting vp his beaver) he ſaid unto him,</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, I beſeech you favour me with your horſe, for mine
being tired can paſſe no further, yet muſt I make haſte for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7477:45"/>
the Kings ſervice to whom I am ſent from the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> hearing ſuch an unreaſonable demand proceede from a
perſonage, of whom, by his rich armour, and by what his aſpect
promiſed, ſuch a requeſt was not to bee expected, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, if I knew, that you could not performe your duty
with any other horſe than mine, I would gladly give him you, to doe
the King or <hi>Princeſſe</hi> any ſervice, whom I alſo deſire to ſerve as well
as you; but knowing that you might have furniſt your ſelfe in place,
through which you have paſſed; or if you could finde none there,
that you may ſpeede your ſelfe howſoever at <hi>Cornetto,</hi> I hope you
will hold me excuſed, by ſo much the rather for that I going my
ſelfe to ſerve the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> ſhould doe her but ſimple ſervice, if I were
deprived of my horſe. But as the gods ſhall protect you, what
good newes bring you with you? What hath ſhe done at <hi>Saſſari?</hi> Is
that Traytor the Admirall perhaps taken? The Knight (altering
his colour at theſe laſt words) anſwered him; The taking of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
is not a thing ſo eaſie as you beleeve: caſting with that word
his eyes about, to ſee if any body was comming, and ſeeing none in
ſight, he ſpake on: The Admirall was never Traytor, but a Knight
that can revenge injuries, as now he is ready to revenge this which
thou doſt him, and to take away as a good prize (together with thy
life) that horſe, thou wouldeſt not give him by courteous meanes;
which ſaid, he lightly vaulting off his ſaddle, drew out his ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> taking him (by theſe words) for the Admirall, was the
joy fulleſt man in the world, and giving <hi>Caraſio</hi> his horſe, drew out
his ſword, and ſaid, Yea marry, this is the onely way to get the
horſe; if thou being the Admirall (as thy words deſcrie thee) haſt
the courage to kill me Knight-like, as thou ſlew'ſt the <hi>Prince,</hi> Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-like.
Well, then, come doe thy worſt, for I will doe my beſt,
to revenge in his injurie, the wrong done to all <hi>Princes.</hi> The other
replied not with words, but with a great blow which he made at his
head, ere he was in his guard, or had time to bring thither his ſhield,
which had put him in an ill plight, had it not happened to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart,
ſo as it lighting on the creſt of his helme did him no other
hurt, than the cutting off of a ſmall piece thereof. To require
which courtefie, <hi>Polimero,</hi> having put him to ward a fain'd blow,
ſtroake wiht a true one at his helme, with ſuch force, as hitting him
in a place unarmed, it there made an ample wound. The Knight
(who deſired nothing more than a quick diſpatch of the combat, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe thus diſadvantaged in the very firſt blow) reſolved with
himſelfe to adventure at all. For the effecting whereof, having ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out his opportunitie of cloſing, got in to imbrace him, throwing
away his ſword, that he might the better uſe his dagger; then hee
ſtuggling to throw him downe, tried his armour every where by
potching it, to ſee if he could find any place unarmed. But <hi>Polimero,</hi>
being freſher and ſtronger than the other, (lifting him up by the
hams) threw him flat on his backe, and ſeazing on his dagger (whilſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7477:46"/>
he lay amazed with the fall) held its point before his helmets ſight,
bidding him yeeld; which becauſe he would not doe, but ſtruggled
to get up, <hi>Polimero</hi> ſtabd him in a place unarmed under the ſhort rib,
laying him thereby to meaſure againe his length on the ground; and
taking him for dead (becauſe he ſaw him ſtirre no more) he unlaced
his helmet, to aſſure himſelfe thereof, when ſeeing him yet alive
(though not in plight to defend himſelfe) he ſaid unto him,</p>
               <p>Tell me (Sir Knight) in plaine termes, who you are? Becauſe, if
you be the Admiral, and had as well avenged the death of the <hi>Prince,</hi>
as you have done mine, you had not beene in the plight you now are
in, which had beene much better for you; for the longer the gods
delay puniſhment, the heavier inflict they them, as now they doe to
you, by not ſuffering you to die by my hands. Which as hee
was ſpeaking, hee ſaw comming towards him a great crew of
Countrey Peſants, armed with pikes and javelings, who ſeeing the
wounded Knight on the ground without any helmet, ſtraightwayes
knew him; and not knowing <hi>Polimero</hi> otherwiſe than for a ſtranger.
Alas, My Lord, (ſaid they) what meane you to doe with this
wretch, which you keepe under you little better than dead? How
much better befits it him to die by other meanes, ſeeing your
hands are too worthy for him, and he farre unworthy to die by
them. For he is (if you know him not) the <hi>Prince</hi> his murtherer,
the Author of the Rebellion, the occaſioner of the warre, and
wee pray God he prove not conſequently the cauſe of our utter
ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> glad of ſuch an encounter, ſaid unto them, My friends,
if you will promiſe me to bring him priſoner to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> I will
leave him in your hands. How? (anſwered they) If you pleaſe to
deliver him us, we will moſt willingly obey you, not onely for
our promiſe ſake, but alſo becauſe it is an imploiment we much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
for (we pray you) be pleaſed to know, that this is the Admirall,
the common enemy, both of the Kingdome and of all good men;
howbeit for your better aſſurance, if you liſt to returne backe but
two miles, we will deliver him up (in your preſence) to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of <hi>Cornetto.</hi> That will I not doe (anſwered <hi>Polimero</hi>) you
ſeeme to me to be ſuch, as I neede not doubt of your honeſty, ſee
therefore, I leave him in your hands, take him, for I give him you:
which ſaid, hee mounted on horſebacke, leaving him as yet in a
ſwoond on the ground. But they having laid him athwart his horſe,
without bearing him any kind of reſpect, lead him to <hi>Cornetto,</hi> and
delivered him up to the Magiſtrates charge, who cauſed his wounds
(whether hee would or no) to be ſearch'd and carefully look'd
unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> (joyfull for what had hapned, and continuing his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney)
underſtood by the way how that the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſurprizing <hi>Saſſari</hi>
at unawares, had taken priſoner the Baron of <hi>Friſano,</hi> but that the
Admirall eſcaped away; and that her Highneſſe was withall ſpeede
returned under <hi>Villapetres,</hi> ere the King of <hi>Corſica</hi> could be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7477:46"/>
of her abſence thence. This newes made him (leaving <hi>Saſſari</hi> on
the left hand) hold right on to <hi>Villapetres,</hi> whence come to <hi>Valentino,</hi>
he underſtood how the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was already arrived at the Campe;
wherefore he thinking every houre one yeare till his comming to ſee
her, having refreſhed his horſes, paſt on, and came to the Campe,
juſt at ſuch time as <hi>Epicamedo's</hi> men had begun a brave skirmiſh;
which growing greater and greater, increaſed almoſt to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and forme of a battell. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſtood beholding it (from
the top of a hillocke) encompaſſed with the principall of the army;
when looking aſide, by chance, ſhee ſpied <hi>Polimero</hi> deſcending the
ſide of a hill, in great haſte, for the great deſire he had to make one
in the battell. It ſeemed to her that ſhe never ſaw Knight of a better
grace and ſeemelineſſe (except her Brother <hi>Perosfilo</hi>) and not being
able to refraine looking on him, ſhe perceived that he had a deſire to
fight: but he (come to the place, and ſeeing the enemie at firſt but
weake in number) ſtood ſtill to behold the skirmiſh, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
increaſing, began to exaſperate. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> would not ſuffer
hers to be ſuccored, for the great deſire ſhe had to ſee what this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
Knight meant to doe; when he (ſeeing iſſue forth of the
enemies Campe a troope of horſe, that came to charge the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
her ſquadron in the flancke, and perceiving no man ſtirre from her
ſide) put on <hi>Flammauro</hi> with ſuch velocity, as the winde could not
have ſurpaſſed him in ſwiftneſſe: and then (without regard of being
all alone, but preferring the neceſſitie of aide before the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the enterprize) himſelfe alone reſolutely charged them all.
The <hi>Corſe</hi> Captaine (deſirous to breake his launce in the curace ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a Knight than of a meane pike-man) ranne with his launce
reſted fully at him; ſo as in the midſt of the carriere each of them hit
his oppoſite, but with contrarie ſucceſſe; for the <hi>Cors</hi> burſt his launce
(as he made account to doe) without doing any further harme,
and <hi>Polimero</hi> in the encounter brake his alſo, but left a yard and a
halfe thereof in his enemies breaſt. Then reining his obedient Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
to the right hand to divert himſelfe from encountring the whole
troope together, he mannaged him ſo dexterouſly, as (having broke
through them without receiving any blow) he turned face againe
with ſword in hand, ſooner than they could doe the like; and withall
(ere any one touch'd him) ſent with three blowes, three horſemen
tumbling to the ground. In the meane time, though all ſtrucke at
him, yet was there not any that could fully reach him, by reaſon of
the great fierceneſſe of <hi>Flammauro,</hi> who (as if he had beene inſpired
with a reaſonable ſoule) would not ſuffer any one come neere him;
yet would he come ſo neere to the others, as his maſter might well
come to ſtrike them: never in her life-time ever eyed the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
a more pleaſing ſpectacle, conſidering the valours of the Knight and
Courſer, ſo fitly ſhared betweene them, as by aſſiſting one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reciprocally, they became Invincible. Well knew ſhe him to
be a ſtranger, in that all her Knights were well knowne unto her,
imagining hee could be no leſſe than a <hi>Prince</hi> that enjoyed ſo rich
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7477:47"/>
a treaſure, as ſo unvaluable a Courſer. <hi>Polimero</hi> ſeeing no man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
him (after he had kild and beaten downe above twenty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
with redoubled courage, began to charge them a-new, but
finding no armour that either denied entrance to the fine edge of his
damaske blade, or reſiſted the force of his victorious arme, nor any
Courſer that in nimble gyres, and curvets, could match his <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauro,</hi>
he forced them to ſave themſelves by flight; himſelfe brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in ſuddenly with the ſame furie among the foote ſquadrons,
where thoſe of his ſide following him, would have ſlaine them
all, had there not beene ſent freſh troopes to their reliefe.
Who ſhooting a good while whole clouds of arrowes, gave <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi>
cauſe to feare leſt his horſe (which then by the triall he had of
him, he eſteemed more than all the kingdomes of the world) might
be thereby endangered; and therefore retired himſelfe from ſuch
a hazard. But the firy Steede though obedient to the hand, by his
neighing, puffing, ſnorting and looking backwards, expreſſed how
unwillingly he retired, which he manifeſted ſo evidently as the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
had thereby occaſion to ſay, that he needed not ſpeech in that
he expreſſed himſelfe better by his actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> ſeeing him ſo willing, and knowing him to be ſo barded
and trapped as he could not be hurt elſewhere than in the legs, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to adventure him, not without entring into the opinion of ſuch,
as beleeve the tranſmigration of ſpirits into bodies, his <hi>Flammauro</hi>
ſo fortuned, that having emptied their quivers, they ſo cloſed in the
ſhocke, as they had ſcarce roome to uſe their ſwords.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> continued heart-raviſhed (as it were) with this her
guſt, ſpectatrix of the ſweeteſt ſport that ere her eyes beheld; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could ſhe tell (till ſhe ſaw <hi>Polimero's</hi> helme off) whether ſhe
more affected the horſe, or the horſeman, being ſo rapt with the
pleaſure ſhe conceived, as ſhe tooke no notice how hers were diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged.
Whereupon the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno</hi> could not chuſe
but ſay unto her;</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Highneſſe to give me leave to ſuccour our
men, leſt that noble Knight judge us to be farre more cowardly,
than we have eſteemed him valiant; whereof the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was well
content, but would not for all this ſtirre thence her ſelfe. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe</hi>
then followed with a noble troope of Knights (being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
moſt nobly deſcended from the bloud Royall, and withall the
richeſt of the <hi>Sardegnan</hi> Lords) iſſued forth at ſuch time, as <hi>Polimero</hi>
(after he had a little repoſed himſelfe) was about to goe to renew the
charge. Who ſeeing comming towards him the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> richly
armed, and not knowing who he was, he ſtaid for him, till ſuch time
as come to him, he ſaid,</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, I beſeech you pardon us, for having left you alone,
ſeeing your matchleſſe valour needs no ſuccour; and truly, but that
we doubted you would have thought us diſcourteous, we had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
you alone to undergoe the brunt of deſtroying <hi>Epicamido's</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:7477:47"/>
whole campe, we are now come hither by her Highneſſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to obey and follow your armes and command. <hi>Polimero</hi> (incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelfe ſomewhat downewards) made anſwer;</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, if my actions were ſuch as might deſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
you give me, I ſhould deeme my ſelfe exceeding fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
but the little time that makes me know you ſo courteous, makes
me know alſo how little reaſon I have to beleeve my ſelfe valorous,
and yet that little in that reſpect alone, that I am favoured with your
applauſe. As touching my not being ſuccored, I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that I needed not any, becauſe of the juſtice of the Lady <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe;</hi>
neither could I (without being much to blame) entertaine ſo
unworthy an opinion of ſuch worthy Knights as ye are; nor is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
poſſible that any one fighting for ſuch a cauſe as this, can chuſe
but be couragious if not valorous: and for the reſt, I am come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an intention to ſerve; if therefore you be to fight, behold
me ready to obey and follow you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> (who was one of the moſt courteous of his time)
had not left <hi>Polimero's</hi> anſwer unreplied unto, had he not beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the enemy, who perceiving theſe Knights deſcend the
hill, had formed a ſquadron of the beſt of the hoſt, to goe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, which the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> ſeeing now come galloping towards
him (with their launces reſted) ſaid to <hi>Polimero;</hi> The Lady <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
is that onely one that can paralell your courteſies, ſee where comes
the enemy, let us goe meete them; at which words, he (ſpurring
his horſe) paſſed on. But <hi>Flammauro</hi> at the onely cheeke of the
hand (as if he had knowne his Maſters will) ſprung forwards ſuch a
leape as he left behind him the <hi>Marqueſſe. Polimero</hi> had no launce,
for he had broken it in the firſt encounter, ſo as being encountred
by many, he bore the brunt of them all, without moving ever ſo
little of his ſeate, yet ſtroke he downe at every blow a horſeman to
the ground, being aſſured if he fail'd any, his horſe ſupplied his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault,
who beate downe ſo faſt as even his owne friends feared to
approach him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> who began by this time to recover, and had left his
bed, being deſirous to ſee what was done abroad, cauſed himſelfe to
be carried up on a hill, accompanied with divers Lords, among
whom were the Earles of <hi>Reparata, Puſsinera,</hi> and <hi>Caſtle Rabone,</hi> with
the Barons of <hi>Ianque</hi> and <hi>Lagoſardo</hi> all the <hi>Prince</hi> his murtherers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now ſo rich a ſquadron on the enemies ſide, would needs know
who they were, wherein he was ſatisfied by theſe Lords, who well
knew them by their devices. But as they knew not <hi>Polimero,</hi> ſo were
they aſtoniſhed at his valour. By this time had the horſe (iſſued
from their ſide) received the charge, after the foote were cut all to
pieces. <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> not able to ſupport this ſo foule a diſgrace, (all
ſwollen with diſdaine) called for his armes. The Chirurgions were
not able to diſſwade him, who although he was by reaſon of his
wounds growne weake, yet was he farre more ſtout than feeble, and
becauſe hee could not ſuffer his head (not as yet well cured) to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7477:48"/>
armed, therefore would he needs goe bare-headed. But thoſe great
ones that were about him, in the end ſo prevail'd with him, as (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for their horſes) they quieted him with aſſured hope, that they
would by the getting of that dayes victory recover the honour of
the field.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno</hi> (ſeeing the enemies foot overthrowne,
and their horſe but few, and theſe retiring) drew neere <hi>Polimero</hi> to
conduct him to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> judging the reſidue ſufficient to make
good the field; but now perceiving iſſue from their ſide more than
twenty troopes of horſe, he ſaid: I once thought that the enemie had
contented himſelfe with the loſſe he hath already ſuſtained, but hee
(I perceive) is inſatiable and will have more, let us ſee what troopes
are theſe: looking then towards the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> he perceived ſhe ſent
him ſuccour; and comming afterwards to know (among the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Reparata</hi> and the other Rebels, he ſhewed them <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limero,</hi>
but more particularly thoſe that ſlue the <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (ſeeing the conflict grow greater and greater) moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on horſebacke, and cauſing the Trumpets to ſound, ſo rowſed
up <hi>Epicamedo's</hi> ſpirits, that ſhe ſaw him ſend forth for a ſupply well
neere all his horſe. Whereupon ſhee doing the like, and drawing
nigh the battell, came to know all the Traitors, of whom being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to take ſome alive, ſhe diſcovered her deſire to the warlike <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
women, who alwayes made good their places in the flancks
of her own troope, and then put her ſelfe forwards among foremoſt,
where <hi>Polimero</hi> was, that with one blow had newly beaten off his
horſe the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Caſtlerabone:</hi> the women alighting ſtrave to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
him away, which they could hardly effect, becauſe of the great
reſiſtance of the enemies ſide. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (growne furious to ſee
them all before her) thruſt at the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Ianque,</hi> which fortune ſo
well guided, that it paſſing betweene his curace and pouldrons came
out at his backe. <hi>Polimero</hi> who by the colours of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> by her
rich upper garment, by her horſe roially trapped, (but above all) by
the comelineſſe of her perſon, knew her for the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi> and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her ſtrive to get this priſoner, put forwards <hi>Flammauro,</hi> who
by making a large roome, gave the women time to ſave their prize;
and then changing his ſword into the other hand, he compaſſed with
his right arme the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Ianque</hi> about the middle, and ſpurring on
his owne horſe, plucked the other ſheere off his, which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with ſuch facility, as one would have thereby judged his force
to have beene ſufficient to have removed a Tower, and delivering
him over to the charge of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> women (whoſe deſigne he
well obſerved) he encountred the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Reparata:</hi> whilſt the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
(in the ſame place) affronted that other of <hi>Puſsinera.</hi> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all their <hi>Cavallerie</hi> ran thither to ſuccour them, the throng grew
to be ſo preſſing as neither the one part nor the other had beene able
to ſtirre, if <hi>Flammauro</hi> had not made them roome, for he keeping off
with his heeles ſuch as were behinde him, gave <hi>Reparata's</hi> horſe ſuch
a ſhocke, as made him (being not able to ſtand) preſſe downe with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7477:48"/>
him (as he fell) that of <hi>Puſsinera,</hi> who tumbled downe in a bundle
with him, with the legges of the one <hi>Count</hi> and the other under their
horſes.</p>
               <p>And becauſe <hi>Flammauro</hi> was that onely he, that could make all
ſtand off, <hi>Polimero,</hi> leaving to others the charge of bearing away the
priſoners, tooke care to ſecure thoſe, that bare them away from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hindred by ſuch as would have reſcued them; wherein he had
no ſmall adoe, by reaſon they were all upon him, ſo as he had not
got from them alive, but that the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> reſcued him, who ſeeing
him <hi>barricadoed</hi> about with the enemies horſe (none of them daring
for all that approach him) being ſeconded by the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> and
the <hi>Valentinians</hi> with an unreſiſtable force, brake into their ring, by
that meanes freeing him from the danger he was in, without having
the power, either to ſpeake one word unto him (although ſhe was
alwayes cloſe by him) or to ſeparate her ſelfe from him, though ſhe
knew no reaſon therefore. Wherehence I gather (concede me I
pray you this ſmall digreſſion) that among the hidden ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that of ſympathizing is one of the trueſt, which if we judge
vaine in reſpect of the operator, may yet prove to bee not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch in reſpect of the principles of nature. For as experience
teacheth us, that the influence of lights and planets are true in the
mutations of qualities here below, which none can denie, that denie
not ſenſe it ſelfe; ſo may we alſo argue from the like, that the other
ſtarres have alſo their peculiar influence, which if it be granted, and
that wee allow them to bee promoters of affections, then muſt
they bee ſuch alſo of love and harred, by reaſon of the diverſe
proportion of their aſpects, and not of elections or caſuall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
and if they, or theſe, bee changed from their former into a
diverſe proportion, and that the celeſtiall ſignes be found to bee of
diverſe aſpects, and that ſome of them be malignant, others not;
ſome predominant, and others obedient; this may proceede from
the foundation of daily conjectures, whereby wee ſee one friend
rule another, the ſonnes the fathers, and the ſervants alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway
and (in a certaine manner) domineere over their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>So now <hi>Polimero,</hi> before ere hee ſaw the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> became
enamored of her; and ſhe (likewiſe without ſeeing him) fell ſo
ſtrangely in love with him, that the more willingly ſhe ey'd and
followed him, the leſſe power had ſhee to ſpeake to him; Nay,
(almoſt deprived of all boldneſſe and courage) ſhe feared either to
looke in his face or fall in conference with him.</p>
               <p>He in the meane time ſcoured over all the field edg'd onwards
by his great ſpirit, and by the deſire hee had to ſhew himſelfe
worthy of the favour of her whom hee had elected for his Lady
and Miſtreſſe, ſtand long ſtill to looke on her hee could not, as
well for a native reſpect potent in that age of his, in teaching
him that neceſſarie circumſpection which might give others
no occaſion to take notice of his thoughts; as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7477:49"/>
it behoved him to have an eye both to himſelfe, and to his
horſe, who delighting in the warre, gave ſometimes ſuch counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as might teach a good Horſeman to ſticke firme to his ſeate:
yet failed he not to caſt a carefull eye to her dangers, wherein he (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
all other care) reſcued her twiſe from being oppreſſed
with the enemies.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>Prince</hi> his murtherers, there remained free, none but the
<hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Lagoſardo:</hi> who albeit he were fierce and couragious, yet
fought he nevertheleſſe very circumſpective of his perſon, not that he
feared to die, but becauſe he feared to fall alive into the hands of the
<hi>Princeſſe.</hi> Him <hi>Polimero</hi> knew not for one of them (though he had
beene ſhewed him as well as the other foure) yet incountring him by
chance, hee ſtrucke him on the nape of the necke with a backe blow,
which made him bow downe his forehead to his horſe-necke; which
he (come to himſelfe) requited with a thruſt in the flancke, whence
began to guſh forth ſtore of bloud, which the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> perceiving
(and deſirous to revenge) violently flew at him with ſuch a furie, that
(maugre thoſe that would have guarded him, or her owne determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of having him alive) ſhe never left him till ſuch time as ſhee
ſaw him mortally wounded, fallen downe and trampled, not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ruſh all the reſt; eſpecially becauſe <hi>Polimero,</hi> though he had no
finger in her combat as long as it laſted, guarded nevertheleſſe her
perſon in beating the way round about her with his <hi>Flammauro;</hi> by
which meanes he defended her from all ſuch as would have ſtrucken
at her.</p>
               <p>By this time the enemies could doe no more, nor hold out any
longer, having loſt almoſt all their Captaines, ſo as there remained
no other eminent Commander than the King alone; for the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Rebels (being the <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Sarda, Terra nova,</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geria</hi>)
were run away for feare of being taken priſoners: So that if
either the day had laſted, or <hi>Polimero</hi> not beene wounded, then even
there had ended the warre, and perhaps the life of <hi>Epicamedo.</hi> But
<hi>Eromena</hi> doubting leſt his wound were mortall (in that ſhe ſaw guſh
out thereof ſuch ſtore of bloud) cauſed a retreite to be ſounded, and
then ſuſpition chaſing away reſpectiveneſſe; ſhe having lifted up her
beaver, ſaid unto him;</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, ſo great is the obligation I owe you, that it grieves
me, my power is inferior to the deſire I have to expreſſe my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe:
I ſee you bloudy, but know not how you feele your ſelfe:
Doe you beleeve that your wound is very deepe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero,</hi> as ſoone as he ſaw her face uncovered, permitted his
greedy eyes to runne to ſuch a long'd for ſight, thinking hee ſaw
the heavens opened, and thoſe parts, which with celeſtiall ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
formed that face, to be congregated gods; howbeit he was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
in the abſolute diſtinction of the greater from the leſſer, ſeeing
all generally Majeſticall, and every one by it ſelfe worthy of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of ſo many more worlds. But thoſe ſplendent eies (full of ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
rayes, that pierced through the concentred point of his heart)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7477:49"/>
made him a little ſtagger, whoſe luſtre was as that of <hi>Apollo,</hi> but their
vertue as of a greater Deity; for theſe in ſtead of dazeling the material
eyes, ſtrike thoſe of the minde with ſo reiterated raies, that there is
no lightſome ſplendor, either of Sunne, Moone or Stars, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the thouſandth part of its own vertue ſo fully in it ſelfe, as theſe
poſſeſſe all of all theirs, in a manner ſo unexpreſſable, as the moſt
perſpicuous wit could never forme to it ſelfe an <hi>Idea</hi> conformable
thereunto: And although her language had its preheminence, and
that it had captivated the underſtanding in its firſt apprehenſion;
nevertheleſſe the <hi>ſhafts</hi> of her eyes made themſelves be eſteemed the
armes of <hi>love,</hi> nay his throne, nay his heaven, nay <hi>Iove</hi> himſelfe.
Wherefore having already lifted up his beaver, with an humble
garbe and true poſture of veneration he returned her this anſwer;</p>
               <p>And who can ever preſume (valorous Lady) to thinke himſelfe
worthy or capable of ſerving you in ſuch a manner, as that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
and the dutie of who ſo ſerves you, exceede not a thouſand times
his ſervice? or what greater recompence ought any one pretend from
your Highneſſe, for any ſervice than your ſervice it ſelf? ſuch have the
gods made you, that being onely and abſolutely ſingular in all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts, you onely ſhould, for being ſuch, be excladed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the debt which others own by the common law of
nature. As for me I pretend nothing elſe than your ſervice, neither
expect I other guerdon than that you would vouchſafe to be pleaſed
to give me leave to ſerve you: wherein if my fortune or your benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
make me ſo happie, as that my ſervice be acceptable unto you;
I ſhall account in at unpretended gaine. But as for my wound, I
thinke it be not dangerous, if my ſenſe beguile me not, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it well may, ſeeing that who ſo lives with the gods is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the feeling of any paine; your divine preſence is ſufficient to
eaſe all kinde of paines, and cure all manner of wounds, though deepe
and inward, as I repute mine to be at this inſtant rather exaſperated
than given.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> in the lifting up he made of his beaver, reſted ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazied,
as if ſhe had beene ſtrucken with lightning, beleeving not till
ſuch time as ſhe heard him ſpeake, that hee could be other than a
damzell like her ſelfe, whom ſome emulation had drawne into
thoſe parts. But having afterwards examined the arguments for
the contrary, ſhe could not ſatiate her ſelfe in beholding him, yet
not all of him, for her eyes (become immoveable) had not the
power to ſtirre from their firſt object; ſo as fixed altogether on his,
her eyes twinckled not at all, and ſo exceedingly was ſhe raviſhed
by an unknowne power, as ſhe was forced to underſtand the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intelligences that paſſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one heart to the other. But when ſhe
afterwards heard his courteous conceits, his modeſt pretentions, and
his laſt words, of her not underſtood amiſſe; ſhe being ſuch a one, as
both for vivacitie of wit to conceive them, and for incomparable
beauties and exquiſite perfections, to deſerve them was every way
peereleſſe, imagining withall that ſo lofty a thought could not be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7477:50"/>
lodg'd elſewhere, than in a <hi>Prince's</hi> heart) ſhe with a gladſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
made him this reply.</p>
               <p>You are too too curious (Sir Knight) in prizing a feeble damzell
ſo highly as you doe; and too little affectioned to your ſelfe-wards,
in ſo ſlenderly eſteeming your owne worth; for ſuch have your
ſervices hitherunto beene, as I judge my ſelfe more than any other,
indebted to that common law you ſpeake of, the excluſion from
which if it could be granted me in any caſe, ſhold then be for ſervices
done me by my fathers ſubjects, who are thereto obliged by nature,
and by the favours they daily receive; but in this caſe a ſtranger hath
no place, his ſervice not depending on the law of ſubjection, but on
his owne free-will and election, wherewith he greatly obligeth
whom he ſerves. But leaving this aſide, me-thinks your wound hath
no neede of delaying its cure, which ſince it is ſuch as you tell me, let
us hence to our tents, where (I hope in the gods) the danger will not
prove ſuch, but that you may be ſoone cur'd thereof: for there have
we good Chirurgions, and withall theſe our mountaines are full of
vertuous herbes, by meanes whereof you will in a few dayes (I
hope) finde your ſelfe recovered and a ſound man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> would no further reply, for doubt of being eſteemed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious;
which ſhe obſerving, put off her glove to touch his hand, as
ſhe was wont to doe to her gueſts, and he gently taking it in his, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately
kiſſed it, to the great pleaſure of them both, acutely
conceiving their joyes to be equally ſhared. The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſeeing him of ſo tender an age, and ſo rare a beauty (after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange
of courteous complements) could never have their fill of
looking on him, deeming his force to be unproportionable to his
yeares, and his delicacy to his valour.</p>
               <p>Being come to the tents, and the Chirurgions ſent for, he was
(by ſpeciall order from the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) laid a-bed, and dreſſed in a
tent not farre from hers. The wound was in the fleſhly part of the
flancke of a good wideneſſe, of no danger, and of a likelihood of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoone cured, whereof the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was exceeding joyfull, and
had willingly gone in perſon to viſite him, but that modeſty and her
dignitie forbade her.</p>
               <p>The day enſuing, it was reſolved in councell, that no time, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite,
was to be given the enemy, already halfe overthrown, but that
he ſhould be aſſailed in his trenches: when (as they were going out)
there appeared before them ſome Countrey Swaines, who (delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> a letter,) told her they were of <hi>Cornetto,</hi> where they
kept priſoner the Admirall ſhrewdly wounded; whereupon ſhe being
verie inquiſitive to know how he was taken, one of them knowing
<hi>Caraſio</hi> (who by chance waited there to know what the Councell
would reſolve of) anſwered her; the Maſter of that ſame ſquire there,
is he that delivered him us, to bring him (as ſent from him) to your
Highneſſe, but he is in ſo bad a plight at this preſent, as that we could
not bring him along with us. Hereupon the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (knowing <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſio</hi>)
knew alſo by him, whence the preſent came; ſo as (turning
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7477:50"/>
towards the Councell) ſhe ſaid; A happy ſtarre was it for us, that
conducted hither ſuch a Knight as this, who in a ſmall time hath
done more himſelfe alone, than all our forces together; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the overthrow at <hi>Valentino,</hi> and taking of <hi>Saſſari</hi> were of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
yet all had beene to little purpoſe without the taking of
this Traitor and the reſt, which were by him tane yeſterday; calling
upon this for <hi>Caraſio,</hi> ſhe enquired of him if what they ſaid was
true: which when hee had affirmed, and ſaw that ſhe joyed much
thereof, he further ſaid; I beleeve not, that your Highneſſe knowes
as yet all that might in that reſpect make up your joyes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,
and thereupon acquainted her of the impriſoning of the ſlave;
How (ſaid ſhe) is the ſlave a priſoner, and I know nothing thereof?
It is moſt certaine (anſwered <hi>Caraſio</hi>) and with that related unto her
the manner how he was found at ſea, by the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce had he finiſhed his diſcourſe, when there arrived unawares
a Poaſt from the King, who brought alſo letters from the ſame
<hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> wherein (after the newes of the ſlave) he recommended
<hi>Polimero,</hi> deſcribing him by his aſpect, armes, and horſe, giving her
withall an inkling of his being highly deſcended, and of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of purpoſe to ſerve her in that warre. Which newes afforded
her (as ſhe conceived) a colourable excuſe to go ſee him; and therefore
asked <hi>Caraſio</hi> if a viſite of hers would be diſcommodious unto him,
who (having anſwered her it would not) advertized thereof his
Maſter; who (at the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her entrance raiſing himſelfe on his
elbow) ſaid,</p>
               <p>The Tent (<hi>Madame</hi>) in that it is your Highneſſes, may perhaps
deſerve this favour, but never I; although I poſſeſſed all the merits in
the world: (and as he would have ſpoken on) the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, ſaid,</p>
               <p>Since then (Sir) the Tent (as you ſay) is mine, it is fit that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in mine owne houſe, which otherwiſe I would not preſume to
doe with you, but by way of intreaty: Repoſe your ſelfe on your
pillow, or I will get me gone, courteſies are not ſupportable when
they be prejudiciall to your wounds. There is no wound can preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
me (anſwered <hi>Polimero</hi>) that is annointed with the precious
balſome of your Highneſſe favours, yet muſt I needs for all that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
you, for to that end was I borne. Whereat ſhe ſmiling ſaid, I
could doe no leſſe (Sir Knight) than come to ſee you, to yeeld you
thankes for the preſent you ſent me ere your arrivall hither, whereof
I know nothing till this inſtant; I pray the heavens I may be able to
ſhew my ſelfe not ingratefull unto you, for (for my owne part) I
owing ſo much, have (without their aide) but little to ſatisfie ſo

him to lie ſtill) made her this anſwer:</p>
               <p>Your Highneſſe her preſence enjoyes a vertue ſo excellent, as it
is not (either in reſpect of it ſelfe or of others) capable of receiving
of the leaſt blemiſh of defect, ſo as what in others might be perhaps
ſtiled importunity, is in your Highneſſe no other than a favour, who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7477:51"/>
being ſo bountifull a diſtributreſſe of your courteſies will not ſuffer
me to goe away, without largely participating thereof, for that I
well know that they point fully at me, ſo as I hope for more eaſe and
good to my wounds from them, than from all the balſomes, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
herbes in the mountaines of <hi>Sardegna;</hi> by ſo much the
more am I therefore indebted unto your Highneſſe, by how much
you exceeding with your goodneſſe and bounty, the weakeneſſe of
my deſerts, deeme me worthy of that merit which no dignitie can
deſerve; for the reſt, if preſents ought to be priſed for their good
qualities, then hath your Highneſſe no reaſon to thanke me for this,
becauſe among men there is not a worſe than that Traytor; or if by
ſome conſequence, or motive of juſt revenge, your Highneſſe thinke
this preſent meritorious, yet cannot that neither make it thanke.
worthy, ſeeing all men are obliged to juſtice, and Knights above all
other, and yet above all Knights I, who have dedicated my ſelfe to
your Highneſſe ſervice, ere ever I knew you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> having fixt on him her eyes whilſt he ſpake, exactly
ſurveying, and conſidering with her ſelfe his beautie (which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that of any other in his time) his comelineſſe, and behaviour,
(gifts in him naturall, and by education perfected) together with the
ſweetneſſe of his words (which pronounced in a feemely order, and
with a certaine kinde of inimitable utterance won the hearts of ſuch
as heard him) maugre the vigor of her courage, the vertue of her dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
&amp; her formerly made deliberation never to affect any could, not
chuſe but love him; which ſhe afterwards continued with a paſſion ſo
exceſſive, as there was never woman that ever more truly lov'd than
ſhe. Moved then with the affects of love (borne, at the firſt ſight, or
ere ſhe beheld his face, and growne up by ſeeing him with his beaver
off, but now waxen ripe, in both ſeeing and hearing him,) ſhe reſted
ſo troubled in her minde, as ſhe knew not what to ſay, till at length
ſomewhat ſtammering, and bewraying with her humide eyes, the
ſtate of her burning heart, ſhe ſaid unto him:</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay to you? (courteous Knight) ſithence that your
vertue being ſubordinated to the divinitie, a type of all vertue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
it ſelfe with it ſelfe, deſpiſeth thoſe fruits which humane ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
delights in among mortals? You will be obliged unto me, and
will maintaine, that you cannot by ſerving of me diſoblige your
ſelfe, if humane affaires proceeded in ſuch a faſhion, then were the
conditions of ſome miſerable, and of others tyrannicall: for thoſe
ſtraightly bound without being able to untie themſelves, and theſe
quite looſe, and free from all poſſibilitie of becomming bound, could
never hold that relation together, that nature requires equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
things not unequall. Wherefore in that we are in nature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
and therefore neceſſarily borne to this relation, it muſt needs
follow that who ſo ſerves, deſerves; and that you being the obliging,
I muſt conſequently needs be the obliged unto you: otherwiſe (by
treading the paths of divinitie) all humane wayes would be quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
Your wounds (Sir Knight) though peradventure not your
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7477:51"/>
actions, bewray you to be a man, and being ſuch, how can you hold
your ſelfe tied to this ſnare of obligation, and to this chaine of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
without ever pretending either liberty or reward? Nay, not ſo
much as commendations, being you muſt ſtrip your ſelf of that alſo,
if you will ſuſtaine the machine of your paradox? You free from all
kinde of debt and duty, either of vaſſallage or otherwife, have done
me ſo great ſervices, as I may not endure to heare you degrade (by
the indignitie of the prize) your worthy actions that ſo much oblige
me; and if your argument were true, the gods ſhould never be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by me, ſeeing their good turnes extended no further than to the
purging the world of monſters, and to terreſtriall things here below
on earth, who nevertheleſſe ought with great reaſon to be adored, as
thoſe by whoſe meanes we receive all goodneſſe. And if by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argument you beleeve you could not oblige me in that you
were already obliged to juſtice; give me but leave to tell you, that
the juſt man is indeed commended onely by juſtice, not becauſe wee
are not all bound to be juſt, but becauſe the law of juſtice doth not
compell us to have a hand in all juſt cauſes; and therefore, you for
having a hand in this, and in a cauſe of ſuch a nature, and withall with
the hazard of your life (whereto juſtice obliged not) acquire
thereby the praiſe not onely of a juſt man, but alſo of a ſtout Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
for which you deſerve the guerdon, if juſtice ceaſe not to be
juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero,</hi> (ſeeing her ſo profoundly dive into the center of the
<hi>Ethnickes,</hi> with a reſolution not to be vanquiſhed) making her with
all reſpectiveneſſe a ſubmiſſive cringe, to manifeſt his yeelding as
conquered, ſaid thus unto her; Let not your Highneſſe imagine (I
beſeech you) that I meane to oppoſe your courteous Tenents, by ſo
much the rather becauſe they tende to my favour. And although
that truth in its power can doe more than all powers, this rule never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
ſhall for this time ſuffer its exception; your Highneſſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie
of neceſſitie exceeding and ſurpaſſing truth it ſelfe. Pardon me
(I pray you) for ſo ſaying, for had I ſaid otherwiſe, it would have
prov'd a ſpecies of Rebellion in my ſervice, which (although your
arguments rather ſtop my mouth that can expreſſe little, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my faith, which beleeves what it ought) being it deſires to
conſerve it ſelfe faithfull, cannot chuſe but confeſſe even to the death,
that the condition of my ſervices, is nothing in compariſon of the
royall merits of your Highneſſe, which of themſelues are ſuch as by
vouchſafing to ſuffer them, to be knowen, is a guerdon ſufficiently
ſatisfactorie, to whoſoever is graced with the favour of knowing
them.</p>
               <p>Thus did love ſolace it ſelfe in theſe two Lovers, but with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
extraordinary order: for being wont in other to creepe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
in theſe would he needs manifeſt his Deitie, and ſhew himſelfe
to be a god, though blinde, yet eyed ſufficiently to ſpie out two
ſpirits, who (participating of celeſtiall eſſence) merited to be by an
extraordinary way infuſed with his graces. Therefore would hee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7477:52"/>
have the beginning and the period to be both in the ſame inſtant, and
that from their reciprocall affection, ſhould ſuddenly ſpring forth a
certaine knowledge, as if they had been long before acquainted each
with other: So as (baniſhing all complements, and depriving them
of all whatſoever they had learnt, either by nature or from the
Court, in the art of diſſembling;) he taught them to underſtand and
diſcerne the ſcope of their different arguments, and yet would hee
have them underſtand mutually each the others meaning, by the
ſecret intelligence of the meanes already adoperated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena</hi> then (breathing amorous ſighs from the internall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of her heart) thus replied; I well perceive (Sir Knight) that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a falſe title of ſervice, you are reſolved to command me, which
(for the clearing of ſome oppoſing ambiguities) makes me very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to know but who you are; for albeit I am conſtrained to yeeld
unto you (were it but for your valours ſake, which makes me deeme
you moſt noble) yet ſhould I thinke my ſelfe exceeding happy, if
fortune therewithall concurr'd in the reſt. Whereat <hi>Polimero</hi> (taking
her by the hand, and with extreme joy kiſſing it) returned her this
anſwer: Your Highneſſe ſhall in this point be very ſhortly obeyed
and ſatisfied, for I hold it more difficult by proweſſe to make my ſelf
knowne to be worthy of what I pretend to be already, than to bee
known, for that other, who as yet is altogether unknown. Tell it then
(replied the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>) Command me it not I beſeech you, ſaid then
<hi>Polimero;</hi> onely be but pleaſed that the warres firſt be brought to an
end, and that my true ſervice, which ſhall never have end, may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
its foundation of actions; this accompliſhed, I will not onely
pray the heavens (contrarie to all my owne arguments) to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
in granting a reward, but will alſo beſeech your Highneſſe
ſelfe to beſtow one on me: neither ſhall I preſume to deſire it at your
Highneſſe hands, if fortune and nature concurre not in a higher
pitch, than I ſhall ever be able to arrive with the humility of my
ſervice, conſidering the infinite deſerts and high merits of your
HHighneſſe. On this <hi>Eromena</hi> (deſirous to know him, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe his excuſes) was diſturbed by the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> and other
knights, by reaſon of whoſe comming ſhe retired her ſelfe thence
a little after; and ſo did theſe others alſo, after they had paſſed with
<hi>Polimero</hi> ſuch obſervant tearmes of good breeding, as (becauſe of
the laſt newes) they judged convenient.</p>
               <p>The morning following was <hi>Epicamedo</hi> aſſailed in his trenches;
but not <hi>with any particular valour of ſingular perſons;</hi> for the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
went not thither, and <hi>Polimero</hi> lay wounded, the others ſuffred
themſelves to be governed by a common and ordinary ſpirit, which
commonly rules by ordinary meanes. So that the fortifications
being good, well flanked and as well guarded, and the defendants
become (by paſt knocks) more carefull and reſolute, not to give
way to the valour of the enemy, there therefore enſued an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
retreat with ſmall loſſe of men, and no diſadvantage of acquired
reputation.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7477:52"/>
the <hi>Corſes</hi> (to ſhew they were not vanquiſhed) in the ſucceeding
dayes, iſſued forth inceſſantly to their wonted skirmiſhes, with an
intent rather of prolonging than finiſhing the warre; although many
were of opinion that their beſt courſe had beene to retire themſelves,
in that their hopes were by ſo many contrary fortunes almoſt quite
overthrowne. But <hi>Epicamedo</hi> (that of all the <hi>Corſan</hi> Kings was moſt
couragious and fierce, no whit daunted to ſee his deſignes broken off,
his friends loſt, and himſelfe forſaken of ſuch of them as ſurvived,)
had already ſent poſt over into <hi>Corſica</hi> for new forces, ſo fortifying
(in the meane time) the ſituation of his Campe, as hee made
it of its ſelfe apt to beare the brunt of any ſudden aſſault, as
might tend to the forcing of his trenches, which laſted many dayes,
untill the recoverie of <hi>Polimero,</hi> who all this while had much adoe
to detend his being concealed from the urging importunity of
<hi>Eromena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were a doing, the Fleets at ſea were diverſly
governed. The <hi>Sardan</hi> rode in <hi>Porto di Torre</hi> contented to conſerve
her ſelfe. And the <hi>Corſan</hi> (who was ſtronger by ten Galleyes) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
as Miſtreſſe of the ſea, ſcowring the coaſt from <hi>Tolata</hi> to
<hi>Corſica,</hi> without any danger, when ſhee leaving freſh forces, and
diſembarking them at <hi>Terra-nova</hi> (a place neere the Campe) romed
over all that river, leaving alwayes eight or ten Galleyes at <hi>Tolata</hi>
to ſupply ſuch occaſions, as might fall out to be neceſſarie, either
for the affaires of the army, or the Kings ſervice. Now when all
theſe of the Fleete were returned from <hi>Corſica,</hi> and had landed ſome
thouſand foot, fifteene of them wafted off towards <hi>Porto di Torre,</hi>
to ſee if they could by any meanes draw forth into the Maine, the
<hi>Sardan</hi> Galleyes; which under the command of a brave <hi>Vice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall</hi>
lay at anchor in the haven, expecting the arrivall of the
<hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> with a good number of Galleyes, that were
a rigging and arming in the <hi>Arcenall</hi> of <hi>Caleri,</hi> towards the
augmenting and reinforcing of this <hi>Sardan Armado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> had obtained of the King the office
of Admirall, on condition that <hi>Eromena</hi> thereto conſented,
wherefore hee came to <hi>Villa-petres,</hi> and got the confirmation
thereof, by meanes both of his owne merits, and of <hi>Polimero's</hi>
interceſſion, to whom hee ſo perform'd his promiſe of concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, as the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> could not poſſibly come to know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
any thing elſe, but generalities, wherewith albeit ſhee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
contented, yet remain'd ſhee nevertheleſſe in a confuſed
manner, confuſedly diſquieted. Returned afterwards to <hi>Caleri,</hi>
he there ſtaid waiting untill the Galleyes were made ready, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(though inferior in number) hee hoped to affront all the
<hi>Corſan Armado.</hi> In the meane time the other Galleyes (as I
told you) lay at anchor under the command of a <hi>Vice-Admirall;</hi>
who (becauſe his power was limited, and his Galleyes but twelve
in number) would not venture them farre, knowing that
the loſſe of theſe few Veſſels might occaſion the ruine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7477:53"/>
of the whole enterprize. The Centrees which he kept watching
aſhore on the Promontory, gave him notice of the comming of the
enemie, together with the preciſe number of their Gallies, beſides
one Galley more that came from a contrarie point where of they
knew not what to thinke. The <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> therefore judging it a
great ſhame to ſuffer himſelfe to be aſſieged in his owne haven, the
enemies having but the advantage of three galleys, or at the moſt but
of foure (if that which was comming from the Weſt, were alſo one
of theirs) reſolving to prepare himſelfe to fight, launch'd forth of
the haven in good order, not beleeving that the other Galley was
any foe to them, becauſe the kingdomes of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Maiorica</hi>
(whence ſhe ſeemed to come) were in good league and friendſhip
with the <hi>Sardegnan</hi> crowne.</p>
               <p>By this time the <hi>Corſes</hi> had divided their fleete into three ſmall
ſquadrons, where of two conſiſted of ſix Galleyes a-peece, and the
third but of three, which (being diſentangled) might ſuccour where
occaſion required; And the <hi>Sardans</hi> divided theirs into two onely,
not reſerving any Galley for ſuccour. Gotten then within ſhot one
of the other, they began to let flie their arrowes; the three fetching
a large compaſſe came with their Archers to charge the <hi>Sardans</hi> in
their poope; and after they had for a good while maintained
their ſhot (perceiving the approach of the Galley of the Weſt that
with maine force of oares came flying towards them) they went
two of them to haile her, whilſt the other thirteene went on to
grapple with the twelve <hi>Sardans,</hi> with ſuch ſhouts and cries, as made
all the ſea-coaſt reſound at the noiſe thereof. The two approaching
neere to that other, and ſeeing her with three fanals or lanthornes, but
without any Standard, wondring what ſhe might be, held ſtill their
oares; the other did the like, but carried away with the meere force
of her courſe, ſhe bare up ſo neere the other, that the <hi>Corſe</hi> Captaine
might conveniently aske her whence ſhe was? Where at ſhe (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for <hi>Corſes</hi>) plunging her oares ſuddenly in the waters, run
full-but on the next to her, giving her ſuch a violent ſhocke, as ſhe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but of three and twenty banckes, ſcaped hardly a ſinking, and
then being boorded by a brave ſquadron of Knights, was (after a
ſhort skirmiſh) taken, with the death of ſuch as ſtrove to defend her.
Meane while her fellow-galley, thinking this ſtranger ſo buſied as ſhe
could not reſiſt her aſſault, reſolved to charge her ſterne, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſetled her ſnout on the ladder, and reach'd out their grappling
hookes to hold her firme, that ſo they might mount her by skaling,
they were beaten backe by one Knight alone, that threw downe into
the ſea above fifteene of them one after another, who were there
drown'd with the weight of their armour; the reſt (playing wide off
with their arrowes) were in a caſe but little better, becauſe the enemy
(being exceedingly well armed) ſhowred ſuch clouds of arrowes, as
forced this Galley to forſake her loſt fellow, and flie backe to the
reſt for ſafegard; but the ſtranger (not weying the want of her
men that were aboord the other <hi>Cors,</hi> ſeeing they were Maſters
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7477:53"/>
there of) made amaine after this, whom ſhe overtaking aſſailed, and in
a ſhort time (boording her with her men) made her fellow captive
with the other; and becauſe ſhe could not chuſe but uſe ſome cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
towards her for the aſſuring her ſelf of her the more ſpeedily (ſhe
being reſolved to ſuccour thoſe others of <hi>Sardegna</hi>) ſhe cut in pieces
almoſt all the ſouldiers, and withall cut off her oare-ties that ſhe
might not runne away; which done, ſhe bent her courſe towards the
<hi>Corſan Admirall;</hi> who, not able to ſuſtaine a new aſſault, having had
but too much to doe with the <hi>Sardan Vice-Admirall,</hi> remained in the
power of the <hi>Sardans.</hi> Then after aſſailing another, and taking her,
it came to paſſe, that the <hi>Corſans</hi> firſt loſing their ods of veſſels, and
afterwards over-match'd with diſparity and diſadvantage, were all
of them taken, ſo as there eſcaped not as much as a Pinnaee of all
their number.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vice-Admirall,</hi> who before was in a doubtfull plight, and had
(without this ſuccour) for all his valour gotten the worſt of the
day, not knowing whoſe that Galley might be, went aboord a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,
and come to her poope, he ſaw that Knight (that with his owne
hands had tumbling downe ſo many over-boord) clad in coſtly
armour, of a Majeſticall aſpect, and environed with a ring of noble
Knights, that honoured him as their Lord; and therefore imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he could be no leſſe than a <hi>Prince,</hi> he kneel'd downe before him;
when the other (not permitting him) ſaid, Stand up (Sir Knight) for
I may not heare you in ſuch a poſture, whereupon he (riſing up) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
I will obey you (my Lord) for all things oblige me ſo to
doe, yet ſhall this not hinder me to acknowledge, that your preſence
merits to be by me ſpoken unto in ſuch a poſture and faſhion. I know
I enjoy this victorie by your meanes, and that it is to you, that the
kingdome of <hi>Sardegna</hi> owes this debt. I am therefore come to yeeld
you thankes for it, not conformable to your dignitie, though ſuch as
may be better expreſſed by the affection of a gratefull heart, than by
the unpoliſht language of a Knight that is more Mariner than Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.
I will ſay no more, becauſe I judge your qualitie to be ſuch, that
to offer you my ſelfe with theſe Galleyes, ſav'd by your valour,
would adde ſo little to your greatneſſe; as you would peradventure
diſdaine them. I am not indeede Admirall of this fleete, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ppoſſeſſe not ſuch abſolute authoritie as were requiſite for your
ſervice; nevertheleſſe, ſo great is the ſervice that the King my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne
hath received of you, as I may in this particular without
preſumption aſſume full authoritie, which ſhall be to offer you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his Galleyes, and thoſe that man them, whoſe hearts you have
by your helpe won already, thoſe alſo of the enemies, acquired by
your armes, that you may diſpoſe of them, as to you may ſeeme
good, being well aſſured that I can never doe a ſervice more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than this to my Sovereignes the King and <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight that had all this while liſtened unto him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Majeſtie, changing it now into a ſmiling countenance, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
(Sir Knight) I can doe no leſſe than accept very kindly your
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7477:54"/>
Noble courteſie which you could never have manifeſted by a more
generous ſpirit than your owne; but as it befits me not to accept it
according to the largeneſſe of your offer, ſo hold I it very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
not to accept of ſome portion there of, and that ſhall be your
amitie. Leaving the reſt for you and your ſouldiers, together with
the honour of the day, whereof if you will yet needs have me parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate,
it ſhall ſuffice me to have with my comming, haſtned your
victorie. I am <hi>Metaneone, Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> come hither to finde
out a brother of mine, who (I know well) is come to <hi>Sardegna,</hi>
with the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> to make one in theſe warres; I have a
great deſire to get a ſight of him; and becauſe he (for ſome reſpects)
will perhaps conceale himſelfe from me, and ſhun my preſence; I
would faine be ſo directed as I might unawares come to finde him
out, ere he knew any thing of my comming, wherein if you can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
me, 'you ſhall oblige me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vice-Admirall,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>Princes</hi> commands, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe before him, and becauſe he could not come to kiſſe his
hand, he reverently kiſſed the skirt of his armour, and then (raiſed
up againe) he ſaid,</p>
               <p>Moſt valourous <hi>Prince,</hi> to reply or repeate things already ſpoken
were ſuper fluous, eſpecially conſidering that of ſo great a <hi>Prince</hi> as
is your Highneſſe, all gifts are to be accepted, as I alſo accept all, ſave
onely one, where of your Highneſſe (though liberall) ought not to
be prodigall, and that is the honour of this dayes conqueſt; which if
it happen that your Highneſſe refuſe, I will erect to fame a Trophee
thereof, ſo great, as you ſhall be (whether you will or no) conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to accept it. And as concerning the reſt, had you not mentioned
particularly the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia,</hi> I could not have certainely ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your deſire in any thing; yet now I know that the youth that came
with him, lives unknowne, and hath performed ſuch martiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
as it is moſt neceſſarie and requiſite that <hi>Sardegna</hi> being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
engaged to the one for his land enterprizes, reſt obliged to the
other alſo for his atchievements by ſea: he hath kept his bed (woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
almoſt this moneth, and lives (not farre hence) in the Campe
with the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi> If your Highneſſe pleaſe to goe thither by land,
your way will be the ſhorter, but more difficult, if by ſea, more
commodious, ſudden and unexpected; whither I will waite on your
Highneſſe, together with the whole Fleete; for in that the King of
<hi>Corſica</hi> hath but tenne Galleyes now left, I intend to ſeize on them,
ere they can come to know any thing of the loſſe of the others. Nor
can the King <hi>Epicamedo</hi> eſcape death or impriſonment, when hee
ſhall be thus deprived of his Gallies, being that he can hope for no
helpe from the Rebels; the greateſt part whereof are taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the remaining three, fled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> commending this deliberation as prudent, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the approbation of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi> told him, that hee
himſelfe would partake with him in that enterpriſe, the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that way was moſt commodious for him. Returned therfore to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7477:54"/>
                  <hi>Porto di Torre,</hi> and leaving there the Galleyes they tooke, (except
foure which they cauſed ſuddenly to be arm'd and mann'd, re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the others with the <hi>Corſan ghing</hi>) they ſet out for their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
voiage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> kept his bed longer than he made account to doe, for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up one day to goe skirmiſh, his wound then halfe cured, bruiſed
by his armour, began to ranckle and feſter; wherefore the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
would not ſuffer him to arme himſelf any more, till ſuch time as that
wound were fully cur'd, together with two more given him the ſame
day. It grieved him to the heart to ſee the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> in all dangers,
and himſelfe not able to ſuccour her, the rather becauſe the enemie
was ſo well fortified in his Campe, with ſundry Forts and redouts
over all the field, as made him even deſpaire. Such was (in the meane
time) the affection betweene them, that it was impoſſible to beleeve
how ſtrongly it was joyned with a paſſing modeſt diſcretion (a well
knowne enemy to fervent love:) but too too greene youth in the one,
and native modeſtie in the other, moderated their affections, whence
ſprung thoſe effects in love unacuſtomed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> could by no meanes come to know who he was;
which made her often vex at her ſelfe for having had ſo little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt,
as not to have forced the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Chia</hi> to tell it her, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her ſelfe that he well knew i, although he made ſhew of the
contrary, the rather becauſe in his letter to her he wrote, that hee
was of a high deſcent. And albeit ſhe could beleeve no leſſe but that
ſhe was beloved (for had ſhe but imagined otherwiſe, ſhe had beene
dead a thouſand times) nevertheleſſe this conſtant concealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
put her in doubt, cauſing her to <hi>ſyllogize;</hi> That who ſo loveth,
the ſame obeyeth the thing or ſubject beloved, but he obeyed not
(becauſe he told her not who hee was) and therefore he loved her
not. Another time ſhe would imagine that he concealed himſelfe for
not being able to make himſelfe knowne to be of ſuch bloud as might
be deemed any way worthy of her: Or if he were, that then he did
but profeſſe affection onely to paſſe away the time (during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of his ſtay there,) in pleaſing his humour with the title of
love. But when ſhe conſidered how his royall manners unmasked
him, repenting her ſelfe of her cenſure, ſhe accuſed her judgement of
temeritie, it grieving her that ſhe had her ſpirits ſo offuſcared as in not
knowing him, not to know her ſelfe. Onely ſhee was certaine, that
if this torment laſted, her life could not long endure, growne alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
impotent with the tedious ſuffering the violent fits of her amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
feaver, wherewith ſhe had euery day ſuch a bickering, as cauſed
the corals and roſes fade away from her ſweetly Majeſticall face,
like one languiſhing and fainting underthe burthen of ſome tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
diſeaſe: which gave many cauſe to conjecture, that the delicaete
of her ſex kept diſproportioned companie with the ſtoutneſſe of her
courage, and that watching, weight of armes, and other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of the warres diminiſhed the excellencie of her beautie, ſo that
if the warre continued, it might well revive in her the valour of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7477:55"/>
                  <hi>Perosfilo,</hi> but quite deſtroy the beauties of <hi>Eromena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> on the other ſide, the more his externall wounds healed,
the more did his internall exaſperate and fret. Well was he aſſured
of the love of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> which made him not become inſolent
(conformable to the levity of youth,) nay rather, though neither
his ſtarres had enclined him, nor her beauties and good parts forced
him to love her; yet had meere gratitude (a great miſtreſſe of gentle
ſpirits) beene powerfull enough (without either influence of ſtarres,
or attraction of beauties) to have compel'd him (in a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
even to adore her. And how much rather then by inclination
or compulſion, was hee conſtrained to doe it for divers other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects?
When he conſidered the excellency of her ſingular endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
by ſo much the more worthy of all merits, by how much
the vertues of both ſexes being united in her, had of the <hi>Idea</hi> of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(compartible among all women) formed one woman alone, and
withall (to make her more admirable) conferr'd on her al manly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and courage. And that therefore his was a fortune fortunate,
above all fortunes, to be belov'd of her, who above all other women
merited the ſacrifice of all hearts. And if every great <hi>Prince</hi> (how
potent ſoever) had reaſon to eſteeme himſelfe happy, if he came to
receive but the leaſt of thoſe favours, which he hourely enjoy'd;
by how much the more ſhould he, being poore, without meanes,
and the meaneſt of all his brothers, thinke himſelfe (among the
happieſt) moſt truly happy? It grieved him he obey'd her not in a
matter ſo friuolous, which ſhe ſo much deſired to know; yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
it, in that he was aſhamed to manifeſt himſelfe ere he had given
a more ample expreſſion of his merits; becauſe the being ſprung
from bloud Royall, was but a qualitie to content the world. The
nobleneſſe of a minde ſo divine, as exceeded all Royall ſtate, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a qualitie more ſublime to content it ſelfe; ſo as he for being
not able to reach with the lowneſſe of his ſervices to the hight of her
perfections would have utterly diſpaired thereof, if he deſire to ſerve
her, more than the ſervice it ſelfe (eternally inferior to his duty)
had not made the way of her favour eaſie to his merits.</p>
               <p>Little elſe could <hi>Polimiro</hi> ponder in his minde, the greeneneſſe of
his yeares not affording him as yet other effectuall affections, than
the leſſe ſecret, and his want of experience, depriving him of the
light of nature, which is wont to beare a great ſway, even in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
it ſelfe, unleſſe a true love (interpoſing it ſelfe) engender a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
eclipſe; his ſpeculations were altogether of abſtractions, for in
not knowing he knew, and though he knew not how, yet well knew
he what he would faine have, and what he would faine not have: Full
little was he as yet aware of that the negative might have place in a
courteous Lady; he being not (ever ſo little) acquainted with thoſe
things, (which though ſued for) might be without diſcourteſie
denied. Much was he troubled and vexed for his hurts, thinking that
the time ſpent in healing his wounds, wounded him in loſing ſo
much time in her ſervice, his heart perſwading him, that (with the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7477:55"/>
ardent deſire he had to deſerve her) he found himſelfe ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to chaſe away, not onely from his trenches, but even from
<hi>Sardegna,</hi> both <hi>Epicamedo</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Polimero</hi> ſtood thus feeding his amorous melancholy, in
came the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who accuſtomed to come every day to viſite
him, and the better to ſhadow her affection, held her councell of
warre about his bed, under pretext (for the honour due to his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
to receive alſo his opinions. Where, after thanking her for the
trouble and paines ſhe vouchſafed to take in comming to viſite him,
he beſought her to give him leave to goe out to the field, for that hee
well ſaw that that aire agreed not with her conſtitution, and that
therefore ſhe being unaccuſtomed to hardneſſe and diſaſters ſhould
doe well to take ſome courſe to avoide them. Whereunto the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
(that well knew the cauſe of her alterations) made anſwer:</p>
               <p>My Lord, you would faine governe your ſelfe, according to the
greatneſſe of your ſtout ſpirit, which at this preſent ought to reſigne
its government to your perſon, that may not be otherwiſe ruled than
according to your preſent indiſpoſition; you well know and feele
what prejudice you have got thereby already; I pray you thinke on
it, that it may ſerve you for a warning, to dehort you from incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
againe into the like inconvenience. My indiſpoſition is not ſuch
as you take it for, neither doth any toile prevaile over any tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or eaſe that I have beene formerly uſed unto; Have but a little
patience, and when the Chirurgians condeſcend that you may
(without danger) get up, then will I alſo bee therewith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Whilſt thus with reiterated ſupplications <hi>Polimero</hi> endevored to
obtaine his requeſt, there entred into the tent <hi>Caraſio</hi> with a Currier
come from <hi>Porto di Torra,</hi> who kneeling downe before the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi>
delivered her a letter, which opened, ſhe found to be the <hi>Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>
and contained the newes of the victory, obtained againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
with the conqueſt of fifteene Galleyes; which chanced him
by the aid of one Galley, commanded by a moſt noble Knight.
And that now he was reſolved (having arm'd foure Galleyes of
thoſe fifteene he had taken, and reinforced the reſt) to aſſaile (with
the aſſiſtance of that other Galley) <hi>Epicamedo's Armado</hi> at <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuova;</hi>
whereof hee would render an account to her Highneſſe,
whom hee beſought to charge the enemie by land, in the ſelfeſame
time, if it ſeemed good to her Highneſſe ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> having read this letter, gave it <hi>Polimero;</hi> and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the Councell of warre, cauſed it to be reade unto them,
who approved of the opinion of the <hi>Vice-Admirall.</hi> And becauſe
the ſea was about two and twenty miles thence diſtant, there were
placed many Centrees along the mountaine towards <hi>Caſtrodeſen,</hi>
who (as ſoone as they ſaw the Fleete appeare and aſſaile the <hi>Corſan
Armado</hi>) were to give a ſignall, with ſmoke in ſeverall places; which
was performed with ſuch ſecrecie, that no man knew it, except the
Councell, and him that (ſtanding Centree at the ſea) might ſerve to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7477:56"/>
give all the reſt directions; nor was there any danger of his falling
into the hands of the enemie, becauſe the <hi>Sardan</hi> horſe was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> (when the Councell was gone) turned towards the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
ſaying, Alas, and will your Highneſſe doe me this ſhame, to
let me lie lulled here amongſt the feathers in ſuch an occaſion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
when others toile themſelves abroad in the field? Not I by
any meanes, (anſwered the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) ſo that the Chirurgians permit
you but to goe abroad; and as ſhe would have ſpoken on, in came the
Chirurgians to dreſſe him, who were ſo favourable towards him in
their opinions, that the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was contented hee ſhould get
him up.</p>
               <p>Much was <hi>Polimero</hi> troubled in minde, ever fithence he had reade
the <hi>Vice-Admirals</hi> letter, wondering with himſelfe, what, or who
might be that moſt noble Knight therein mentioned. On this, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
already crept into his imagination began full cruelly to ſting
him, making him beleeve that it was ſome <hi>Prince,</hi> who (moved with
the fame of <hi>Eromena</hi>) was come thither of purpoſe to ſerve her.
And becauſe his heart was tortured with the paſſion he felt, therefore
he reſolved rather to die than endure to have any rivall; ſo eaſily is
humane wit altered, when it is once raviſhed with its affections: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he who before breath'd forth nought elſe but vertue, now
ſtung with the Serpent of amorous envy (for ſuch was his (though
unreaſonable) being that he neither ſaw his favours participated, nor
any perſon partakeable of them) he ſuffered himſelfe to be guided
with the falſe imagination of having a rivall, till the day wherein he
was cleared of that doubt, with no ſmall amazement and griefe of
<hi>Eromena;</hi> who on the other ſide raved therefore, beleeving that his
minde (ſurpriſed by ſome new thought) had fully alienated from
her his affection. And ſo indeede ſeemed it to be, he wanting art to
diſſemble his paſſions; which concealed, though not diſguiſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the judgement, that tooke the one for the other: ſo as if <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
were therein miſtaken, yet was ſhe not to be therefore blamed,
becauſe <hi>Polimero</hi> an experienced youth, reaſoned with himſelfe on
this buſineſſe, as if ſhe had beene faultie, and as if her beauties and
good parts ought not to have had the force of attracting other than
him alone; in ſo much as he became fretfull, and pettiſh, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
her but with troubled browes, manifeſt expreſſers of
more troubled thoughts: whilſt ſhee that paſſionately loved him
(knowing what little reckoning he made of his wounds) could by no
meanes imagine what might be the cauſe of ſo ſuddaine an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whereof ſhe conceived ſuch a griefe as pierc'd through her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſoule. She therefore deſirous to be reſolved thereof, conducted
him aſide towards the trenches (under pretext of finding out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place to aſſaile the forts) where (after a ſhort diſcourſe
of what might there be done, and ſeeing him poſſeſſed with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
deſire of combating) ſhe ſaid unto him,</p>
               <p>My Lord, I would not by any meanes, that the greatneſſe of your
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7477:56"/>
courage ſhould any way prejudice your health, I well perceive you
much altered, ſithence you left your bed, the reaſon whereof cannot
poſſibly be, other than the feeling of your ſelf not well; which if it be
ſo, I pray you let me know it, aſſuring you that I have a greater ſhare
than you beleeve in your ſufferings: And I proteſt unto you, that if
your wounds endanger you, by reaſon of a re-lapſe (as ſome dayes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
they did) I ſhall be therewith diſpleaſed, and ſhal judge it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
done me by you. <hi>Polimero,</hi> who well underſtood what it was
to be a ſharer in his ſufferings, and what ſignified the declaration of
her diſpleaſure; dying his cheeks with a faire vermilion, and become
fully conſolated, returned her this anſwer; I yeeld your highnes hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thanks, for vouchſafing to take care of my health; which (among
many other your noble favours) manifeſts how deepely I am engaged
unto you; and could I but fully aſſure your Highneſſe of what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
unto you, I aſſure my ſelfe that your Highneſſe would reſt
ſatisfied with my reverent gratitude. As for my hurts, your Highneſſe
needes not doubt of them, my wounds being now growne to a good
paſſe; but if you ſee me malecontent, I think I have good cauſe ſo to be
for to tel you the truth, it liks me not wel, that any other come to rob
us of the glory of this war; and had your Highnes but given me leave
when firſt I beſought you for it, I aſſure my ſelfe that we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
<hi>Epicamedo</hi> either to returne or die, ere any other came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of his army, and mee of the honour of doeing my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
duty. <hi>Eromena</hi> by her acuteneſſe of apprehenſion, ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Polimero's</hi> drift, whereof ſhe was very joyfull, well knowing
that jelouſie in its limits, is a daughter of love: wherefore ſhe ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; Let not (I pray you) what hath hapned diſpleaſe you, which
ſhall (I aſſure you) be for your greater conſolation and honour; the
comming of any other ſhal neither deprive you of that honour which
your valorous actions deſerve, nor me of the obligation which I ſhall
ever owe you therefore, more than to any Knight of the world, how
great or worthy ſoever he be; whereof aſſure your ſelfe, and live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly,
if the being therof aſſur'd have any power to make you ſuch.
Hereupon <hi>Polimero</hi> gently took her by the hand, which ſhe liberally
reached out unto him (&amp; affectionately kiſſing it) remained the joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
man living: with great deſire ſtood he expecting the ſignall of
ſmoak, which the day following appearing, made the <hi>Sardans</hi> give an
<hi>all-arme,</hi> though few of them underſtood the meaning therof; which
<hi>Epicamedo</hi> ſeeing, knew not what to thinke, but perceiving them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three ſquadrons, and advancing forwards to come and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
his forts, he alſo cauſed for their defence, an <hi>allarme</hi> to be beaten.
But <hi>Polimero,</hi> who was of opinion, that to aſſaile the forts was loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and that it wold prove the better courſe to make on, &amp; become
maſters of thetents, if they could (for the forts left alone unſuccour'd,
would afterwards fall of themſelves) wheeld about a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe;
and then cauſing all his troope to alight, hee aſſaulted the
trenches on the reare parts thereof ſuddenly, and with ſuch a furie,
that he forced the guard thereof, and was himſelfe the firſt man that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7477:57"/>
entred, where leaving to make good the front a ſtrong ſquadron of
horſemen, though a-foote, he with the reſt remounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
beating downe all hee met; wherein hee found no great
difficultie, becauſe there were no horſe to withſtand him (they
being iſſued forth with the King together with the greateſt part of
the armie to defend that part, where the aſſault was moſt likely to be
given:) and ſo in leſſe than an houres ſpace, became maſter of all the
Tents.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> on the other ſide (as ſoone as by the cries ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the troopes to bee in a hot conflict) ſpurr'd on-wards; till
(paſſing betweene Fort and Fort) followed by her force, ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
<hi>Epicamedo,</hi> who making head with thoſe few horſes he had,
not able to hold out long, was forc'd to retire himſelfe, cauſing a
ſquadron of pikes to ſet forwards in firme battell-array: By whom
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſeeing her ſelfe oppoſed, cauſed hers to advance, who
(after a ſmall reſiſtance) put the enemie to rout for want of horſe.
Then <hi>Eromena</hi> (diſdaining to beſmeare her hands with the bloud of
the vulgar) went ſearching for <hi>Epicamedo,</hi> who having underſtood
how the Tents were ſet upon, was runne to their ſuccour, leaving in
his ſtead the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Sagona:</hi> Whereupon ſhe (having ſelected
a troope of the choiſeſt horſe, and left the reſt to the charge of the
<hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno</hi>) purſuing him eagerly, found that <hi>Polimero</hi>
(after he had taken the Tents) was come forth to charge <hi>Epicamedo;</hi>
who had with him but a ſmall Battalion of horſe, not amounting to
ſix hundred; but all of them of the prime Nobilitie of <hi>Corſica,</hi> his
greateſt confidence being in his foote that failed him; for when
they ſaw the Tents taken, the enemie victorious in the front, and
now come to charge them in the flancke (themſelves being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
diſordered, and the greateſt part without any pikes for having
burſt them in the former incounter) growne quite heartleſſe, they
ſought to ſave themſelves by flight: ſo as being for their better way
of eſcape divided, they were (for the moſt part) ſlaine, whilſt
the King skirmifhing with <hi>Polimero,</hi> and hurt in the hand and
flancke, was forc'd to yeeld himſelfe. Of the ſix hundred horſe
eſcaped but a few, who flying towards the Fleete with hope to
ſave themſelves, were met by thoſe that were comming to bring
newes of its loſſe, and then being all ſcattered abroad ſome in
in one place and ſome in another, they were by the Peaſants rob'd
and killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> (having laid the King in ſure hold) ran under the Forts,
where the fight was yet maintained; but the <hi>Corſes</hi> (not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any longer, nor having any place of retreite) throwing
downe their armes, yeelded themſelves, the greateſt part of
them being already ſlaine in the firſt hot skirmiſh; and the
Forts (after they had ſtood as ſpectators of the ſlaughter of their
men, and impriſonment of their King) yeelded themſelves over
into the mercy of the vanquiſhers. Thus were the Tents taken, the
Forts rendred, aſſaulted, and won in leſſe than two houres ſpace. And
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7477:57"/>
now <hi>Eromena,</hi> deſirous to ſee what fortune had done with the Fleete
at ſea (leaving all the foote to repoſe themſelves) taking along with
het <hi>Polimero</hi> and two thouſand horſe, ſet her ſelfe on her way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Terranova.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metancone</hi> uſed ſuch diligence in this voyage, that (without helpe
of any winde) he in one nights ſpace compaſſed about all <hi>Capo Luo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godori</hi>
to <hi>Terranova,</hi> being little leſſe than a hundred and twenty
miles, where he found the <hi>Corſes</hi> without ſuſpition, and had found
them alſo buried in ſleepe, without either watch or ward, had not
the Fleete as it paſſed by <hi>Capo di Sarda,</hi> beene deſcried; he found them
with armes in their hands, not becauſe they made account to fight,
but onely to obſerve the termes of martiall diſcipline: They tooke
theſe Galleyes to be their owne, returning (as they thought) victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and the two over and beſides the fifteene, to be prizes taken
away from the enemie; the rather becauſe the three lanternes were
not borne by their Admirall; but when they deſcried the colours
of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> and on the Royall thoſe of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> they knew not
what courſe to take: flie away they could not, becauſe their ladders
were a-ſhore their hatches out of order, and ſome of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſht
with oares; ſo as being aſſaulted, there was more adoe to
kill than to conquer them; and ſuch of them as eſcaped a-ſhore,
met with the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> and were taken priſoners. <hi>Metaneone</hi> ſeeing
the enterprize ſo well ſucceede, was very glad thereof, and long'd
for with impatience the long-wiſh'd for fruition of his brothers
company, comming ſtealingly towards him, wiſhed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
for that he had deſcried many troopes of horſe, which could be
no other than the enemies, ſeeing they came from that part of the
field whereof they were Maſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> (thus ſurprizd) knew not what to reſolve of, thinking
it a ſhame to retire, aud a deſperate danger to ſtay their comming;
When the <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> ſaid thus unto him, I cannot beleeve that
theſe are enemies; or if they be, I am ſure they have but a few horſe,
wherewith they can doe us no great harme: howſoever as it is not
fit we leave the Galleys unmann'd, ſo is it not any diſcredit or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for us to retire untill we be better aſſured of the matter: let us
therefore (if you pleaſe) retire every man to his charge. The
<hi>Prince</hi> thereupon (ſeeing the <hi>Count de Bona</hi> of the ſelfeſame opinion)
made a faire retteite, cauſing the Archers to ſtand ready at the
loope-holes, and all the reſt with their armes in hand. But no ſooner
appeared thoſe horſe in ſight, than the <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi> knew the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
by her Banner, and <hi>Metaneone</hi> his brother by <hi>Flammauro.</hi> Being
then ſorry hee had retired, he came a-ſhore from the Galley, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the <hi>Count de Bona,</hi> and all the other Knights.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> and <hi>Polimero</hi> never lin gallopping till they came to the
haven: where the firſt man of all the fleete that <hi>Polimero</hi> knew, was the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> his governour, and then next his brother; whereat with
a ſhril voice he ſudenly ſeritch'd out, Oh ye gods what is this I ſee?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7477:58"/>
The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (ſeeing that ſomething ailed him) asked him what was
the matter? Nothing <hi>Madam</hi> (anſwered he) but that I cannot
imagine what this <hi>Prince</hi> makes here. And whilſt ſhe was asking him
what <hi>Prince</hi> that was (without getting any anſwer of <hi>Polimero,</hi> who
remained as yet aſtoniſhed) they were come to the place where hee
was. <hi>Eromena</hi> perceiving <hi>Metaneone</hi> comming to meet her, hearing
him ſtil'd <hi>Prince,</hi> lighted off her horſe, to whom <hi>Metaneone</hi> drew
neere to kiſſe her hand, which ſhee not permitting, and he not
perſiſting in his offer (as a courteous Knight ſhould have done) but
running (as if hee had beene beſides himſelfe) to <hi>Polimero,</hi> hee
ſtraightly embraced him, ſaying, And will you (my ſweete bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
be perpetually mindfull of my foule fault? What, will you
abjure nature, and for one diſcourteous brothers ſake, abandon a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
father that tenders you ſo dearely? Behold me here in token
of repentance, deſiring your pardon; I beſeech you forgive me:
Suffice it you, that the knowledge of an error is a ſufficient puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a generous heart; if ſuch you can but thinke mine to be, that
haveſo undeſervedly offended you. But (my deareſt beſt of brothers)
doe but conſider how all things have their time; the wrongs are
done and paſt, the repentance is now preſent, and the penance
ſhall bee to ſerve you, now when my ſervice is not acceptable unto
you; which if it were or could be, I ſhould eſteeme it a great honour
unto me. Theſe his words were accompanied with teares ſo lively,
that (whilſt he on the one ſide embraced him, and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi>
on the other ſide kiſſed his hands, and wept over him like a child)
the ſtanders by were forced to beare them company in doing the
ſame, though altogether ignorant of the myſterie of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> at the firſt, knowing his brother and his diſpoſition, could
not chuſe but doubt of ſome evill intention; but afterwards ſeeing him
come in ſuch a faſhion and ſpeake unto him in ſuch a manner, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
beſides with the <hi>Count</hi> whom he wel knew would not deceive
him, ſtriving to unhelme himſelf but could not (ſo tranſported was he
with the overmuch haſte he made, and of the ſtrange commotion of
his affections (having lifted up his beaver, he taking his brothers hand;
would needs kiſſe it, with no leſſe reſpective humilitie, and humble
reſpectiveneſſe, than he would have uſed towards his Royall father.
But <hi>Metaneone</hi> more and more affectionately embracing him, and
cloſing his face to the viſard, could not ſatiate himſelfe in kiſſing
him, not affording him leaſure to ſpeak a word, much leſſe to anſwer.
<hi>Caraſio</hi> ſeeing what his Maſter would faine have done, help'd him
off with his helme; whereof <hi>Polimero</hi> being freed ran againe to kiſſe
his brothers hand, and he in the meane time with affectionate embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
claſped him ſo cloſely, as it was unpoſſible for him to ſpeake
a word, untill at laſt, quite wearied with kiſſing and weeping, they
were faine to defiſt. When <hi>Polimero</hi> after a ſhort pauze turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his brother, ſaid;</p>
               <p>My Lord, I know not how I have merited ſo much of the gods, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7477:58"/>
to be (for ought I ſee) received into your gracious favour; I will not
flatter my ſelfe in beleeving that I deſerve it, but beleeve rather that
your goodnes mov'd to pitty my youth, hath bin pleaſed to exceede
all exceſſe of courteſie, by receiving me in the degree of ſuch a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſervant as my duty binds to be, and of ſo obedient a brother as
nature made me. I beſeech you vouch ſafe to concede me onely the
firſt attribute, in your eſteeme, and that ſhall content me; ſo that
your Highneſſe would be pleaſed to accept in good worth the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of my good will, excuſing the weakeneſſe of my yeares, which
have given your Highneſſe occaſion to be diſpleaſed with me: but
of my willingneſſe to deſerve your Highneſſe favour, let (I beſeech
you) my voluntarie exile, and my choiſe of going unaccompanied
(to avoid your Highneſſe diſpleaſure) be an aſſured token: for the
reſt I ſubmit my ſelfe to your good will and pleaſure, being moſt
ready to doe whatſoever you ſhall pleaſe to command me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone,</hi> that had converted his former hatred into the moſt
perfect affectionate and trueſt friendſhip that could poſſibly be found
in any brother of the world, embracing him anew, ſaid unto him;
Oh peace, peace, my deare <hi>Polimero,</hi> it becomes not you to ſpeake in
this ſort, for the witneſſes that teſtifie againſt me are without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and above all, my owne conſcience. I am not come with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to grant you pardon, but of purpoſe to begge and receive it
from you, ſo that you then forgive me, I ſhall thinke I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the greateſt part of the happineſſe I wiſh to enjoy in this
world.</p>
               <p>Faine would they have exceeded, when the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
them) ſaid to the <hi>Prince;</hi> No more, (my Lord) no more.
My Lord, the <hi>Inſante Polimero</hi> cannot brooke to ſee the perſon of
your Highneſſe ſo ſubmiſſive; neither neede you doubt that his
good nature is any whit mindfull of what is done and paſt. Which
ſaid, he (taking againe the hands of <hi>Polimero</hi>) kiſſed them with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> that ſtood all this while an amazed ſpectatreſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(the meane while) cauſed her helme to be unlaced, ſaid to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneone;</hi>
(Worthy <hi>Prince</hi>) I beſeech you give me leave to interrupt
your joyes, we can no longer forbeare to know who you are, as well
that we may thereby come to know what this Knight alſo is, (who
having done as ſuch notable ſervice would never hitherunto oblige
us with his name;) as alſo that we may honour you conformable to
the merits both of your noble perſon, and of the favours you have
done us; which ſaid, ſhe withdrew him aſide from the reſt, whilſt
<hi>Polimero</hi> went againe to embrace the <hi>Count</hi> and to entertaine the
<hi>Mauritanian Cavaliers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> related orderly unto the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> all that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him and his brother, and how his father had charged him to
bring him backe againe: which when the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> heard, ſhe thought
her former joyes but bitter now, that ſhe underſtood her lover to be
a <hi>Prince,</hi> waxing ſo pale thereat, that the apprehenſive <hi>Prince</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7477:59"/>
it, ſaid on; My charge was indeede not to returne without him;
but in reſpect I ſee what warres your Highneſſe is like to have in
your Kingdome, and withall for that (me thinkes) I ſee that my
brother hath beene fortunate in your Highneſſe ſervice, I will finde
a way to content my father without taking him hence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> having by this time recovered her ſpirits, well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the acuteneſſe of the <hi>Prince</hi> his apprehenſion, which though it
made her bluſh, yet was ſhe not thereat diſpleaſed; but entertained
him with all ſuch gentle termes, as beſt became a courteous Lady
to uſe towards a deſerving <hi>Prince;</hi> hoping to finde him a co-adjutor
and furtherer of her deſires: And then turning towards <hi>Polimero;</hi> Is
it thus (ſaid ſhe) that you deale with yourfriends; My Lord <hi>Infante
Polimero;</hi> in not ſuffering your ſelfe to be knowne, thereby to loade
me with ſhame for not having honoured you conformable to your
birth and qualitie? Whereto he (all joyfull) made anſwer, (Right
excellent <hi>Princeſſe;</hi>) Too too much have I beene honoured by your
Highneſſe, I would it pleaſed the gods, that you thought me worthy
but of ſome part thereof. Whereupon ſhe taking him by the hand,
(and joying together for the arrivall of the <hi>Prince</hi> his brother) wrung
it amorouſly, and he againe affectionately kiſſed hers, to his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great content.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> afterwards and all the reſt, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the manner of taking both the Fleetes, went to renew their
complements with <hi>Metaneone,</hi> confeſſing the warre to be brought to
an end by the valour of theſe two brothers.</p>

(ſomewhat incommodated) in
<hi>Terranova,</hi> whence ſhe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno</hi>
how the Fleete was taken; (and
in regard her comming thither
was unexpected, and her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
proviſion as then not
arrived from the Campe,)
<hi>Metaneone</hi> perſwaded her to
ſup with him in his Galley,
which he cauſed to launch out
of the haven with the ſweete
conſort of his trumpets, at the pleaſing harmony whereof, the
Ghing rowed ſo mainely, as they made her in leſſe than an houres
ſpace out-ſtrippe her fellow Galleys (which were the <hi>Vice-Admirall</hi>
with three others of the choiceſt of the whole Fleete) leaving them
(to the wonder of every one) above three miles a-poope of her.
Much adoe had the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> to ſatiate her eyes in beholding the rare
beautie of the Veſſell, with the rich curioſitie of her hangings and
furniture, which farre exceeded thoſe of many royall Palaces.</p>
               <p>It was now Summer-ſeaſon, and the calme-ſea was from the
ſhore-ward courted with a gentle breath of aire, whilſt the ſea-ſtrond
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7477:60"/>
and winding creeks of the Iland, afforded the eye a ſpacious and
delightſome proſpect. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (in the meane while) was
ſerved with ſuch exquiſite diverſitie of banquets, as that ſhe ſeemed
to be in a dreame; ſo ſtrangely was ſhe amazed in obſerving the
abundant quantitie, and rare qualitie thereof, together with the
richneſſe of the plate, and order of ſervice in a Galley at ſea. And to
the <hi>Sardans</hi> the wine (above any thing elſe) ſeemed excellent,
who now perceived themſelves deceived in the opinion, they til then
held, that their white-wines were the beſt and richeſt of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>prince</hi> had for his pleaſure divers kinds of ſtrange creatures,
which <hi>Affricke</hi> is continually and daily accuſtomed to produce;
wherewith the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was exceedingly delighted, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tane, were very gentle and tractable, and euery one in his kinde
manifeſted by his geſture the diverſitie of his temperature, wherein
Nature diſcovereth the treaſures of her providence.</p>
               <p>It grew towards night, when intending to returne, they deſcried
(not very farre off them) ſomething that floted on the ſea; which
ſuch as at firſt tooke it for a fiſh, perceived it to be none, for that it
dived not but ſtood ſtill, without turning, either for the noiſe of the
oares, or voice of men. The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who (taking pleaſure to looke
all about) was the firſt that ſaw it, would needs know what it might
be, and therefore cauſing to row gently towards it, ere they came
to touch it with their oares, ſhe perceived it was a woman, who faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handing
a little plancke, floted on the ſea. The Frigat (which ſtood
neere the <hi>Royall,</hi> and that for ſwiftneſſe was not her inferiour) went
to fetch her aboord, where they found, for ſubject to their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
an exquiſite bcautie that in her they ſaw, with the evident
ſymptoms of a miſerable fortune; pale was ſhe, and leane, hare-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and bare-legged, with her feete ſorely bruiſed, and full of gags
and ſcarres. Mong'ſt theſe ſo rue-full conditions, there ſhined in her
face a royall Majeſtie, and in her dying eyes a pitty, able to cauſe to
moane the very Tigers themſelves. There covered her ſnow-white
bodie (which by her alablaſter legges and ivory armes, might eaſily
be judged to be ſuch) a courſe gowne of ſhippes ruſſet freeze, made
careleſly without any order, juſt like one of thoſe, wherewith ſtatues
are ſometimes wont to bee covered withall: hardly could they
make her let goe her hold of the plancke, becauſe, when danger,
travell and faſting had bereaved her of her underſtanding; then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which in ſuch occaſions failes not, had forc'd her vitall ſpirits
into her hands and fingers; ſo as now freed from perill, and not
comprehending it, ſhe continued her holdfaſt without ſlacking it any
thing, following altogether the inſtinct that governed her, being not
able to follow reaſon, which ſhe wanted, becauſe ſhe wanted the
more ignoble part, which was the ſenſe. There was none ſo flintie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
as not to pittie ſo compaſſionable a ſpectacle; but farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who having cauſed her to be laid on a bed, was
carefull to ſee her dri'd by her truſty damſell <hi>Aretia.</hi> Who not like a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7477:60"/>
waiting woman, but like a diligent Squire followed her Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever abandoning her for feare of any danger how perillous
ſoever; ſhe dried, rub'd and chafed her, ſo as her revoked ſpirits
return'd by little and little to their proper reſidences, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the miſerable weake one; who ſeeing her ſelfe in ſuch a
place, knew not what to imagine; ſhe peer'd ſtedfaſtly on the two
ſtanders by, her mouth ſhee opened, but ſpake never a word; in
being ſilent ſhe ſpake, and yet in ſpeaking ſhe uttered never a ſyllable,
tormented with agitations of minde, the more grievous, for that the
body oppreſſed with long ſufferings, lay as if it had beene deprived
both of life and ſenſes. The firſt things that came to life in her were
ſighs and ſobs; and next teares, which being not ſufficient to exhale
and evaporate the heavineſſe of her heart, would faine be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a kinde of a voice not ſhreeking or diſpleaſing, but moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and wailefull, able to move the very ſtones to pitty. The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
(who with her damzell were all that were of her ſex among all
that company) would needs be a ſole co-adjutor in this charitable
office, having for modeſties ſake excluded all the reſt; and calling
for ſome cordials and reſtoratives, gave them her with her owne
hand, comforting her, entreating her, and courteouſly compelling
her to take them; becauſe no one meanes alone was ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her, neither had altogether prevailed with her, but that fixing
her eyes on the royall ſhe-warrier, ſhe became aſtoniſht at her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and behaviour, which perſwaded, and (as it were) conſtrained
her to obey her; little are ſhe, when having recovered a little vigor,
ſhe turning towards the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> with a feeble voice ſcarce audible,
ſaid thus unto her;</p>
               <p>I know not (faire one) what you may be, whether a woman or a
goddeſſe, if a goddeſſe, then know you well that pittie is ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on me, and that it were true commiſeration not to give, but
to take away the feeling of my griefes: but if a woman, let me then
tell you, that the having uſed it to me-wards, hath beene a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
as in me nature it ſelfe was more cruell in procuring my eſcape,
and I moſt cruell againſt my ſelfe for following her inſtincts; which
ſaid, ſhe (become clay-cold) remained in ſuch a plight, that for a
good while ſhe ſeemed to be rather dead than alive.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who by her ſpeeches (which ofttimes are expreſſe
ſignes of inward conceits) conceived to be in this woman ſome (of
I know not what) kinde of worth and ſingularitie, having cald for
vineger and odoriferous waters, ceaſed not to uſe her uttermoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
with affectionate care to revive her againe, which quickly
ſucceeded as ſhee deſired; and ſeeing her come againe to her ſelfe,
though little better in the reſt of her organs and members, onely ſhe
ſtrove to get up to come to kiſſe her hands; the courteous <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
(holding her downe, and inceſſantly beſprinkling her with thoſe
waters) ſpake thus unto her;</p>
               <p>Alacke (good ſoule) Leave off I pray you all other thoughts, but
ſuch as concerne your ſelfe, courteſies in you are now out of ſeaſon,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7477:61"/>
neither is there any one here that lookes for any ſuch, which though
there were, yet might ſuch be well ſatisfied with your willingneſſe,
which in you appeares not otherwiſe reſiſting than againſt your ſelfe
and your owne good. Be comforted, I pray you, and reſolve with
your ſelfe to live; for albeit your afflictions be great (as I imagine
them to be by the condition wherein I found you;) nevertheleſſe
ought you by all means be conſolated; good and evill ſtand not
alwayes in the ſame limits; that evill is onely deplorable that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
remedileſſe, and in ſuch a caſe neceſſitie ſhould comfort us;
fortune (Siſter) is unſtable, and her wheele voluble, ſo as we ought
the rather preſume to looke for good, being in an ill caſe, than on
the contrary; for as good cannot attaine to exceſſe, ſo can it not bee
either long or ſtable; and the exceſſe of evils, as it is eaſily encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
ſo is it alſo as eaſily diverted, it being a ſting that ſo long laſts,
as the maligne aſpects endure, which as they increaſe in their exceſſe,
ſo decreaſe they in their receſſe, and with its mutation change them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a better aſpect. The ſicke woman, who with great attention
had liſtned unto her (fetching a deepe ſigh) return'd her this anſwer.</p>
               <p>Alas (Valorous Lady) what dolefull conſolations are theſe for me;
grounded on a foundation as ſandy as are conſtellations. But, if
what you inferre, bee true; What then (I pray you) is the reaſon,
that few are the fortunate, and innumerable the unfortunate in the
world, who withall ever remaine ſuch? Or if they aſſay mutation,
yet is it not ſubſtantiall, but onely ſomewhat extenuated from more
to leſſe. How many are there that live in continuall poverty? How
many in perpetuall impriſonment? How many are there that are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetable
in all kinde of miſery, whom (in regard of the infiniteneſſe of
the number) I neede not ſpecifie? And yet in them may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
many acceſſes and fits of evill, but never a period of any, for
they never feele its receſſe, although the heavens goe round to them
as well as to others, neither goe the ſtarres ſlower for theſe than for
thoſe. And as touching what you ſay of good and proſperitie, It is
ture, that there is nothing more ſlippery and flickering, nay ſuch is it
of its owne nature, as it cannot make it ſelfe enjoyable; the paſſions
of the minde make it leſſe delightſome and imperfect, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied (as it ever is) with cares and feares, whereby it
doth not onely leſſen, but growes not to be what it is taken to bee;
where (on the contrary) the deſire to continue or rather to goe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in proſperitie, augments our diſcontents; which infuſed into
us by the imagination, ſpring up ſucceſſively like ill weedes in a good
foile, without either tillage or ſeede, thriving the better in the more
tempeſtuous weather, and becomming perpetuall from ſeaſon to
ſeaſon, bountifully repaying the earth an hundred for one, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
thereby its being farre more liberall than juſt, and a better
friend to it ſelfe than to other mens labours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> aſtoniſhed at her diſcourſe, would faine egge her on
a little further, for the better diſcovering among obſcurities ſo
palpable, the cleereneſſe of an elevated capacitie; wherefore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7477:61"/>
ſhe ſaid unto her; The cauſe (ſiſter mine) of our errour in beleeving
that evill hath a greater ſtroke over us than good, proceeds from
our owne paſſions, as you your ſelfe have confeſeſſed; though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of themſelves they bee of equall weight. The palat is more
digeſted with the bitter than pleaſed with the ſweete, though of its
proper nature it love and affect the latter; the reaſon is, becauſe our
ſenſes make us more ſenſible of ill than good, which if wee conſider
rightly, we ſhall have no reaſon to complaine of nature, which made
not contraries with proportion more contrary in the one than in the
other. The blacke is no more blacke, than the white is white; albeit
the one is diſcerned better than the other, not for any defect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie,
but by reaſon of the qualitie of the eye, that is more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to receive the impreſſion of the one than of the other; the
Sunne (likewiſe) which for his brightneſſe ſhould bee more apt
to bee ſeene, is nevertheleſſe (for a like reaſon) leſſe ſeene. If then
it bee ſo (as moſt aſſured it is) Why then comfort you not your
ſelfe now that you are certaine of having paſſed the period of
your evils, by the eſcaping of death, the extremeſt point of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery?
So as neceſſarily your misfortune declining, it's malignite
in the receſſe prepares for you in his change argument of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſeeing that changes are no other than mutation of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
you ought to ſuppoſe that it muſt needs bee from bad to
good.</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>Madame,</hi> (anſwered the woman weeping) conſider I pray
you that reaſon and ſenſe cannot be weighed with equall weights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
reaſon is either ſo fleeting, as ſhe will not ſuffer us eaſily to lay
hold on her, or elſe light and wavering, if ſhee chance to be formed
by uſe or opinion. But the ſenſe being weightie and of certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
remaines active, and deceives not, unleſſe it ſelfe be begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by ſome alteration: well ſaid you, that ſo ſhould I doe, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
ſo would I faine doe; but firſt make you theſe ſcales even (if
you can) by giving mee either ſo much reaſon as ſenſe, or elſe no
more ſenſe than reaſon, and then will I both obey you, and comfort
my ſelfe. But (woe is me) it is their irreconcileable diſparitie that
makes my miſerable eſtate inconſolable in that the practiſe of the
Theoricke is in them too too different; the one being more eaſie to
an eloquent tongue, than the other to the ſtouteſt heart, when it
ſhall have occaſion to put it in practiſe. Now as touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
and period of my evils; know (moſt noble Lady) that if men
could content themſelves with food onely, as doe the wilde beaſts,
then might the argument be good; for you (of your commiſeration)
having freed me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, which was the period of evill; (me thinks)
reaſon tels me, that I am now in its receſſe, for that the way of life
is opened unto me: but too too miſerable is our condition to bee
contented to live onely, and to live to our ſelves alone; there is none
but knowes that we muſt live for others alſo, neither ſay I onely as
he, who held that we are borne to our Countrey and friends, but
I hereto adde that we are likewiſe borne to our owne affections, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7477:62"/>
among them above all to honour, which ſubſiſting of an unknowne
and delicate element, receives its influence from the courſe of the
more delicate ſpheares, which conjoyned to theſe materials, are in
the point of their period diverſe in qualitie, even as mine are; ſo as
the receſſe of ill in the one is the receſſe of honour in the other: How
then can one live in the receſſe of ill, with the hope of the acceſſe of
good, when the receſſe of honor engenders the acceſſe of infamy, that
ſtands in the oppoſite point? But to ſpeak with your own principles,
you (<hi>Madame</hi>) well know, that it is not one ſole aſpect that makes us
become miſerable, but our meeting afterwards with other new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
in the way of theirprog reſſions; &amp; the being of the maligne ſtars
(which the learned call the Infortunate) of ſuperior ſituation, and by
conſequence heavier and ſlower, which being in ſome ſort intricated
with the fixed, that are ſloweſt of all, are never more diſinveloped,
but accompanie our few dayes with infinite evils; which being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by death, and deprived of all power of hurting us in a life
freed from their fetters, purſue us nevertheeleſſe to our very graves,
with an abominable and ignominious fame; which i ſay not becauſe
I beleeve it to be ſo indeede, but becauſe that who ſo gives thoſe
principles credit will be induced to beleeve no otherwiſe. And I
(for my part) cannot chuſe but ſubſcribe to the opinion of ſuch as
beleeve, that the fates and conſtellations are no other thing than the
providence of the gods, whereunto if I now truſted not more than
I doe to the celeſtiall figures, I ſhould utterly deſpaire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (obſerving her to ſpeake with much paine and great
perplexiti of minde) thought it not good to trouble her any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
albeit ſhe much deſired to know both her, and the originall of
her misfortunes, the rather becauſe ſhe well diſcerned in her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſignes of no ordinary perſon; leaving therefore <hi>Aretia</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
her, ſhe returned to the <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom ſhe related
what diſcourſe ſhe had with her, expreſſing her ſelfe to be gladder of
this prize than of that of both the Fleets. They lodged themſelves
in <hi>Terranova</hi> as well as they could, where the ſicke woman was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
looked unto, and lodged as commodiouſly as the ſtraightneſſe
of the place would permit, who by meanes, either of the Phyſitians,
or of comfortable repoſe recovered together with her ſtrength, her
before exiled beauty.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> continued with the weake woman, the two
brothers had time to conferre together, where <hi>Metaneone</hi> informed
his brother of all that paſt betweene him and his father, and how he
was by him ſent to finde him out, whom therefore he once intended
to have conducted homewards; but perceiving (as he thought) in
that <hi>Princeſſe</hi> probable ſignes of an exceſſive love towards him, and
conſidering withall how the tie of honour ſtraightly obliged him to
deferre his departure thence, till the warres were ended, he knew
not what courſe he were beſt to reſolve of; howbeit he held his owne
returne neceſſarie, becauſe he was to intreate his father to demand for
him a wife (and there related he unto his brother all the ſtory of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7477:62"/>
                  <hi>Eromilia</hi>) yet knew he not well how he could go home without him.
And that on the other ſide in procuring him to returne with him,
he ſhould doe very ill, for that he might thereby marre his fortune,
and hinder his advancement, which hee ought rather by all meanes
to further and procure, not onely for the gaining him ſuch and ſo
great a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> but alſo for that when himſelfe had obtained <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi>
they might betweene them make (as it were) but one ſtate of
<hi>Mauritania, Sardegna</hi> and <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and ſo become awed of all
their bordering neighbours.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> (perceiving the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> comming) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
their diſcourſe; and aſſoone as they came a-ſhore, counſelled
them both to abide in <hi>Sardegna,</hi> undertaking to be himſelfe the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
of their commiſſions, not doubting but that the King
would be for that time contented to know that they loved one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
of whom he promiſed them to procure for the <hi>Prince</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage
for <hi>Maiorica,</hi> and for the <hi>Infante</hi> troopes of aide for <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degna,</hi>
wherewith he might (for the furtherance of his marriage
with <hi>Eromena</hi>) conquer the kingdome of <hi>Corſica,</hi> who alſo (now
that he was knowne for a <hi>Prince</hi>) ſhould in the meane time endeavour
to bring his loves to a determined end. Of this propoſition the <hi>Prince</hi>
liked well, deſiring it might bee ſuddenly put in execution; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
both of them wrote to their father conformably, as well of the
friendſhip confirmed betweene them, as alſo of the reaſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
them to ſtay ſome-time in <hi>Sardegna,</hi> and withall of the
neede they had of being favoured by his Majeſtie, in what ſhould
by the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> (to whom they wholly referred themſelves)
be manifeſted unto him more at large: to the ſame effect wrote they
likewiſe to their mother, ſiſters, and brothers; telling afterwards
the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> that they, being reſolved to ſerve her in thoſe warres,
thought good to acquaint therewith the King their father, to the
end that he might not grieve, in that he ſaw them not returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
whither they meant to ſend for that end the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi>
whom they beſought her Highneſſe to honour with ſome command
of hers, if ſuch an occaſion might any way proove ſerviceable unto
her; for which the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> kindly thanked them, telling them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that ſhe herſelfe would alſo write to the King, being bound to
thanke him for the favours ſhee had at their hands received, which
accordingly ſhee did with as lively a gratitude as by paper and inke
could be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> went ſpeedily aboord the Royall, and in two dayes he
arrived in <hi>Tunis.</hi> The King ſeeing him come wihtout the <hi>Princes,</hi>
became thereat ſtrangely amazed, but had no ſooner underſtood the
occaſion of their ſtay, and peruſed their letters, than he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
fully ſatisfied, and exceedingly comforted. Thoſe two buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were propoſed to the Kings Councell, where the <hi>Count</hi> of
<hi>Bona</hi> ſhewed the utilitie of matching the <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Maiorica</hi> to be ſo
evident (eſpecially comprehending the other of <hi>Sardagna</hi> of him
held for aſſured) that no man oppoſed the concluſion thereof; yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7477:63"/>
ſtirred he not from <hi>Tunis</hi> till ſuch time as there were eight thouſand
foote, and two thouſand horſe ready levied for <hi>Polimero.</hi> And
for <hi>Metaneone,</hi> it was the Kings pleaſure, that the ſame <hi>Count</hi> (as
ſoone as hee had diſembarked his forces) ſhould goe treate of the
match with <hi>Maiorica,</hi> giving him for adjutants three of his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres,
to the end that the embaſſage might be the more ſolemnly
performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena</hi> in the meane while, lived now at her owne hearts ſweet
content, having not onely fortunately vanquiſhed her enemies, and
ended ſo dangerous a warre, but come alſo to know <hi>Polimero</hi> for the
ſonne of ſo great a King, as his condition could not give the people
any occaſion of murmuring, and therefore meant ſhee (as ſoone as
the ſtate were well appeaſed and fully ſetled) without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to returne to <hi>Caleri</hi> &amp; marry him; from which although the death
of her brother (as yet freſh in her memory) did in ſome ſort diſſwade
her; nevertheleſſe when ſhee conſidered with her ſelfe how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of government her father was, ſhe was perſwaded that the
world would commend her, for making choice of a <hi>Prince</hi> of ſuch
exquiſite conditions and knowne valour; the onely obſtacle indeede
was his ſomewhat too greene youth, for which ſhe doubted ſome
would grumble at her, the rather becauſe the diſe qualitie of yeares
(ſhe being at leaſt by ſix yeares his elder) made the difficultie the
greater; but love (ſuppreſſing all ſuch conſiderations) made all theſe
skores even: ſo as ſhe (having ſent for <hi>Polimero</hi>) told him that ſhee
had not as yet rejoyced with him, according unto her minde; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained her ſo long wiſhed for deſire of knowing him, nor
expreſſed (as ſhe ought) how ſorry ſhe was, that he had not made
himſelfe knowne unto her ſooner. But hee on the other ſide ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to excuſe himſelfe with many reaſons, among which ſome
were, that he being deſirous to become worthy of her favours,
thought it expedient to obtaine his intention therein, rather by reall
feates of armes, than by bare merit of bloud, being a condition hee
was ſure could never faile him; that he was bound to thanke the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
in that he ſaw till then all things ſucceed well, ſave onely one
which he as yet wanted; and as ſhee thought to aske him what that
might be; It is a thing (ſaid he) that I cannot expreſſe unto you in
words; but if your Highneſſe would vouchſafe but to looke into
my heart, you might there ſee it protraied, which you ſhall there no
ſooner ſee than know it to be no other thing, than an ardent deſire of
being your ſervant till death: which as he ſaid, his ſpeech failed him,
as he would have pronounced the laſt accents. Now <hi>Metaneone</hi>
(knowing his youth too tender for the managing of a buſineſſe of
that nature and importance) had before hand leſſoned him what he
ſhould ſay, wherein he following his inſtructions, thought himſelfe
afterwards to have made more ample manifeſtation of his courage,
than if he had fought alone againſt all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena,</hi> being glad he had thus begun to breake the ice, returned
him this anſwer; My <hi>Princely</hi> Lord, I underſtand not well what you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7477:63"/>
would ſay, being that you are too great a <hi>Prince</hi> for my ſervice, for
well ſee you how I am ſerved by no other than ſimple Knights; and
the ſervices I have received of you, are indeed no ſervices but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
which rather binde me to be your ſervant, for the obligations
I therefore owe you; and for me to looke into your heart, alas,
how can I poſſibly doe it without your prejudice, which I would
not doe, although it were to ſave my owne life. It is true, that a
Painter might in your hearts portrayture place my Picture, and ſo
might I by that means come to ſee it without harming you: doe but
tell me then (I pray you) how was it that he did it, and who he is,
and I will be his ſcholler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero,</hi> waxen by this time ſomewhat bolder, replied; Right
excellent Lady, your Highneſſe ought not refuſe my ſervice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am a <hi>Prince,</hi> but ſhould accept of me the rather for being ſuch
an one; and for the Painter you neede ſeeke no further than your
Royall ſelfe, becauſe your Highneſſe is both the Painter, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture;
who if you had the power and skill to portray your ſelfe in
my breſt, may more eaſily behold there the excellency of your
Pencill, which is ſo farre from harming me, as it is the onely reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
that can prolong my life.</p>
               <p>Here as hee would have ſpoken further, his ſpeech failed him, ſo
as waxen more vermilion than the freſheſt roſe, and kneeling on the
ground he affectionately kiſſed her hands, which ſhe withdrew not,
but was well content to ſuffer his warme breath to ſatiate it ſelfe
with that (to him) more than an Ambroſian banquet: Well (ſaid
ſhee) my Lord <hi>Polimero,</hi> what if I ſhould ſee my ſelfe in your heart,
could you then finde in your heart to ſee your ſelfe in mine?
Whereto he (without letting her hands goe) replied. But how dare I
(peerleſſe Lady) without infinite preſumption deeme my ſelfe ſuch a
Painter, as to place my unworthy picture in ſo worthy a Tabler,
wherein if I were favoured with one ſole thought of yours, I ſhould
thinke my ſelfe the happieſt knight that ever was borne a mortall?
You are (ſaid ſhe) indeede no Painter, nor have I any picture of you,
or your making; yet well know I you for a perfect ſculptor, for
here have you carved your lively ſtatue, breathing as you ſee it;
which ſaid, ſhe (holding before him a looking-glaſſe) proceeded,
Whether of us now is the beſt Artificer? I, that onely placed in
you my lifeleſſe Picture; or you that have graven and carved in mee
your ſculpture with its compleate parts and lineaments, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with all the lively organs and living powers of the intellect?
If ſo it be (anſwered the overjoyed <hi>Polimero,</hi>) I aske then no other
boone of the immortall gods; but having never knowne my ſelfe
for ſuch a one a could accompliſh ſo notable a piece of workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
for which I ſhall be all my lifes time obliged to my ſelfe, I am
conſtrained (becauſe the word of ſo great a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> cannot fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my beliefe herein) to beſeech your Highneſſe to favour mee
with ſome authentique aſſurance, by whoſe vertue this ſtatue may
abide in this place, ſecured by an irrevocable title, conformable to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7477:64"/>
the lawes of the world, as I aſſure my ſelfe it is already according to
the lawes of love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> hereat paſſionately inflamed, leaving him never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
in his kneeling poſture, and taking him with her armes gently
about the necke, thus replied; (My deere Lord) to the end you may
be fully aſſured, that I will bee yours according to the rites of the
world, as I am already yours by the power of love, for irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
aſſurance of the one and the other, I give you this earneſt: and
with that (kiſſing him) ſpake on; Now ſee whether ſuch an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
can by one of my qualitie be ever either revoked or denied.
Whereupon hee drawen on with ſo ſweete a baite, would faine
become ſomewhat bolder, but wanted the boldneſſe to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo checkt was his forwardneſſe with the curbe of baſhfulneſſe,
till afterwards his being aſſured encreaſed his courage in ſo modeſt
a way, that holding on a meane path betweene exceſſe and defect,
he needed not any more, either bit or ſpurre. The combat was of
kiſſes, wherein fortune ſhewed her ſelfe indifferent, there being no
one kiſſe lent, that was not as amorouſly repaied; till at length for
feare of being diſcovered, though neither weary nor ſatiated, they
ſate them downe, where (baniſhing all coyneſſe and love-hating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects)
now and then reciprocally interchanging ſweete embraces,
they recounted each to other their intended deſignes. <hi>Eromena</hi> well
approving of his ſending to <hi>Mauritania</hi> for freſh troopes, together
with his deſigne of <hi>Corſica,</hi> whereon her minde (diſtracted with
amorous thoughts) neere faſtened, and now thought ſhe it fit, that he
under went that enterpriſe, that ſo that kirgdome being by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
to the kingdome of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> might make their nuptials
more approveable and better lik'd of, hee having no other thing to
endow her withall. Vpon this ſhee would needs the day following,
have her Councell ſummoned to ſit, whereunto, having invited the
two <hi>Princes,</hi> ſhe propoſed the ſtate of the warre to be conſidered in
its future limits.</p>
               <p>The propoſition was, whether it were their beſt courſe (now
they had the <hi>Corſan</hi> king priſoner) to hold the enterpriſe as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
and ſo licenſe their ſouldiers or no? and if no, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
of what they were beſt to doe? Some held it fitting that the
warres ſhould ſo reſt determined; others were on the other ſide of a
contrary opinion. Whereupon <hi>Metaneone</hi> being requeſted to deliver
his opinion, excuſed himſelfe by alleaging that being but ſo lately
arrived there, he was unacquainted both with the countrey, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes
thereof, and therfore referr'd himſelfe unto his brother, who
(having ſerved the ſtate) could not chuſe but have a more exact
knowledge of its condition. <hi>Polimero,</hi> being thereunto earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned,
at laſt delivered himſelfe in this ſort.</p>
               <p>If State-affaires (Soveraigne <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) carried with them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſideration than that of the preſent, I ſhould hold for vaine
any other opinion, than that of peace, and ſhould thinke the beſt
courſe were to lay armes aſide, and enjoy the fruit of conqueſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7477:64"/>
atchieved by the valour our arme of your Highneſſe, but conſidering
them not as the ſhort dayes of men, but according to their laſting
perpetuitie, a prudent <hi>Prince</hi> ought to ſquare out, and ſettle his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
in ſuch a manner as the ſame may laſt, not for his life
onely, but even as long as the world can endure; It is true, your
Highneſſe hath already freed this kingdome from the cruel-leſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
that ever was raiſed againſt any <hi>Prince,</hi> and withall taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
that King, who (to become Tyrant here) ſo inhumanely nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
it; but this can suffice but for the preſent, what ſhould follow
is to prevent future dangers, which cannot bee otherwiſe effected
than by meaſuring the Kingdome of <hi>Corſica</hi> with the ſame meaſure
wherewith its King would have meaſured this of <hi>Sardegna;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
being ſo neere a borderer to the latter, as they almoſt joyne,
and by the ill which that hath, and would have done: to this may be
comprehended the danger of the evill it may doe hereafter; I grant
that your Highneſſe hath for this once beene ſo fortunate as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
him; yet is not <hi>Sardegna</hi> ſure to have alwayes the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
prowes and fortune. The good husbandman beleeves not, he
hath ſufficiently rid his land of noyſome weeds, by cropping their
leaves onely, unleſſe he alſo plucke them up by the rootes, ere they
fall to ſeede a-new. So ſhould your Highneſſe alſo advane your
victorious banners in the kingdome of <hi>Corſica,</hi> which once ſubdued,
you may unite to this crowne, which untill you doe, the warres
may well be ended in opinion, but never in effect; for <hi>Corſica</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now loſt its King may chuſe it ſelfe another, and ſo either of
it ſelfe, or by the helpe of other <hi>Princes</hi> make perpetuall incurſions
into this Kingdome, which that they will attempt, I am the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to beleeve, becauſe the humor of thoſe people is naturally
revengefull, eſpecially now that there is not a houſe among them
that hath not felt heavy loſſes by this warre, and the fugitive Rebels,
neſtling themſelves in the <hi>Baſtilica,</hi> may thence get themſelves eaſily
ſetled in their ancient patrimcnies, their treaſon and offence not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to make them ſo odious as not to finde ſome favourers of
their actions among thoſe they have commanded and ſwayed over
theſe foure hundred yeares: and <hi>Corſica</hi> being a poore countrey,
the inhabitants thereof for being needy will come ſhift for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to <hi>Sardegna,</hi> where under the pretext of forragers they will
maintaine a warre ſo laſting, as no valour ſhall bee able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them, ſo well fortified will they bee found by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of hils, and ſtrongly barricadoed by the ſtrength of woods, as
there will bee ſomewhat to doe to dinde them out, but much more
to come to fight with them. But if your Highneſſe would be pleaſed
to reſolve of the contrary, you ſhall avoide all theſe inconveniences,
neither ſhall you find any conſiderable oppoſition, for that you ſhall
invade a kingdome, that ownes neither King, Captaine, nor ſouldiers,
and ſhall withall find it deprived (for ought I beleeve) of Galleyes,
armes and Councell, now that all the beſt of them lie ſlaine in theſe
wars. And though forraine <hi>Princes</hi> would endeavour to ſuccour it,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7477:65"/>
yet ſhould they finde it loſt and won ere they came, ſo as ſuch an
enterpriſe cannot indeede any way redound to their good, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who have neither intereſt nor reaſon to ſuccour ſuch as cannot
but be utterly forlorne. Now ſome one may object, thatto ſuppoſe
that no neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> can lay any claime thereto, is falſe.
Well, I grant it, but let us (I pray them) argue who ſuch may bee,
for I ſee but onely five that may juſtly be reckoned in this number;
three whereof alſo I will immediatly exclude. The firſt ſhall be the
King my father, I will not ſay for my ſake, for that every one will
ſcarce beleeve, ſeeing that <hi>Princes</hi> ſquare out their actions by the
rule of their own ends, but becaſe he never aimed at the command of
the ſea, neither can the greatneſſe of <hi>Sardegna</hi> breed in him any jealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
conſidering that looke what difficulties ſtranger <hi>Princes</hi> ſhall
have in enjoying it, the ſelfe ſame difficultie ſhall ſhe have alſo in
poſſeſſing the Dominions of others, eſpecially in the firme land: for
the ſame reaſons, I exclude for the ſecond man the <hi>Etrurian</hi>
King; though not the King of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> who is the third; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his forces are not ſuch as neede be feared; there remaine yet
the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Ligurie:</hi> this laſt may not doe it, becauſe the
<hi>Tuskan</hi> King his neighbour will not ſuffer him to over-grow him in
greatneſſe, ſo as if hee ſhould ſtrive to poſſeſſe ſome others ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
the other would not let ſlippe the occaſion of ſeazing
on his. And if the <hi>Sicilian</hi> King doe but aſmuch as aime thereat, hee
muſt neceſſarily make enemies of the <hi>Mauritanian, Ligurian,</hi> and
<hi>Etrurian</hi> Kings, beſides ſuch others as command the other ſide the
<hi>Faro,</hi> if he but offer to joyne new kingdoms to his own, who (beſides
his being rich and potent) is ſufficiently well ſeated to put all the reſt
in a jealouſie of him. But let it be granted that any of them (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King my father, for whom I offer my ſelfe an hoſtage) would
be eaſily tempted to take up armes, yet let any ſuch whoſoever hee
be but ballance, the certaine charge, that muſt be neceſſarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed,
with the uncertaine benefit, that may perhaps be reaped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
and he ſhall ſee that as it cannot be compaſſed with a few men,
ſo the tranſportation of great forces, will require great Fleets, which
cannot be rigg'd under a great deale of time, which though they
could ſuddenly provide, yet ſhall they meete with many other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in being (for want of convenient havens) compel'd in
the ſelfeſame time, to fight againſt the winde, ſea and us. I omit the
conſideration of what the blindeſt ſee, which is, That <hi>Sardegna</hi> ſhall
be rid of its bad neighbours, and ſhall by commanding in ſtead of
awing them, become glorious and dreaded of all ſuch as would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
harme or infeſt it; I overpaſſe alſo ſuch conſequences as might be
deduced from the augmentation of forces, territories and revenewes,
conſidering the commodiouſneſſe of its ſituation. Other conſiderable
difficulties I beleeve there are none, whereof though there were, yet
can I not thinke them to be ſuch as may be paragonized with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſtate of theſe two kingdoms, beſides no difficulties ſhould ever
hinder the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of neceſſary reſolutions. But now becauſe it is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7477:65"/>
no policy to credit the Counſel of ſuch as ſhare not of the perils that
may chance to ſpring from the roote of ſuch adviſe, I here porferre
your Highneſſe to participate thereof, not only with my perſon, but
alſo with ſuch troopes as ſhall be thought requiſite for that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I hope to obtaine of the King my father, and of the
Prince my brother here preſent, ſo your Highneſſe will but vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to accept of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> that with great pleaſure had all this while liſtned
unto him, kindly thanked him for his proffer, as though it had beene
a thing ſtrange unto her. And becauſe ſhe well perceived that the
matter when it came to be reſolved of among the Councell, would
not prove ſo plaine, but that it might meete with ſome oppoſitions,
by reaſon of ſuch jealouſies as might ariſe from the proffer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gave ſhee order that they ſhould among themſelves treace
thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno,</hi> who ever ſithence <hi>Polimero</hi> was
knowne for a <hi>Prince,</hi> began to gheſſe at the cauſe of his comming to
<hi>Sardegna,</hi> as he had alſo before that taken notice of the inclination of
the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> deeming that love of hers to be well emploied, ſince that
(if ſhee married at all, ſhe could not make choiſe of either a fitter or
worthier husband) reſolved to ſet forwards, and bring to head that
buſineſſe, being well aſſured the ſhould thereby both pleaſe the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
and doe the ſtate good ſervice; therefore oppoſed he openly
ſuch as held the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Mauritania's</hi> propſition dangerous (infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for an example the Trojan horſe for a caveat to feare and
miſtruſt both the gift and giver.) His reaſons were, that it was
not to bee doubted, that he who ſo had begunne to merit, would
not continue ſo to doe, aſwell for deſire of glory, as for hope of
reward, hee being the laſt of the ſonnes of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without meanes: that in caſe he harboured any evill intention,
his forces could not ſtead him much, for that theirs would be more
than thrice ſo many; and that ſithence they might without loſſe of
their owne men gaine themſelves a kingdome (to them ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and neceſſary) he held it a great folly to refuſe it. Many other
things toucht he by the way, whereby the moſt acute ſmelt out his
drift, wherewith they were ſo farre from being diſpleaſed, as all of
them without any oppoſition, willingly concurr'd in the ſelfeſame
opinion. Wherof the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was a glad woman, who having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
acquainted <hi>Polimero,</hi> cauſed both him and his brother, to be cald
in to the Councell, as though ſhe had told him nothing thereof;
where (having extolled his noble exploits in the wars, taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to fall in ſpeech of his laſt proffer) ſhe told him; That although
the Councell was ſomewhat loth to make uſe of the kingdome of
<hi>Mauritania,</hi> yet notwithſtanding, that in reſpect of the knowne good
correſpondencie ever held betweene that and the <hi>Sardegnan</hi> crowne,
it had now reſolved to accept of the troopes by him offered, to the
end that hee might with them and thoſe of <hi>Sardegna</hi> proceede in
his <hi>Corſan</hi> enterprize, as hee had propoſed. Then turning her
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7477:66"/>
ſelfe towards <hi>Metaneone</hi> (when ſhe had made a great <hi>Encomio</hi> on
the Fleete, won her by his meanes) ſhee confeſt, that the King her
father, her ſelfe, and the whole kingdome, were exceedingly obliged
to the one, and the other; for which all of them together would
be ready at all occaſions to ſerve them, the King their father, and
kingdome: whereunto the brothers having anſwered each for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
gave in courteous termes ſuch aſſurance of their good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there was not any that doubted of their ſinceritie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> had already poſted a Currier to advertize the King
her father of the victories; and now determined ſhee to ſend him the
Councels reſolution, and withall the King <hi>Epicamedo</hi> with the other
priſoners; much had he deſired to ſee the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> whereto ſhee
would by no meanes condiſcend, pretending to detaine him not as a
priſoner of warre, but as a Traitor, guilty of injured Majeſtie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
her brothers murtherers had never attempted to take away his
life, had they not beene back't by him; ſo as he indeede was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that murther, thoſe warres, and all other ils that thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>Many dayes ſtaid the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> in <hi>Terranova,</hi> expecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the reſt of the army from <hi>Villapetres,</hi> to march thence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the next countrey of <hi>Luogodori,</hi> which lies in the utmoſt
point of <hi>Sardegna</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Corſica,</hi> to the end ſhe might aſſure
her ſelfe of thoſe countries formerly poſſeſſed by the Rebels, and
might alſo thence with more conveniency (at the arrivall thither
of the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> troopes) tranſport them over into <hi>Corſica</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aretia</hi> in the meane time had uſed all poſſible diligence to reſtore
to her former being, the weake woman, whom they had ſaved from
the mercileſſe ſea, which for her bodily plight was not very difficult,
but for the ſtate of her minde, ſeemed a thing impoſſible, in that ſhe
found her weaker every day than other, and (as it were) repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that ſhe died not. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> now diſentangled of publike
affaires, and deſirous to know who ſhee was, went in perſon to viſite
her, who having by this time underſtood that this was the famous
<hi>Princeſſe Eromena,</hi> received her with profound humilitie, by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
direction ſhee kept as yet her bed, though much againſt her
will; where the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> ſitting downe by her, joyed much to ſee
her a living woman, hoping that as ſhe had already gotten this point,
ſo ſhee might in time alſo come to gaine the other, which was
to bring her to ſome degrees of comfort by entertaining her with
mirth and pleaſant company: wherein ſhee was nevertheleſſe very
much deceived, becauſe a refined melancholy, having firſt beene an
infirmitie of the minde, and then come to be a bodily diſeaſe, and
ſo growne to be a reſidence of different ſubſtance is wont to prove
(for the moſt part) mortall and incurable. I had come ſooner unto
you (ſaid the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) but that I thought good to give you firſt
time to recollect your ſpirits, and yet wot I not well how I ought to
entertaine you, becauſe the outward expreſſions of your fortune
ſhew you to be otherwiſe than your proper conditions diſcover you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7477:66"/>
to be. I beſeech you to cleare me of that doubt, aſſuring you on the
faith of a noble maiden, that the curioſitie to know it, tends to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end than to aſſiſt you, which I will doe without ſparing any
thing I have. Here is no body preſent but <hi>Aretia,</hi> for whoſe ſecrecie
I undertake as for my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The woman (ſtanding awhile in a muſe, without making any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer)
fetching at length a deepe ſigh, not without teares, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her;</p>
               <p>Royall <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> your requeſts are commands to me; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to ſatisfie your Highneſſe therein, bee but as it were to draw
freſh bloud out of greene wounds, and to feſter an old long ſithence
inulcerated ſore, yet can I for all that doe no leſſe than obey
you.</p>
               <p>My name is <hi>Eleina,</hi> my Nation, the <hi>Narbon Gaule,</hi> my Countrey,
<hi>Arelate;</hi> where my father is he that beares both Crowne and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
My mother was the daughter of the <hi>Celtan</hi> King; know her did
I never, becauſe ſhe (preſaging my misfortunes) leſt ſhe ſhould ſee
ſo unhappy a burthen, died in childbirth of me. With ſuch quaint
tenderneſſe was I bred up, as children of my birth and qualitie are
wont to be, but much more fondly; for being the only child of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who (although a Widdower at foure and twentie yeares of age)
would never condiſcend to marry againe, for all that his ſubjects
earneſtly beſought him thereto, ſo much overſwayed him, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great love he bare to my mother, for whoſe ſake he alſo
tendered me the dearer; for the fuller expreſſion whereof, he grew
more obſtinate in his intended reſolution, ſo as I was eſteemed and
honoured of the world, as undoubted heire of that Kingdome. My
childhood ſpent I in many noble diſciplines; for being borne to a
Crowne, I was educated not as a woman, but as a Soveraigne <hi>Prince:</hi>
and withall to make my preſent ſtate more fully miſerable with the
memorie of paſſed glories, the Knights errant deemed themſelves
not worthy of the ſeeking adventures, ere they had firſt had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of ſeeing me, which came to paſſe, either becauſe things a far
off had a greater priveledge of opinion, than things more at hand; or
becauſe there was in me ſome eſteeme-worthy thing which I knew
not my ſelfe; ſuffice it, that ſuch was the effect, whether the cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it or no. Being arrived to ſixteene yeares of age, ſuch was my
misfortune, that there came to <hi>Arelate</hi> as a Knight errant, the ſon of
the King of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Don Peplaſos.</hi> This <hi>Prince</hi>
making a ſhew of being enamored of me, ſpeake, and wrought ſo far,
as I (drawne on rather by my deſtinie, than by any love I bare him)
perſwaded my father to give me him for wife; which he did, (being
not uſed to contradict me) though ſore againſt his will, and with the
teares in his eyes proteſting he did it meerely to ſatisfie me, himſelfe
for his owne particular, liking not well of ſuch haſty weddings, and
much leſſe of the bridegrooute. But I, over-tired with the great
number of Suitors, without knowing which of them to chuſe,
(detained in this ignorance by the tenderneſſe of age, but much
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7477:67"/>
more by my ſimplicitie in not knowing what manner of thing love
was, wearied with the trouble of being ſo wooed, and fooliſhly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to ſee my ſelfe a wife) made choice of him, to verifie that old
Proverbe, <hi>Women ever chuſe the worſt.</hi> With him lived I ſeven yeares
without bearing children, which ſeene by my fathers ſubjects, who
would by no meanes bee commanded by the <hi>Catalonian</hi> nation (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
by them by a naturall antipathy) and much leſſe by him,
whom for his bad uſage to me-wards, they hated more than death
it ſelfe, they earneſtly beſought my father to marry, ſo that at laſt
he, won by their importunities, but much more by my letters, tooke
to wife a faire and vertuous <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> the King of <hi>Aquitain's</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who; bare him the very firſt yeare a male-child, which as much
contented the people, as it madded and diſcontented my husband,
who ſeeing himſelf deprived both of that kingdome, and alſo of any
hope of having by me any children, determined to avenge the one,
and remedy the other, by doing away my perſon.</p>
               <p>It fell out in the meane time, that fame extolling abroad the two
neighbouring beauties, which were yours, and that of <hi>Eromilia,
(Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica</hi>) hee (being the vaineſt man living) not
knowing which of both to chuſe, was much tormented in minde,
for being indifferently enamored, as well of the one as of the other;
but conſidering yours, without poſſeſſions and dominions (the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
object of his love) during the life time of your brother, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mirrour of <hi>Princes,</hi> and withall fearing you for the fame of your
valour, which would not (as he thought) willingly brooke ill uſage,
he bent his inclination towards the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> from
whom he withdrew it againe, when he underſtood of her being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to your brother, which occaſioned not the taking away of my
misfortunes, but the differring of them for my greater evill.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> lov'd a gentle Knight, if he may be ſaid to
love, to whom nature gave no inclination to love other than himſelf,
beſides the being of his nature, diſpoſition, and conditions, ſo farre
alienated from thoſe of <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> (for ſo was the Knight named)
that it ſeemed impoſſible to forme thereof a true friendſhip; but as
every rule is wont to have, (ſo hath this alſo) its exception, at leaſt
on the behalfe of the <hi>Prince,</hi> who being preſumptuous, and ſo farre
deceived in himſelfe as to repute his owne vices to be vertues, eaſily
beleeved, that <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> (a vertuous <hi>Cavalier</hi>) tooke them for ſuch
indeede; to him therefore diſcovered hee his inhumane deſignes:
but he (which well knew his nature) although he durſt not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
him, yet was he ſo mov'd by the inſtinct of his owne vertue, as
he could do no leſſe than advertize me thereof. And becauſe either to
ſpeake or write to me might prove dangerous, he onely wrote to me
to finde out ſome one truſty, with whom he might conferre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>The husband of my chiefe chamberlaine, named <hi>Don Elavio,</hi> was
one of the beſt eſteemed, and nobleſt of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Knights,
whoſe conditons when I had well examined, I judged him a man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7477:67"/>
worthy of my ſecret. And he having conforted me, went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with <hi>Don Eulavio,</hi> to whom he ſhewed the letter, which he had
(as I told you) written unto me, according as we had firſt agreed on,
to certifie him, that he was ſent from me, and afterwards (burning
it in his preſence) uſed with him, on my behalfe, ſuch courteous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as might ſuite with an affaire of ſuch importance. To whom
<hi>Don Eleimo</hi> anſwered, that without the teſtimonie of the letter, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
alone was a ſufficient letter of aſſurance and credit. And with
that he told him, how that the <hi>Prince,</hi> having taken me to wife, not
for affection ſake (as he made me beleeve ere he married me) but for
meere covetouſneſſe of the <hi>Arelatan</hi> kingdome, which not ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
according to his expectation, (my father being married and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſonne, and I prov'd a barren woman) was reſolved to put me
to death; but conſidering the good opinion which the people and
his father alſo had of my honeſtie, he determined to worke his ends
another way, and that was by poiſon, which he intended to put in
practiſe ere long, having already ſo wrought with my Phyſitian, as
he had got him to promiſe to make him ſome of purpoſe, which (for
not being violent) ſhould in the end of certaine dayes worke their
effect, without giving any colour of ſuſpition. All which when I
underſtood, I know not which was greater, either the hate I bore
my husband for ſo barbarous a crueltie, or the feare I had of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to preſerve my ſelfe; and having before my marriage beene
very curious of ſimples, whereby I knew ſuch as might more eaſily
be uſed to hurt me, I prepared for my ſelfe ſuch antidotes, as I
hoped thereby to preſerve my life, as it came indeede to paſſe; for I
in uſing them, ſo prevented the danger, as I could not have poiſoned
my ſelfe, although I would. Yet was I not therein uncircumſpect,
for ſome of them I tooke (being aſſured by the antidotes) others
would I not take, becauſe I knew they were too ſtrong, being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
of all of them, and of their qualities, by the good <hi>Don Eleimo;</hi>
whereat the <hi>Prince</hi> wondering, after many fantaſies and conjectures,
(moſt ſubtle as he was) imagined that I was enformed thereof, but
not thinking of <hi>Don Eleimo,</hi> he began to miſtruſt that the Phyſitian
(moved either by pitty or avarice) had made me priuy thereto; but
when he afterwards ſaw, both by his proteſtations and proceeding
in the practiſe, that he proved as truſty to him as treacherous to me,
he could not then chuſe but ſuſpect who it was indeede. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he (intending now to kill two birds with one ſtone) forethought
how to take <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> ſo napping, as he might puniſh him, not for
the good he did me, but for the evill he might lay to his charge to
have done with me, which he perhaps beleeved ſo to be, as one dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it impoſſible that meere pietie and pitty (which he being never
acquainted withall, himſelfe beleeved to bee in no other man) had
moved this Knight to doe me this good office; nor could he imagine
that any other intereſſes induced him thereto, whom he well knew
to be a noble and rich <hi>Cavalier</hi> and my ſelfe ſo poorely entertained,
as I had ordinarily little more allowed me than a private Lady.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7477:68"/>
Confirmed then in this article of beleefe, he, for many dayes, did
nothing elſe but pry into our actions, though to no purpoſe, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo farre from any ſuch intention as imagination it ſelfe could not
fancie us more alienated therefrom.</p>
               <p>One had <hi>Don Eliemo</hi> among all his ſervants no leſſe deare unto
him, than himſelfe was to the <hi>Prince;</hi> on him fixt <hi>Don peplaſos</hi> his
eye, judging him a fit inſtrument for his deſignes; and ſeeing him
ofttimes in his fore-chamber, waiting for <hi>Don Eleimo,</hi> tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to call him, under colour of asking of him ſomething, or bidding
him doe ſome petty ſervice, ſo as hee puffed up with ſuch like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and already framing himſelfe high fortunes, began to deſpiſe
ſuch meane preferments as might bee pretended from <hi>Don Eleimo;</hi>
Nay, ſo great was his preſumption, that thinking one day to unhorſe
his maſter himſelfe out of the <hi>Prince</hi> his favour, he grew by this
imagination, both to envie and hate him; ſo uſeth fortune to ſport
her ſelfe in humane things, as in a noble minde one generous act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
more than all wordly intereſſes; and on the contrary, in a baſe
minde, one ſole intereſt can doe more than all the ties of vertue, the
one to ſave the innocent contemnes his Lords favour, and the other
to obtaine it by betraying the guiltleſſe, makes himſelfe guilty.
Now when the <hi>Prince</hi> thought hee had ſufficiently prepared
him, hee found one day opportunitie to ſpeake unto him in this
wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> I purpoſe to receive thee into my ſervice, but charge
thee not to ſpeake a word thereof to any man living, eſpecially to
<hi>Don Eleimo</hi> from whom ere thou part, thou muſt (for a buſineſſe that
imports me) obſerve, whothoſe of my wives family be that frequent
him moſt, and in this and every other action of his, penetrate the
deepeſt thou canſt poſſibly; wherein, if thou ſerveſt me well, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to make thy fortune ſuch as thou ſhalt not neede envie thy
Maſters greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> who joyed not a little to become thus the <hi>Princes</hi> favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
promiſed to ſerve him with all obſervant diligence, wherein he
could already aſſure him, how <hi>Don Eulavio</hi> uſed to come often to
viſite him, and that (for the moſt part) by night, locking themſelves
in privately, both alone, very circumſpect, that no man over-heard
them; and that one evening among the reſt, when <hi>Don Eulavio</hi> was
gone, <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> ſtood a long while looking on a Iewell, which
the other had left him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (thinking he had now gotten all that he deſired) bade
him in any caſe ſteale away that Iewell, which hee promiſed to doe,
well knowing how to filtch away the key of the ſtudy wherein it
was laid up. This Iewell was my mothers, being a triangle of three
rich diamonds, each angle whereof was enriched with a great pearle;
I ſent it him by <hi>Don Eulavio</hi> in token of gratitude, and he (as <hi>Don
Eulavio</hi> told me) accepted it very unwillingly, his heart ſeeming to
preſage unto him his enſuing evils, ſeeing that he abhorring it as a
thing mortiferous, praid him ſundry times after he had received it,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7477:68"/>
to bring it me backe againe; which (I beleeve) he did, not that his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
ſtucke in what his heart preſaged him; but becauſe he ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſht
his nobilitie (as he thought) in doing mercenarily that action,
which had no other end than it ſelfe. It was an eaſie matter for <hi>Cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo</hi>
to ſatisfie the ill intended curioſitie of the <hi>Prince, Don Eleimo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
not himſelf from him, for that he deemed him to be as faithful
a ſervant, as himſelfe was an affectionate Maſter; ſo as he made a ſhift
to ſteale away the key, and then filtching away the Iewell, brought it
forthwith to the <hi>Prince,</hi> who (knowing it to be mine) looked after no
other evidence, but condemning me unheard, would by no means let
ſlip a ſeaſon ſo opportune to his villanies: Being then riſen out of his
bed, &amp; cauſing himſelf to be followed by thoſe of his guard, he went
towards <hi>Don Eleimo's</hi> houſe, that adjoyned to the Court, intending
to ſurprize him there, but that the heavens permitted not, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſion to call to <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> (who lay in his chamber) without
receiving any anſwer, he was forced to riſe himſelf, when not finding
him there, whereat he was much amazed, til having ſent for a candle,
he perceived at the firſt ſight, the ſtudie doore open, and finding not
therein the Iewell, he ſuddenly ſuſpected the cauſe, wherefore the
<hi>Prince</hi> favoured the Traytor. What to reſolve of in that inſtant, hee
knew not, ſeeing that to ſtay there was dangerous; and to get him
gone would bee judged a ſigne of manifeſt guilt. Whileft thus his
troubled minde enclined while to the one, and while to the other
reſolution, behold hee perceived through a window, (which by
good fortune ſtood the open) a great glimmering of lights, and no
ſmall crowde of people; among whom were alſo the Archers of the
Court; whereupon examining in his judgement (in the twinckling of
an eye) the crueltie of the <hi>Prince,</hi> who was both head-ſtrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable,
he reſolved to ſhun his owne ruine, as the leſſet evill, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a place and time more proper, for the clearing of his innocency,
which was mine by conſequence; taking with him therfore ſome
coine and Iewells from out his ſtudy (by the being there wherof he
comprehended, that the robberie tended not to the filtching away of
a Iewell, but to the murthering of him in his life and honour) leaving
unſtirred his family (who little ſuſpected any ſuch accident) he ſlipt
him out by a ſecret doore that leade to his lodgings, whilſt the <hi>Prince</hi>
cauſed the ſtreete doore to be furiouſly beaten downe to the ground.
The confuſion of the poore ſervants which then lay in a deepe ſleep,
cannot be expreſſed, no more than the fury of the <hi>Prince,</hi> who becauſe
he found him not, tooke on him like a mad man; whilſt thoſe of his
traine not beleeving that he could be fled away in ſo ſhort a time, in
cauſing him to be ſought for all over the houſe, gave him the more
time to ſave himſelfe: who (being ſuffered to paſſe through the gate of
the watch, not ſo much for giving them the militarie ſigne, as becauſe
they knew who he was) went aboord a Galley (feining ſome buſineſſe
for the <hi>Prince</hi>) wherewith he got himſelfe to the King my father in
<hi>Arelata.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> (in the meane time having ſent all over) found
out at length the way of his eſcape, when though he ſpeeded all the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7477:69"/>
Galleyes after him ſundrie wayes, and to diverſe places; yet was it
not poſſible for any of them to over-take him, becauſe hee having
choſen the beſt Galley never ſuffered the Ghinge to repoſe their
oares, till he arrived in <hi>Aquamorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> being thus eſcaped, there remained yet <hi>Don Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavio.</hi>
Now there ſerved <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> a ſlave given him by <hi>Don Eula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
who (having beene well uſed by both, and ſeeing the misfortune
of the one) ranne inſtantly to the other, thinking it his beſt courſe
to ſave himſelfe in the houſe of his firſt Maſter, ere the Officers fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on him for a chattle with the goods of the ſecond. Now <hi>Don
Eulavio</hi> uſed gaming very much, (and as fortune would have it) he
then was at play, when ſeeing the ſlave appeare before him, he (riſing
off the table with a great heart-beating) asked him what he would
have? And (having underſtood the cauſe, though not the occaſion)
ſuſpecting what was indeede, and judging his ſtay to quit himſelfe
thereof would prove dangerous, hee loding the ſlave with a ladder
of cords (made in his youth for his ſtolen love-ſports) and taking
his way towards a part of the citie, formerly perhaps obſerved by
him for ſuch like occurrences, ſpeedily deſcended the walls, leaving
there the ladder behinde, ſithence when, there was never any newes
heard, either of him or the ſlave. The <hi>Prince</hi> thus fruſtrated of his firſt
hope, came running to <hi>Don Eulavio's</hi> houſe, which he found open, and
repleate with ſervants, waiting for their Maſters, that were there a
gaming; but ſcouting on further, and detaining ſuch as would have
runne in to give notice of his comming, he ſuddenly ruſhed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
among them; where every one ſtood up to honour him, and he
(finding there miſſing <hi>Don Eulavio</hi>) enquired for him, after whom
when every man had ſought and cald too, they perceived in the end,
he was gone his wayes; which when <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> underſtood, there
was no man that durſt as much as looke on his fierie eyes, for hee
laying aſide all gravitie, ſpake and did things unworthy a <hi>Prince;</hi> all
the ſervants there ſent he packing to a cloſe priſon, as he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done with <hi>Don Eleimo':</hi> neither were thoſe Knights whom hee
found a gaming, any thing better uſed by him; whileſt I (wretched
woman) lay (thankes to my quiet conſcience) deeply plunged in a
profound ſleepe. Many yeares before ſlept I al'alone, the <hi>Prince</hi> never
comming neere me, but at the requeſt of the King his father, which
was ſeldome, and then with a demeanour rather irkeſome &amp; diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than any whit contentſome for the converſation of married folks,
unleſſe it be in an affectionate way, is no pleaſure but a torment, and
ſavours rather of beaſtiality than humanity. There ſlept alwayes two
gentle-woman in my bed-chamber, where ſtood a ſmall lampe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
burning, becauſe my melancholy being growne to be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
infirmitie, I ever found my ſelfe troubled with ſome indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
orther, either of ſtomacke or ſpleene, ſo as there paſſed not a
night, wherein I needed not both remedies, and the company of
ſome to comfort me; for my head was ſo replete with vapours, as
I ſaw and ſuffered what another woman (how ill diſpoſed ſoever)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7477:69"/>
could not have aſmuch as imagined, much leſſe ſeene and endured.
With a great rumbling came the <hi>Prince</hi> ruſhing into my bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by reaſon whereof my fit of ſickneſſe ſeizing on me; as ſoone
as I underſtood the occaſion of his comming thither, I ſwounded and
fell in a convulſion, ſo extremely violent, as I was ſo fortunate as not
to heare with mine owne eares thoſe injurious termes which (I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heard) he gave me. He would by all meanes have cauſed me ſo
naked to be caſt into the bottome of a dark dungeon, had not the king
(who came running to ſee what this hurly-burly meant) hindred him
to do it; who hearing him accuſe me of adulterie with <hi>Don Eleimo,</hi> by
the inſtrumentall means of <hi>Don Eulavio,</hi> told him, that the judgement
thereof belonged to him as King, and therefore bade him get him
to bed, telling him that what he had done was ſufficient, aſſuring
him withall, that as he would have me burnt, if he found me guiltie,
ſo would he alſo allow my innocencie ſuch favour as it merited;
whereupon hee parting away (though much againſt his will) the
King would not as yet leave me, but patiently attending to ſee the
end of my fit, and conferring in the meane time, while with the
one, and while with the other of my gentle women, he well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>Prince</hi> his ſuſpition to bee either vaine or malicious. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to my ſelfe (if ſo I may ſay that found my ſelfe then in
a worſe plight than ever) the King drew neere mee, conſolating
mee exceeding courteouſly; and having firſt ſuffered me to vent
out my teares, for the disburdning of my heart, hee then told me;
that albeit he never had occaſion in ſo many yeares, to ſuſpect my
honeſty; nevertheleſſe, being that the gods had given him the
Scepter of Iuſtice, he could doe no leſſe than heare ſuch as accuſed
me, to the end he might the better heare me alſo. And that if I knew
my ſelfe innocent, hee ſaw no cauſe I had to grieve, ſeeing
that I might aſſure my ſelfe that no tie of affection ſhould prevaile
with him ſo farre, as to ſuffer me to be wronged. I (that felt my
ſelfe ſtrucke through the heart by ſo diſhoneſt an injurie) aſſured by
my conſcience, anſwered him, that the not condemning me, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me never awhit, becauſe finding me guiltleſſe (as moſt certainely
he ſhould) he was obliged to publiſh me innocent; but that (to free
me from the evill opinion of the world, wherein I was falne by
this imputation) lay not at his diſpoſe, unleſſe he would be pleaſed
to preferre the rites of juſtice before all reſpects of bloud, by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my malitious accuſers by the ſtrictneſſe of the <hi>Talion</hi> law. The
King ſtrucken inwardly with my words, ſtoodawhile in a maze, and
afterwards (bidding mee good night) retired to his lodging, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with me a guard, with expreſſe order, not to ſuffer the <hi>Prince</hi> to
enter my chamber.</p>
               <p>The day following, the fame of this accident was rumored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
not onely through the Citie, but alſo over all the King dome,
with ſuch diſcontent of the people, murmuring in ſo open a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
againſt the perſon of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as made him (being no leſſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
than cruell) ready to goe beſides himſelfe; neither was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7477:70"/>
there any Market-place, Temple, or Common-walke, where there
was not punctuall ſcrutinie made of my life, and behaviour, followed
by a generall judgement on my behalfe every way favourable. And
in truth, though I had harboured a diſhoneſt intention (which was
(God knowes) farre from my thoughts) yet was it impoſſible for me
to have ever put the ſame in practiſe, being that I went no where
unaccompanied, nor ſtaid I ever by night or day in my owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all alone, neither (which is more) favoured or affected I ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of my women more than the reſt, but eſteemed them all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
alike, bearing no other different reſpect towards them, than
might ſerve to manifeſt my better liking, to ſuch of them as I found
more diligent in my ſervice, ſo as it was impoſſible for me to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
by other than malice it ſelfe, which nevertheleſſe by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
meanes could not poſſibly prejudice me, becauſe it could no
way alleage time or place; although (by its miſchievous malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie)
it could deviſe how to alleage perſons.</p>
               <p>The day following the King would faine know of his ſonne the
cauſe of my accuſation, who related unto him all that he gathered
out of <hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> with the contumacie, and ſuſpitious flight of the two
Knights where of he formed a conſequence of my offence. And then
examining <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> (who conformed himſelfe in all things to the
<hi>Prince</hi> his allegation without varying in any thing) it hapned that
the accuſation (though moſt falſe) ſeemed ſomewhat likely to bee
true. Whereupon the King (miſinformed) came to me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
all that was laid to my charge, opening unto me by his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
a large field to cleare my innocency, which I manifeſted unto
him ſo apparently lively, as any man but he, would have inſtantly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
me, and condemned the <hi>Prince.</hi> But alas, <hi>No man ever hated
his owne fleſh,</hi> ſo as it was no marvaile, if his fatherly inclination,
hindred him to diſcerne the malice of his ſonne; he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that they went about to poiſon me, becauſe the Phyſitian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, for which I (having no other teſtimony than the two Knights
that were fled and gone) alleaged my diſtillations, and ſome words
careleſly let ſlippe from mee, whereby my women diſcovered
in mee ſuch like ſuſpitions. I denied not the gift of the Iewell,
though for the occaſion I told you, further alleaging, that <hi>Don Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavio</hi>
being (as every one knew) a noble Knight, it was not a thing
credible that either I ſhould uſe him for a Pander, or that he would
have beene ſo baſe as to ſuffer himſelfe to become ſuch a one: but
ſeeing the King for all this ſticke firme to the evidence of his ſonne
(which was the gift of the Iewell, and flight of the Knights,) I
ſhewed him how the gift had its occaſion, and much more the flight
of the Knights, that had beene verie wilfully ſottiſh to have truſted
themſelves to the diſcretion of an unjuſt and cruell <hi>Prince,</hi> who if he
made no conſcience to procure my death, for being excluded of his
hopes of the <hi>Arelatan</hi> kingdome, and for the aſpiring to that of <hi>Maiorica,</hi>
much leſſe would he have made, to put them to death, to the
end he might thereby, not onely revenge himſelfe, and ſuppreſſe the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7477:70"/>
diſcoverie of his miſchievous practiſes, but alſo rid himſelfe of me
for ever, at the price of my life and honour. In the end I beſought
him that my Phyſitian might be examined by torture, wherof he was
well contented; but hee the very day before he was to be examined,
was found ſtrangled, to make the world beleeve that he hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for feare of torments. My reaſons (in ſumme) had availed mee
little, if (in leſſe than eight dayes after this accident) there had not
appeared an Ambaſſadour from my father come ſcowring with
maine force of oares, on a well rigged Galley, who having preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the King with a letter of credence, and acquainted him with the
occaſion of his comming, delivered him alſo a letter from <hi>Don Elei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
containing the whole ſtory of my caſe, without varying a haites
bredth from what I had formerly related. And (becauſe the
Embaſſadour ſuddenly upon his arrivall, would needs have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
ere he ſpake with me or any other) he praied, as ſoone as the
King had reade the letter, that he might ſee me, to confront there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
my depoſition; which could not be denied him; and finding
me in a plight ſo deplorable, he comforted me, with aſſuring me,
that my fathers tenderneſſe of affection to me-wards, was no leſſe
now than when I was his only child; and that when he were aſſured
of my honeſty, he was reſolved to defend it, though it ſhould coſt
him his life and kingdome, that he was ſent thither to be an aſſiſtant
at my arraignement, which he would have proſecuted with all rigor,
that ſo my innocency might be the better cleered, that the maine
proofe conſiſted of one ſole point, which was, to ſee if what I ſaid,
was conformable to what <hi>Don Eleimo</hi> had told my father, and now
written to the King of <hi>Catalogna</hi> there preſent. Much was I comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in hearing this, and after, having asked him how my father did,
I related unto him (as formerly I had done to my father-in-law) the
advertizements many times given me by <hi>Don Eleimo,</hi> with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
antidotes by mee taken, whereof I ſhewed them the receipts,
wiſhing them to aske the Phyſitians, if ſuch were effectuall againſt
poiſons. I made known unto them in the end how it grieved me, that
my Phyſitian was hanged up in priſon, for feare leſt he diſcovered (on
the racke) both his own and the <hi>Prince</hi> his treacherie. Which when
the Embaſſadour heard, he asked the King what he thought of it?
Whereto hee not knowing what to anſwer, (reading againe <hi>Don
Eleimo's</hi> letter, with ſtrange mutation of colours) ſaid, he would goe
conferre with his ſonne: to whom, when he had ſhewed the letter,
and made with him a great ſtirre about it, he at length reſolved to
have all things huſht up, wherewith I not contenting my ſelfe (but
requiring the death of the falſe <hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> with ſome publike declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Prince,</hi> for the manifeſtation of my innocency) could
by no meanes poſſible obtaine, either the one or the other, for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſcopo,</hi>
diſclaimed from having ever named me, maintaining all hee
averr'd to be true without any prejudice to me; and the <hi>Prince,</hi> by
alleaging love to be a thing full of doubts and feares, not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
himſelfe from the obligation of giving me ſuch ſatisfaction,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7477:71"/>
as I looked for, but alſo pretended to have withall obliged me, in
having ſo baſely defamed me. I would faine have returned home to
my fathers, but entreated by my father-in-law, deceived by the
falſe penitencie of my husband, and counſelled by the Embaſſadour
not to doe it (being that my husband could no waies make a more
publike declaration of my wronged honeſtie, than to keepe mee
with him) I was perſwaded to ſtay; whereof I ſoone repented
me, now that a juſtly conceived diſdaine had taken away from mee
all the reſidue of love; and that there appeared to increaſe in him a
deſire to free himſelfe of the knowne ill opinion that every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, imagining my life to be unto him a perpetuall upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his infamie.</p>
               <p>It fortuned that a yeare and ſomewhat after that theſe things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
the valourous <hi>Prince,</hi> your brother, was ſlaine, whereupon a
new phrenſie being come into his head of getting the <hi>Princeſſe Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi>
(a thing which could not be whileſt I lived) he reſolved to
make me away; but not knowing what colour to have for it, now
that my honeſtie was ſo openly knowne, he thought of a thouſand
wayes, whereof no one liked him; at laſt hee lighted on one, the
moſt villanous that ever humane wit could imagine.</p>
               <p>Now there ſtood ſeated on the <hi>Pirenean</hi> mountaines, a Temple
dedicated to the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno;</hi> whither ſuch married paires, as
had lived diſguſted, came from remote parts on pilgrimage, to pray
the goddeſſe to grant them reciprocall love and concord. <hi>Don Pepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos</hi>
(in whom was never before ſeene any ſigne, either of pietie, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
become now forſooth in an inſtant devoutly religious) invited
me to this pilgrimage; whereof I (that much needed celeſtiall helpe)
was (God knowes) exceeding joyfull. Me-thought that my prayers
were already heard, and that I ſaw my husband become an altered
man, for that the deſire to be good (which he ſeemed now to have)
argued in him a beginning of goodneſſe. Nothing would he reſolve
of without me, touching this journey, participating of my advice,
as well for the manner thereof, as for the company we were to take
along with us; wherein (he ſeeming to be exceedingly mortified and
full of contrition) we reſolved to goe diſguiſed, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of pompe; taking with us but one ſervant a-piece: but becauſe
I thought I could not (for modeſties cauſe) be ſo conveniently ſerved
in my occaſions by a man ſervant, I told him that in ſtead of a man,
I would take along with me a waiting-woman, he (telling me that it
was fitting I ſhould ſo doe) replied; that to prevent future accidents,
I ſhould doe well to take along with me alſo a man-ſervant, for that
wee knew not what dangers might befall us by the way, and that
therefore it were not amiſſe, to chuſe out ſuch a one as I knew for aman of valour, whereunto I very willingly condeſcended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this propoſition quite cleared of all ſuſpition that might have
ſtucke in my minde; albeit, ſo ſimple was I, as that I never once
doubted of any thing; I ſelected me one, whoſe name was <hi>Calaplo,</hi>
a harmeleſſe and comely young fellow, though never till then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7477:71"/>
knowne to me for a man any way valiant; and now my minde ſetled
on no other thing than my journey, having cloathed our ſelves in
pilgrimes weedes of courſe gray cloth, we ſet our ſelves forwards on
our journey: whither hee offered not to take along with him
<hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> to ſhew how unwilling hee was to diſpleaſe me; albeit
though hee had brought him along with him, I would never
have diſliked it, having before reſolved with my ſelfe to forget what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
was paſt; in his ſtead tooke he a right noble and valiant Knight,
and ſuch a one, as I cannot beleeve that he knew any thing from this
treacherous plot, but rather that the <hi>Prince</hi> tooke him with him of
purpoſe, that his deceived goodneſſe might deceive others. Come to
the Temple, wee adored the goddeſſe, and preſented her with rich
gifts, whereat I beleeved, ſhe ſmiled to ſee them come from two
hearts, the one a Traytor, the other betraied. I (full of religious
faith) continued all the day in the Temple praying, not without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a very great commotion of feare in my minde, though I ſaw no
reaſon why, and therefore imputing the fault to my infirmitie, I fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
beſought the goddeſſe to comfort me. In the meane time my
good husband (whilſt the Knight was at our lodging, which was
very farre off, left behind there of purpoſe, under colour of keeping
companie with my woman, who was ſomewhat ill at eaſe) ſent my
man to fetch him a little wallet, which (having given him the key
thereof) he made him open, ſhewing him a good quantitie of Iewels
and gold (as indeede there was nothing elſe therein;) then cauſing
him to put all in again, and locke it up faſt, he ſaid unto him; Here take
this wallet, and get thee gone ſuddenly into ſome countrey, ſo farre
off, as it may not bee knowne that thou art living in the world, for
if ever I come to know it, I vow thou ſhalt not live one houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The yong man (hereat much amazed, taking the wallet) went his
way without any more adoe. And he comming haſtily into therem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
invited me to goe ſee a white Doo on theſe mountaines, whereat
I ſmiled that he tooke it for a Doo, where it was more likely ſome
kinde of Chamoy or Wilde-goate; but he obſtinately perſiſting in
affirming it to be a Doo, I gathered up my ſelfe to follow him. And
becauſe my Phyſitians had told me, that exerciſe was good againſt
my infirmitie; it was no difficult matter for him (we having not as
yet gotten any ſight of the Doo) to get me to deſcend through pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſo rugged and craggy, as it was impoſſible for me to returne
thence backe againe. But he telling me he had the day before gone
the ſame way, and that a little further was a very faire path, whither
we were neceſſarily to goe, to returne backe againe; I then (though
too late) perceived my ſelfe deceived; wherefore (burſting out a
weeping) I beſought him to have compaſſion of me. But he (waxen
by this time cruell, and growing more and more ſavage) made mee
trot ſo long, till ſeazed on by one of my wonted fits) I fell downe
deprived of all ſenſe or feeling. What become of him I know not;
for it was darke night ere I came to my ſelfe; when I found I was
gotten into a ſteepie and rockie dale, a long dayes journey diſtant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7477:72"/>
from the place where I ſwounded. How I was carried thither, I
know not, much leſſe how I came to bee left bare-foote and bare-legged,
and ſtripped naked of all ſave onely this gowne of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
pilgrimage; and certainely I would have choſen rather to
have died a thouſand deaths, than to have beene left in ſuch a
plight, for my tender feere could not endure the ſharpneſſe of the
ſtones, neither (which was worſe) knew I which way to goe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my ſelfe, that to returne backe againe, was impoſſible for mee,
ſo as putting my ſelfe into the hands of fortune, I made choiſe to
deſcend the leſſe difficult way, going for the moſt part on all foure,
and ſharing among my knees, legges, and hands, the paines which
my feete alone were not able to ſuffer. But come at laſt to the foote
of one mountaine, where began the aſcent of another, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeene all the day long any living creature, lifting up my eyes
by chance, whom might I ſee but my ſervant <hi>Calaple,</hi> who beheld
me, but knew me not, ſo great was his aſtoniſhment to ſee me trudge
in ſuch a faſhion; till conſtrained by my wearineſſe to ſit me downe,
he came to know me by the pitious moane I made; whereupon hee
(with a voice ſomewhat loud) thus ſaid unto me;</p>
               <p>And is it poſſible that you are my Lady the <hi>Princeſſe?</hi> Alas,
what cruell deſtinie could make any man become ſo barbarous as to
put you in ſuch a plight? I now perceive, that the cauſe of my exile
was to make the world beleeve, that I were runne away with your
Highneſſe, (and here related he unto me the charge and command
the <hi>Prince</hi> gave him, whence we gathered the ſcope of his malicious
intention.) Whileſt we thus ſtood talking, behold there came three
highway theeves, that ſet upon him unawares, where I ſaw him vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
defend himſelfe; till they in their fight ſo changed their
ground, as I (loſing the ſight of them) knew not what thereof ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for there being a profound ſteepy dale, and a great fall of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
betweene the one mountaine and the other, I muſt have fetcht a
large compaſſe about to get whither I had ſeene them, which lay not
in the power of my feere to doe, and beſides, I imagined that I could
not have found him otherwiſe than dead, for had he beene alive, hee
would not have failed to have come to finde me out. All that night
lay I in that place, where the firmament was my Inne, the earth my
bed, paſſions my meate, and teares my drink; being kept waking with
the new paine of my feete, accompanied with the cold, without any
hope of riſing ever thence any more; ſo tired and tormented was
I with all extremities of anguiſh and vexation. Scarce was it day,
when I was found in this plight by a countrey ſwaine, who (taking
compaſſion on me) lifted me up, and (comforting mee in pitifull
manner) carried me into a Cottage, where I was lovingly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his wife and mother, who (having reſtored me with freſh
egges, and anointed my feete and legges) laid me in a ruſticke bed,
with ſuch a diligent charitie, as more they could not have done
though they had knowne me for what I was. Three dayes abode I
there, and might (if I had lifted) have ſtaied there longer, but being
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7477:72"/>
that theſe exceeding poore people could not furniſh me with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
for my journey, nor the ſhepheard neglect his flocke to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
me, nor I diſcover my ſelfe for great ſhame (having got them
to ſhew me the way to the ſea, to embarke my ſelfe) I went on my
way; and in ſtead of rewarding theſe poore creatures with gifts,
according to the ſtate of my birth and qualitie, I was glad to accept
of them ſome bread, and an old paire of ſlip-ſhooes, according to
the ſtate of my fortune, to ſave my ſelfe from ſtarving for hunger,
and from quite ſpoiling my feete: but wherefore goe I thus prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the matter? I made a ſhift to get me (though with infinite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings)
unto the ſea-ſhore, which I no ſooner deſcried, than I was
from a-farre off eſpied of certaine Pirates that lay there a roving
about the ſhoare, who having ſeized on mee, fell to a great ſtrife
whoſe of theirs I ſhould bee, but becauſe they ſaw mee growne
very weake with want and wearineſſe, they ſuffered mee to repoſe
my ſelfe, agreeing that the chance of the dice ſhould aſſigne mee an
owner. It was the eighth night that wee continued ſailing (though
they ſteered on no direct courſe, but romed up and downe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as occaſions offered them hope of booty) when I heard them
jarring among themſelves with ſwearing they were a-ground, and
crying out of the ſteere-man to hul, they ſeemed to be all at their wits
end, for feare of ſplitting. The winde was ſomewhat ſharpe, but
even and levell with the ſea, without any ſurging billowes; when
I (ſeeing my ſelfe fallen into the hands of ſuch a rabble of raſcals, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
either to free my ſelf or die) threw me down into the ſea with
a plancke, whilſt the Foiſt (carried away with the winde) got farre
wide of me, in the twinkling of an eye; &amp; the night being ſo obſcure,
as I could not deſcrie the ſhore, I kept my ſelfe ſetled on the
plancke till the morning, when being by wearineſſe and faſting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the paſſe wherein you found me, I had the fortune to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this benefit from ſo worthy a <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who will vouchſafe
(as I hope) to helpe me yet to get home to my father, as I beſeech
your Highneſſe to doe, obliging thereby both him and I, for all the
remnant of our lives time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena,</hi> who had attentively liſtned to the refluxes of ſo unjuſt a
fortune in a <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of ſo great merit, and who had before under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by others the former paſſages, ſaid thus unto her; (Noble and
vertuous <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>) there is not any debt due from mee to the gods
(although I owe them many) which I eſteeme greater than their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made of me the inſtrument to breake off (as I hope) the courſe
of your misfortunes. I beſeech you to reſt you merry, and to thinke
your ſelfe at home at your own Royall fathers houſe, whither I will
ſend you ſo well accompanied, as you ſhall not neede to feare either
<hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> or the Pirats. Here are the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to
whom I pray you to make your ſelfe known, and to any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
for I do not only care little, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Catalogna</hi> know
that I profeſſe friendſhip unto you, but meane to make him know
withall that I will for your ſake profeſſe enmitie to him. And then
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7477:73"/>
without ſtaying for an anſwer, (having ſent for the two brothers
that ſtaid to come in unto them) ſhe related ſuccinctly unto them the
recited Hiſtorie: wherewith as <hi>Polimero</hi> was tranſported to an
affect of compaſſion, ſo was <hi>Metaneone</hi> violently carried beyond
himſelfe with a paſſion of wrath, diſcourſing and arguing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
how that all the ill done this innocent Lady, was intended
to the making miſerable of his <hi>Eromilia;</hi> being very ſorrie he had not
known it ſooner, for then <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> had not ſo eaſily ſlipt out of his
hands, whom (when his brothers affaires and his owne were once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
hee reſolved to chaſtiſe at any hand. With diverſe ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
comforted they <hi>Eleina,</hi> promiſing to hazard in her aſſiſtance
both their powers and lives, ſo as being by them thus conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſupplied with whatſoever befitted her ſtate
and qualitie; ſhe thanked the gods for having by ſuch infortunate
meanes, ſo fortunately conducted her thither. Two dayes then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſpatch't <hi>Eromena</hi> a well furniſht Galley to the King of <hi>Arelate,</hi>
with hers, and his daughters letters, not conſenting to let her goe
her ſelfe, becauſe ſhee intended to detaine her ſome dayes, till ſhee
were recovered of her ſufferings, and then to ſend her home better
accompanied.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the two brothers conferred together of their
affections, impatiently expecting the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona's</hi> returne;
whileſt the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (to prevent the loſſe of time) aſſured her
ſelfe of <hi>Luogodori:</hi> confiſcating the eſtates of the Rebells, and
therewith bountifully recompencing the merits of diverſe
Knights, that had in this warre worthily behaved themſelves,
ſo as the kingdome was in a ſmall time peaceably ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi> having got all things requiſite for his charge,
haſted over into <hi>Sardegna,</hi> where receiving intelligence of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
at <hi>Terranova,</hi> he fetching about the Ilands end came to <hi>Portodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torre,</hi>
and leaving the Fleete ride there, went thence to <hi>Saſſari,</hi> where
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> then reſided. The <hi>Princes</hi> (having courteouſly embraced
him) and underſtood of the expedition hee brought with him, were
thereof exceeding joyfull; but <hi>Eromenaes</hi> joyes farre tranſcended
theirs, hoping that this <hi>Corſan</hi> enterprize would make up her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagno</hi> (who in his youth had beene one of
the moſt amorous Knights of his time, and who by great practiſe on
himſelfe and others, was growne to be a skilfull Phyſiognomiſt in
the affaires of love) ſeeing her deſires written in her face, thus
ſpake unto her; Your Highneſſe hath done for the ſtate one of the
two things you ſhould doe to make it become fully happy, opulent
and flouriſhing (which is) to have reduced it after ſuch great tempeſts
of war and rebellion to the pleaſant calme of peace and obedience.
The other thing that is yet to doe, is, to finde out a husband wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of you, to the end that you may have a companion to beare a
ſhare with you in ſupporting the weightie burthen of governement,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7477:73"/>
and to beſtow on us a faire, goodly, and generous poſteritie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> bluſhing (though well pleaſed with ſo unexpected a
propoſition) returned him this anſwer; Certainely I beleeve (Cozen)
that you never meant to be old, ſeeing that you are not yet about to
leave off your youthfull humours, would you have me marrie, when
there is no man (for ought I know) that will have me; Do you thinke
it a thing ſeemly or fitting for one of my ſex and qualitie to go woo
for a husband? By the high gods (replied the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi>) your
Highneſſe hath reaſon to conceive of me as you do; for by my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
I would never grow old; Where is that man living that deſires
to be unpleaſant? Take away but the jocondneſſe of our thoughts,
and what are we (old men) good for? ſeeing melancholy makes a
man noyſome, both to himſelfe and others; and mirth in old age is
the gift of heaven; It conſerves a man, and makes his company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
deſired of every one, which if in youth it be diſſolute and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
yet hath it in graver yeares its gravitie, and its peculiar
wayes, ſo as under the barke of pleaſantneſſe lies hidden the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Theoricke and Practicke of the world, which being
the onely booke for perfecting man, inſtructs without error, unleſſe
error bee caught hold of, in its beginnings, and in the ſimple vulgar
opinions. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſmiled at his diſcourſe, and (to give him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter thereof) ſhe replied.</p>
               <p>Oh how ſimple are thoſe <hi>encomions</hi> you make of old age, of that
ſhivering age, which cannot be pleaſant, becauſe it wants the vigour
of bloud, the efficient cauſe of mirth. Your Highneſſe may reaſon as
you thinke good (anſwered the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi>) that reaſon of yours may
hold good in old dotards, as (being long ſithence fallen from being
any more themſelves) are good for nothing; but yet give me leave
to tell you that ſuch as fortifie their minds, againſt the defects of
time with good governement, againſt fortune by enjoying her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
indifferently, and againſt their owne rebellious affections, by
having gotten a habitude of commanding them, fall not under the
cenſure of this your reaſon; for ſuch (keeping themſelves from both
extremes, (that is) from ſuch things as befit no other than young
men, and from exceſſe of melancholy (which is moſt habituall in old
men) may (finding themſelves free from mentall perturbations)
conſerve themſelves a long time in a healthfull and pleaſant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in whom if mirth cannot engender love, yet makes it them at
leaſtwiſe become more ſociable and uſefull to ſuch as are enamored,
not without awaking withall the memory of their owne particular
loves, which in them cannot for all that bee blamed, for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within the limits of an affection overſwayed by reaſon. You
will ſay then (replied the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) that if an old man would conſerve
himſelfe in a blithſome diſpoſition, he then ought by conſequence
to procure its effects, and therefore the effects of love. I ſay it, and yet
I ſay it not (anſwerd the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi>) The wife old man may bee
maſter of the affects of the minde, but not of the progreſſions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neceſſarie to the conſideration of ſuch effects, againſt which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7477:74"/>
there is no word either of Prudence or Philoſophy that can ſuffice;
Yet remaines there in him, I know not what thing, which I cannot
expreſſe, that makes him, though having himſelfe laid by his armes,
delight nevertheleſſe to ſee them exerciſed by young men in the
termes of legall affection. Now touching what I have motioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, your Highneſſe ſhould doe it of your ſelfe, and not wonder
at me as you doe, for if I were not growne old, I would not ſtay till
ſome other ſhould put mee in minde of buſineſſes of that nature.
Whereat the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſmiled, ſaying; And whom (Cozen) ſhall I
take to husband? There is to <hi>Prince</hi> but will (when he hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me) reſide in his owne countrey; and I againe will by no meanes
leave mine: and for wedding a private man, who will commend
me? Neither the one nor the other ſhould your Highneſſe doe (ſaid
he) but reade a meane path betweene both; and being asked how?
he proceeded ſaying, I meane ſome <hi>Prince</hi> noble and valourous,
though without any means, for ſuch a one can not be ſaid to be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, who (in being a <hi>Prince</hi>) ſhall bee a match befitting your
greatneſſe, and (for having no dominions) will doe all whatſoever
is requiſite for your affaires. Yea, but could you name me ſuch a
one? (asked with a grave countenance the <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>) Marry, that can
I well, <hi>Madame</hi> (anſwered the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi>) Whom could your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ever chuſe more noble, valiant, and generally beloved of all
men, than the <hi>Infante Polimero?</hi> Whereat ſhe (changing her colour,
and ſtanding a while in a muze) ſaid; I know, that to match my ſelfe
is neceſſarie, becauſe to continue as I am, is for many reſpects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
unto me; albeit (as your ſelfe know) I have ever had but
a ſmall inclination therto; but the maine difficultie conſiſts in finding
out ſuch a one as may give the people ſatisfaction. I cannot denie but
that the <hi>Infante Polimero</hi> ownes all thoſe conditions you ſpeake of,
yet reaſon will not that I be ſhe he ſhould aime at, neither beleeve I,
that he will ever offer to looke for me, for feare (perhaps) of being
rejected for want of meanes. Nevertheleſſe if you thinke that this
marriage may make for the publike good of the kingdome, take
you care then of the managing thereof, and (for my owne part) I
promiſe you not to ſwerve from your Counſell.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> kneeling downe before her, and kiſſing her hand,
undertooke the charge thereof, aſſuring her he would conduct it in
ſuch a manner, as ſhe ſhould therewith reſt well ſatisfied, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
he afterwards accordingly performed: for taking opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold of an occaſion to exaggerate before the Councell, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the two <hi>Mauritanian Princes,</hi> and to exalt the valour of the
younger; and deſcending handſomely thence to the occaſions and
affaires of the time, to the infirmitie and decadency of the King, to
the ſex of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (though valorous, yet feminine) he at laſt in
generall termes propoſed the neceſſitie of matching her with ſuch a
husband, as might reſide in the kingdome. Whereupon all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Princes,</hi> and others alſo further off being named and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
he found oppoſitions againſt every one, except <hi>Polimero,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7477:74"/>
age and nature, hee conſidered to be apt to receive the aire and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of <hi>Sardegna;</hi> who although hee wanted Dominions and
meanes, yet wanted hee not forces and warlike troopes, but could
upon any occaſion procure (as hee had done at that preſent) great
ſupplies of his father and brother, whoſe amitie was more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and enmity more dangerous to <hi>Sardegna,</hi> than all the reſt of the
neighbouring <hi>Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there were that feared there was ſome diſſembling or
double dealing in this buſineſſe, ſo patly propoſed in the inſtant of
the arrivall of the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> forces, as if they menat, in caſe they
could not obtaine their deſire by faire meanes, to enforce them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
with their powers; which the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> perceiving, aſſured ſuch
of their being therein miſtaken: wiſhing them withall to deliver
themſelves freely, if they thought that ſuch a match would prove
any way inutile or prejudiciall unto them, aſſuring them of the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanian</hi>
troopes, as well as of their owne native <hi>Sardegnans.</hi> Their
diſputations were at length reduced into reſolutions; that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was neceſſarie; that there was not alliance nor
match better, nor fitter for her, than that of the <hi>Mauritanian Infante:</hi>
and that the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> ſhould treat therof, by way of propoſition, as
proceeding from himſelfe, giving thereby rather way and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the <hi>Infante,</hi> to demand her, than cauſe to beleeve, that
they were already reſolved to give her him. The joy that <hi>Eromena</hi>
thereof conceived, as it was exceeding great, ſo was it nevertheleſſe
exceeded with an incomparable prudence, whereby ſhe well knew
how to conceale it, anſwering the Councell that they ſhould finde
her conformable to their deliberation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> after hee had delivered his Lords letters, and
diſcharged himſelf of the troopes and Galleys, being licenced to go
on his Embaſſage, wafted off (as ſoone as he had received the <hi>Princes</hi>
letters) with a proſperous gale for <hi>Maiorica,</hi> where he, and the other
Embaſſadours were received with all ſuch ſolemnities, as befitted
the Embaſſadours of ſo great a King. And becauſe the buſineſſe was
before reſolved of, and this ſolemne office done, meerely for publike
ſatisfaction; it was eaſily concluded on, and <hi>Eromilia</hi> promiſed to
<hi>Metaneone Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> upon the ſole condition, that ſhee
would ever marrie at all.</p>

with a reaſonable indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
wrought a generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
ſo as ſuch as before
had her heard commended for
the extraordinary induſtries of nature obſerved in her, now rapt with
new (partly curious, and partly amorous) affections deemed that
man happy, whoſe fortune it were to winne her in this loſſe of her
ſelfe, being it ſeemed not ſo inconvenient for any other, to finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
to ſteale her away; as for her, to invent (her ſelfe) the
meanes of depriving her ſelfe of the world. And albeit the buſineſſe
in it ſelfe ſtood not founded on reaſon, that a <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (eſpecially of
ſo great a merit) ſhould be conſtrained to alter her (upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſoever grounded) indeede rather compaſſionable than blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
reſolution. Nevertheleſſe ſome diſcourſing by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7477:76"/>
approved it as an act lawfull to ſearch after, and finding to
gather up ſuch Iewels, which throwne away by an unwiſe (and as it
were) a prodigall owner, were expoſed to the hazard of being
ſtolne away by the unworthy, and ſo to become ſubject to light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their baſe and abject hands; neither could ſuch an attempt (ſo it

tended to gaine, yet doth every kinde of labour deſerve its hire, nor
is that kinde of uſury unlawfull which in recompence of its paines,
deſires but the ſimple lone of the thing found.</p>
               <p>Suchlike were the reaſonings of ſundry young <hi>Princes</hi> of divers
Countries, who like ſphericall lines came to meete all in one and the
ſame center; nor is it any wonder that a cauſe remote, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and bring forth the ſelfeſame reſpects in perſons remote each
from other, ſeeing the univerſall ſoule that moves and inſpires the
vaſte world, is even one and the ſame. But thoſe (among the reſt)
that gave themſelves moſt to theſe imaginations, were the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Tingitana</hi> and one of his brothers, with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> and
<hi>Granada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Tingitana</hi> in thoſe dayes commanded as Soveraigne
all that part of <hi>Afſrike</hi> that lies on the Ocea ſea, as farre as ſix de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond our <hi>Tropike,</hi> growne to be great there by fortune and
reach of wit, (if wicked ſubtiles may be ſtiled the effects of wit.)
This King had foure ſonnes, that were ever at diſcord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who (having together with their breaſt-milke ſucked ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and deſire of rule) could never quiet themſelves with other
thought than in being every of them left ſole without competitors.
The King old of yeares, but elder in wickedneſſe, growne expert in
knowing the pravitie of his ſonnes by his owne, moved rather by
a jealous zeale of himſelfe than any affection he bore them, had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them aſunder, by aſſigning to each of them the governement
of a kingdome; with the revenewes whereof they maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in an honourable and ſplendide faſhion, without ever abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the precepts of ſoothing &amp; diſſembling being a maxime placed
in the frontiſpice of the ſchoole of thoſe (therein ſo accompliſhed)
<hi>Princes;</hi> wherein every of them ſo exceedingly profited, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſelfe, though a great experientiſt in that art, was (for all his
cunning) deceived for beleeving thoſe affectionate-ſeeming demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations

at ſo large diſtances, eſpecially the two eldeſt, who troubled him
more than the reſt; but humane prudence is wont to light on often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by ſhunning, what but for ſhunning, it had not encountred: for
<hi>Orgilo</hi> (having underſtood by the Lord of <hi>Velez</hi> of the comming of

alienated, as (for having never harboured a gentle qualitie) he gave
himſelfe over to be a ſordid receptacle of all kinde of foule and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
enterpriſes: onely one ſole thing in him ſeemed to looke
with a face of vertue, which was a bodily force inconſiderately uſed,
and a generous ſeeming ſpirit, the abundance of his vices ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him too much from being able to lodge, either true magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
or reall bounty: With ſuch and the like qualities purpoſed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilo</hi>

and how hee had cauſed to be calked and rigged a Galley in <hi>Mamora</hi>
for the ſtealing away of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica</hi> (thinking hee might
better bring his project to paſſe by ſea, ariving unawares, than by land
with the ruſhing noiſe of people, wherwith he might alſo run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of working a jeloufie in his father) thought now or never to lay
hold on this ſo fit an occaſion to cruſh him, and therwithal to poſſeſſe
the beauty of the moſt famous maiden in the world. Seteld in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
he cauſed two Galleyes to be put in a readines with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
as he was ſhip'd and at ſea, ere it was openly known that he
had any intention to embarke himſelfe; ſteering on, becauſe of the
length of the voiage, night and day till hee came to lie in ambuſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
a little rock, without the ſtreights of <hi>Collonne;</hi> where, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by a frigat which he ſent before to <hi>Mamora,</hi> that his brother
ſtood on the point of departure, and well knowing that the <hi>Pegno della

concerning a buſineſſe much importing her Highneſſe, whereat
<hi>Perſeno</hi> (thinking he came from the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi>) came down
to the ſea-ſhore to welcome him, having already underſtood by <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neones</hi>
letters all things that had ſucceeded him ſithence his departure
thence, as the taking of <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> and his deſignes, the King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorica's</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:7477:77"/>
promiſe of giving him his daughter, his arrival in <hi>Sardegna</hi> &amp;
finding out of his brother, with the hiſtorie of <hi>Eleina,</hi> and of the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanian</hi>
Ambaſſadors ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his father to the King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that marriage; neither was it twenty dayes ſithence there had
arrived a Galley ſent by the King himſelfe, with particular newes of
the promiſe he had made, of which he wrote not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
thinking it better that the <hi>Counteſſe &amp; Perſeno</hi> ſhould at ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
opportunitie, poſſeſſe her thereof, charging them by ſeverall
letters to perſwade her therto. So as <hi>Perſeno,</hi> thinking now that ſome
one ſent from <hi>Metaneone</hi> brought him the ſame newes, came running
downewards; when hee ſoone perceived himſelfe beguiled, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
this ſtranger knight by his ſpeech and habit to be none of his,
growne by this meanes ſomewhat ſuſpicious, and ſeeing the other in
his anſwer not fall from generalities, but perſiſting in ſaying he had
letters to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> touching a buſineſſe of much conſequence, he
uſhered him up, entertaining him with the beſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance that could
be, and then recommending him to the company of ſome Knights of
ſpeciall eſteeme, he placed him to ſup with them, wherehe dranke his
ſhare of the precious wines of <hi>Malaga,</hi> wherewith they ceaſed not to
ply him, till ſuch time as he was knowne to be grownei ſomewhat
altered. <hi>Perſeno</hi> in the meane time, having made privy hereto the
<hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and acquainted her with his ſuſpicion, beſought her by all
meanes to give him audience, which ſhe refuſing to doe in reſpect of
her vow, <hi>Gieroſando</hi> (falling a perſwading of her to doe it) told her,
that her vow bound her not from ſuch perſons, which though it did,
yet could it but tie her onely from being ſeene, but not from being
ſpoken unto, and that therefore ſhe might well ſpeake with him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permitting her ſelfe to be ſeene of him: much adoe had they to
perſwade her to it, till at length, being'egged on with the neceſſity of
knowing the buſineſſei ſhe ſuffered her ſelfe to be over-ſwayed.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger was therefore brought in, and a candle ſo placed,
as ſhe could not be ſeene; whereat he (being already informed of
the occaſion of the vow) was no whit diſpleaſed, but ſent in before
him his letters of credit; which when the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> had peruſed, and
ſeene whence they were ſent, ſhe grew to be more curions and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to heare him, who uſed not many words, and thoſe few ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
and worſe linkt together, whereby was diſcovered unto her the
deſigne of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tingitana,</hi> and how that <hi>Anteraſto</hi> came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to defend her, being as he was a Knight obliged ſo to do, but
that in regard the other was his brother, he would not give the King
of <hi>Tingitana</hi> his father cauſe to thinke, that he thus aſſailing him by
the way, was moved ſo to doe for any other end, than for the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Knight-hood, in reſpect whereof he intended to give
him leave to come under the rocke, and there to puniſh him; which
he had done without making her privie to it, but that he doubted that
ſhe (not knowing how the matter ſtood) might feare ſome ſudden aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.
The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſtood hereat ſome while in a muze, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him any anſwer; till by queſtioning him how <hi>Anteraſto</hi> came to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7477:77"/>
know of this attempt and what moved him to incurre the hazzard of
ſuccouring her againſt his own brother, ſhe gave him occaſion to tell
more than was either demanded of him, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge to
reveale; Inſomuch as he affirmed that the deſire of enjoying her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; the affectionate love he bare her, made her become his brothers
enemie. Now <hi>Eromilia</hi> had formerly underſtood of their hatred and
malice, whereby ſhee knew that the occaſion of this ſervice, ſprung
not from any love to her, but rather from the hate he bare to his
brother, and that ſuch like love in ſubjects that obſcured the ſweete
affection of fraternitie, could not prove to her otherwiſe than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
and unluckie; reviving therefore her memorie with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
of the Pirats, than whom ſhe judged theſe more dangerous,
ſhe anſwered him, that ſhe held her ſelfe obliged to the <hi>Infante Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſto,</hi>
which ſhe would make knowne to the King her father; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beir
ſhe marvailed much that a <hi>Prince</hi> ſo noble, as his brother was,
could harbour ſo theeviſh a ſpirit, eſpecially conſidering how ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
in the territories of <hi>Tingitana,</hi> where ſhe expected to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
rather by him than by any other. Howſoever ſhee bade him,
(ſeeing he was ſo minded) come and ſpare not, for that ſhe was not
ſo ill provided of men and munition, as that ſhe had not thereof both
number and ſtore, ſufficient to defend her ſelfe. And that therefore
ſeeing the comming of his Lord <hi>Anteraſto</hi> was needleſſe, ſhe praied
him to ſpare himſelfe that labour; aſwell for that ſhe ſtood in no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
thereof, as alſo becauſe ſhe deſired not that he gave his father
the King of <hi>Tingitana</hi> any cauſe of diſguſt, who could not chuſe but
ſuſpect the worſt of theſe his proceedings: and then rewarding the
Knight with rich preſents, ſhe licenced him. But to the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi>
who ſeemed to be ſorrie that ſhe accepted not the aſſiſtance of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraſto,</hi>
ſhe ſaid, She was loth to give him any occaſion or excuſe to
come, being aſſured that his purpoſe was no leſſe abhominable
than his brothers, and that (God willing) ſhee would defend her
ſelfe from the one and the other.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing which the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> did, was to ſend away the two
Galleyes that rode in the haven to ſave them, being disfurniſhed of
their ſouldiers, emploied for the manning of the holds within, from
being ſeazed on by the enemy, but much rather to give her father
notice of the danger wherein ſhe ſtood; and then cauſed all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be ſevered into divers places, not doubting of being able to
defend her ſelfe for many moneths, the place being well fortified
and provided of victuals.</p>
               <p>By no means would the faithfull <hi>Perſeno</hi> loſe this ſo fit an occaſion
of letting her ſee, how that her ſtay there was an invitation to any
one to come to ſteale her away, who being till then extolled for her
vertues and prudence, was now like enough to incurre a contrary
cenſure, ſeeing the daily perills ſufficed not, either to make her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more warie, or to change her reſolution. Beſides, the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and diſtaſts of her father, who hazarded the bearing the brunt of
ſome dangerous warre, with one <hi>Prince</hi> or other, whereof two
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7477:78"/>
might pretend themſelves already injured, who were thoſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogna</hi>
and <hi>Tingitana;</hi> telling her withall, that God requires not of
us ought beyond our power, but is diſpleaſed when under colour
of doing him ſervice, we doe what we ſhould not doe: that <hi>Peros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ilo's</hi>
ſoule could receive no ſatisfaction from theſe her lugubrous
loves; but that her age, the lawes, the kingdome, and the King her
father deſired an end in this buſineſſe; and that if heretofore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her to match her ſelfe for convenienceies ſake; ſhe was now by
neceſſitie conſtrained thereto, it behoving her of force to have
one to defend her, and to give her ſelfe to one, thereby to avoide the
being thus injured by all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromilia</hi> bluſhed to ſee her ſelfe ſo neerely touched with theſe
reaſons, knowing them to be true, by the feeling ſhe had of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
dangers, more than by any thing elſe, which ſeconded rather
with the teares, than the arguments of the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> drew her at laſt
to promiſe them (as ſoone as her yeare ended) to returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Full glad were the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> and <hi>Perſeno,</hi> to have gained on
her this point, beyond their expectation, and therefore tooke further
occaſion to inſtill into her memorie the modeſtie of <hi>Metaneone,</hi> who,
finding her <hi>Pegno della morte</hi> unwalled and diſarmed, would not ſo
much as offer once to put foote aſhore, for feare of diſpleaſing her;
and now they obſerving, that his name ſounded pleaſantly in her
eares, and that ſhe liſtned willingly thereto, ſignified ſo much unto
the King. <hi>Perſeno</hi> writing beſides unto <hi>Metaneone,</hi> whom hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
to favour them with a convoy, being that her father had not
a Fleete ſufficiently potent to reſiſt ſo many enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anteraſto's</hi> meſſenger returned in the ſelfe ſame time, when by
her flagges was deſcried <hi>Orgilo's</hi> Galley gliding ſmoothly on the
chryſtal ſurface of the calme ſea, glittering by reaſon of the reflexion
of the golden Sunne-beames, nor was it long ere ſhe entred into the
ſtreights, where they loſt ſight of her. She paſſed ſome foure houres
before night, and went with an intention (being that the winde
withſtood her not) to arrive the day following at the <hi>Pegno della
morte</hi> ere the breake of day, thinking that houre of all other the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
time to ſurprize it.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Anteraſto</hi> wayed anchor, and coaſting <hi>Spaine,</hi>
tooke on him to ſteere a different way, but at night tacking about,
held the ſame courſe, by croſſing the ſtreights, and coaſting along
the ſhore of <hi>Affricke;</hi> wondring not a little why <hi>Eromilia</hi> would
not be ſeene, for which he beleeved not her vow an excuſe ſufficient,
becauſe he, that never was of any Religion, or ever knew the gods,
judged of all others by himſelfe. And underſtanding further (by
the meſſenger) wonders of her perfections, which the more unapt
he was to judge of, ſeemed by ſo much the more ſtrange unto him,
he grew the more deſirous to poſſeſſe her.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe two (ſo neere in bloud and reſolution) were poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
towards the fatall place prepared for them by deſtinie; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(reſolved to repreſent now a complete Tragedie) had in her
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7477:78"/>
ſeene aſſembled the two <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> which
with an equall deſigne, had each of them put in order a Galley, to
come to the poſſeſſion of thoſe beauties which were judged ſo much
the fairer, by how much the more they were hid and prohibited.
Their fathers Dominions were ſomewhat neere adjoyning, but
their thoughts ſo farre from any neereneſſe of ſympathizing one the
others, as they themſelves but too well knew, that either of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
endevoured to croſſe the others intentions. Nor ſhould it ſeeme
ſtrange that all of them ranne with ſo ſmall forces to this enterprize;
being that their hope and aime was not to force the rocke, but to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
it, for who ſo would have made proviſion to take it by force,
had need of greater power than theirs within, or (attempting it with
an equall force) of time, (the father of inventions,) wherewith the
neighbours would have beene awaked, and ſo the execution of
their deſignes interrupted. Wherehence we may gather, that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
and imprudent counſell proves oftentimes better than a prudent
and mature direction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> had before his ſetting forth of the haven,
deſcried afarre off a Galley, who croſſing the ſeas, tooke the direct
courſe he meant to ſteere, ſuſpecting therefore that others might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
as hee did, he launcing out, traced her, till ſuch time as (the
Sunne declined) the darkeneſſe deprived him of the ſight of her.
The other, who was the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> albeit ſhe ſaw this Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
make after her, yet was ſhe nothing ſuſpitious of her, but ſteering
onwards, arrived by three houres of the night, at <hi>Pegno della morte,</hi>
with as little noiſe as poſſibly ſhe could, ſuffering her ſelfe to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
meerely with the force of her courſe without any further helpe
of oares: which nevertheleſſe was not ſo ſecretly performed, but
that the ſcouts of the <hi>Pegno</hi> deſcried her, expecting (becauſe of the
notice given them) no leſſe than to be aſſaulted. The Knights, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any noiſe ſtood every man ready to make good his ground,
and (that the enemie might thinke himſelfe the more ſecure) as
much as the very rounds had retired themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> (armed at all pieces) was the firſt that ſet foot
on ground, follow'd by two hundred reſolute ſpirits (the greater part
wherof were of the braveſt Knights in his Countrie) amongſt whom
one (who had bin there before to view the fortificarions) was the firſt
man that (by a ſcaling ladder) mounted the walls, cauſing (in the
ſelfeſame inſtant) divers othes to be faſtned in places leſſe difficult.
The great ſilence kept within, made them hold the enterprize for
accompliſhed, there being neither Centrees, nor rounds to be ſeene.
But the skaling ladders were no ſooner full, than (with the ſhowring
downe from on high, of logs of timber, fire and ſtones) the aſſayers
were all beaten downe, bruiſed and kil'd, and the ladders (for the
moſt part) torne and rent all to pieces. Whereupon the <hi>Prince</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
the aſſault, and looſing then more than before, ſeeing the
place inacceſſible, retired himſelfe, juſt as there came a Galley
ruſhing into the port with great fury; upon the ſudden arrival
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7477:79"/>
whereof he (neither knowing whoſe ſhe was, nor willing to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſo many, making up a ſquadron of ſuch as remained alive) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
downe to the ſea ſhore, to ſee whom it was; but receiving no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he waxed bolder, and juſt as he opened his mouth to haile them
againe (with his beaver lift up) there hit him a ſhaft in the very
mouth, that pierced him quite through the nape of the necke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
ſhowred ſo great a cloud of arrowes on the reſt of his troope,
that almoſt all of them lay dead in the place; whileſt thoſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluzia</hi>
not ſo much as once quitted their ſtanding, whoſe <hi>Prince</hi> mad
angry for being diſcovered, aſſayling with a ſudden furie the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadan</hi>
Galley, eaſily tooke her, and underſtanding whoſe ſhee was,
was paſſing glad thereof.</p>
               <p>Theſe two <hi>Princes</hi> were Cozen-germanes, growne at ods for
certaine lands, and other pretentions of the brothers their fathers,
become now withall rivals and pretenders to one and the ſame beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which ſole occaſion had been ſufficient ground of enmitie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover
the <hi>Andaluzian Prince</hi> could not chuſe but grieve now that he
ſaw the other dead, being that neereneſſe of bloud, muſt needs worke
ſomething in any one, whoſe heart is not waxen altogether inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
and reſolutely given up to hate and revenge. Yet was not the
Tragicke example of his Cozens death, ſufficient to warne this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Prince</hi> from tumbling downe the precipice of the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
albeit by the chillineſſe of divers ſhivering feares his firſt heate
were frozen, for growne now neere his end, he could not give place
to the oppoſition of reaſon, becauſe it lay not in his power to reſiſt
the will of heaven; ſo as ſeeing himſelfe thus guided by ſo wavering a
paſſion in the place where his misfortune led him on to ſlay his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
he more now enraged than enamoured, commanded his men to
give the aſſault, reſolved (now that he found himſelfe growne to
that paſſe) either to take the rocke or die. But alas, what could he
doe with ſo few men againſt that hold, which was of its naturall ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
ſo ſtrong as it could not be won but either by ſurpriſall, or
by farre greater forces, than his were? Whileſt he, thus deſpairing
of what he would have done, but much more deſperate for what he
had done, made account to retire himſelfe, behold the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitana</hi>
(hearing the noiſe of the conflict) comes ſweeping amaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſwelling waves, and ſeeing the two Galleyes left unmanned,
thought it his beſt courſe to ſeaze on them, left they might be made
inſtruments to indamage him, which he ſoone accompliſhed, for
finding in them but very few fighting men, he put them all to the
ſword (without ſparing one of them) even to the imbruing his
<hi>Princely</hi> blade in the baſe bloud of the raskally Ghing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> ſeeing himſelfe thus ſurprized (having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
his men from the walls) ſtood ready to receive this ſecond un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
for enemy, who landing with no great difficultie, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by a priſoner the caſe of the Cozens, (growne cholericke
to ſee his deſigne thus thwarted) came fiercely on with ſword in
hand, deſirous rather to kill him with his owne hands, though with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7477:79"/>
danger, than to ſhoote him through with arrowes as he might have
done without any perill at all.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Prince Orgilo</hi> was great of ſtature, and ſtrong as any Knight
of his time, who for knowing himſelfe to be ſuch, never knew what
feare meant, which engendred in him an undaunted temeritie. But
as his force was greater than that of a ſavage beaſt, ſo was his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
leſſe than that of man. Stay to be backed by his he would not,
but went on himſelfe alone, to charge them all, and had made them
all retire too, had there but beene any place of retreit.</p>
               <p>The poore <hi>Andaluzo</hi> ſtood almoſt under the walls, whom <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeno</hi>
taking for <hi>Orgilo</hi> (as he tooke alſo <hi>Orgilo</hi> for <hi>Anteraſto</hi>) defeated
with logs and ſtones; ſo as the true <hi>Orgilo</hi> had no great adoe to make
an end of the reſt, having firſt with his owne hands killed the <hi>Prince</hi>
as he had deſired: which effected, he knew not what to doe next; but
he from below, and <hi>Perſeno</hi> (with his) from above, ſtood looking
the one on the other without ſpeaking a word.</p>
               <p>The night was exceeding faire, ſo as the Moone being then newly
riſen, diſcovered them each to other; When <hi>Orgilo</hi> (ſeeing himſelfe
injured by none, and thinking to delude them) told them who hee
was; and that being advertized of the intentions of theſe two <hi>Princes,</hi>
he was come of purpoſe to interrupt and chaſtiſe them, being an act
that concerned him, not ſo much for being <hi>Prince</hi> of that Countrey,
as becauſe he more than any other was deſirous to ſerve the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
of <hi>Maiorica</hi> their Miſtreſſe. <hi>Perſeno</hi> (diſſembling his knowledge in
thoſe paſſages) anſwered him, That that act of his was ſuch as might
bee expected from a juſt and generous <hi>Prince,</hi> for which he kindly
thanked him, on the behalfe of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and the King her father,
both which would therefore remaine his debtors, but that he was
onely ſorry for one thing, which was, that he had put himſelfe to
that trouble without any neede, for if he thought himſelfe able to
oppoſe two <hi>Princes,</hi> and fruſtrate their deſignes with one onely Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
hee might eaſily have imagined that the qualitie of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi>
her ſervants, was not ſo lither and effeminate, not their
valour ſo ſlender, as not to know how to defend themſelves againſt
ſo few in a place ſo ſtrong: and that therefore it had beene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for him to have ſent the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> intelligence thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expoſing himſelfe to ſuch a hazard; or if he would needs come,
wherefore came he not then by land, which he might have more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
done, and with more men too, being that there wanted no
Barkes at <hi>Velez,</hi> to paſſe them over to the rocke? Strange ſeemed
this language to <hi>Orgilo,</hi> who judged him too arrogant, and withall
too ſawcily ſubtle for penetrating and touching him ſo neere the
quicke of the truth, which made him diſdainefully thus reply; I
know not what thou art, that ſpeakeſt thus indiſcreetly; I hold the
Lady <hi>Princeſſe</hi> for the moſt courteous damzell of the world, ſo as I
have cauſe to wonder, that ſhe retaines in her ſervice a fellow ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous
as thou art: It beſits not thee to examime or pry into the
actions of <hi>Princes</hi> who governe themſelves according to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7477:80"/>
uncontrouled wils and underſtandings, not ſtaying to have
their actions ſcanned, by the meaſure of the common judgement of
the vulgar, for the moſt part falſe and remote from any true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Somewhat more hee would have ſaid, when his owne men
(pointing with their fingers) ſhewed him two Galleyes that came
entring the port, whereupon (beleeving them to belong to one of
the dead <hi>Princes</hi>) he ranne haſtily to the ſhore to hinder their diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking.</p>
               <p>All this while had <hi>Anter aſto</hi> haſtned the beſt he could, for feare of
comming too late, doubting of the fortunate temeritie of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whom he aſſured himſelfe the Rocke could not eaſily be
won by ſo few men as his troopes conſiſted of, if his brother but
once poſſeſſed it. And ſeeing ride there three Galleyes, he was not
affraid of them, but marvailed to ſee them ſo ſilent, taking them to
belong to the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and imagining that his brother was not as
yet there arrived: drawing neerer them, and ſeeing two of them full
of dead bodies, and the their with the colours of <hi>Orgilo</hi> (which he
ſoone deſcried together with himſelfe ſtanding on the ſhore) he
imagined that he had taken the Galleyes, but that for not being able
to take the Rocke, he had then retired himſelfe. His firſt reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to ſeaze on the Galleyes which ſucceded him fortunately,
for cauſing his Archers to play at thoſe ſquadrons he ſaw marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on the ſhore, hee gave them no time to remount aboord their
Galleyes, as they ſought to have done, ſhooting them at his pleaſure,
though to no great hurt of thoſe others, who (kneeling on the
ground, and covering themſelves with Targets cloſed together one
athwart another) ſheltred themſelves from the ſhot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orgilo</hi> had with him the braveſt and experteſt ſouldiers of all
<hi>Aſſrike,</hi> ſo as though inferior in number, he no more feared this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
than if he had had equall forces to withſtand it; nor would he
retire himſelfe one ſteppe from the ground he ſtood on, which was
there, where ſuch as came a-ſhore, were of neceſſitie to land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anteraſto</hi> (ſeeing the ſlender ſervice his arrowes did him) made
on towards the ſhore with a Frigate, whereupon his men (ſeeing
him goe with ſo few, againſt enemies that ſo well defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
leapt into the water to ranke themſelves with him; who
would have found enough to doe, had they not beene armed with
launces, wherewith (maugre the obſtinate courage of <hi>Orgilo</hi>) they
forced a place to land the reſt of their troopes: yet him could they
never have forced, if his owne men had ſeconded him by doing as
much as he did, who not caring a ruſh for the pikes and launces, but
encountring them boldly, burſt them with his breaſt in ſhivers, ſo
confident was hee in the fine temper of his Cuyraſſe, not ſtirring
one inch off his ground, but blaſpheming heaven, and abuſively
injuring his followers, branding with infamous titles, and direfull
menaces the moſt valiant of them, who (having retired themſelves
not cowardly but diſcreetly for being over-matched in number and
armes,) as they forſooke him not in effect, ſo came they farre ſhort
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7477:80"/>
of equalling his temerity, reduced to the point of obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
not to ſtir thence a foot. <hi>Anteraſto,</hi> glad to ſee him brought
to this ſtreight, and deſirous to make uſe of this advantage, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his troopes to keep the enemies ſo ſeparated, as they might
not be able to come to re-unite themſelves any more with their
Captain; wherein hee was ſtraightwaies obeyed; for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of them falling into a cloſe order, interpoſed themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, leaving <hi>Orgilo</hi> all alone, without poſſibility of being
ſuccoured by any, whileſt hee, with his ſword in both hands, made
himſelfe large way, without being hurt of any; for all ſhun'd the
whisk of his mortall blade, which had by its keen cutting, ſhowne
it ſelfe to be both well tempered, and of fineſt edge and metall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anteraſto,</hi> who was a Knight of great valour, and though not ſo
ſtrong, yet more dexterous and warie than his brother, whom he
deſirous to kill with his own hands, (not ſo much for any diſtruſt
hee had of his, who would (if they had known him) have borne
him reſpect, as to carry away together with <hi>Eromilia</hi> and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the rich ſpoiles of three ſovereigne Princes) bravely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
him hand to hand, wounding him with a main blow on
the elbow of the ſword hand, which although it ſtruck him not
downe, becauſe of the goodneſſe of his armour, yet was it ſuch as
ſo benum'd him, as he was not able to requite him with the like: ſo
as favoured by this opportunity to make uſe of his point, he bore
him a thruſt under the vauntplate, between the two cuyſhard pieces,
burſting through the mail that aſſured that part of his body, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his ſword in his belly foure fingers beneath the navell. Full
well preceived <hi>Anteraſto</hi> that hee had mortally wounded him; yet
not ſatisfied with giving him his deaths wound, but deſirous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to let him dying know by whoſe hand hee fell. Pround wretch,
(ſaid he) th'art now come to that paſſe which thou thoughtſt by thy
treacheries to bring mee to; die thou ſhalt now (maugrethy ſtout
miſchievous heart) by my hand, and I will kill thee fairly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a good Knight, although thy treacherous life nver deſerved
at my hands ſo honourable a favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orgilo,</hi> knowing his brother, and not grieving ſo much for his
death, as to dye by his hand, ſeeing he could not uſe his right arm,
and that there was no way for him but death, being therefore loth
to loſe any time in making him any anſwer, hee (throwing away
his ſhield, and patiently ſuffering himſelf to be wounded anew,
without offring once to put by any thruſt) with his left arm ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
graſped <hi>Anteraſto,</hi> whom hee (being endued with extraordinary
force) bare to the Shore-brink, which was not above ten paces off,
with telling him, Die then I will, for ſo will my misfortune have
it, yet ſhalt not thou (inſulting traitour) out-live mee, for wee will
both march hand in hand to the other world, where if there be any
field to fight in, I now mortally defie thee to an eternall combate.
At which word throwing himſelf downe headlong into the water
with him, (maugre all his ſtrugling to get off) hee bare him downe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7477:81"/>
to the bottome, whence neither of them return'd ever ſithence
up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anteraſto's</hi> Knights, there preſent, little thinking to ſee their
wraſtling come to ſuch an end, were nothing carefull to help their
maſter, ſeeing the advantage hee had already, much leſſe when they
came to know his enemy; but when they ſaw both of them ſo plung'd
in the Sea, they remain'd thereat much aſtoniſhed. The Frigats
ranne to their ſuccour, but too late; and one who diſarmed himſelf
to dive under water to fetch them up, ſoone repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed him of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
when hee ſaw it was to no purpoſe at all, ſeeing that if they
were dead, all his labor was in vain; and if alive, yet was it more than
hee alone could do to bring them up again, who beſides would have
had ſo much ſenſe as to keep him under water with them, taking
him for an enemy, and ſo ſhould he have been drowned for at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man. But indeed, the truth is, that they cared not much for either
of them, all men fearing and hating as well the one of them as the
other; ſo as there were ſome of them that interpoſed themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two ſquadrons that yet continued fighting, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the caſe, and knowing themſelves for vaſſalls of one and
the ſame King, lifting up their arms (in token of accord) appeaſed
their mortall fury: But ſeeing themſelves on the rock, where they
imagined the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> to have great treaſures, they reſolved to force
the place, under pretext of revenging the death of their lords, by
ſacrificing to their ſoules the bodies of ſuch as defended it. Nor
could the ſtrong ſituation of the place reſtrain them, who grown
couragious by their falſe imagination, prepared themſelves to give
th'aſſault.</p>
               <p>Returned into <hi>Sardegna</hi> was the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi> with an happy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to his embaſſage, to perfect the happineſſe of Prince <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neone,</hi>
who the ſelfe ſame night in his ſweeteſt ſleep, thought he ſaw
ſome one awake him ingreat haſte; the chamber was without light,
yet thought he that all the wall on its foreſide ſtood open, ſo as by
Moon-light he might ſee, that he that awoke him was <hi>Perſeno.</hi> Fain
would hee have riſen on his elbow to ſalute him, when the other
(without uttering a word) keeping him down with one hand (with
a look melancholike, and all beſmear'd with blood) ſhewed him
with the other, the <hi>Pegno dellamorte</hi> aſſailed by many men, who
ſtrove to come ſcale the walls. <hi>Metaneone,</hi> turning about to know of
him who they were, &amp; how he came thither, loſt ſuddenly the ſight
of him, and deſirous thereupon to riſe up, he ſaw no more neither
battell, nor <hi>Pegno,</hi> nor any opening of the wall, but the obſcure
pitchy darkneſſe of the night, with the chamber in its former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
termes and dimenſions: come to know himſelfe awakened, he
marvelled much to ſee his imagination work ſo ſtrongly on him,
as to make him not onely think his dream true, but even to beleeve
that it was no dream at all. Return'd to ſleep again, there paſſed
not an hower ere hee was in the ſame manner again awakened by the
<hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Palomera:</hi> Seeing again through the breach of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7477:81"/>
chamber, the <hi>Pegno</hi> aſſaulted; but as he would have ask'd her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
he ſaw ſhe was quite vaniſhed away, &amp; in her place appeare the
<hi>Princeſſe</hi> his Lady and Miſtreſſe, who from the windowes of the
Caſtle, beckoned unto him to come to her ſuccour. Whereupon,
throwing away the coverler, and riſing up ſuddenly without further
examining whether it were a dream or no, now he ſaw himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
nor beleeving it leſſe true in that he ſaw the Well cloſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
having cald up his ſervants to bring him lights, he went to the
next chamber, where <hi>Polimero</hi> lay, to whom when he had related the
viſion, he told him, how he was reſolved to hie him thither, becauſe
he could not beleeve that this viſion (or dreame whatſoever it was)
contained not in it ſome myſterie; and had upon this parted ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but that the occaſions of the warres perſwaded him to ſtay
till day, for the avoiding of ſuch ſuſpicions, as might be concelved
of this nocturnall and ſudden reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> (being as yet very ſleepie) ſaid unto him, My Lord and
Brother, to ſtay till day will doubtleſſe prove to bee your beſt
courſe, becauſe ſo ſuddaine a departure cannot chuſe but be ill taken,
and much cenſured; eſpecially, ſeeing you cannot goe ſo alone, but
muſt take with you many of your Galleyes deſigned for the <hi>Corſan</hi>
enterpriſe. And (then having pawzed awhile) he proceeded. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve that either too light, or too free-feeding hath occaſioned
you this dreame; for being that you ſupped laſt night, theſe fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
could not proceede from any weakeneſſe; and on the other ſide,
ſeeing you fed not ſuperfluouſly, there is no place left for imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo particular, and diſtinct, as thoſe you ſaw; neither is (indeede)
your temperature or complexion, any way ſubject to melancholy;
but I ſhould rather thinke, that you were (ere you ſlept) troubled
with ſome imaginations that cauſed you to ſee, in this your dreame,
ſuch reſemblances as were repreſented unto you.</p>
               <p>No (brother) no, (anſwered him <hi>Metaneone</hi>) it was not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature
proceeding from diet, that hath produced theſe effects,
much leſſe any imagination, or melancholike paſſion, for I went to
bed merrily enough diſpoſed; and albeit I denie not that my thoughts
are ever buſied about <hi>Eromilia,</hi> yet am I ſure they are not any thing
ſpiced with melancholy, which though they were; how is it poſſible
for them to have ſhape ſo diſtinct a dreame, if it may bee ſaid a
dreame to finde my ſelfe broad-waking, gotten up, and withall to
have ſpoken once with <hi>Perſeno,</hi> and another time with the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>
of <hi>Palomera,</hi> and to ſee the ſelfe ſame things the ſecond time, as at the
firſt, not ſleeping, but broade waking; and which is more, the aſſault,
the very place, nay, my Lady <hi>Eromilia's</hi> ſelf out of my chamber, laid
then open to the heavens, and ſplendor of the moone? To theſe laſt
words <hi>Polimero</hi> halfe-ſmiling made him this anſwer; The ſeeing
now your chamber as before; the knowing of the great diſtance of
the perſons you ſaw, and much rather of the place which of it ſelfe
is immoveable, may aſſure you, that yours was but a dreame, though
ſuch, as of it ſelfe is not altogether to be ſlighted: for many are of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7477:82"/>
opinion, that the knowledge which we have of the gods (for as
much as concerneth pure nature, and its inſtincts) depends, partly
in the order of ſuch things as wee ſee in the world, and partly on
the motions of the minde in dying, and on the quietneſſe and ſweet
temper of the ſenſes in ſleeping: for the ſoule being in that inſtant
free, and in its pure celeſtiall diſpoſition foretells us things to come,
thereby inſtructing us how we ſhould govern our ſelves, which alſo
befalls oftner the good than the bad; the former participating of the
divinity in a certain manner, which the evill doe not. By this came
in Divination, which many well-ordered Common-wealths, not
onely beleeved, but alſo governed themſelves by it; which as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
commend, ſo muſt I needs confeſſe, that who ſo denies not the
divinity, cannot deny the examples of divine admonitions by way
of dreams, whereby have been ruled both men and kingdomes:
onely what I think not well of, is, to credit every dream indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
becauſe, as the denying of divine admonitions is impiety, ſo
alſo to beleeve that all dreams are divine admonitions, is both ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
and vanity. I know not what to ſay of it (anſwered <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneone</hi>)
but well know, that the world (for the moſt part) excludes
thoſe things for which it can give no reaſon, whereof I beleeve this
to be one. Nor can all the Philoſophers that ere the earth enjoyed,
make mee beleeve, that their ignorance in knowing the reaſon of
things can make that not to be, which experience teacheth us, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chooſe but be in effect. Which he expreſſed ſo paſſionately, that
<hi>Polimero</hi> could not chooſe but ſmile thereat, and therefore ſaid unto
him; It is an ordinary thing for ſuch as deſire to ſurmount others
in knowledge, to come ſhort of them therein. To deny either the
ſenſe or the effect of things, is, if not ignorance, at leaſt a ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
and fooliſh wiſdome; for if this ſo were, who could give us
a reaſon of the gods? who have beſtowed on us many things, not
that we ſhould know them, but that we might uſe them.</p>
               <p>There's not a people in the world but beleeves, that things to
come may by ſome meanes or other be foretold, the examples
whereof are infinite, and the conſent both generall, and authorized,
if not by the reaſon of the efficient cauſe, yet at leaſt by its effect and
ſucceſſe. We may then conclude that your dream, (not proceeding
from any alteration, but reiterated with the teſtimony of your own
ſelfe broad waking) is a voice come from heaven to call you to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
that <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> whom (being you) you ought to defend againſt
all the world.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> ſeemed to be herewith ſatisfied, though not yet well
quieted in minde; for having ſpent the reſidue of the night in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
himſelfe for his journey and in rowzing up his followers, hee
with Impatience long'd for the appearance of the new day, that he
might take his leave of <hi>Eromena.</hi> But the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcatteringly diſperſed over the lodgings, it hapned that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the noiſe that was made in knocking in ſo many places, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
it to be downe by <hi>Metaneones</hi> order roſe vp all-aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7477:82"/>
in that ſhe knew not the occaſion thereof till having ſent for
him; hee and his brother both came and participated unto her the
buſineſſe, wherewith ſhe then remained well ſatisfied: for the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of not knowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what to imagine thereof, had before very
much troubled her. But now ſhe offered him the whole fleet, and
(if need were) her own perſon alſo, judging it by the quality of the
dream impoſſible, that this faire Princeſſe ſtood not in ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
plight. <hi>Metaneone,</hi> (yeelding her therefore condigne thanks)
told her, that hee left with her his brother in pledge of his ſervice,
and beſought her courteous pardon, aſſuring her, that no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
could have been able to have drawn him from her ſervice,
(eſpecially at that time) except this imployment, whereto he held
himſelfe the more obliged (albeit he had had no ſuch intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as indeed he had) becauſe he thought that heaven it ſelfe had thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
call'd for him in particular. Howbeit, hee meant not to take
along with him any more than ſix Gallies, in that hee ſaw in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(whereto he gave credit) the enemies to be but few in number,
leaving the others with the reſt of the ſhipping, to be diſpoſed of
by her Highneſſe as her owne, for ſuch would he have them bee.
Whereupon, loth to loſe any time, hee ſuddenly parted (after he
had taken his leave of the Princeſſe <hi>Eleina,</hi> who was alſo come to
ſee what this ſtirring meant.) By the break of day came he to the
Fleet, where embracing <hi>Polimero,</hi> he praid him to ſend their father
word of his departure, promiſing to advertiſe him of whatſoever
ſhould befall him. And then (having taken his leave of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
of <hi>Oriſtagnio,</hi> who would by all means have accompanied
him, the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi> and the reſt,) he hoiſt up ſails, with ſo great
a deſire to be in <hi>Affrick,</hi> that thinking a good gale of winde not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
he would needs haue his oars plied withall, which hee was
fain to countermand againe, ſeeing the Seas ſwell, and the windes
maintaine of themſelves a ſtiffe gale, according to his own deſire.</p>
               <p>Eight daies without ceaſing continued his navigation, alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on, either by favourable gales, or gentle calmes, which (in
reſpect of the goodneſſe both of ghing and veſſells) no whit diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
his voyage. In the morning of the ninth day was by
its dawning diſcovered to his view, the <hi>Pegno della morte;</hi> and within
an houre after were diſcried, foure Gallies running into that haven,
which confirm'd him in his opinion, that his dream was not falſe,
wherefore cauſing the oars to aſſiſt the ſails, he arrived there two
houres after Sunne-riſing.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers of the two brothers had done their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to aſſaile the walls, during the piece of night that reſted, but
ſeeing at laſt the loſſe they ſuſtained, they retired themſelves, with
an intention not to get them gone, but to procure of the Lord of
<hi>Velex</hi> ſome ſupply of men, till ſuch time as their King (being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
advertiſed) either ſent or came himſelfe to avenge the death of his
ſonnes, for which purpoſe they had ſent to him a Galley. And as
they thought in the mean while to repoſe themſelves, they ſaw

ſeeing the armed troopes under the walls, with ſuch a number of
dead bodies, would not reſolve of any thing, till perceiving how
few they were, and ſeeing the Gallies oppoſing him not, as ſoone
as he came to know who they were, and what had befallen them,
he proffered them (on condition they would but aſſiſt him to take
that hold) the whole place it ſelfe, with all therein (the perſons
onely excepted:) quick enough were the <hi>Tingitanes</hi> in accepting this
proffer, who ſuddenly chooſing themſelves a Captain, ſent him to
conclude the accord, ſo as having landed the freſh forces, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
new Scaling-ladders, they re-began the fight; the defendants
being tir'd out with fighting all the night long, without once cloſing
an ey: whileſt <hi>Perſeno,</hi> who had the main care of all things (both
in commanding and performing) diſcharg'd the duty of a good
Knight.</p>

                  <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> (ſeeing that place could not be taken by ſcaling, unleſſe
it were either at unawares, or by night, cauſed a Ram-engine to be
landed, which, together with its teſtude, they ſetled on its wheels,
covered with great ſearſes of Goats-haire, to ſave it from fire. The
Ram was faſtened with a ſtrong chain, and ſupported by two tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-beams,
joyning angle-wiſe under it, rear'd up againſt the wall,
in the loweſt, eveneſt, and moſt acceſſible part of the Rock. Which
done, he (to beat the defendants off the walls) planted above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Catapults,</hi> and Croſſebowes, which ſo galled the defendants, that
many of them were thereby killed and wounded; among whom
<hi>Perſeno</hi> made one, having one arme little better than loſt by a Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-ſhot.
The Ram began already to work its effect, and the wall
(which was new and haſtily built) began ſoone to yeeld to its ruine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatning-buts.

               <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Eromilia</hi> (whom feare had cauſed to ſtrain courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with her religious vow) ſtood o'recharged with griefe, looking
out through a window of the Tower, a wailfull Spectatrix of the
unhappy conflict: repenting now too late her obſtinacy, knowing

perſuaſions good, and the Counteſſe her counſell both whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

bring in a ſeaſon when it can doe no good? The <hi>Counteſſe</hi> that ſtood
by her (albeit moved and griev'd to think that the Princeſſe her
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7477:83"/>
ſelfe was the ſole cauſe of all theſe evils) omitted not (for all that)
that reverence, which a faithful ſervant in all reſpects owes his Lord
nor yet loſt ſhe the occaſion of giving her a gentle touch and feeling
of her errors, by telling her that <hi>Princes</hi> (how prudent ſoever)
ſhould never deliberate of any thing of themſelves alone, eſpecially
when affection makes them become paſſionate, and therefore apt to
deceive themſelves; which (as ſhe then told her) ſhe thought good
to put her in minde of, not for the preſent, when the evill could not
be remedied, but rather to fore-warne her from incurring the like
danger in ſucceeding times. I would to God (anſwered the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>)
that it might doe mee good hereafter, whereof I much doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſee no way to ſhunne this preſent ruine. The Gods will
there-from deliver you (anſwered the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>) whereof I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Highneſſe hath better eyes than I, I beſeech you looke, if the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
hath three Lanters, for if it hath, then ſure they are his. The
<hi>Princeſſe</hi> (who had ſtood all the while, with her eyes fixed on her
owne danger, fetching a deepe ſigh) turned her looke to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and ſpying there the Galleyes, ſhe all joyfull, cried out, that
one of them bare ſuch lanternes; but this conſolation laſted not a
moment, when ſhe now ſaw thei wall battered downe, the enemie
enter in, and her men flie upwards towards the houſe. <hi>Perſeno,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the caſe thus irrepairable, being reſolved to die, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
fighting with his unhurt arme, without lending any eare to the
<hi>Catalan,</hi> who had by publike proclamation granted life to ſuch as
laide aſide their armes, yet were there for all that but very few that
followed not <hi>Perſeno's</hi> example.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this ſervice were found to be neere about five
hundred fighting men, betweene ſuch as were ſent thither from the
King, and thoſe that were taken out of the two Galleyes; whereof
lay dead almoſt three hundred, and of them the greateſt part ſlaine
by the <hi>Machines;</hi> with the reſt went <hi>Perſeno</hi> retiring, though alwayes
fighting, but the ſteepineſſe of the rocke (making for their great
diſadvantage, by diſcovering to the <hi>Catalognian</hi> Archers, the reare,
as well as the front) was cauſe that he loſt many of them, ſo that at
length his feeble ſelf wounded again with the puſh of a pike, and then
trampled under foote, gave occaſion to ſuch as remained to yeeld
themſelves to the enemies diſcretion; whom the <hi>Tingitans</hi> would
have put all to the ſword, but <hi>Don Peplaſos,</hi> who aſpired to <hi>Eromilia's</hi>
favour, would by all meanes have them all ſpared; giving them
withall leave to gather up <hi>Perſeno,</hi> who lay, though not dead, yet dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
wounded, by whoſe fatall ruine were utterly overthrowne
the nowruined hopes of the poore diſtreſſed aſſiedged; the houſe
not being any whit fortified, but depending altogether on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the walls below.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> all this while never ſtirred off the window, where
having cald one unto her, ſhee cauſed him by waving about a ſheete
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7477:84"/>
faſtened to a pole, to make ſignes to the Galleyes to haſten their
courſe, inſomuch as <hi>Metaneone</hi> with all the reſt ſaw it, and grieving
at the ſlowneſſe of the winde though favourable, hee cauſed the
Ghing to plunge their oares a-new in the foaming deepe; by meanes
whereof he quickly appeared ſo neere the view of <hi>Eromilia,</hi> as hee
might plainely diſcerne her dolorous geſture in the act of imploring
his ſuccour; and the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> with her hands beckning unto him to
make all poſſible haſte.</p>
               <p>The defendants a little before (when they ſaw the enemie got in)
had lock'd faſt the Tower, and fortified its gate with cheſts
and coffers (though it was of it ſelfe ſufficiently ſtrong, being
barr'd all over with iron bands) hoping to keepe themſelves free,
untill the arrivall of <hi>Metaneone,</hi> which fell out indeede as they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
for <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> unwilling to offer any violence (being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
aſſured that hee had her in his hands, and well knowing that
for want of proviſion and men to defend her, ſhe muſt needs at laſt
have yeelded) came himſelfe in perſon to the gate, uſing the moſt
humble and loving termes that could be. But the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> when ſhe
came to know him (growne no whit dejected to ſee her ſelfe thus
penn'd up by one ſhe abhorred more than death it ſelfe) up-braided
him his treacheries ſo diſdainefully, that he thereupon re-aſſuming
his naturall diſpoſition, and laying by all fained courteſies, was now
a preparing his engines to beate downe the gate, when newes was
brought him of the arrivall of ſix Galleyes. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
him any more, when once ſhe heard the trumpets ſound,
returned with the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> backe to the window, whence percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Metaneones</hi> ſaluting her all armed as he was, ſhe anſwered him
by doing the like in a maner, expreſſing her gratitude as courteouſly
as poſſibly ſhee could; by which favour he thought his courage ſo
multiplied, as hee would to doe her any ſervice, have reſolutely
fought againſt all the world. The <hi>Counteſſe</hi> with ſignes made
knowne unto him the beſt ſhe could the ſtate they were in. But the
<hi>Prince</hi> aſſailing the Galleyes (which were left almoſt unmann'd,
becauſe of every ones running to the ſacke) tooke them without any
great adoe, and underſtanding whoſe they were, thanked the gods
that hee came time enough to thwart thoſe his miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> giving over his late intention of throwing downe
the gate, ranne with his whole ſquadron downe towards the ſea-ſhore,
confuſed in minde to thinke of what he were beſt to doe, and
aſtoniſhed at the ſuddeneſſe of the enemies arrivall, without being
deſcribed on the maine ſea, being that not onely his Centrees, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
he himſelfe might have eaſily diſcovered him thirtie miles off.
At laſt he reſolved to ſtay in the Fort, and there to make good his
ground againſt the enemy, for that he thought himſelfe too weake
to keepe from landing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone,</hi> who no whit regarded the hazard of his owne perſon,
growne now furious with love, but more enraged with anger,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7477:84"/>
hotly aſſaulted the ruines of the wall, not ſo well defended as aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
till ſeeing he therein ſpent too much time, having placed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſouldiers to the Ram, he made them give againſt that part of
the wall that lay next the breach, which being already much ſhaken
with the former battery, with fiftie ſtiffe blowes fell to utter ruine;
ſo as the ſquadron that ſtood ready to mount the breach, entred it,
maugre all the enemy could doe, who now diſcouraged, were
forced to retire as <hi>Perſeno</hi> had done before them. When <hi>Metaneone</hi>

failing him together, whether by reaſon of his wounds, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
ſunke downe to the ground in a ſwound and ſenſeleſſe: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancone,</hi>

to aske how <hi>Perſeno</hi> fared; When underſtanding the ill plight hee
was in, he was much grieved thereat; yet being unwilling to make
any ſtay in the Fort, for feare of diſpleaſing the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> he ſent a
Knight to the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Palomera,</hi> with order, that having on
his behalfe ſaluted her, hee ſhould pray her (in his name) to
kiſſe the hands of her Lady the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and to tell her, that ſeeing
the gods had now freed her from her enemies, hee waited onely to
receive her commands, whereon depended both his ſtay and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
wiſhing that in the meane time ſome courſe were taken
for the re-edifying the walls, whereto he would cauſe his Ghing put
their helping hands, eſpecially on the outſide which had moſt neede
of, being aſſured againſt the Ram-engines, and that if ſhe needed
ſouldiers, he would leave with her as many of them as ſhe pleaſed.
He injoyned him further, to goe and viſite <hi>Perſeno,</hi> and to tell him
that he had come himſelf to ſee him, but that he doubted to-incurre
the Lady <hi>Princeſſe</hi> her diſpleaſure; with this Knight ſent he him his
own Phyſitians &amp; Chirurgians, with divers ſoveraigne-good things
for wounded and ſicke men, cauſing all his to returne to the galleys,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7477:85"/>
without ſuffring them to pillage or touch any thing within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of the walls, although it were the ſpoile of the enemies ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> (as ſoone as ſhe ſaw <hi>Metaneone</hi> runne in the
Port, and the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> out of her agonies) had begun a-new to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her to change her reſolution, ſhewing her, how ſhe alone was
the onely cauſe of the death of ſo many <hi>Princes,</hi> whoſe fathers (in
caſe they went about to avenge them as they had reaſon) would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her to ſuch a ſtreight, as ſhee could not be able to defend her
ſelfe long; telling her withall, that her vowes tied her onely to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities,
but not to what could poſſibly not be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed. Beſides,
that ſhee had already ſhewed her ſelfe to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
whoſe whole Fleete had ſeene her, as well as he. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
her, that ſhee would follow her Counſell, and that ſhee
would for the execution thereof write to her father, to ſend to fetch
her thence. And what will it boote you to doe ſo? (ſaid the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe</hi>)
ſeeing that ere your meſſenger can arrive in <hi>Maiorica,</hi> wee ſhall
be here beſieged by all the King of <hi>Tingitana's,</hi> forces, whoſe aime
will tend, not ſo much to the revenge of his ſonnes, as to the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Rocke, now that experience hath taught him (what
he ſaw not before) the importance of ſuch a Fort; which for good
reaſons was not fit to bee left in the poſſeſſion of a ſtrange <hi>Prince.</hi>
But how can I helpe it (anſwered the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) ſeeing I have
no ſhipping. What have you not? (replied the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>) whoſe
then are the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania's</hi> Galleyes? They are his owne
(anſwered the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſmiling:) but I know them to bee yours
(ſaid the <hi>Counteſſe.</hi>) And here unmasking the whole ſtate of the
buſineſſe ſhe related unto her the great love that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania</hi>
bore her, and how at the requeſt of the King his father, ſhee
was by her father promiſed him in marriage; with the Hiſtorie of
<hi>Don Peplaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> and all other paſſages to that purpoſe, except his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
comming by ſtealth into that houſe, which the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>
thought not good to make knowne unto her as yet, whileſt her mind
were ſo agitated with paſſions for the deceaſed <hi>Prince</hi> his death;
which in that it could not be remedied, ſhe ſhould (as the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>
told her) ſtrive to forget, and endeavour to reſtore her ſelfe to her
father, kingdome, and (above all others) to a husband and poſteritie,
to ſatisfie the world with reaſon, as ſhe had before without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
juſtly incurr'd its cenſure.</p>
               <p>At theſe words the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſtood mute, thinking it a ſtrange
matter for her to be changed in an inſtant, and being obſtinately
reſolved to live without any husband, now ſhould, or poſſibly
could diſpoſe her ſelfe to take one; but knowing that ſhe could
not but doe ſo, her reſolutions till then to the contrary, being
neither good nor laudable, and that it was a leſſer evill to cconfeſſe
an errour (being that there is no wiſe man but erres ſometimes)
than to make it the more unexcuſable by defending it, ſhee quite
changed, or at leaſt moſt reſolute to change her intention, told
her, that ſhe marvelled ſhe had not acquainted her with thoſe things
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7477:85"/>
ſooner, howbeit the reaſon (why ſhe did not) gave her (in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe)
ſufficient ſatisfaction; her ſervants being afterwards come to
certifie her of <hi>Metaneone's</hi> conqueſt, and <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhe having cauſed the Tower to be opened, made them carry
<hi>Perſeno</hi> neere to the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> her withdrawing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>chamber, for whoſe
wounds ſhe grew ſo compaſſionate as they drew pearle-like teares
from her faire chryſtall eyes. And underſtanding now that there
was a Knight there ſent from <hi>Metaneone,</hi> ſhe ſent to him the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe,</hi>
who having received the embaſſage, came and acquainted her
therewith; whereunto <hi>Eromilia</hi> (after a ſhort pawſe) returned this
anſwer;</p>
               <p>Goe and pray him to kiſſe his Lord the <hi>Princes</hi> hand on my
behalfe, and to tell him that for the reſt, I intend to anſwer to none
but himſelfe, for ſeeing that I am conſtrained to breake my vow, I
meane hee ſhall be the man that ſhall breake it, by ſeeing me firſt
of any other, deſiring him therefore to vouchſafe (ſo it be not
troubleſome unto him) to come hither himſelfe. The exceeding
joy the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> hereat conceived cannot be expreſſed, who went
her ſelf to conduct the Knight with the Phyſitians and Chirurgians
to <hi>Perſeno,</hi> whoſe wounds not being mortall, were with all diligence
by them carefully look'd unto; but the ſoveraigne balme that cured
him indeede was his Miſtreſſe her reſolution told him by the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe;</hi>
ſo as having anſwered the Knight, as he was in reſpective dutie
obliged, he licenſed him to returne to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> as ſoone as he underſtood this unexpected anſwer,
would needs ſuddenly runne up, but conſidering it to be then dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
he thought beſt to deferre it a little, when lifting up his eyes by
chance, he ſaw the <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> that beckned to him to come up;
whereupon (accompanied with a few, leaving all the reſt below) he
aſcended the rocke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> made a ſhew of beleeving that he comming from
as farre off as <hi>Sardegna</hi> (without touching land any where) was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh'd
of proviſion; and therefore ſeeing that he came not, had
willed the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> to call him; albeit ſhe was by reaſon of the
ruines and loſſes occaſioned by the laſt great bickering deprived of
the meanes of entertaining him any thing ſumptuouſly. But that
was not indeede the white her intentions aimed at, for the truth is,
that the deſire ſhe had to ſee him was ſo great, as ſhe had not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to ſtay till he came, ſhe being now (upon the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> her
perſwaſions) totally changed from what ſhe was before. Nor
might this be ſaid to proceede from inconſtancie, ſeeing that ſhe in
all her actions manifeſted the contrarie; than which it ſhould
rather bee beleeved, that ſhe being by nature endued with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
inclination to whom ſhee was to bee married, loved <hi>Peros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filo,</hi>
beleeving him to bee the man, and in the errour it ſelfe
followed her naturall inclination; but come in the end to ſee and
know the vanitie of her amiſſe-ſhed teares, the reall blame ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
juſtly incurr'd, the more than great evills and inconveniences
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7477:86"/>
that thereupon enſued, and withall how this <hi>Prince</hi> had ſerved her,
deſerved her, and obtained her ere ever ſhe knew him, ſhe could
now doe no leſſe than follow the inſtinct of her generous nature,
which was to love him whom the heavens had appointed for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> being come up, the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> came to the gate to meete
him, where ſhe would have kneeled unto him, but that he permitted
her not; howſoever ſhee rapt with an extremitie of joy, ſaid unto
him; A great good fortune was it to us (valorous <hi>Prince</hi>) to meete
with your Highneſſe, ſithence thereon depended the ſafetie of us all,
who had elſe beene twice loſt ere this time. Nay rather, right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
was I (anſwered the <hi>Prince</hi>) in having beene favoured with
the occaſion of ſerving my Lady the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> in your perſon, who
deſerve to be ſerved for your owne ſake. Whereto ſhe with a reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
obeiſance replied; Your Highneſſe knowes well how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
too much; although I cannot have too-much time to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
your <hi>Princely</hi> favours. Vouchſafe (I beſeech your Highneſſe)
to come in, and be joyfull, for you ſhall finde my Lady the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
an altered woman, ſo as I am induced to beleeve that your Highneſſe
is the true <hi>Perosfilo:</hi> and here related ſhe unto him ſuccinctly, how
ſhe had acquainted her Lady the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of her being promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him in marriage. Meane while the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> ſtood expecting him
at her chamber-doore, where come, he kneeled downe before her,
and with a reverent force taking her hand, kiſſed it with an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
affection; ſo as I know not whether his preſence or carriage
liked her beſt.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Metaneone</hi> was (next <hi>Polimero</hi>) the beſt accompliſhed
Cavalier of thoſe times; and whereas he at firſt hated ſuch courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
as were peereleſſe in <hi>Polimero,</hi> in whom he alſo diſliked all other
perfections; So now hatred being chaſed away, and love brought
in, in its ſtead, there came running in with it (headlong as it were)
all his brother's vertues (at leaſt much reſembling, if not of equall
weight with them) as though they had beene formerly violently
and unnaturally excluded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> offended with her ſelfe that ſhe was not able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from doing ſuch courteſies, would not heate him a word
whileſt he continued in that kneeling poſture; but ſeeing his courage
ſufficed him not to utter one ſole word (ſo wrapt was he with the
he joy conceived in ſeeing himſelfe in preſence of her, who was the
rich Cabinet, wherein lay ſtored all his beſt of happineſſe;) ſhe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the cauſe of this ſilence, ſaid thus unto him;</p>
               <p>Right excellent <hi>Prince,</hi> Let it not (I pray you) ſeeme any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto you, that I after ſo much time brake off now that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which I once purpoſed conſtantly to obſerve during the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of my life. I beſeech you not thinke me ſuch, as being firſt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſelled
by my ſelfe, am now at the perſwaſions of others, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by reaſon of any naturall levity; for if it ſo were, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuſe to continue unhappie (as I was before) than to re-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
my former being, by running the hazard of an opinion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7477:86"/>
what ſiniſter as you in that behalfe might conceive of me. I will
paſſe over with ſilence all thoſe reaſons, (which as both your ſelfe
and any one elſe may eaſily judge) perſwaded me to alter my courſe
of life; but of one onely (ſeene by none) will I make mention. And
with this riſing up to make him a low congey, ſhe proceeded; This
is the obligation and tie of duty I owe you, to conforme my ſelfe
thus to your will, which if my father hath thought fit for me to do,
for greater reaſon have I to judge it ſo, and will doe while life ſhall
laſt. I thanke you not, either for your paſt or preſent favours; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
that you have now recovered that which the heavens had
preſcribed you, which being yours, and by you (as you manifeſt)
beloved, the thankes you therefore owe, is to your ſelfe. And with
this (my Lord) I thought good to acquaint you, not ſo much for
declaration of my obedience to the King my father, and expreſſion
of my gratefulneſſe to you my benefactor, as that you might hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards
(as ſole Lord) diſpoſe of our ſtay or departure, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
before all the world, that I will for ever hereafter, depend
wholly on that honeſt, courteous, and diſcreet will of yours, that
knew ſo well how to oblige me.</p>
               <p>The chamber was full of people, that thronged thither to ſee
how their Miſtreſſe would behave her ſelfe, among whom were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Knights that came with <hi>Metaneone,</hi> and ſhe ſpake ſomewhat
loud of purpoſe that all might heare her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Counteſſe,</hi> with the other Ladies, when they heard her, burſt
out a weeping ſo tenderly, that <hi>Metaneone</hi> had much adoe to hold
from doing the like, ſo ſtrangely was he ſurpriſed with an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
content, but very few were they, who ſhed not ſome teares
for companie with the women; whileſt he offering to kneele downe,
but by her not permitted, returned her this anſwer;</p>
               <p>My ever-onely Lady, Nature that was ſo carefull to create your
Highneſſe ſingular, above all things elſe, ſhould by its ſingularities
aſſure you, that there is no judgement ſo clouded, as (conſidering
your wayes) can chuſe but knwo your actions to be completely
perfect: and though it were poſſible that any ſuch could be, yet
ſhould it bee conſtrained to confeſſe, that in you the very errours
themſelves are perfections; which ſteali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> gwife accompanied you,
and being ambitious of honour, and coverous of fame, changed
both name and nature, being not (for all that) grafted, but onely
faſtned to the boughs of the goodlieſt and perfecteſt tree, that ever
the gods of husbandry for celeſtiall deliciouſneſſe planted among the
terrene ones of humane Paradiſe: For who could have knowne how
to leave father, countery and Realme, without any blot of errour,
except your unparalel'd ſelfe, who have even in erring abounded in a
ſingular conſtancie, and incomparable worth of love, farre ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all the conſtancies and merits of the world? Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then ſhould not doubt, but rather confidently beleeve, that
you ſhall thereby reape the more praiſe, in that ſo praiſe-worthy an
errour cannot ſufficiently be prized, which I repute to be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7477:87"/>
becauſe its ſole perfections having invited mee, it of it ſelfe
ſo raviſhed me, as I being really transformed into a ſweete error,
cannot (without error) call my ſelfe more mine owne. Now for
that it pleaſeth your Highneſſe to make me happie, by ſeconding
the Will of the King your father, I have not words to expreſſe my
thankfulneſſe, nor effects to ſerve you comformable to your merit,
onely there remaine in me a deſire and a will to both. And becauſe
your Highneſſe merits all that is good, too too blame were I, if after
having given, what elſe was mine; I detained from you theſe that
are yet left me. Accept them then I beſeech you to make mee
will and deſire, if it bee your will that I may wiſh; and your
deſire that I may deſire; who account my ſelfe no other than the
obedient executor of your commands, and in that right happie,
ſince fortune hath raiſed mee to ſo high a pitch, as to be thought
worthy to ſerve you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who had now converted her widdowly moane into
freſh teares of conjugall affection, joyfull of having acquired ſo
courteous a <hi>Prince,</hi> would not leave him unreplied unto with a gentle
correſpondence of courteous thankes-yeelding; which ended, and
the houre of dinner a good while paſſed, they ſate them downe with
better content, and more conſolation in the ſtraightneſſe of that
Rocke, than others of their ranke and eminencie would have done
among the ſuperfluous varietie of royall Palaces.</p>
               <p>Needs would the <hi>Prince</hi> (as ſoone as he had dined) goe ſee <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeno,</hi>
whom the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> alſo favoured with the ſame honour, where
after ſome gratefull paſſages, they had no time to diſcourſe of ought
elſe than of their departure, which ſomewhat troubled <hi>Eromilia's</hi>
minde, for not knowing how to diſpoſe of the Rock. But the <hi>Prince</hi>
(who well knew the <hi>Tingitanan</hi> Kings ambition, and how that ſuch
a place well fortified, might curbe him at any time) reſolved not to
abandon it at any hand; ſo as their departure was deferred for no
other cauſe, than for the refabricking of its ruines, and hewing the
rock in ſuch a contrived maner, as no engins might approch it, which
in few dayes was diſpatched, by the helping hand of the Galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves,
who laboured thereabout every one his ſhare. The <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
would have him leave ſome of his to governe it, whereto he would
by no meanes condiſcend (deeming it as yet unbeſeeming him ſo to
doe;) but prayed her to leave there for Commander <hi>Perſeno,</hi>
the rather, becauſe hee being grievouſly wounded, could not chuſe
but grow to be in worſe plight with the motion and rowling of the
ſea: the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelfe ſending to <hi>Orano</hi> (a frontier citie of his ſtate)
for all things requiſite for him to aſſure that hold againſt a long
ſiege, promiſing him withall (in private) that in caſe it pleaſed him
not to ſtay there, he himſelfe would procure his father in law, to
ſend him a ſucceſſour, gratifying him in the meane time with large
rewards of honours and revenewes from <hi>Mauritania</hi> of his owne
things pertaining to his principalitie. Things reduced to this head,
he embarked himſelfe with the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> and all her family,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7477:87"/>
ſteering on a direct courſe for <hi>Maiorica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Eromilia</hi> had by <hi>Metaneone's</hi> counſell (ere ſhee parted)
cauſed the Brother-Princes to bee fiſh'd up, whoſe bodies ſhe ſent
embalmed in two coffers, to the Lord of <hi>Velez</hi> with the two remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Galleyes, together with the full relation of the fact, (whereof
he was before ſufficiently informed) praying him to ſend them to
the King of <hi>Tingitana</hi> their father, not without expreſſing her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of the violence done her in their Dominions, and in a
place purchaſed of the Governour himſelfe; whereto he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly
anſwered, That the <hi>Princes</hi> came to no other end, than to
defend and reſcue her, having underſtood by their ſpies the deſignes
of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> and <hi>Granada.</hi> And that if one of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to force the Rocke, it was for the diſcourteous language
given him by the Captaine of her Garriſon.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner were the bodies of the other two <hi>Princes,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Galleyes, conſigned to ſuch of their men as remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alive; thereby to take away all pretext of grievances; adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
thereof, beſides the Courts of ſundry <hi>Princes</hi> by particular
letter, expreſſing the manner of the fact, to the end that the truth
might be every where knowne. Onely <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> was reſerved to
his wives determination, being deemed unworthy to enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> or honour due to a Knight, for being culpable of
two faults, and in each of them two ſeverall times guiltie, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for his firſt offence in the one and the other, obtained pardon;
offences of a baſe minde, an impious heart, and miſchievous affect;
and againſt that ſex, which nature made pious, that it might even of
crueltie it ſelfe obtaine pittie; yet he, more cruell than any cruelty,
moved with a barbarous avarice of Tyrannicall ambition, had twiſe
attempted the death of chaſte <hi>Eleina,</hi> to deprive her, both of life
and honour, and to make her twiſe miſerable, with the rape of the
gentle <hi>Eromilia;</hi> beſides, his ingratitude towards the King of <hi>Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who albeit they knew his ill intention,
yet (becauſe they thought it impoſſible for him to fall into relapſe
of ſo foule and enormous a fault) had both ſet him at liberty, and
honoured him. In ſuch a faſhion was his Inditement framed, not by
notaries, upon the teſtimony of two or three; nor written in fragile
papers, but in his owne conſcience, approved by the deede it ſelfe,
made notorious by the atteſtation of all that part of the world, and
regiſtred in the moſt tenacious memories to be conſerved for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
tradition to poſteritie, to the horror, not ſo much of the
good, as of the miſchievous; that, as fame is the reward of the
well-doer, ſo infamy might be a puniſhment to the ignominious
liver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> (as wee have ſaid already) had ſix Galleyes of his
owne, beſides thoſe foure of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> which he aſſured from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away, by intermingling the Ghing together, ſo as they being
firſt well armed, and then aſſured with the exchange of Galley-ſlaves,
he aſſured them yet better with ſouldiers, and the family of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7477:88"/>
the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi> whom with her Ladies, he lodged in his Galley
Royall, ſerving her by day, with the greateſt reſpect that could be,
and at night retiring himſelfe into the Admirall of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> for
commodiouſneſſe and burden little inferiour to his.</p>
               <p>More joyfull was <hi>Eromilia</hi> at this her parting, than at her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
telling the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> that ſhe now found it by experience to
be true, that violent infirmities cannot be otherwiſe cured but by
conformable remedies; confeſſing that but for the continuance of
thoſe dangers that gave her a true feeling of her then being, it had
beene impoſſible to free her ſelfe of her melancholy, and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to returne whom: but now by ſeeing, with admiration eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day more than other, the <hi>Prince's</hi> diſcreet manners and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
the love of him living, ſerved as a wedge to knocke out of
her minde the memory of the other deceaſed.</p>
               <p>Their Navigation was ſhort, and favoured with gentle windes,
yet to them ſeemed it farre ſhorter than indeede it was, for that the
joy which their hearts conceived of their amorous converſation,
made the houres and dayes runne faſter, all things appearing unto
them, with an aſpect more gratefull. And indeede darkeneſſe it
ſelfe lets happie men ſee its ſhadow more pleaſant, if not leſſe
darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and the heavens that ſeeme to threaten troubled hearts, doe
ſport and play with the contented.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Eromilia</hi> was aſſailed of any one, there was muttered a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
murmur in <hi>Maiorica,</hi> that ſhe was aſſieged and in danger to bee
loſt. Great enquirie was made to finde out the Authour thereof,
who could not for all that by any poſſible meanes be knowne; there
being not any veſſell or ſhipping, arrived from any where, ſo as the
King (who was wiſe) thought it could not chuſe but be true, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it ſome naturall effect of the number of thoſe, for which no
reaſon can bee given; remembring he had read, that a great King
being ſlaine, the fame of his death fore-ranne the fact, a full
moneths-time; which albeit it had its reaſon, that there were many
in ſundry places, that were privie to the conſpiracy, which being to
be effected from moment to moment, and yet not executed, made
ſuch as were fartheſt off, thinke it done indeede; whereon enſued
the fame of giving out that for done, which was to be done; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
hee wanted not other examples free from this oppoſition,
whereby he came to know, that there be inviſible channels of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
correſpondencie between minds ſeparated by place, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by naturall ſympathy, by meanes whereof the one comes to
receive light from the other. Hence proceed the buzzing of the ears,
the palpitation of the heart, dreames, apparitions of ſeeming ſpirits,
ſudden melancholy in evill, and ſudden joyes in good, whereof wee
know no reaſon at all; but howſoever it be, the King beleeving the
common rumor to be the effect of an effect to it conformable, in a
ſhort time ſet in order a Fleete of tenne Galleyes, and of many
of ſuch ſhips, as he found riding in the ports of his kingdome;
whereof he leaving the governement to the Queene his wife, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7477:88"/>
himſelfe, reſolved to free his daughter from danger (if ſhee
were in any) and if in none, to free her from any further ſuſpition
thereof, by conducting her home againe; but ſeeing he loſt time,
by encountring for the moſt part with contrary windes, he reſolved
(leaving the ſhips behinde) to make onwards with the Galleyes;
nor was he gotten ten miles wide off them, when he deſcryed tenne
Galleyes, ſteering aright courſe towards him, whoſe they might
bee, whether friends or foes, he could not imagine; but his
prudence inclining to ſuſpect the worſt, made him prepare to
fight.</p>
               <p>This King was ſomewhat ſtrucken in yeares, but yet a luſtie old
man, with a body enured to ſuffer, and nerves hardened with the
continuall exerciſe of the ſling, (a weapon more uſed in thoſe
Ilands, than in any other part in the world;) wherefore he (ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at all pieces) with a couragious and joyfull countenance
heartned and cheered up his men to behave themſelves vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly.</p>
               <p>Neither of the Fleetes ſhrunke backe, but held on their courſes
in a right direct line, the one againſt the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> thinking them to be enemies in that he tooke them for
ſome <hi>Catalans,</hi> that went with theſe new forces to finde out their
<hi>Prince,</hi> ſet out his Standard of warre, reſolved to uſe them as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſavages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who till now (to her paſſingcontent) ſtood behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the pleaſantneſſe of the calme ſea, and liſtning to the muſicke,
which the waves (like a ſecond quire) made at the ſtroke of the
oares, finding now her pleaſure corrupted with the feare of the
Fleet that came towards her; and beſeeching the <hi>Prince</hi> to retire
himſelfe, could not chuſe but grieve thereat, her heart telling
her, that to fight then, was a reſolution taken contrary to all
reaſon.</p>
               <p>Both Fleets were now come ſomewhat neere, without knowing
one another, when having fitted their hatches, they mann'd their
Frigats from either Fleete to diſcover each other; come to know the
banners, and to haile one the other; it cannot be credited with what
an extraordinary fleetneſſe they ſpeeded each backe to his Lord.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Metaneone</hi> heard of the King of <hi>Maiorica's</hi> being there, he
ran to the chamber to acquaint therewith <hi>Eromilia,</hi> who aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in tenderneſſe of affection, returned up againe to ſee her father.
The <hi>Prince,</hi> intending to conduct her to him, cauſed a Frigat to bee
covered to ſhade her from the Sunne, which then was moſt violent
and ſcorching hot. But the King mounting on the ſelfe-ſame veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
which brought him the newes, that his daughter was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voying
homewards by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi> (not ſtanding on
any termes of ceremonie) went on all alone towards the Royall.
Whileſt <hi>Metaneone</hi> (on the other ſide) boording his Frigat, launched
out to meete him, ſaluting him with ſuch a reſpective reverence as he
could not have uſed greater towards the king his father, go in to kiſſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7477:89"/>
his hands he would not for doubt of interrupting his content of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his daughter, but followed him neere at hand. Before the King
arrived at <hi>Eromilia,</hi> he ſaw her oftentimes ſaluting him with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
inclinings; but come to embrace her, he had not the power
to ſever himſelfe from her, his royall gravitie not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
powerable to withſtand the motives of his ſpirits, in ſuch an
encounter. <hi>Eromilia</hi> wept, nor did hee leſſe, and if the reſpective
conſideration of ſeeing the <hi>Prince</hi> ſtand on ſide of him, had not
ſomewhat enlightned him, he was not likely to be ſoone diſenvelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of the paſſions of his fatherly affection: whereupon leaving
her, without having had the power to ſpeake one word unto her,
he ranne with his, as yet bedewed eyes, to embrace <hi>Metaneone;</hi> who
kneeled to him to kiſſe his hand; but he obſtinately ſtriving to get
him to ſtand up, debard them of the time to expreſſe each to other,
otherwiſe than ſuperficially, the joyes they conceived for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this encounter, for retiring to <hi>Eromilia,</hi> and cauſing her to
ſit on one ſide of him, and <hi>Metaneone</hi> on the other, (after hee
had received the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> with the other Ladies that kiſſed his
hand) hee lifting up his eyes, thanked the gods that had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him this joy, relating unto them the occaſion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
The <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (marvelling thereat) told him, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was not falſe, acquainting him with all that had hapned,
and how that, but for <hi>Metaneone's</hi> comming, ſhee had remained
a prey to <hi>Don Peplaſos.</hi> Then <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> (ſaid hee) came
to ſteale you away againe? Hee came indeede (anſwered <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi>)
and wee have him priſoner in that Galley there. The King
ſomewhat muſing thereat (turning towards <hi>Metaneone</hi>) ſaid unto
him; And you (my noble ſonne) how hap'd you to arrive ſo
opportunely to reſcue <hi>Eromilia?</hi> On this <hi>Metaneone</hi> related unto
him all that befell him ſleeping, whereof though hee had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
informed <hi>Eromilia,</hi> yet forbore ſhee not to marvell thereat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new.
He told them how the viſion was reiterated; himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not deceived in having ſeene, talked, and walked; that being
parted without ſtaying till day came, it pleaſed the gods to favour
him, in conſerving unto him by their pietie, what his Majeſtie had
out of his Royall courteſie beſtowed on him; for which hee
now kiſſed his hand, being not permitted to doe it before. The
King embracing him, and glancing a looke on <hi>Eromilia</hi> (who
though ſhee bluſhed, yet meant not to denie her conſent) thus
replied;</p>
               <p>Sithence then the heavens will, that ſhe be yours, who have
now two ſeverall times acquired her, ſo as I am (for that ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect)
obliged to give her you, I beſeech you to beleeve, that if I
had not already beſtowed her on you, I would moſt willingly give
her you, onely for your merits ſake. For which hee, kiſſing his
hand againe, and diſcourſing with him a good while about the
dreame, deſirous at length to leave him all-alone with his daughter,
roſe up with an excuſe to goe ſalute the <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Maiorica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:7477:89"/>
Glad was the King to ſee the alteration of his daughter, and the
humilitie wherewith ſhee craved his pardon for her paſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
delighting to know of her more particularly all paſt ſucceſſes,
together with the manner of the fortification of the Rocke. Arrived
afterwards to his ſhippes he might ſee them turne ſterne; ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
were they to ſee ſo many Galleyes fall towards them ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unexpected, but come to know what they were, they tack'd
about to accompany them, arriving with the others all together in
<hi>Maiorica</hi> with as much joy to the Queene, and all the kingdome, as
may be imagined at a returne ſo unexpected.</p>
               <p>There were arrived alſo in <hi>Maiorica</hi> the two Galleyes that
came from the <hi>Pegno,</hi> who were not ſo fortunate as to meete the
King, in that they hapned to paſſe one night a good diſtance wide off
him, and now (having provided themſelves of ſuch men as they
wanted) they rode prepared to returne to the <hi>Pegno,</hi> when the Fleet
arrived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone</hi> would not deferre the nuptials of his <hi>Eromilia,</hi> albeit he
deſired to have them ſolemnized in the preſence of <hi>Polimero</hi> and his
fathers Embaſſadours; but conſidering how he ſtood imployed in
an enterpriſe, which hee could not ſo ſoone rid his hands off, hee
thought it ſufficient to advertiſe him thereof, ſending him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the ſix Galleyes, and thoſe foure of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> with foure
others, that the King would needs ſend <hi>Eromena,</hi> writing unto her
that hee would have ſent her more, but that he doubted of ſome
accident, becauſe of <hi>Don Peplaſos,</hi> who was directed to <hi>Eleina</hi> to bee
by her diſpoſed of, as ſhe thought good. <hi>Metaneone</hi> ſent alſo to <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi>
to his father the newes of his adventures, and alſo of his
marriage, to receive from him order of his ſtay in <hi>Maiorica,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
with his wife to <hi>Rirſa,</hi> who in the meane while ſtaid there to
conſolate her parents and kingdome with her preſence.</p>
               <p>The Galleyes (being once departed) ſail'd on with a ſmart gale
to <hi>Sardigna</hi>-wards with <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> by this time fully cured of his
wounds, who obſerving himſelfe excluded from the ſight of the
King of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> where he had beene, and of <hi>Metaneone,</hi> who had
taken him priſoner, and ſent him to his wife (by him ſo unworthily
and inhumanely uſed) hee well perceived there was no account
made of his qualitie, and therefore often-times proffered to kill
himſelfe; but being prevented of his purpoſe by the diligent cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of ſuch as guarded him, he bethought himſelfe of a way of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, by changing apparences, and ſhewing himſelfe leſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and with a more quiet minde, taking on him to deſire
what hee moſt abhorred, which was the ſight of <hi>Eleina.</hi> Whileſt
then the Galleyes (one morning ere Sunne-riſing, by the favour of
a ſtrong Weſterne gale) glided on a maine ſpeede, there diſcovered
it ſelfe within kenning the Iland of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> whereat the Ghing
gave a joyfull ſhout, crying, (Land, land) which as ſoone as <hi>Don
Peplaſos</hi> heard, hee cald for his clothes, and having put on a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-weede,
made a ſhew of being deſirous to take the aire, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7477:90"/>
himſelfe with the ſight of the ſhore, after his being over-tired
with his long ſojourning at ſea; come up on the hatches, he ſtood
ſtill a-while beholding the Iland, then walking a turne or two, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
muzing, and ſtanding with his face towards the ladder of the
Galley, he ſuddenly let fall off his gowne, and leaving therewithall
his ſlippers, leapt down into the ſea, with ſuch an unexpected ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that he was plunged therein, ere any one was aware of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
whereupon the ſailes were ſtrucken downe with great fury,
but to little purpoſe; for the Galley being runne onwards above
two miles, ere the ſailes could be taken in, or the long-boate hoiſt
out; (the Frigat of the Royall hapning then to be ſailing before the
Fleet.) The lewd-lifed <hi>Prince</hi> was drowned ere he could be ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
his body was found floating on the ſea, and ſwollen with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which brought a-boord, was laid under hatches, to the great
diſcontent of the Admirall, who was very ſorry that he could not
deliver him to <hi>Eleina</hi> in the ſame ſtate as he received him. But now
(ſeeing the accident remedileſſe) they having placed him with his
head downewards, to emptie his body of the water, afterwards co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it with a beere-cloath of blacke velvet, bearing that reſpect to
his life-leſſe corpes, for having beene thoſe of a <hi>Prince,</hi> which hee
deſerved not living, having leade a life unworthy of a <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arrived in <hi>Porto Torre,</hi> they found not the Fleet there, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding how that it was paſſed into <hi>Corſica,</hi> they alſo with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable

after his brothers depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not well approving of
ſuch reſolutions as are built on
the ſlipperie foundation of
dreames; but ſeeing that it lay
not in his power to remedy it,
he with the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
returned to <hi>Saſſari;</hi> whileſt
<hi>Eromena,</hi> growing more and
more ardent in her love, and
buring with its violent flames,
ſolicited the <hi>Corſan</hi> expedition,
thereby to rid her ſelfe the ſooner of the time interpoſed betweene
her and the concluſion of her deſires. The King deſirous to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

but ſhe reſolved to bring firſt the warres to a period, comforted
him with her letters, acquainting him with the Councell neceſſarily
concluded on for the eſtabliſhing, by the conqueſt of the <hi>Corſan</hi>
kingdome, a perpetuall peace in <hi>Sardegna,</hi> aſſuring him that the
war could not long laſt, the enemies wanting a head to guide them,
now whileſt the infeebled body was not able to ſupport it ſelfe;
which indeede even juſt ſo ſucceeded, for ſhe (embarking her forces,

<hi>Polimero's</hi> great exploits) ſhe could not have ſo performed, if they
had either had a Captaine, or not wanted thoſe that remained dead
in <hi>Sardegna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Eromena</hi> was at <hi>Tolmido's</hi> arrivall in <hi>Sagona,</hi> accompanied
with the <hi>Princeſſe Eleina,</hi> who could not be diſſwaded from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, both of them delighting every day more and more each in

               <p>Paſſing joyfull was <hi>Polimero</hi> of <hi>Tolmido's</hi> comming, who having

formerly held any communion of amitie; ſee his body ſhe would

with ſailes and tacklings of the ſame colour. But <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> would ſhe

a thouſand time obſerved in others, <hi>that of things not good the end

ſince that mine, for falſely accuſing his wife the firſt time, reaped
nought elſe from it but ſhame; and for endevouring to make her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſecond time, was by his owne conſcience prick'd on to
make away himſelfe; the gods having miraculouſly ſaved her, to
ſave together with her life her <hi>never blemiſhed honour.</hi> And I (well
may I ſay, moſt wretched I) drawne on with the ſweetly alluring
baite of vaine ambition, (after having betraied a Maſter, than whom
I could not have deſired a better) ſee my ſelfe now likely to end
deſervedly my dayes, with ſome kinde of unuſuall and ignominious
death. Now touching what your Highneſſe commands me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:7477:91"/>
The <hi>Prince</hi> before his departure, gave me order to goe my wayes
before him, to ſpie out a fit place to kill and burie in the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi>
to the end that when her body could not be found by any, we might
boldly give out, ſhe was runne away with <hi>Calaplo;</hi> I went, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the places neere the Temple were indifferently frequented
with Prieſts and Pilgrimes, I was faine to goe a good diſtance wide
off it, ere I could finde a place for the purpoſe. I had with me two
(I know not whether I ſhould terme them ſouldiers or executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)
ſure cards to the <hi>Prince;</hi> whom he was wont to make uſe of
for the taking away of the lives of many. Wherefore he thought
he might well truſt thoſe, who charged with the burthen of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
offences, had no other ſtay on earth than his countenance, nor
could he indeede chuſe but make uſe of them, being that hee would
not himſelfe, nor ſaw me willing to ſtrike that bloudy blow; I then,
and thoſe fellowes with diſguiſed cloathes and falſe beards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Prince</hi> a-farre off (being by me firſt informed of the place)
when ſhee fell in a ſwoond, whither he cald us, and would needes
have her ſlaine in that very place; but there being not ſo much as a
handfull of earth to cover her body withall, he knew not what to
doe; yet becauſe it behoved him to reſolve of ſome courſe, hee
made us continue to carrie her towards the place appointed, looking
alwayes round about him, to ſee if he could eſpie any other fit for
that purpoſe. But we, going on a ſlow pace, by reaſon of our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and difficultie of the ſtones; he both weary and vext with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
told us, hee was not able to follow us any further, and
therefore would (leſt his abſence might give cauſe of ſuſpition) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe againe, leaving to our charge the execution of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.
Which ſaid (I know not whether it was to neceſſitate us
not to let her live or otherwiſe) hee himſelfe cut off her cloathes
from under her gowne, ſtripping her of them all, without leaving
her as much as ſtockings or ſhooes; telling us that he did it, leſt
there remained any token to know her by, in caſe the body were by
any means diſcovered. But the very act of ſeeing ſo naked a <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
of ſo great merit (innocently condemned to loſe both life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,)
ſtamped ſuch a compaſſion in the cruell mindes of thoſe two
murtherers, that as ſoone as the <hi>Prince</hi> was gone, they ſo gazed one
the other in the face, as if their new <hi>affect</hi> had beene written in their
foreheads, each of them with halfe-pronounced interrogations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
when his fellow would ſpeake.</p>
               <p>We held on our way a good while without loſing ſight of the
<hi>Prince,</hi> in that we deſcended, and he aſcended, making many a ſtand,
to behold the progreſſe of our journey, of us diligently continued;
but the two (not able to diſſemble any longer) told mee flatly, that
they would not imbrue their hands in the bloud of that <hi>Innocent
Princeſſe.</hi> The ſame, my friends (ſaid I) is alſo my deſire; but what
ſhall we doe then? If we leave her in the plight ſhe is in, ſhe will die
of her ſelfe, if ſhe bee not dead already; which if ſhe be not, how
ſhall we doe to ſave our ſelves? That thought troubles not us (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7477:92"/>
they;) If we returne, we are ſure to come to ſome ill end or
other, for the <hi>Prince</hi> will never thinke himſelfe ſafe whileſt we live
partakers of a buſineſſe of ſuch importance, and will therefore cauſe
us to be ſlaine, when we thinke leaſt of it; doe you therefore what
you pleaſe with the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> and tell the <hi>Prince</hi> what you liſt of us,
for wee are moſt reſolute never to returne more to <hi>Catalogna:</hi> at
which word they would have laid downe their burthen; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
them not to leave me ſo alone, they were contented to liſten
unto me, having in former times received of the <hi>Prince</hi> (through my
hands) rich preſents and great ſummes of money, which made
them thinke themſelves therefore ſomewhat obliged unto me. I
cannot (ſaid I to them) but commend your reſolution, ſeeing it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
me the way to ſatisfie the compaſſion. I have of this <hi>Princeſſe.</hi>
What I deſire is, that (ſhe &amp; you being ſafe) I may alſo without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
returne to the <hi>Prince,</hi> being that I have not with me means to live
elſewhere, as ye have. Whereupon many things were propoſed,
but none reſolved of; when eſpying foure mountaine Swaines or
hillie-men, comming with a chaire made of light wood, wherewith
they had carried down ſome one, we thought beſt to lay therein the
<hi>Princeſſe;</hi> but they, ſeeing a woman in ſuch a plight, and ſo clothed in
ſuch a place, and among ſuch men, refuſed to obey us; till at
length conſtrained, partly by menaces, and partly by faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they tooke her up, and carried her betweene them ſo maine a
pace, that we (though disburdened) had much adoe to follow
them; who asking us afterwards whither we would goe? Forth of
all habitation, ſaid we. By that time it grew to be night, found wee
our ſelves a great way diſtant from whence we parted from the
<hi>Prince;</hi> having with us (being men for ſuch a piece of ſervice well
provided, for having no neede of an Inne) bread, wine, and other
good things, wherewith we kept our men in breath, who come to
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oote of a great mountaine among other leſſer ones; we thought
it beſt to lay downe our burthen in a ſolitarie place, and there to
murther them for their paines: then made we as thought we meant
to pay theſe countrey fellowes, yet (being vnwilling, I know not
wherefore) to kill them in that place; the preſence of the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
(by us reputed for dead, there having not appeared in her any ſigne
of life all that day long) carrying with it a ſtrange unthought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
we walked on with them, one of us taking on him to open
his purſe, and I, asking the name of that mountaine, and the way to
the next place of habitation, till come a good way off, wee kild
three of them, every one of us his man, which booted us not much,
for that the fourth eſcaped, making us to follow running after him
a great way thence, nor could we have poſſibly overtaken him, if
his ill fortune had not (by cauſing him to ſtumble at a great ſtone)
made him burſt one of his legs, whereby we came eaſily to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him away. This crueltie could not we (eſpecially my ſelf) by
any meanes forbeare to execute, becauſe our apparent qualities, and
habits, with a woman ſo ſtrip'd halfe naked, and taken for dead, were
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7477:92"/>
ſufficient motives to ſtirre up curioſitie in any one, to prie into our
actions, learne them out, and report them. Returning backwards,
it was not poſſible for us to finde out our firſt path; ſo as wearie
with the tediouſneſſe of our long dayes journey, we ſought out for
a place to hide and repoſe our ſelves in, that night in the thickeſt of
the mountaine, with order, that whileſt two of us ſlept, the third
man ſhould watch; but ſo farre were every of us from taking any
reſt that night, that even that repoſing our ſelves tormented and
wearied us more than all the former dayes toile; whereby I came to
know it to be true, that miſchievous deedes are of themſelves both
executioners and tortures; ſo as I that never knew what teſtimonie
of conſcience meant, when I betraied <hi>Don Eleimos,</hi> began to have
now a feeling of it. For of that (becauſe there followed it no danger
of life, and that I thereby obtained the benefit of the <hi>Prince's</hi> favour)
I made ſmall reckoning; judging that as a wicked <hi>Prince</hi> makes ſlight
account of any inconvenience that ſtands betweene him and a
Scepter, ſo ought alſo a Courtier to arrive to the height of favour,
eſteeme diſſimulation, fraude and miſchiefe, as prudence and good
counſell. But the compariſon in this caſe was too too different, in
reſpect of the qualitie of the perſon, the project not treating of, nor
tending to the precipitating of a man downe from the top of his
fortune, for the ſetling of my ſelfe in his place, but to the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of an Innocent <hi>Princeſſe;</hi> from whoſe death I was like to gaine
nought elſe than perpetuall ſuſpitions, aſſuring my ſelfe (conſidering
the nature of the <hi>Prince</hi>) that I could by no meanes long ſhunne my
fatall ruine; and that he would never reſt till he had freed himſelfe
of ſuch as were privy to this ſo important a ſecret, which made me
grieve that I had not with me my Iewels, or ſo much money as
might ſuffice me to accompanie the reſolution of the other two.
But now the day appearing, there was not one amongſt us, that
knew whether to goe, ſince that to returne to the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> was but
loſt labour, ſo as the thought thereof was of us already abandoned;
for their parts, they were reſolved never to come, where any newes
might be heard of them; but I (whom avarice and ambition had
deprived of all good counſell) was exceeding ſorrie that I knew not
how to returne backe to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and doubting leſt ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
would befall mee, if it ſhould be knowne that the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
were not dead; I reſolved at length to returne backe againe howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and to affirme for certaine that ſhe was ſlaine, and then to take
away with me ſuch coine and Iewels as I had gotten and ſtor'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
partly of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and partly of others for procuring them
his favour; wherewith I made account to live the remnant of my
dayes commodiouſly, if not richly without being beholding to any
man. Which plot of mine communicated unto the others, and by
them approved of; we parted thence, toiling our ſelves to finde out
ſome kinde of path, which we had never lighted on, had we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried
afar off one a foot, who deſcending the mountaine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
towards us was without ſpying us, diſcovered by us. When
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7477:93"/>
I, ſtraight knowing him to be <hi>Calaplo,</hi> was thereof exceeding joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
deeming it the happieſt encounter that could poſſibly betide
me; for I (knowing the cauſe of his going away, being my ſelfe
the man that hatch'd the invention of ſending him packing in that
manner) hoped to bring the <hi>Prince</hi> good newes of his being ſlaine,
(for we having at firſt concluded to deale ſo with him, did not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it, for not multiplying of too many Miniſters in the fact, and
by conſequence of dangers in diſcovering him, the rather in that we
hoped, that he would for feare have kept himſelfe ſecret.) Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the buſineſſe unto my companions, they reſolved to murther
him, not ſo much to ſerve and pleaſe thereby the <hi>Prince;</hi> as for love
of the Iewels and coine which I told them hee had about him.
Wherefore as ſoone as we got to the path, we dogg'd him without
being able to overtake him almoſt all the day long; In the end paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
downe a deepe ſteepy bottome, and getting up another moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
he held not on his way one houres ſpace, till he ſtood ſtill, ſo
as we might at our pleaſure overtake him; and (comming ſtealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
upon him for feare of being eſpied) we might perceived him
talke with ſome body afarre off, and in his ſpeech heare him ſay
(<hi>Your Highneſſe</hi>) which gave us cauſe to imagine it was the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>
he ſpake to; there we ſet upon him unawares, but found him ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
that (what by retiring, and defending himſelfe) were could
never come once to faſten a blow on him, the difficulty of the
mountaines ſteepineſſe, ſerving him for a great advantange. And I,
in the meane while, ſeeing how he had with a maine downeright
blow cloven the head of one of my two companions, thought it my
beſt courſe to leave him hand to hand with the other: their death lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
importing my ends, which was the life of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> or rather
my owne, which without her death could not ſubſiſt: it grieving
me too much to leave in an inſtant the fortunes of the Court, by me
only aſſayed, but not fully tasked. Thus was I flattered by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which prevailes more in an upſtart, than in one (that being
borne there) hath it hereditarie from his anceſtors, and from the
nobleneſſe of bloud.</p>
               <p>Being freed then from that pittie which was inſtill'd in me by
my companions, I got me to the place where I had before ſeene
<hi>Calaplo,</hi> to aſſure my ſelfe whether the ſame was indeed the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
or that I was deceived; where I ſaw it was ſhe indeede, and ſhe
alſo might well have ſeene me, if hindred by her weeping, ſhee had
not in drying her eyes covered them with the ſleeve of her gowne,
her good husband not having left her any thing elſe to drie them
withall. The ſeeing her then in ſuch a plight bred in me ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
as made me (quite contrarie to my intended reſolution) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to comfort her; but remembring how ſhe would never have
either beleeved or truſted me; and that it was better to goe and finde
her out, crave her pardon, bring her backe to her father in ſafetie,
and there leave her; I deſcended the hill; but could by no meanes
poſſible (for all my rambling about) ever finde her out; ſo as at length
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7477:93"/>
(having alſo ſought her the day following to no purpoſe) I reſolved
to ſet my ſelfe on the way of my returne.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> in the meane time had in this tragedie plaid his part
with exceeding great artifice; for returning to the Temple dropping
wet with ſweat, making a ſhew of being (as he was indeede, though
for a different cauſe) profoundly afflicted, ſent folkes to ſearch all
there about, for his wiſe; taking on him to feare, that ſhee (loſing
her way) were devoured of ſome wilde beaſt; he ſent firſt of all to
the Inne to know if ſhee were retired thither. But the Knight that
was left there with the ſicke woman comming thereupon up to the
Temple, and acquainting him how that <hi>Calaplo</hi> had bin there to fetch
away the waller, he began to diſplay and ground on that act of his,
ſome token of ſuſpition; but when ſuch as were ſent aboade returned
without any newes of her; then told he them openly that he could
beleeve no leſſe, than that ſhe were runne away with <hi>Calaplo,</hi> which
he knew how to repreſent <hi>ſo feelingly,</hi> with ſuch naturall affects
both of griefe and diſdaine, that the Knight (whoſe imagination
never dived to the depth of ſo foule a treaſon) could not otherwiſe
chuſe than be of the ſame opinion; nor could it indeede be otherwiſe
conceived of any, except of ſuch as lighted pat on the very truth;
ſeeing that neither bloud, nor any relique of any limbe of hers could
poſſibly be found any where; albeit the mountaine was (for three
dayes continuance) ſearch'd all over with moſt exquiſite diligence.
Beſides that (in that part ſo well frequented) was never ſeene any
ſavage beaſt, much leſſe was it ever heard that any one was ever
ſlaine or hur there. The <hi>Prince</hi> with this occaſion came to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
(for ſo would he have it,) to the end that the fame of the
accident might forerunne his arrivall in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and ſo for being
afterwards conformably confirmed by him, be the better credited;
whcih indeede ſucceeded him every way anſwerable to his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</p>
               <p>The King well deeming that his heavy-hearted ſonne had neede
of comfort, ſent of the graveſt and wiſeſt of the Realme to meete
him; when he taking on him to be uncapable of any comfort, ſpake
and did things with ſuch an extreme compaſſion-meriting paſſion,
as there was not any that grieved not for his griefe. For albeit by the
qualities of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> there was no reaſon to beleeve, that any
ſuch a reſolution could ever be foſtered in her, yet could he ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
diſſemble, that for ſome while he blinded the beſt ſighted
and moſt penetrating eyes. My returne was neere about the
ſame time as his, though a little ſooner, for ſo had we before agreed
on. When I, in taking on me at Court to have never heard any
thing of theſe paſſages, in wondring at ſuch an accident, in making
as though I could not beleeve it, and in ſuch other circumſtances,
wanted little of going beyond my Maſter himſelfe, yet to him told I
that we had buried her a pikes depth under ground, ſatisfying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the reſt of his demands at full, I having ſtudied by the way how
to make anſwer to all whatſoever he could aske me: but he that now
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7477:94"/>
could finde no more in his heart to fix his eyes on me (my very
preſence upbrayding him of the fouleneſſe of his fault) never ſpake
to me more one word thereof.</p>
               <p>Soone went I about preparing my ſelfe for my flight, when hee
faining to have heard ſome inckling of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> went ſuddenly
a-boord a Galley, ſo as I was faine to doe the ſame; where we were
ſcarce ſetled a-boord her, whenamong the Knights and Ghing was
ſpread a rumor, that we were bound for <hi>Affrique</hi> to ſteale away the
<hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Maiorica.</hi> Of this good plot knew I nothing, for the
<hi>Prince</hi> beginning to grow cold in his favours to me-wards, favoured
another (perhaps) worſe yet than my ſelfe, at leaſt in that behalfe,
that he could not conceale a ſecret, wherewithall his Lord truſted
him; which he telling in confidence to a friend of his, and that friend
againe to another, ſoone occaſioned our almoſt utter ruine.</p>
               <p>We incountred (as it pleaſed the gods) by the way the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Mauritania</hi> (your Highneſſe brother) with whom the matter paſt ill
for us. In that fight remained I wounded, endevouring either to
die or regaine the <hi>Princes</hi> favour; not with an intention to enjoy it
long, but onely to aſſure my ſelfe thereof, till ſuch time as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
preſented me occaſion and place to run away; it grieved me
exceeding that I ſay ſo wounded as I was not able to helpe my ſelfe,
now that I might have made uſe of ſo fit an occaſion for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> (after the departure of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi>)
conſidering how little it ſtead him to detaine in that ſort
<hi>Don Peplaſos,</hi> and too withall that ſithence he was to ſet him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
his fairer courſe was to do it, with giving him as little diſguſt as
poſſibly he could, (after he had given his daughter notice of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
freeing her from danger, in caſe <hi>Don Peplaſos</hi> reſolved to returne
thither againe) he went himſelfe in perſon to viſit him, referring it
to his owne choiſe whether he would go or ſtay. Whereupon he
aſſoone as he had diſpatched himſelfe thence having by making by
the way enquiry, eaſily found out the Author of the rumor ſpread
a-broad, cauſed him (in his owne preſence) to be hang'd up by the
maine yard. Arrived at home, ſcarce were his wounds cicatrized or
begun to cloſe up, when he (on the ſame pretext as before, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
that his wife was retired to <hi>Pegno della morte,</hi>) embarked himſelf;
taking with him foure Galleyes, wheron it behoved me to mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
too, (wounded as I was) reſolved to run away (at any hand)
as ſoone as we ſhould be landed in <hi>Afrique.</hi> Where what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
befell us, is already knowne unto your Highneſſe: whom I
humbly beſeech to intercede ſome remiſſion for me, ſince that it
better beſeemes the Lady <hi>Princeſſe Eleina's</hi> royall breſt to pardon,
than it ill befitted my baſe heart to offend; proteſting before the
Immortall gods, that in all theſe evills, my offences ſhall never
grow ſo high, that they left not rooted in my mind a feeling ſorrow
for having committed them, neither did I (as I hope for mercy)
commit them out of any deſpight or malice, but meerely for that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7477:94"/>
ambitions ſake, that hath in every man ſuch power, in cauſing him to
deſire to engroſſe to himſelfe his <hi>Prince</hi> his favour, wherein we have
no example left us of any man, that could ever yet (in that kinde of
avarice) content or temper himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To theſe laſt words of his, <hi>Polimero</hi> could not without diſdainefull
anger liſten, and beholding him earneſtly he excuſed <hi>Don Eleimo's</hi>
judgement, for that <hi>Cataſcopo's</hi> countenance and demeanour was able
to deceive the moſt penetrating &amp; ſubtileſt underſtanding. Once was
he about to make him no anſwer at all, his perſon not meriting any,
but obſerving to be there preſent, many of the principall Courtiers,
he (deſirous that this example might ſerve them for a document)
thus ſaid unto him;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cataſcopo,</hi> the Hiſtorie I heare of thee makes thee knowne to bee
unworthy of what thou craveſt, eſpecially thoſe arguments aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
thy fault wherewith thou pretendeſt to qualifie it. Thou
would'ſt have the <hi>Princeſſe Eleina</hi> pardon thee out of her ggreatneſſe,
what thou haſt offended out of thy baſeneſſe; not conſidering how
that <hi>Princes</hi> are obliged to puniſh malefactors, not to doe ſacrifice to
their particular revenge, but for the publike weale's ſake, the people
being much better bridled by example, than ſwayed by lawes.
Nor indeed can ſhe, as a <hi>Princeſſe</hi> juſtly pardon thee; for though that
all her miſeries had ended with her death, yet the miſchiefs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
that had thereon enſued, or that may yet proceede therefrom
betweene the <hi>Arelatan</hi> and <hi>Catalognian</hi> kingdoms, might or yet may
be perpetuall, with the death of thouſands of innocents that might,
or yet may periſh by thy meanes. Moreover, thy being in the act
it ſelfe ſorry for having offended her, makes thee the more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of favour; for it is no marvell if the blinde fall that hath no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to leade him; or that a franticke man under the conduct of his
corrupt imagination, throw himſelf down headlong from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipie,
but for one of a perfect ſight to fall and refall ſo foulely, and
for one that hath a reflux of knowledge, and beene admoniſhed by
conſcience, to precipitate thy ſelfe ſo dangerouſly and wilfully as
thou haſt done, is a thing altogether prodigious; nor can a man
judge otherwiſe of thee than that thou intendeſt whenſoever thou
didſt any miſchiefe to doe it irrevocably without the conſent either
of reaſon or conſcience, an evident figne of an accompliſhed malice,
never to be repealed with any kind of good inſpiration whatſoever;
nor am I ever a whit induced to beleeve, that it was repentance
which made thee, (when from on high thou ſaweſt her drying her
eyes with the ſleeves of her poore gowne) to thinke of ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her, and of bringing her home to her father, for that was not
an effect of a repentant ſpirit, but of a minde already vilified in the
conſideration of its proper danger that thou incurredſt with thy
Maſter, for the life thou could'ſt not deprive her of. And this made
thee (thinking on thy own miſeries) capable of that pitty which thou
hadſt not whileſt thou waſt void of ſuch impreſſions.</p>
               <p>Men of a ſhallow judgement, looking no farther than the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7477:95"/>
take thoſe to be vertues that are not, whereas the wiſer ſort
examine the actions, diſtinguiſhing that which really is from that
which ſeemes to be. Which that it is ſo, thou maiſt ſee by thy ſelfe,
for thou betrayed'ſt not thy Maſter firſt but with premeditation;
nor the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> afterwards, but with deliberation, and yet paſſed
there betweene theſe two treaſon plots, dayes and moneths; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou hadſt time to kindle the coles of charitie towards the one
and the other, if there had beene remaining in thee any ſparke of
vertue; but thou dideſt it not till thy foreſeene miſerie joyned with
the danger, engendred in thee this adulterate pittie, if it may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
pittie, and not rather baſeneſſe &amp; diffidence of being able to ſave
thy ſelfe any other way. Nay, I beleeve what is yet worſe (nor can I
beleeve otherwiſe of ſuch an one as thou art) that thou (ſeeing thy
ſelf undone) thought'ſt with a new invention of malice to winne her
to be thine, after thou hadſt loſt her to her ſelfe, and to make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of thy life and good fortune, her, whoſe death thou had'ſt
complotted, &amp; whoſe miſerie thou mean'dſt to accompliſh by taking
from her her honour, to no other end than to oblige her unto thee
with a ſtrange kind of benefit directed wholly to thy own ſole ends,
which alſo might have accordingly ſucceeded thee, conſidering the
noble inclinations of ſo excellent a <hi>Princeſſe.</hi> But the gods permitted
thee not to put that project in practiſe having deſtined for her ſafetie
other meanes than thy malicious pittie, which becauſe they in thee
abhorred, they blinded thy eyes and clouded thy underſtanding, for
finding her any more; nor doth thy laſt alleaged excuſe (that the
ambition of the <hi>Prince</hi> his favour was cauſe of thy offence) decline
any whit from thy other reaſons; for if we ought not to doe evill
that good may come thereof, how can we excuſe that evill whence
ſprings another evill by many degrees greater?</p>
               <p>The impoſſibilitie thou inferreſt of the never being of any man
that could in ſuch like ambitions containe himſelfe, is moſt falſe;
whereof though I yet granted thee that there were not any, yet will
I never concede that there cannot be any ſuch. A <hi>Prince</hi> his favour
is acquired either by merits, or elſe by reaſon of the inclination of
the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelfe; and where merits are, there is ſeldome any
great fortune, for they proceeding from vertue, thoſe vertues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
brooke fortune, but diſdaine her means, and ſhe again ſeeing her
ſelfe ſo deſpiſed, ſcornes and contemns them; where inclination is,
there reſides fortune alſo, but diverſely; for many <hi>Princes</hi> are good, &amp;
have good inclinations, but with them have they alſo their affects,
which they will have humored; yet ſhould they not be therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd,
ſeeing they are but men, nor ſhould they be condemned or
much blamed for chuſing perſons to their fancy and liking, ſo that
the State ſuffer not thereby. True it is, that ſuch as theſe ſhall be by
ſo much the neerer a fortune, by how much the farther off they are
from integrity, except when the <hi>Prince</hi> his meere liberality inricheth
them out of his owne, without prejudicing any other. But ſuch as
are cald to favour to be inſtruments of the wicked to the ruine of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7477:95"/>
good (as thou waſt) are not of this number, but of a third degree as
deteſtable, for being in the extremitie of evill, as is that of the good
deſirable, that marcheth in the fore-ranke of goodneſſe; ſo as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that (among all men in the world) thou onely art in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and as ſuch an one unworthy of either excuſe or pardon.</p>
               <p>Much amazed remained <hi>Cataſcopo</hi> at this ſo rigorous though juſt
judgement of <hi>Polimero,</hi> which ended, he was reconducted to priſon
where along time he continued without any hope of pardon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromena</hi> having paſſed over into <hi>Corſica</hi> and taken <hi>Bonifacio,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch'd
on to <hi>Sagona</hi> which yeelded it ſelfe to her mercy; with the ſame
felicitie tamed ſhe the <hi>Talſines,</hi> acquired <hi>Teliſano,</hi> the valley of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,
Giovellino</hi> with whatſoever other places are contained in <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Corſo.
Nebbio</hi> that was then the citie and ſeate Royall made her ſome
reſiſtance, the Rebels being reduced thither, and moſt reſolute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves till death; which they had performed, if the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
had thereunto conſented: which later weying with themſelves
the loſſe they ſuſtained by <hi>Polimero's</hi> valour, and conſidering withall
how ſcant their proviſion was growne, yeelded on reſervation of
the ſafegard of their lives and goods: whileſt the Rebels ſeeing the
people ſo inclined, ſaved themſelves by timely flight in <hi>Balagnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time had <hi>Polimero</hi> (long before) ſent the <hi>Count</hi> of
<hi>Bona</hi> to the King his father, that he might (when he had given an
account of his embaſſage in <hi>Maiorica</hi>) obtaine an other for <hi>Sardeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
to demand in marriage for him <hi>Eromena,</hi> wherein he was with
ſuch expedition diſpatched as <hi>Nebbio</hi> was ſcarce rendred up, when
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> received letters from her father, with newes of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall
of an Embaſſadour from the King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> about a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of ſo great importance as it neceſſarily required her perſonall
preſence, wiſhing her therefore to leave good order for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and to hie her ſelfe thither with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Vpon this <hi>Eromena,</hi> well knowing what the buſineſſe was,
though loth to part from her lover, poſted away, leaving all the
troopes in his charge, taking along with her the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> with the
principall Commanders of the Campe, to the end that the whole
honour of the conqueſt of <hi>Corſica</hi> might reſt entirely his alone.
Nor was ſhe therein deceived, for <hi>Polimero</hi> (deſirous to bring his
enterpriſe to an end, and above all to get into his hands the Rebels)
came before <hi>Balagnia</hi> ſo ſuddenly and unexpected, as they had no
time to get out, as they made account to have done, any tentative of
theirs ſerving them to no purpoſe, for that the citie was walled round
about, ſo as it was ſoone given up, and the Rebels conſigned him
alive. This done, he tooke <hi>Calui</hi> wth all its territorie, nor remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there now other than <hi>Genarca,</hi> which becauſe of its being ſeated
on the ſea, had not ſo eaſily beene forced, if he, by bringing thither
the Fleet, had not conſtrained it to follow the fortune of the others.
Afterwards having embarked the Rebels on the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
he commanded the Admirall to deliver them from him to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7477:96"/>
King. As ſoone as <hi>Eromena</hi> was come the King told her, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for which he ſent for her, was, for that the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi>
had ſent to demand her in marriage for his ſonne <hi>Polimero.</hi> She (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as though the matter were ſtrange to her) anſwered, that ſhee
would doe what ſhould be by the State thought fitting, referring
her ſelfe wholly to the Councell. Now thoſe of the Councell come
with her from the Campe were fewer than thoſe others of the
Court, and approved of the marriage, acknowledging for chiefe of
their ſide the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagnio.</hi> But the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Boſſa</hi>
(being uncle to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Montevero</hi>) endevoured by all meanes
to croſſe thoſe nuptials, making with the kinſmen of the Rebels ſo
ſtrong a voice, as that but for the others authoritie, he had eaſily
hindred it. His reaſons were, the diſparitie of their yeares, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without any patrimonie, his having made many principall hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the kingdome his enemies, with the impriſonment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the torture and death of ſo many Barons, which though
it were done on a juſt ground, yet was not juſtice able to give every
one ſatisfaction. And though that prudent <hi>Princes</hi> ought to aime
their levell at reaſon onely when they reape no prejudice therefrom,
yet if they ſee any likelihood of the contrary, then ought they to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
the paſſions of their ſubjects, who being potent in a ſtate might
otherwiſe trouble it, they preſuppoſing the juſtice done to the faulty,
to bee a generall injury to their bloud, whereof in reſpect of the
number of ſuch as were innocent, there ſhould be a ſpeciall care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
not to contaminate the honour of ſome, in the puniſhing of
ſome others. Nor can the governement be ſupportable of a <hi>Prince</hi>
brought in with the bloud of ſo many, who for for being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to leade a life full of jealous ſuſpitions) cannot be beheld other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than with an evill eye by the kinſmen of ſuch as were by him
delivered up to the hangmau: that his Majeeſtie ſhould conſider not
ſo much whether what was propoſed were reaſonable, as whether
the ſame were profitable or no. And on the contrary; if the ſole
reaſon were for its being prejudiciall to him; true it were that juſt
<hi>Princes</hi> ſhould deſire the execution of juſtice, though the whole
world came thereby to periſh; but that this caſe required no ſuch
juſtice, for in denying <hi>Polimero</hi> the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> we (ſaid he) neither
wrong him, nor take from him ought that is his, whereas by giving
her him, we ſhould wrong the Realme by endangering it, and take
from it what it its owne by depriving it of its peace, there being
many ſpirits that cannot brooke the governement of this <hi>Prince,</hi>
though (I confeſſe) in all other reſpects worthy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagnio</hi> could not without indignation heare
out this Oration, wherein he diſcovered many heads of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
Riſing up therefore on his feete, and concealing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
what he conceived of it, he anſwered to his objections. That
the diſproportion of yeares was not a diſadvantage to be calculated
betweene <hi>Princes,</hi> it bringing no prejudice to the maine principall;
which alſo if it were to be calculated ſhould be rather objected on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7477:96"/>
                  <hi>Polimero's</hi> ſide; that his being without patrimony was that which was
of them to be ſought after, to the end that his affection might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to any other ſtate or country than that of <hi>Sardegna</hi> (here gave
he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the way a touch of his ſupplying the want of a patrimony
by the conqueſt of <hi>Corſica,</hi> &amp; of the obligation that the crown owed
him therefore.) That the enmitie he incurr'd with the Barons ſhould
ſerve &amp; much availe for the amplifying of his deſerts, ſo as he much
wondred at their inducing for an excluſive argument, that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all thing elſe expreſſed his worthineſſe; that the rebels kinſmen
were known for <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of conditions ſo noble, as would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any cauſe hate <hi>Polimero's</hi> perſon; and though they were ſuch as
would wiſh him ill, howſoever, yet had they no reaſon for his ſake to
hate the ſtate, and ſo prefer their particular enmity before the publike
benefit; which if it ſo were not, and that therfore thoſe nuptials caried
with them ſome apparance of danger, yet ſhould there not be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
any reckoning made, ſeeing that <hi>Princes</hi> ought in every ſtate to
maintaine the priviledges of their dignitie; which they doe not when
they lend an eare to all manner of privie whiſperings, by liſtning
wherto they come at length to be drawn to condiſcend to any thing,
even to the putting down of the crown, and renouncing the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or to beare the ſcepter, and govern, not as a King, but as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
magiſtrate depending on the will of others. True it was that
the people ought to be hearkened unto, &amp; that in matters of law and
juſtice, the <hi>Prince</hi> ought to part from his own opinions and cleave to
better judgments; for which purpoſe were counſellors and councels
ordained, which were otherwiſe ſuperfluous and vaine; but yet that in
matters abſurd and unjuſt he ought to let them ſee, that he knowes
how both to conceive and puniſh offences; making it thereby appeare
to every one, that his taking of counſell ſprang not from defect, but
from excellency of judgment, which is to the nature of a <hi>Prince</hi> more
particularly adherent, than any other condition whatſoever, that the
puniſhing of the guilty was to be imputed no more to <hi>Polimero,</hi> than
to juſtice it ſelf; which if it ſhould be therfore hated, then might we in
ſuch a caſe grant, that he might alſo with reaſon be ſtomacked; that
his comming to the principality could not prove inſupportable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than ill-minded men; his ſteps of aſcending thereto being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
not on the bloud of any of the nobilitiey and their demerits, but
upon his own bloud and <hi>well-known</hi> deſerts; nor was it to be doubted
that he would become ſuſpitious, &amp; ſo by conſequence cruell, ſeeing
that the rebels kindred either approved, or not approved of their
miſdeeds, which if they approved, they then made themſelves acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
to the ſame fault; if diſapproved, they could not chuſe then but
approve of their puniſhment; nor was it leſſe ſtrange to ſay that their
honour remained blemiſht by the others puniſhment, as if we would
beſeech <hi>love</hi> not to let the Sun ſhine on any uncleane thing, for feare
of polluting it ſelfe therewith; but if they ſtill inſiſt, that their honor
is thereby contaminated, let them then tell mee what is in their
judgement fit to bee done, and whether the murthering of ones
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7477:97"/>
                  <hi>Prince,</hi> and betraying of ones countrey, merit impunity and reward?
Furthermore hee denied that the rule of juſt and profitable
had the ſuppoſed diſtinctions, which though they had, yet could
not that any way ſtead them for the preſent purpoſe. In fine, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that none but traitors could either refuſe or oppoſe this
match being both juſt and lawfull, which he offered (beſides argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
to make good with the ſword. Much amazement in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
bred this reſolute ſpeech of <hi>Oriſtagnio;</hi> and little wanted the
<hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Boſſa</hi> of being ſeconded, when he excuſing his ſpeeches
with much humilitie, and the King being unwilling to be entangled
with new garboiles (feare occaſioning ſuch effects in him, as it uſeth
to doe in ſuch as thinke by ſuffocating evils to make them ſheere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way)
the matter was whoſht up with the concluſion of the marriage.</p>
               <p>Well perceived the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> how her father erred with too much
facilitie, but ſeeing it could not be remedied; ſhe with <hi>Oriſtagnio's</hi>
counſell reſolved to call the priſoners to be put to death before the
publication of the marriage, and returne of <hi>Polimero,</hi> thereby to free
him (as much as in her lay) from the imminent hatred of the Barons.
That which in this deſigne of hers troubled her moſt, was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Epicamedo;</hi> ſhe ballanced all thoſe reaſons that made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
worthy of death, with that one ſole regall qualitie of his,
which gave the ſcales ſuch a ſhake, as it was impoſſible to find means
or counter-reaſons to condemne him. Moſt inconvenient ſeemed it
alſo to proceede againſt him by a judicious way, as againſt private
perſons, by nature, law, and oath ſubject to the ſtate. In deciding this
point were many dayes conſumed, with no few arguments of both
ſides. After which was reſolved, that for one borne free, a King
and a Soveraigne, to live a priſoner, deprived of a kingdom, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the charge of a Iavlor, was no ſmall puniſhment: howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that his Realance was well gotten from him by the common rule
of nature, which teacheth us to repell force by force, not ſo much by
a title of war, as becauſe it was a warre begun by him, who became a
refuge to traitors, an entertainer of rebels, and a foſterer of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of <hi>Princes;</hi> with an example tyrannicall and prejudiciall to
himſelfe, if it had fortuned him to have continued in his royal eſtate:
nor were all thoſe dangers that were propoſed to be likely to ſpring
from the keeping of him alive, able to remove <hi>Eromena</hi> from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
clemencie; who onely kept him ſecure under the charge of a
faithfull guarde, whereof there was no great neede; for he having
underſtood of the loſſe of his kingdome, and of the reſolution taken
touching his perſon, growne furiouſly mad thereat, and wanting
wherewithall to kill himſelfe, ranne his head at the wall with ſuch a
horrible force as he therewith daſh'd out his braines; for the others
were prepared new wayes of torture, as pinſers, ſheares, hot irons,
and fires: but the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> thereto conſented not, leaving ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
for helliſh furies, contenting her ſelfe that they (though
worthy of all torments) paid the law its due, and ſatisfied by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the neceſſitie and publike deſire of juſtice, which was executed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7477:97"/>
with ſo great a concourſe of ſpectators as that the field was not
capable to containe ſo great a throng. The Traytors dying all of
them penitent of the offence, except the obſtinate Admirall. In the
meane time was the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona</hi> held in ſuſpence (almoſt two
montehs ſpace) without receiving any publike anſwer; being never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
well informed of its occaſion, and ſumptuouſly entertained.
The newes being afterwards come of the totall poſſeſſion of <hi>Corſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and <hi>Polimero</hi> deſiring there ſhould be ſent thither a Vice-Roy to
governe it; a generall aſſembling of the ſtates of the kingdome, was
reſolved of, to which end came together the feodatories &amp; deputies
of every one of the Cities and Provinces. The firſt thing in that
Parliament decreed, was the <hi>Prince's</hi> funerall exequies, which were
celebrated with ſuch an orderly pompe, as that they might with
more reaſon bee termed triumphs; there not appearing other lugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous
object, than the habit and affection to the deceaſed <hi>Prince.</hi>
There were to be ſeene the repreſentations and modells of ſacked
cities, battells won, people tamed and vanquiſhed, of Kings and
Giants taken and led captives, of wilde beaſts trampled downe, and
monſters ſlaine, the liberalitie uſed towards the vanquiſhed;
the giving of cities and whole kingdomes, not for avaritious
but for honourable ends; the Virgins preſerved and the women
cared for: the dangers of the land and ſea, voyages and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of new regions. In ſumme all whatſoever could in ſuch a
ſubject bee imagined for the expreſſion of his a thouſand-fold
happineſſe, if there had not (among ſo many ornaments of glorie)
violently beene inſerted in the minds of the beholders the occaſion
of his death.</p>
               <p>At the ſecond ſitting was in ſolemne forme eſtabliſhed the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of <hi>Corſica</hi> to the kingdome of <hi>Sardegna,</hi> with a law of never
alienating it more for any occaſion whatſoever. Some there were
that would have their lawes and priviledges quite aboliſhed, but
thereto would not the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> aboſolutely conſent, thinking it beſt
to ſee firſt how they demeaned themſelves, who though conquered
by force, ſhould not be for that reſpect worſe uſed than before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen not through their owne, but through their <hi>Prince's</hi>
faultineſſe, whoſe remembrance ſhold bee defaced out of the
peoples hearts by good vſage and continuation of favours;
rather than by harſh uſage, and withdrawing of favours to give
them cauſe of endeavouring to regaine their former freedome. As
for the lawes, ſhe well knew their aboliſhing to be neceſſarie, being
that a body cannot be formed of two ſoules, and thoſe different;
and would therefore have the <hi>Sardan</hi> lawes ſerve for, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both kingdomes; nominating the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagnio</hi>
Vice-roy of <hi>Corſica</hi> with generall applauſe of the univerſall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
               <p>There being propounded afterwards at the third ſitting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Mauritania</hi> (not for obtaining of conſent thereto, but to
have it confirmed by counſell) upon recitall of <hi>Polimero's</hi> merits,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7477:98"/>
and of the conqueſt of <hi>Corſica</hi> there was not ſo much as one that
gaineſaid it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> of <hi>Oriſtagnio</hi> parted ſuddely, to the end <hi>Polimero</hi>
might come to celebrate the marriage. Now he had received daily
intelligence from his <hi>Eromena,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Bona,</hi>
of all that was done in <hi>Sardegna,</hi> wherefore though he were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to diſpatch himſelfe thence, yet waited he with all patience,
the orderly proceeding of his affaires, conformable to the neceſſitie
of the times, ſetling in the meane time the places he had gotten in
ſuch order, as they might be eaſily conſerved; fortifying every
place, whoſe ſite or neceſſitie required it, having a ſpeciall eye to
the aſſuring of the ports, but chiefely to the remoteſt from <hi>Sardegna</hi>
in the face of <hi>Liguria.</hi> So as when the <hi>Marqueſſe</hi> came, and found
all things ſo well ſetled, he ſaid, that <hi>Corſica</hi> might well be kept
without his government; it being ſo well ordered, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for it for a long time to fall into any diſorder. Arrived in
<hi>Sardegna,</hi> and as its <hi>Prince</hi> reverenced of every one, he came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri,</hi>
met with great pompe and extraordinary applauſe; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kiſſed the Kings hands, he would needes doe no leſſe to <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's</hi>
alſo, the preſence of the multitude prohibiting them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
one another according to their internall amorous affects, ſo as
they greeted each other with outward apparances, according to the
ſtile of convenient ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The King for all theſe rejoycings never once joyed at all, but the
more he obſerved his ſonne-in-law in his actions reſemble his ſonne,
the more he felt his heart rent with the memorie therof, which he ſo
loved, as for it he diſloved every thing elſe not excepting himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero's</hi> firſt reſolution was to licence the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> forces,
wherewith he well pleaſed the whole kingdome; he re-ſent them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with the pillage or <hi>Corſica,</hi> and therefore paſſing well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſending backe alſo with them all the Fleet, except the Galleyes,
which he ſent for <hi>Metaneone</hi> to come to his marriage; and he by
entreatie of his father and mother-in-law, got leave to bring alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him <hi>Eromilia.</hi> Having then ſhip'd themſelves (after they
had by a Fleet-Galley ſent their brother word of their comming)
they ſayled the two firſt daies with proſperous windes; but were the
two following greatly troubled with Southerly windes, ſo as they
had much ado to keep in the maine, from croſſing over to the <hi>Gaulan</hi>
coſt. But the winde increaſing and blowing with extraordinary fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
they having loſt their direct courſe, were driven into the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtike</hi>
ſea, without being able to touch the Iland of <hi>Corſica.</hi> The
ſweet <hi>Eromilia</hi> found her ſelfe heart-ſicke, being unable to taſte any
ſuſtenance; ſore was ſhe troubled with vomiting, ſo as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in her ſtomack, ſhe caſt up the very pure bloud, to the extreme
griefe of her husband, who would willingly have died rather than
have ſeene her ſo languiſh. He had once hoped to come by ſome
meanes or other to ſtrike on the <hi>Corſan</hi> ſhore, but ſeeing himſelfe
tranſported beyond <hi>Capo-Corſo,</hi> he commanded to take the winde
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7477:98"/>
in poop, and to runne a-ſhore on the neereſt place of landing.</p>
               <p>North-ward from that <hi>Cape</hi> ſtood a little diſinhabited Iſolet,
where having with much adoe caſt anchor, they preſently ſet a-ſhore
the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> who no ſooner touched land, than that there came to
meete her a white fawne, which gently licking her hands, ſeemed to
kiſſe them for her welcome thither. No ſmall delight tooke <hi>Eromi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
to ſee ſo timorous a creature growne ſo domeſticke, ſo as forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her paſſed feares, ſhee cald for ſomething to feede her withall;
whileſt ſhe (gentle thing) taking the bread (as it were for good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſake) out of her faire hand, and then letting it wantonly fall
(as needing it not,) continued in cheriſhing her, and (as farre as
could be comprehended) in inviting her to goe along with her, for
having walked eight or tenne ſteps ſhe would looke backe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelfe not followed would returne againe, doing oftentimes
the ſelfeſame thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metaneone,</hi> who was paſſing glad to ſee his Lady take pleaſure in
a beaſt, that ſeemed to participate of reaſon, imagined that this
Iland might be one of thoſe, wherein was beleeved to be by authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
relations the tranſmutation of men into beaſts; but yet keeping
his thoughts to himſelfe for feare of inſtilling of new feares into the
minde of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> he prayed her to give him leave to follow
that Deere, ſithence that ſhe ſo evidently thereto invited him; which
the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> would not aſſent unto, aſwell becauſe ſhe was loth to be
without his company, as alſo for that ſhe beleeved not, that theſe
actions of the ſilly beaſt contained in them other myſterie, than the
content of her owne nature. But obſerving her continue them, and
too withall grone, as if ſhe grieved to be diſobeyed, ſhe permitted
him to goe.</p>
               <p>The Deere ſeeing her ſelfe now followed, went on a little further,
but no ſooner perceived ſhee her ſelfe not followed by <hi>Eromilia,</hi>
than ſhe came running backe to her amaine. Whereat ſhe (marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and deſirous to know the iſſue thereof) cauſed her ſelfe to
be carried after her. The gentle beaſt led on a round pace, making
ſometimes an obſervant ſtand as if ſhe meant to give time to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken.
And gotten out of the ſight of the ſea, ſhe entred into a
little, but very pleaſant valley; where (ere ſhe had gone two bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots
on) ſhe ſtood ſtill before a poore cottage, lying at the foote
of a rocke, ruſtically built of earth and fagots; at the doore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſtood playing with little ſtickes the beſt featured and fairſt child
that ever humane eye beheld; his age was about three yeares, his
body covered with a rich habit, and his countenance clothed with a
no leſſe commanding than majeſticall phyſignomy. This ſweet
boy ſeeing ſo many folkes, ſtood looking on them awhile, and then
ſuddenly neglecting them, and turning to the fawne-wards (that
plaid skipping and hopping round about him) he ſtroaking her,
made very much of her, and ſhe of him.</p>
               <p>Whileſt thus <hi>Eromilia</hi> (having forgotten all paſt diſcommodities)
ſtood with her lookes fixed on them, there came ſuddenly to them
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7477:99"/>
a Knight with a croſſebow in his hand, and many birds in his
fowling-bagge, who (having eſpied the Galleyes) had left off his
fowling, to come running to his lodging; his clothes (though not
very good for being much torne) were all of ſilke, garniſhed and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
embrodered over with gold; he ſeemed to be about five and
and fortie yeares of age, and had an aſpect noble and courteous; his
followers were no more than one ſervant not very young, with a
bow and a hare on his necke. Both of them changed their colours
ſeeing <hi>Metaneone</hi> with ſo many folkes; and looking one upon the
other, ſeemed with their eyes to expreſſe ſome great matter. The
faſhion of their habits was very ſtrange, quite differing from thoſe
of neighbour regions, which deſcried them to bee of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromilia</hi> impatient to ſtay till they would ſpeake, ſeeing them ſo
in a maze, ſaid unto them; My friends, I beleeve that this unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſight of us, breeds in you no leſſe aſtoniſhment, than the ſeeing
you in ſo ſolitarie a place hath ſtirred up wonder in us; but if your
taciturnitie ſpring from none other roote than from that of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in that you expected no ſuch gueſts; then I pray you to forgoe
it wholly, for we are not perſons to doe you any injurie, but rather
to pleaſure you and doe you all the courteſies that lie in our power.
Pleaſe you but tell us who you are, and whether this babe be your
ſonne, or that <hi>love</hi> (fearing his jealous wife) hath given him you to
keepe, to the end that he, being ſo reſerved, may in time doe ſuch
exploits, as might be expected from ſuch as are deſcended from
celeſtiall Deiries.</p>
               <p>The Knight, who at firſt ſight had not placed his eyes on other
than <hi>Metaneone</hi> and his Knights, (becauſe <hi>Eromilia</hi> exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in the babe was gotten to ſit downe by him) now obſerving
her, and contemplating the appearances which denoted her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he with a more ſetled countenance, ſaid unto her; <hi>Madame,</hi> I
cannot denie but that your comming into this ſtrange and diſinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
place, ſtrikes in us ſome admiration, this little Iland not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
of other than us alone, nor frequented but of ſuch as are
winde-driven hither, whether they will or no. Here ſee we never
any other than Marriners and Fiſher-men, poore creatures, I will
not ſay guided by fortune, but going to ſeeke their fortune. Your
qualitie ſeemes to us much different, ſo as by reaſon of the diverſitie
of ours, we cannot (in ſeeing you) tell what to judge thereof; when
therefore it ſhall pleaſe you to let us know who you are, we will not
faile to obey you, in what you command us, nor would we without
great reaſon requeſt that favour of you.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight (anſwered him the <hi>Princeſſe</hi>) if that can ſatisfie you,
there ſhall be no let in us to worke your ſatisfaction. This whom
you here ſee, is the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Mauritania</hi> my Lord and husband,
the other our knights; my name is <hi>Eromilia</hi> the King of <hi>Maiorica's</hi>
only daughter, borne with a naturall inſtinct to helpe men of merit,
as you ſeeme to be; hither are we come driven with the violence of
the windes and for no other reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7477:99"/>
The Knight (having already underſtood their caſes by ſome
poore folkes that had beene there, caſting a-ſide his croſſebow)
would have kiſſed their hands; but not being permitted ſo to doe,
eſpecially by <hi>Metaneone,</hi> he beſought them to enter in with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his poore Caban, where he promiſed them a part (in private) to
ſatisfie their deſire. Already moved they themſelves onwards to
follow him, when there appeared from the Fleet in ſeemely order a
great number of ſervants with divers diſhes of meat <hi>and delicate cates
of all ſorts;</hi> which the knight perceiving, and comprehending by the
tempeſt of the ſea, that yet continued, what the matter was, hee
(laying aſide all ſuſpition, which the ſudden apparition of ſuch a
number had bred in him) ſaid unto them; May it pleaſe you (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Princes</hi>) to give your bodies ſome comfort, ere you content
your mindes with the curioſitie of our fortunes, the deferring
whereof cannot ſo much trouble you, as the delaying of recreating
and reſtoring your bodies after your paſt ſufferings muſt needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
you.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> (more for the deſire ſhe had to rid her
ſelfe of the company, than for any appetite) tooke ſome refection;
the <hi>Prince</hi> doing alſo the ſame; entertained with the ſweet demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the noble babe; who neither caring for, nor yet deſpiſing
the cates they gave him (though moſt delicate,) expreſſed a Royall
gravitie in the povertie of the place, farre from ſuch pettiſh wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as is uſually in that age common to all children; he diſdained
not <hi>Eromilia's</hi> affectionate kiſſes, but being well pleaſed with them,
would with a kinde of a ſweet willingneſſe meete them as they were
comming; her he contemplated, examining with a ſuſpence of
ſpirit, all her parts, her ſpeech and geſture; obſerving her with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
not as a thing ſtrange unto him, but out of a judgement
mature enough to know her merits. Impoſſible it was to perſwade
the Knight to taſte of any thing, who notwithſtanding wanted not
diſcreete manners and humble language, to defend himſelfe from
their enforcing courteſies; ſomething he accepted of, which were
onely ſuch as he ſaw liked by the child, of him reſpected not as a
ſonne, but as his Lord.</p>
               <p>By this time had the <hi>Prince's</hi> ſervants pitch'd ſome tents in the
ſelfeſame valley farre from the ſight and roaring of the ſea (for ſuch
was the command of the <hi>Princeſſe;</hi>) in one of them dined they, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
away the time there, till the Knight having dined with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the tables taken away, they licenſing for awhile their
traine walking ontowards the Caban; where entred in, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
at its no leſſe ſtrange than rare architecture, for that which
ſeemed to be but a cottage, was in appearance no other, but in effect
ſerved but to limit a ſecret and hidden dwelling. And to make no
ſhew of what was therein, there ſtood placed in it two poore beds
of greene leaves and boughs of trees, with a poore hearth and a
homely chimney, which made ſuch as came in, beleeve there was
nothing elſe. But opening a doore (that ſeemed to be a wall cloſed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7477:100"/>
faſt to the rocke, built to keepe off its moiſture) there was an entry
that led into a hollow vault of a ſoft mouldrie ſtone, under the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of a rocke, which was divided into two partitions of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings;
in the principall of them ſtood a ſquare Hall with two faire
lodging chambers and one backe chamber: In the other lodgings
were ſervants beds, ſellers, wardrobes, and other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>places and ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
for neceſſarie proviſions, which might there be ſeene, not
onely copious, but alſo ſingular in their ſeverall kindes; and to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the one and the other, ſtood placed in the midſt of them,
(compaſſing it in forme of a Crowne) a little court formed by
nature in the very rocke, which by degrees opened it ſelfe to its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
toppe with ſuch a well-obſerved proportion, as art ſeemed to
have lent a hand thereto. And becauſe the raine trickled by ſeverall
channels downe to the bottome, there was formed an ample ciſterne
to receive it, the place being in its ſuperior part inacceſſible, and
therefore unknowne to any.</p>
               <p>The Hall (we ſpeake of) was all hung with ſilke hangings of tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not ſeene before in <hi>Europe,</hi> being rich, ſtrong, of various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
incapable of ſpot or ſtaine; and withall ſo lively as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of the aire from them, made the place more lightſome. The
chambers adorned with cloth of tiſſue, had placed in one of them
two beds of the ſame ſute and faſhion, in one whereof lay the child,
in the other the Knight: their furniture were all pretious, no ſide
thereof wanting either rich curioſities, or riches, worthy (without
curioſitie) of the greateſt Monarch; the tables were of ſilver of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
workemanſhip; the livery cupbords of gold inlaid with rich
pretious ſtones, with houre-glaſſes of the ſame, but that the gold
was brought to be of an ineſtimable value by the quality of the gems
and orientall pearles inlaid therein; that which made up this wonder
of rare curioſities, was, when betweene the two lodgings diviſions,
was opened a doore covered with arras, where-through was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
leading into an odoriferous Chappell dedicated to the gods,
whoſe Images were little, but all of maſſive gold, and ſo reſplendent
with the abundance of ſo many Iewels that ſerved for fringe to
the rich tapeſtrie wherewith it was hung, as there is not any King in
the world that can boaſt of a treaſure equall thereunto. In the midſt
of this Chappell in ſix faire lampes of moſt pure gold, burned a
pretious liquor, whence iſſued an odour ſo pleaſingly ſweet and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
as paſſed all fragrancy, diſperſing it ſelfe over all the houſe to
the great reſtoring and raviſhing delight of the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>So aſtoniſhed were the <hi>Princes</hi> to ſee ſuch an excellencie of rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as they could never have their fill of beholding them; which
to obſerve well would require a great deale of time, whereas that
little time was taken up with varietie, the varietie with curioſitie, the
curioſitie with art, and the art (being inimitable in all his parts) with
its owne excellencie, ſo as the intellect (fixing it ſelfe, while on one,
and while on another wonder of matter and workemanſhip) was
carried about with a perpetuall motion, from one to the other,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7477:100"/>
remaining aggreeved for his being unperfect to judge of them. The
hangings of the Hall (though but of ſilke ſimply) poſſeſſed (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
ſome parts more worthy of contemplation than all the other
riches, not ſo much for that they contained the maps of ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
done with all thoſe exact proportions as are poſſible in art, as
becauſe they were fringed about with purple, its ſilke being died
in the bloud of beaſts to us unknowne, repreſenting the naturall
colours with ſuch vivacitie, as there was not any money that could
counter-value them. No other thing had bin able to have removed
the eyes of the <hi>Princes</hi> from beholding of theſe ſuch eye-raviſhing
objects, the like whereof they had never ſeene before, than the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
deſire (increaſed alſo by theſe circumſtances) which they had
to know the ſtory of the babe; whom <hi>Eromilia</hi> having taken on her
lap, and affectionatly cheriſhing with a motherly tendernes, praid the
Knight to acquit himſelf of his promiſe, whereunto he ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
obedient (as ſoon as they were ſitten down) ſpake in this forme.</p>
               <p>Some eight yeares may be expired, ſithence there chanced to
come to the kingdome of <hi>Arabia the happie,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Artacana</hi>
the youngeſt amongſt the ſonnes of the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> who for
his noble conditions was growne ſo famous, as there was not any
<hi>Princeſſe</hi> or <hi>Queene,</hi> that hearing of him deſired not to ſee him, and
ſeeing him, deſired not to have and enjoy him; ſo that he whileſt he
lived a Knight Errant, had more adoe with his love to ſatisfie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their affections, than to ſuccour them with his valour, which
in him was more than ordinarie. There reigned then in <hi>Arabia</hi> a
right noble Queene, that had beene ſome two yeares a widdow, a
woman of exquiſite beautie and extolled modeſtie; no ſonnes had
ſhe, but in their ſtead ſeven daughters, the elder whereof bred up
with hope of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cceſſion ſhe had then newly married to the <hi>Prince</hi>
of <hi>Suſiana,</hi> which marriage occaſioned the comming thither of the
<hi>Artacanan Prince,</hi> who borne to the exerciſe of armes and in them
bred up (upon the bridegromes invitation) came thither to honour
his friend, and to make his fame by exerciſing of his perſon grow
ſtill more famous in the world, the affect of honour being ſomewhat
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kin to that of gold, whereof the more one hath the more he covets.
It were too long to relate unto you the feates of armes he there
performed, only I muſt tell you that valour, beautie, and bodily fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(qualities without paragon in him) held very ones minde in
ſuſpence, to judge whether they overcame or were overcome of
courteſie and other vertues ſcated in the minde, which (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall)
twinkled forth ſparkles that argued great flames of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
not to be extinguiſhed by any other humour whatſoever. The
Queene who was then young (being not paſſing foure and thirtie
years of age) grew to be ſo ardently enamored of him, as no one
place could long hold her; nor were the conſiderations of her being
mother to ſo many daughters, &amp; Lady of ſo many people, ſufficient
to extinguiſh this ordor of hers; but (like ſome combuſtible matter
ſprinkled over with oyle) ſhe burned more vigorouſly when ſhe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7477:101"/>
lighted on any reaſons contrary to her deſire. This o! this was it
which made her neglect even her ſleep and food; dragd by amorous
furies a different way, ſhe ſtrove to defend her ſelfe from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and in the victory the exceſſive paines ſhe tooke to obtaine
it, weakened her forces againſt the ſucceeding battell. Shee ſhunn'd
the ſight of him, and yet was ſicke to ſee them, and being ſo ſicke,
would willingly have died, for not living ſicke perpetually, in that
her modeſtie permitted her not to ſue to him. In the meane time he
(both honoured and beloved) held correſpondencie with all, which
he well knew how to doe; nay, it had gotten in him ſuch a habit,
as that he could not chuſe but doe it. When he ſaw in himſelfe any
qualitie that he perceived to be in the Queene, he would joy thereat.
It grieved him much to ſee her retired, judging the feaſts and ſports
obſcured by the privation of her preſence, and that her griefe alone
was an univerſall contagion to the Vniverſe. He went to ſee her, and
grieved ſo to ſee her. Their language was not common (ſuch having
no place in perſons of ſingular vertue) but accompanied with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
affect of pitty, followed with a ſweet faintneſſe of the heart,
and waited on with manners Royall, and an expreſſion able to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
the moſt obdurate minde; forcible enough it was not to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(for the breach thereof was made already) but to raze to the
ground her conſtrained reſolution, her loſſe making her know
ſhe was too weake to reſiſt ſo many engins and ſo potent an enemy.
At length becauſe her modeſtie conſented not to the giving up of
that Fort unto any, which ever till then ſhe had conſerved, ſhe dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it her beſt courſe rather than to loſe it, to yeeld it up upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
conditions; wherefore retiring her ſelfe into her ſelfe, and
ſummoning her thoughts before the privy Councell of her conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſhe came to ſee, that it ill-befitted not her age and beautie to
take to her a husband, and too with all that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Artacana</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her equall though not his fathers heire) was no inconvenient
march for her. With this comforted, and reſolved, (leaving her
bed) ſhe appeared at the ſolemnities with an excellent beautie, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on with ſo rare perfections as engendred envy in her ſex, but
reverence and love, or rather a reverent love in any lover of beauty,
luckily borne under an amorous influence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> at that time exceeded not the age of foure and twentie
yeares, too young for the practice of the world, but not for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of love, that grew ſo fixed by affection (which by little
and little was a building in him) in all the geſtures of the Queene; as
it was no difficult matter for him to perceive the fire that the fuell
of his love maintained in her; but yet doubted he of being beguiled,
for albeit he might aſſuredly have builded on the foundation of his
owne merits; yet modeſtie (one of the vertues that embelliſhed
him) made him charie in judging the beſt of himſelfe, and much
more in cenſuring the worſt of others; being that ſuch inclinations
could not without ſome declination of honeſtie be preſuppoſed to
be (as he conceived in any woman whatſoever. An opinion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7477:101"/>
falſe, but ever diſcourteous; which argument of his was farre
from the thought of mariage, knowing himſelfe much younger than
her, and ſhe not onely a mother of a numerous off-ſpring, but alſo
likely to be ſhortly a grand-mother; wherin although he thought not
himſelfe deceived, yet determined he not to give himſelf over for all
that as a prey to deſire ere he knew that he were certaine of his hope.</p>
               <p>The dayes of thoſe feaſts were for the moſt part ſpent in feats
of Chivalry, <hi>maſqueradoes,</hi> ſhewes, dances, and huntings; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue
in journeying: for ſeeing that the whole kingdome, would
needs partake thereof, it was the Queenes pleaſure, that the foure
moneths deſtined to that end, ſhould be ſtored amongſt the foure
royall cities, which were <hi>Omano</hi> the Metropolitan citie placed in the
midſt of the Kingdome; <hi>Zabra</hi> ſituate (as it were) under our <hi>Tropicke;
Saba</hi> in the extremitie of the <hi>Arabian</hi> creeke, and <hi>Carma</hi> beyond the
<hi>Sudmaritan</hi> mountaines; nor was the time ſpent in iourneying recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this account, becauſe every of them would needs feaſt their
Queene their full moneth out, lodging and entertaining her Court
with all its followers, without any charge at all to the Exchequer.
By which occaſion alſo all ſuch ſtrangers as were flocked thither,
ſaw all that part of the kingdome, where grew the aromaticall and
ſweet-ſmelling ſpices, which is in the <hi>Sabeian, Mineian</hi> and <hi>Scalal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quarters, to ſuch paſſing recreation of the ſenſes, that ſuch of them
as had been profeſſed travellers, proteſted, that they never guſted
the pleaſantneſſe of any journey with ſuch a raviſhing content, as
humane ſenſe might imagine it held conformitie with the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
excepting this onely, the odors of <hi>Myrrhe, Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi>
(in the place where they grow, and where every one may
with his hands gather them) farre ſupaſſing the odors of the ſame
ſimples tranſported any where elſe. the very aire there, being alſo
ſituate under ſo fortunate a clime, as it breathes nought els but ſweet
odors, nor diſtils other than right pretious balmes; nay more, the
impartiall-ſeeming Sun which in the ſame paralell in other places
melts and kills, there vivifies and recreates. And the hew of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
countenances which in <hi>Arabia</hi> the deſart, (though many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
more northerly) are gloomie and ſwarffee, are here neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
cleere and lively. If then among the pleaſures of ſo delightfull a
climate, among the commodities of a terrene Paradiſe, amongſt the
allurements of feaſts &amp; revellings, and occaſion of journeyings love
had not commoditie, paſſage, and place to lodge it ſelfe in, we muſt
needes beleeve him to be rather deprived of judgement, than hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked.</p>
               <p>The marriage was celebrated in <hi>Carma,</hi> a palce for all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts moſt commodious; there ended the Queene her
moneth, and there alſo ſhooke ſhe off her ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Artacana</hi> grew to be extraordinarily altered from
what he was wont to be, to the no ſmall griefe of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
who for having invited him thither, thought himſelfe obliged
to entertaine him in ſuch manner, as melancholy might get no ſeat
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7477:102"/>
in him, he oftentimes would aske him what ailed him, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
putting on a merry countenance, ſtrove to conceale with its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
the effect thereof. The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſiana</hi> ſought every way to
procure his content, and thinking that the converſation of Ladies
might delight him, he had no great a-doe to frame a Colledge (as I
may ſay) of the faireſt of them, whereof ſome in ſtead of recreating
and curing of him grew by him to be infected.</p>
               <p>The Queene (having with an amorous prudence examined all
things with her ſelfe) aimed rightly at the occaſion of his alteration;
ſo as ſhe glad thereof, began to hope for ſome good iſſue to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires;
but yet (deſirous that the matter might be firſt broken, either
by him, or by ſome other accident) ſhe had the patience to expect
the occaſion of parting thence.</p>
               <p>Now to goe to <hi>Omano,</hi> they were to paſſe the mountaine in a
chaire, at the foote whereof were to ſtand ready their coaches. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
then from the mountaine, the Queene (under pretext of
the great heat) would have none in hers but the two younger girles;
whereupon the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſiana</hi> (who deſired to be alone with his
bride) came to her and told her, that there was no coach for the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Artacana,</hi> nor was there any provided for him, becauſe it
was thought her Majeſtie would have honour'd him with a place in
hers. She excuſing her ſelfe for not having thought of it, taking him
by the hand made him come and ſit by her of one ſide, cauſing the
two little <hi>Princeſſes</hi> to paſſe over to the other.</p>
               <p>This Queene bare in her countenance (placed there by nature) an
awing Majeſtie, whereby though ſhe had not beene borne a Queene,
ſhe would have beene reputed for ſuch, for that ſhe ſeemed with it
to teach reverence and reſpect. The <hi>Prince</hi> (docible in ſuch like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines)
learn'd them in an inſtant but unlearned himſelfe; for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his colour and ſpeech (as a man ſuddenly oppreſſed with a great
fit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ickneſſe) he remained deprived of all motion. The Queene
(intending to enquire of him how he like her countrey, ſeeing him
now in ſo profound a maze, laying aſide the faire colours which
ſhe carried in her countenance, and borowing of his pale and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
hew) ſaid haſtily unto him; What is this I ſee, My Lord?
Are you ſicke, and yet conceale your maladie? Doe you take mee
(perhaps) to be ſo diſcourteous as not to deferte my journey for
your good, if your health ſo required it? Vpon which words ſhe
intending to bid the coach returne; the <hi>Prince</hi> (revived with the
ſound of that voice with his eyes big with child of a captivated pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
a weeping diſcoverer of his amorous diſeaſe) return'd her this
anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madame,</hi> I beſeech you by the ſame courteſie, by whoſe meanes
my imagination is by you made innocently guiltie, not to breake off
for me your intended progreſſe; I cannot denie my ſelfe to be ſicke,
though my diſeaſe be of ſuch a nature that the more reſt it hath, the
more it increaſeth: there is no other way for me to overcome it but
by ſuffering, which although it cannot be cured, yet ſhould a Knight
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7477:102"/>
being not able to chaſe it away, endure it the beſt he may. For this
occaſion then, and not for any diffidence of your royall courteſie,
have I conceal'd it, howbeit it was never ſo preſumptuous a blab
(though for all that mute) as now it is. True it is, that I muſt excuſe
it becauſe it ſeeing no poſſibilitie of being cured otherwiſe than by
the hand of a goddeſſe, beleeving (and that peradventure rightly)
that you are that deitie, hath made bold to invoke you. The Queene
made no preſent anſwer, but after a ſhort pauſe ſaid thus unto him;</p>
               <p>I never yet heard (My Lord) of a diſeaſe of that nature; and though
I beleeve that the gods can (when they will) cure all diſeaſes, yet am
I ſomewhat dubious in beleeving, that ſuch a cure be reſerved, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more to the one than to the other, or to a goddeſſe rather
than to a god; but though it were granted that it could ſo bee,
yet how can your diſeaſe wanting the diſcourſe of reaſon beleeve
me to be a goddeſſe; or how can you ſay (that perhaps it beleeved
rightly) knowing me for a woman?</p>
               <p>That the gods (<hi>Madam</hi>) have divided their offices and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(replied the <hi>Prince</hi>) cannot (I beleeve) be doubted of: and
this perceive we plainely in the viſible gods; the one meddles not
with the others buſineſſe, be it either to helpe or hurt the things
created; onely they may becauſe of their benigne nature, with their
aſpects mitigate the evill effects of ſuch, which being of a diverſe
nature thinke but of harming us. That a diſeaſe hath underſtanding
though it want diſcourſe cannot be denied, unleſſe the naturall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among creatures be denied alſo; for how doth bloud guſh out
of the wound of a dead corps in its murtherers preſence, wanting
diſcourſe, nay (which is more) not having as much as ſenſe? It
muſt be then needs granted me, that all things either by power of an
internall ſympathy, or by relation (as we may ſay) of another thing
to the ſame (in ſome manner) correſpondent may without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
underſtand, and without will, will. In that I therefore
beleeve that my malady perhaps miſtakes not it ſelfe in thinking
you to be a goddeſſe I can ſay nothing, becauſe I know not what to
ſay. But the Queene ſolliciting him to make particular anſwer to
this point, as he had done to the reſt, (not by any means allowing of
his excuſes) got him at length to confeſſe unto her, that indeed his
deſeaſe was love; but that the qualitie of his Lady was ſo divine,
as that it deprived him not onely of all hope that his ſervice would
ever be accepted of, but alſo of all courage of preſuming to make it
knowne unto her, which he durſt not attempt for feare of the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her diſdaine, and that that accident had then befallen him,
becauſe his heart ſeeing her hold ſo great a conformitie in all things
with the Lady of his life, and taking her for the ſame indeede, was
moved to implore her gratious aſſiſtance; nor thought it itſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
aſwell because his Lady was a goddneſſe, as alſo becauſe it
could perceive no eſſentiall difference betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Queene, perceiving well what he meant, and yet reſolved
to get it plainely out of him, told him there was no Lady free, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7477:103"/>
at her owne diſpoſe that had cauſe to refuſe the ſervice of ſo noble
and vertuous a Knight as he was, unleſſe ſhe were a married wife,
ſuch a one having indeed a good cauſe of excuſe; whereto he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her, that ſhe was a widdow; ſhe replied, that widdowes might
lawfully re-marry. In fine, the end of their diſcourſe was the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
diſcovery of their affection, with the appointment of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to be mannaged with ſuch meanes as might beſt befit her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie
and credit; a concluſion that wrought in their hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
content not to bee changed for the poſſeſſion of the whole
world.</p>
               <p>The overjoyed Queene now aſſured of the affection of her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Prince,</hi> grew fairer every day than other, and come to <hi>Omano,</hi>
paſſed there right happily her deſtinated moneth. Faine would the
<hi>Prince</hi> have written unto his father to ſend him thither forthwith
Embaſſadors to demand her; whereunto ſhe (with whom love pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
not ſo much, but that modeſtie prevailed yet more) would
by no meanes conſent; to the <hi>Prince</hi> his ſo great torment, as he
thought himſelfe unable to ſupport it. Whereas ſhe founding the
fact with more maturitie, conſidered that the world (omitting the

therefore ſubject (as others were) to common paſſions) would have
ſaid that ſhe married onely to ſpite her daughter.</p>
               <p>The feaſts ended, ſhe licenced him with all the reſt: he having all
that time ſo behaved himſelfe, that though hee were enamored,
young, and full of fire, yet was there not any that could take notice
of his pretentions; and although he ſerved her with extraordinarie
diligence and that in tournies he carried her <hi>Impreſa</hi> and favours,
and that ſhee did him beſids the publike favour to terme him her
Knight; nevertheleſſe the opinion of modeſty in her, and diſcretion
in him being great, ſuffered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of Chivalrie, and of ſervice due rather to a Lady
than to love.</p>
               <p>Come home, he communicated his deſigne to the King his father
and to the <hi>Parthian Prince</hi> his brother, who aſſoone as they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſiana's</hi> returne home with his bride, were
not ſlacke to ſend to the Queene a noble embaſſage, which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to be expreſſed in preſence of the Councell. The obſtacles in
this buſineſſe were three; all of them of moment, whereof the leaſt
was the quantitie of daughters; of the other two the leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
was the jealouſie and by conſequence the enmitie of the <hi>Prince</hi>
of <hi>Suſiana;</hi> the laſt and greateſt of all was the danger of ſtirring up
rebellion in <hi>Arabia</hi> the deſart, whereof her late husband (the father
of the girles) having beene naturall King, it was to bee doubted
whether that people would ever obey a new King in prejudice of the
<hi>Princeſſe</hi> of <hi>Saſiana</hi> their legitimate Queene, as her, who of the
daughters was the eldeſt.</p>
               <p>To the firſt was anſwered, that a male being more convenient
and neceſſarie to the Realme than a female, and a naturall home-borne
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7477:103"/>
native more fit than a ſtranger; the mariage of the Queene
was approved to be, not onely laudable, but neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſiana</hi> (being the <hi>Artacan
Prince</hi> his friend) had no reaſon to diſlike of this alliance; and
though hee were more wedded to the hope of that kingdome, than
to its <hi>Princeſſe</hi> till then preſumed to be heireſſe; nevertheleſſe there
was not by this match any thing of his taken from him, becauſe
there having beene neither promiſe nor mention made of giving
him the kingdome for a Dower, hee was not bereſt of the hope of
having it, in caſe there ſprung not from theſe nuptials any heires
male; and if he would not be thus ſatisfied with reaſon, yet was
there no cauſe to feare him, conſidering the greatneſſe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the valour of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Artacana,</hi> and the force of the
<hi>Parthians</hi> apt upon any occaſion to invade <hi>Suſiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third, finding neither reaſon nor pretext, was ſaid, that it
lay not in the Queenes power either to give her new husband the
title of King of the other <hi>Arabia,</hi> nor yet (in caſe ſhe married) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it her ſelfe, it being not hers, but her daughters; adding, that
as they beſought her to marrie, that ſo ſhe might give them a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lord; ſo deſired they her to be alſo pleaſed in the ſelfe ſame
time to cede that kingdome, to whom it of right deſcended.</p>
               <p>With this the marriage was concluded on, and the kingdome of
<hi>Arabia</hi> the deſart granted to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Suſiana</hi> (who, for all the
inviting that he and his wife had to come to the celebration of the
marriage would by no meanes come;) and <hi>Artacana</hi> proclaimed
and crowned King of that Realme with generall applauſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſatisfaction; but little could ſhee or the kingdome enjoy him,
for within foure yeares time death tooke him away in the faireſt
flower of his yeares, &amp; in the greateſt expectation of proweſſe that
might be hoped for of any <hi>Prince</hi> of that age. Grievous then above
all griefes was the griefe of the more than grievouſly grieved
Queene, inſomuch as no perſwaſions could prevaile to take out of
her armes the dead corpes, her often ſwounding kept her alive by
making her become unſenſible of the ſharpeneſſe of the paine which
ſhee felt, without which ſhee had irrevocably accompanied
him. But (alas)' twas not here that her misfortunes ended; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left her by her husband two babes, the one a boy (which is this
here) and the other a girle; there was ſtirred up (a little after the
Kings death) an inſurrection in the Realme, in the favour of the cl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Princeſſe.</hi> In that time were the <hi>Parthians</hi> troubled by the <hi>Medes,</hi>
and our King (when he ſickned) was about to goe in perſon to the
aid of his father, who hath by this time (I beleeve) made an end of
loſing his ſtate and whole Dominions. <hi>Suſiana</hi> ſeeing himſelfe
therefore aſſured of his, on that part, and withall rid of a competitor;
having with gifts and promiſes made up a ſtrong faction in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-laws
kingdome, thought by laying hold on this occaſion to
become abſolute Lord thereof. Of his firſt motion the Queene was
not much affraid, either becauſe, ſhe having by the loſſe of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7477:104"/>
beene accuſtomed and vſed to the ſupremeſt of evils had no
feeling of leſſer; or for that ſhee relying upon the having of a male-legitimate
heire, cared little therefore, but gave her Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to goe pacifie the inſurrection.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rebels with the greateſt part of the other Barons who
(whether it were that they ſcorned to ſerue a babe in his ſwathing
bands, or for any hopes of better advancement, under a King great
of State, and well ſtricken in yeares) accorded to receive him;
whileſt he with a great army quartered on the cofines of the two
<hi>Arabiaes,</hi> reſolved he would be declared apparent heire (after the
Queene) of that kingdome, excluding by name <hi>Coralbo</hi> (for ſo is
this unfortunate child cald) in ſpight of all ſuch as oppoſed him. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few were thoſe that ſtucke to the Queenes ſide, all following the
fortune of the ſonne-in-law, with the pretext of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> by this
time fruitfull of three ſonnes; ſo as the poore diſtreſſed Queene
counſelled by neceſſitie, was faine to forgoe his ſonnes title; but
perceiving though too late, that this could not make up her good
ſonne-in-lawes content, and that <hi>Coralbos</hi> life was that which he ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at, ſhee ſent him to the ſtrong caſtle of <hi>Cardamina;</hi> when he
waxen wroth to ſee him ſo repriv'd from his barbarous crueltie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking
himſelfe now, and promiſing his ſiſters-in-law with great
Dowries to many <hi>Princes,</hi> had the heart to deprive his mother-in-law
of her kingdome; the death of his wife giving him occaſion ſo
to do, who whileſt ſhe liv'd would never conſent either to the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of her mother, or the death of her brother. Eſtabliſhed then
with the title of his ſonnes; the depoſed Queene (of every one pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
too late) conſidering how that <hi>Cardamina</hi> (whither ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired)
could not be long able to withſtand the Tyrants force, calling
me unto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sotiro</hi> my beloved Cozen (ſaid ſhe) I know you conceive the
miſerable eſtate whereto fortune hath reduced me, I am now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either husband or kingdome, and am alſo like enough to bee
ſhortly without a ſonne too. In ſuch loſſes as theſe (for which I
ſhould have died) I have conſerved my ſelfe alive, to the end that
at every new breathing I might lively feele them all: my kindred
and ſervants have all forſaken me, you onely (deare Cozen) have
left and loſt all to accompanie and comfort me, ſo that it is not the
leaſt among my griefes to know the diſproportion that is betweene
your fidelitie and my preſent ſtate, for not being able to reward
you, yet will I nevertheleſſe give you ſo efficacious a token of my
gratitude (though the receiving of it can bee to you but a great
trouble) that you will confeſſe it lies not in my power to give you
more, in the caſe I am in at this preſent. With that, taking the child,
and laying it in my armes, ſhe ſtood a good while without opening
her mouth, plung'd in a ſea of teares, till at laſt ſhe ſaid unto me,
This is that, which I promiſed you, the ſole Relique of my felicities
and onely comfort of all my loſſes and miſeries, which I muſt loſe
to my ſelfe that it be not loſt to the world; here is no place for him
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7477:104"/>
(poore <hi>Infant</hi>) no King or Prince, to whoſe truſt I may commit
him; you onely dare I boldly truſt him with. Vpon this (riſing off
her ſeate, and I following her with the babe in my armes) ſhe led me
into a great tower, where we found ſo much riches, Iewels and
coine, as I remained thereat aſtoniſhed, opening unto me afterwards
the places ſhut up, and my wonder thereat increaſing; Cozen (ſaid
ſhe) I would bid you take all that you here ſee, if the carriage of it
would not endanger you; take therefore all that you thinke may
ſtead and ſerve you, yet muſt you make account that what you
take, muſt (without any more) be the patrimonie of my poore
ſonne, and the ſtay of your loyaltie, my ſelfe not knowing either
what ſhall become of me, or whether I ſhall ever find any meanes of
ſending you any more. And as ſhe was about to tell me ſomewhat
touching the education ſhe would have me give him, ſhe was ſeazed
on by ſo great a floud of teares, as her unfiniſhed conceits were by
her ſobbings limited with this onely, Doe you.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I (transformed into her griefe, though moſt unapt
to comfort her) ſtrove (the beſt I could) to ſpeake ſomething to
her; but ſhe ſoliciting me to depart with ſuch ſpeedy earneſtneſſe,
as if the Tyrant had beene at the gates, I went and chuſed out of the
treaſure what liked me beſt, and taking up the babe got me to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinoe;</hi>
where landing in a Merchants habit, having with me the riches
ſigned up in diverſe packs with merchants marks, I paſſed to the <hi>Nile</hi>
deſending on it at my leaſure to the ſea, where boording a good
ſhop, I ſought <hi>for a ſetling place</hi> over all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Ilands,
but being winde-driven hither, and finding here a great heard of
goats with this Deere amongſt them, I wondered to ſee her ſo
gently fawne upon me without any feare at all; ſo as I judging this
a fit place for my purpoſe, called it (becauſe of the goates) <hi>Capraia;</hi>
and finding this mouldrie ſtone eaſie to be wrought, I ſent for
workmen from <hi>Liguria,</hi> who in a ſhort time made me the houſe you
here ſee, wherein I will doe my beſt to conceale this diſinherited
<hi>Prince.</hi> I brought along with me three right faithfull ſervants, one
my owne, the others given me by the Queene; but becauſe I never
wrote unto her more than once from <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> I ſent her (ſome three
moneths ſithence) one of them to bring her newes of us, not ſo much
for diſcharge of my dutie as to know what ſtate ſhe now is in, and
to ſee, if there be any likelihood of any hope of our returne; wherein
if there appeare an impoſſibilitie, I intend to continue here, till ſuch
time as the child grow to be able to exerciſe horſe and armes; by
that time, ſuſpitions ceaſed, my ſelfe growne aged, he well growne
up, and both of us altogether unkend and quite forgotten, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to bring him elſewhere, that fortune may not together
with his kingdome deprive him of thoſe fruits the world is like to
reape from his (truly Royall) inclinations. And this (excellent
<hi>Princes</hi>) is all that you deſired to know, which I beſeech you to
account as not ſpoken; nor had your Royall dignities beene ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to have made mee become thereof confident enough, if your
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7477:105"/>
aſpects carried not engraven in them the merits of your vertues
worthy to be the cabinet of ſo great a ſecret.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eromilia</hi> hugging the babe cloſe to her faire breaſt, with kiſſing it
a thouſand times, could not containe her ſelfe from weeping; faine
would ſhe have praied <hi>Sotiro</hi> to goe along with her to have him bred
up in her Court, if ſhe had thought to have obtained him; which
proffer ſhe and <hi>Metaneone</hi> both made him, with expreſſion how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
they were thereof, but he humbly thanking her, told her, that
he would finde a time to come with him to ſee and ſerve her. The
three dayes that the tempeſt laſted, paſſed the <hi>Princeſſe</hi> pleaſantly on
this Rocke, with the ſweet-pleaſing company of <hi>Coralbo;</hi> which
expired, ſhee (commending him to the gods) departed with her
husband.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time arrived they at <hi>Caleri</hi> met by <hi>Polimero,</hi> and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
by <hi>Eromena,</hi> conformable to the dignitie of their eſtates and
communitie of their affections; whence they could not part for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes after the marriage, although the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> had
by often meſſages ſolicited their returne; till at length <hi>Polimero</hi> alſo,
(deſirous to pay the tribute of the dutie that he owed his father) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten leave of his father-in-law to take along with him <hi>Erome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
they (accompanied with <hi>Eleina</hi>) went on their intended voyage
for <hi>Mauritania,</hi> where being arrived, they were received with ſuch
pompe and joy, as greater can not be deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The old King ſeeing his ſonnes thus well match'd, and <hi>Polimero</hi>
ſo well provided for and ſetled, joyed for the hope he had to ſee iſſue
from them a faire poſteritie, which hee was ſo fortunate, as to ſee
ſpring from both of them: for <hi>Eromilia</hi> about foure moneths then
after was brought to bed of a boy. Whileſt <hi>Eromena</hi> knowing her
ſelfe to bee with child, thought to returne home, being ſent for by
her father; but the intreaties of her parents and brothers-in-law
were ſo importunate as it was not poſſible for her to returne, and the
Embaſſadors ſent thence to <hi>Sardegna</hi> got (with much difficultie)
leave for her to ſtay there ſomewhat longer; her time being come,
ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, whoſe features were both ſo
faire and manly, that the ſight of her bred no leſſe delight than
wonder <hi>in the hearts of all that ſaw her.</hi> And too withall nature it
ſelfe (which in ingendring amazement proceeds with unaccuſtomed
meanes) now in her operations exceeded her ordinarie bounds;
for two or three nights before her birth were heard all over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
and through the ſtreets of the citie a pleaſing murmur, as that
of voices and inſtruments, that carried to the eare an unuſuall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of harmonie; beguiling many, (who went through the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
to ſeeke for it) with others who went out of their houſes,
thinking to finde it abroad.</p>
               <p>The day ſhee was borne on, there was no man that minded his
owne buſineſſe, but every man (drawne by an unknowne affect)
forſooke his ſhop, whileſt the ſacred temples ſhone with ſacrifices
and devout worſhipping. Never was there ſeene over all <hi>Afrique</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7477:105"/>
a more temperate day, or a more ſweetly-warming Sunne than
was then; Orenge, Lemon, and Cedar-trees that never budded
before, now bloſſomed abundantly, yeelding at that birth their fruit
in all maturitie and perfection. The gentle Dolphins ranne ſporting
themſelves nimbly in the ſea, chaſing to the land whole armies of
fiſh, which the inhabitants tooke with no leſſe joy than amazement:
an old well or deepe wintch (that at firſt was ſunke in the caſtle of
<hi>Birſa</hi> for the commoditie of the Garriſon, and was (for being found
afterwards with ſalt water in it) dedicated to <hi>Neptune</hi>) boild all the
night long, becomming in the following morning ſo ſweete, as it
excelled in goodneſſe the beſt waters in that Countrey.</p>
               <p>Full glad was <hi>Eromena</hi> to heare of ſuch things, acknowledging
her thankes to heaven for doing them in the favour of her girle.
Congratulations ſhe received not as a woman in child-bed, but as a
Captaine vanquiſſant of a battel. Many times and often kiſſed ſhee
her ſweet babe, who without either crying or weeping, beheld ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
the faire light of the world; by no meanes poſſible would the
ſweet little one endure the ſwathing bands, but would with a lovely
fierceneſſe puſh them off her. No other dugs would ſhee touch, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe of her mothers; wherein though they thought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
her (by <hi>Eromena's</hi> holding her in her armes, and others rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
her a dug,) yet ſhe informed by the inſtinct of nature would
ſhut up cloſe her pretty mouth, chuſing rather to die for hunger than
to be nurſt with other milke than her mothers. She would (by all
meanes) bee obeyed in all things, and faine were they (whether
they would or not) to let her have her will, to the paſſing content
of her grand-parents, leaving at her parting ſo great a longing after
her, as the expectations from her exceeded that of all the girles that
ever were borne in <hi>Africke.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Polimero</hi> with his <hi>Eromena</hi> departed thence, leaving every one ſad
