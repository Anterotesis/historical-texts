            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God is my strengthe and in him woll I truste, my shylde and the horne that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me, myne hyghe holde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, O my sauyoure saue me from wronge, I wyll prayse &amp; call on the Lorde, and so shall I be saued from my enemyes, for the waues of death haue closed me about, and the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Beliall haue feared me, the cordes of hell haue compased me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the snares of deathe haue ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. In my tribulacion I called to the lord, &amp; cryed to my god,
<pb facs="tcp:20258:150"/>
and he herde my voyce out of hys temple, and my crye entred in to his eares. The earth trembled &amp; quoke, and the fundations of heauen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; shoke because he was angrye. Smoke we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of his nosethrylles &amp; consumyng fyre out of his mouth that coales were kyndled of it, he bowed the heauen and came downe, &amp; darknes was vnderneth hys fete. And he rode vpon Cherub &amp; flewe, and appeared vpon the winges of the wynde, and he made darkenesse a tabernacle round about him with water gathered together in thycke cloudes. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bryghtnes that was before him, coles were set on fyre. The Lorde thundred from heauen, &amp; the most hyghe put out his voyce, &amp; he shot arowes &amp; scattered them, &amp; hurled lyghtenynge and turmoyled them. The botom of the See appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:20258:150"/>
&amp; the foundations of the worlde were sene, by reason of the rebuking of the lorde, and thorough blastinge of the breth of his nosethrylles, he sent frome aboue and fet me &amp; pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me oute of myghtye waters. He delyuered me from my myghty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye and from them that hated me &amp; were to stronge for me. When they had compased me in the daye of my tribulation, the lorde stayed me vp and brought me out into roumth, &amp; delyuered me bycause he delyted in me. The lorde rewarded me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to my ryghteousnes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purenesse of my han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des he dealt with me. For I kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wayes of the lorde, and dyd no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes nor forsoke my God, But I had all his lawes in my syght, and turned my face from none of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces. I was pure vnto him
<pb facs="tcp:20258:151"/>
warde, and kepte my selfe from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde dyd to me againe accordynge to my ryghtuousnesse, &amp; after my purenesse that I had in his syght. With y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy thou shalte be ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and with the man that is vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte, thou shalt be vncorrupt, with the pure, thou shalt be pure, &amp; with the froward thou shalt be froward also. Certaynely the people that are in aduersitie thou shalt help, and on the proud shalt thou cast thyn eyes. Thou art my lyght O lord, and the lorde shall lyghten my darkenesse. Loo with thyn helpe I wil run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough an host of men, &amp; by the ayde of my god I wil spryng ouer a wal. The waye of god is vndefyled, and the word of the lord fyned as golde, and he is a shylde to al that trust in him. Who is a god saue the lorde, &amp; who myghty saue our god? God is
<pb facs="tcp:20258:151"/>
my strength in warre, and ryddeth the waye before me. He maketh my fete as swyft as an hyndes, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my fete fast vpon my holde. He teacheth my handes to fyght, that a bowe of brasse is to weake for myne arme. And thou hast saued me with thy shylde, and kepest me for euer in mekenes. Thou madest me rowme to walke in, that my fete shulde not stumble, I followed myne enemyes and destroyed them, and turned not agayne vntyll I had consumed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wasted them and so clouted them that they coulde in no wyse aryse, but fell vnderneth my fete. Thou compasedest me aboute with myght to batell, and madest them that rose agaynst me to stoupe vnder me. Thou madeste myne ennemyes to tourne their backes to me, and them
<pb facs="tcp:20258:152"/>
that hated me, &amp; I destroyed them. They loked for helpe, but none cam to saue them, vnto the lord they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he herde them not. The lorde mought lyue, and blessed be he my stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; exalted be god the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that saueth me. It is god that auen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth me, and that bringeth downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people vnder me, and delyuereth me from my enemyes. Thou lyftest me vp on hyghe from them that ryse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste me and delyuerest me from the wicked men. Therfore I will prayse the O lorde amonge the hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and will singe vnto thy name.</p>

Thou seist (O good shepeherd) what sundry sortes of wolues haue broken into thy shepecotes, of whom euery one cryeth, here is Christ, here is Christ, so that if it were possible the very perfecte persons shulde be brought into errour. Thou seest w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what wyndes, with what waues, with what stormes thy sely shippe is tossed, thy shippe wherin thy lytle

Of this tempest and storme we may thanke our own wyckednes and synfull ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, we espye it wel and confesse it. We espye thy rightuousnes and we bewayle our vnrightuousnes, but we appele to thy mercy which (accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the psalme of thy prophete) surmounteth all thy workes.

               <p>This spirite, if thou wol vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saue to renewe in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hartes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal also these forein miseryes cease

or if they cease not, at lest they shal turne to the profite &amp; auaile of them which loue the.
