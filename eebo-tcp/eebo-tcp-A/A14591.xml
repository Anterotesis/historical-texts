            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doe from age to age ſtill bring forth infirmities, not ſeene

            <p>Beſides the peculiar graces beſtowed on ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<pb facs="tcp:1957:4"/>

            <p>To what purpoſe (will it happilie be asked) is this far

no man meanes to make queſtion of, but onely to this

            <p>The famous Countie Palatine of Cheſhire can boaſt
of many excellencies, wherein a countrie either for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
or pleaſure may be tearmed happie. Among other
the ornaments thereof, I cannot but greatly commend a
moſt ſtately, large, and as I may ſo tearme it, a princely
Forreſt (though there be others alſo within the ſhire) ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
euen in the chiefeſt and beſt knowne parts of the
Countie, called the Forreſt of Delamere, belonging to
her Maieſtie. The ſame bordering towards the Weſt and
<pb facs="tcp:1957:5"/>
Northweſt ſide, neere to Merzey, an arme of the Ocean,
in many old records of this countie, is called the Forreſt
of <hi>Mare mondiam,</hi> but is beſt knowne, and hath been
very auncientlie called by the name formerlie men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Giue me leaue a little to deſcribe vnto you the ſame
Forreſt, becauſe in it is the Well whereof I intreate.
There are about the middeſt of the Forreſt certaine rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
walles of ſtone, ſome incloſures, and the prints of
an auncient ſituation, which as well common report of
the countrie, as alſo the teſtimonies of the beſt writers of
Englands antiquities doe affirme to haue been a Citie
(and it ſhould ſeeme indeede to haue been a walled
Towne) there founded and built by <hi>Eadelfleda</hi> a Queene
of Merceland: and the place to this day is called Eadeſ
burie, whereof the whole hundred (being a ſeuenth part
of the ſhire) reteyneth ſtill the name.</p>
            <p>The Borrough or Towne being now vtterly decaied
and gone; there remaineth onely vpon the top of the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
height within that ſituation, a proper built lodge,
called the Chamber, and hath been for the moſt part
maintained and inhabited by a famous race of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(the <hi>Dones)</hi> of whome for certaine hundreds of
yeares, Knights and Squires of that ſurname (hauing
ſtill by inheritance been maſters of the game or chiefe
Forreſters there) haue left good remembrances of their
worthes and great reputation to all poſteritie: and is
now poſſeſſed by a worſhipfull Gentleman, <hi>Iohn Done</hi>
Eſquire: whom the rather I am bolde here by name to
mention, becauſe of his charitable diſpoſition and
gentlemanlike furtherance of the benefit of this Well, to
the reliefe of all ſorts of people that ſeeke for helpe by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1957:5"/>
About a mile and halfe from the chamber toward the
Southweſt ſide of the forreſt is ſituate the <hi>Newfound VVel.</hi>
All the Weſterly and Southerly ſide of the forreſt is
mountanous, and full of vaſte vneuen hilles, ſcattringly
beautified with many Okes (yet moſt of them ſhrubby
and of low growth) and not fewe queaches &amp; thicks of
Hull and Hauthornes, the hils themſelues for the moſt
part diſtinguiſhed by galles and gutters made by waters
falling from ſprings and other places, which in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of time haue worne and eaten deepe paſſages.</p>
            <p>In the ſide of one of theſe hilles, whoſe declining ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
almoſt full vpon the North and North-eaſt, ariſeth
the ſpring, head, and fountaine it ſelfe now called the
<hi>New found Well:</hi> the ſame inſenſibly iſſuing from firme
ground at the roote or foote of a ſhrubbie hull or hollin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
yet ſo as the ſame hull ſtanding at the South-weſt
corner of the Well there is ſome twentie inches diſtance
betweene them.</p>
            <p>The Well or Ceſterne being bordered with three or
foure flagge ſtones (as the compaſſe of it without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any earth about it would giue leaue) is almoſt foure
ſquare, conteyning South and North about 30. inches,
Weſt and Eaſt about 26. inches.</p>
            <p>Whether the Spring iſſue vpright from the bottome,
or from the one ſide, or from all ſides, it is not perceiued.
I rather iudge it comes at the South ſide (which is the
backe of it, and beares againſt the deſcent of the hill.) If
it ſhould bubble forth at the bottome (as in many other
Welles I haue ſeene) this water being ſo cleare it might
be eaſily perceiued, eſpecially the Spring being free, and
yeelding continuall iſſue in a good proportion.</p>
            <p>I haue ſeene indeed many orderly Springes farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb facs="tcp:1957:6"/>
it in ſtrength and bigneſſe of guſh, yet haue I not
known any to keepe a more certain and vniforme courſe,
nor deliuer his water in ſo cloſe and vnperceiueable
manner, as this Well doth.</p>
            <p>The force or ſtreame which the Spring is well able to
maintaine, is about ſo much water as you may imagine
would continually runne at ful through a pipe or tronke,
whoſe concaue or hollow were three or foure inches
compaſſe.</p>
            <p>The deſcent of the hill beneath the Well Northward is
ſteepe, and the waſte water falling North from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
hath both of it owne courſe, and ſhortly meeting
with ſome other rilles, worne the ground to a great hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
dingle, which carrieth them downe to a brooke at
the foote of the hill, by which they are conueyed to a
great poole of Sir <hi>Iohn Egertons</hi> neere little Budworth,
which ſerueth Olton Milles: ſo that, albeit the Spring
ſendeth his water at the firſt Northerly, yet within leſſe
then one quarter of a miles labour it windeth about the
hill skirte, and then holdeth his courſe full Southerly.</p>
            <p>What the vaines of the Earth about it may be, or from
what manner of mixture the Spring ſhould iſſue, I dare
not take vpon me to ſet downe, hauing neither skill to
iudge of ſuch matters, nor hauing had meanes as yet to
procure ſearch made to finde the nature of the mould
whence it ſpringes, which I know would be greatly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
to ſuch as haue skill and knowledge how to iudge
of the power and efficacie of the water thereby. All that
I can ſay in this reſpect, is that the vpper part or face of the
earth there ſeemes to be a ſtiffe clay, inſomuch that the
reſorters thither hauing made ſome one or two ſlender
weake dammes to ſtay the water, halfe a dozen yards or
<pb facs="tcp:1957:6"/>
more beneath the fountaine, there are by that meanes
two ſmall lakes or pooles, wherein poore people, when
they are diſpoſed, do bathe and waſh themſelues. Which
pooles though they be verie vnfit for that purpoſe, being
verie vnhandſomely, thicke &amp; muddy with the clay and
ſoyle of the earth, yet they ſhew the fitneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
means how ceſternes or ſome handſome proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
might be made, either open or cloſe, for the people
of all ſortes to vſe their beſt benefit, and that ſo farre
from the head of the Spring, and ſo much beneath the
bodie and ſeate of the fountaine it ſelfe, that there were
no perill by breaking or digging the ground, to worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
annoiance or hinderance to the vertue of the Spring
or water thereof.</p>
            <p>There be many that at their firſt taſte of the water, doe
confidently affirme they feele as it were ſome reliſh or
ſmacke of an allome-like compoſition; and not a fewe I
haue heard cenſure, that there ſeemes to them a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of the taſt of Licoris; ſome compare it to ſome
other things: for my part (becauſe I am purpoſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre
nothing herein, but what I am verilie perſwaded to
be true) as I can allow of no mans taſte to be authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
in this point, vnleſſe I could alſo find it in mine own,
ſo truly I muſt confeſſe that it is a water different from
manie other Spring waters in taſte, and the moſt pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
in drinking of anie that I haue euer taſted, onely the
reliſh is to me of no eſpeciall thing that I can name, and
the operation ſuch as in my iudgement, and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon mine owne and manie others bodies, it neuer
offendeth with cold or heauy weight in a mans ſtomack,
as the moſt ſorts of waters vſually doe.</p>
            <p>It is one thing moſt notorious and worthie to be ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:1957:7"/>
that no perſons of anie ſort whatſoeuer, which take it in
anie good quantitie, but can and do report that they find
difference in the operation of it from other waters, and
moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it is obſerued that to ſuch as are vnhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and grieued with ſome infirmitie, they are ſure by
the water to finde in themſelues ſome alteration: to ſuch
as are healthfull and verie ſound of bodie, it either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no motion at all, or if anie, it looſeth the bellie, and
giueth moſt gentle and hurtleſſe purgations.</p>
            <p>That there may be ſome alluminous mixture within
the ground, by which the Spring hath his paſſage, one
reaſon may be that quick piercing nature which is found
in it, both in the inward receipt of it, and the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to greene wounds and cuts, vpon which with
wonderfull ſpeed it worketh effectually. And beſides,
though I neuer made triall my ſelfe, the generall report is
that by reaſon of a ſecret ſharpe tartneſſe that is in it, the
water will turne or breake milke, whereinto it is put im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>An other reaſon of the ſame efficacy may be this, which
I can well teſtifie vpon mine owne knowledge, that it
skowreth and cleanſeth anie thing which is waſhed in it,
more then anie water that I haue knowne, inſomuch that
it is of exceeding vſe for the keeping white and faire the
face and handes, better and more pleaſing to many then
the vſe of ſopes, waſhing balles or ſuch other mixtures,
neither ſo wholſome nor ſo pleaſant as this naturall pure
ſpring water.</p>
            <p>This may be ſufficient for the ſituation and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Well, will you now heare the manner of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it.</p>
            <p>In the ende of the laſt winter quarter, and beginning
<pb facs="tcp:1957:7"/>
of this ſpring time nowe paſt, here in theſe partes (as
I thinke elſewhere) there raigned an extreame contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſickneſſe, not infectious, yet ſo generall, as few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
without ſome or other touch of vnhealthfulneſſe.
Among other ſorts of infirmities, many were tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with hot burning Agues and Feuers of all kindes,
which Agues the vulgar people here (eſpecially when
they light on children or young folkes, or that they hold
them but intermiſſiuely, ſo that the patient lies not by it)
call it the Fittes.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Iohn Greeneway</hi> of Vtkinton an honeſt ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
countriman of good credit and well reputed, being
about fiftie yeeres of age or ſomewhat more, was about
the end of March laſt paſt troubled with the Fittes; he
tried ſuch ordinarie remedies as the countrie experience
would offer, but found no abatement of his diſeaſe, at
length he cals to mind an experiment, that ſixteene or
ſeuenteene yeeres now paſt in the like neceſſitie had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued
him: and this it was.</p>
            <p>Being at that time vexed with the Fits, and finding no
eaſe nor remedie for it, he thought good to repaire to a
learned Phiſition at that time lying at the Citie of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
which is about ſixe or ſeuen miles diſtant from
<hi>Greenwaies</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>The Phiſition tooke good regard of the mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and being a man both learned and conſcionable
preſcribed to him, that he ſhould get him home, keepe
him warme, vſe good diet, and not to omit to walke forth
in the mornings, to finde out ſome good pure ſpring
water, to drinke of it, to bathe and waſh himſelfe with
it, and herein he doubted not he ſhould recouer his
health ſhortly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1957:8"/>
I haue hereat not a little beene troubled in mine owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
to reſolue in any probable appearance, what to
deliuer touching the Phiſitions direction, as whether he
might ſpeake this of an excellencie of knowledge, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
before that time either read in ſome vnknowne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall,
or had vnderſtanding of peculiar vertue to be in
that or ſome other water thereabout, or that he ſpake in
generalitie, meaning that anie pure Spring water were
good for that mans infirmitie; or whether the great gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s inuention for general benefits did not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vſe the Phiſitions preſcription, as a meanes of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
benefit he meant to beſtow vpon poore deſtreſſed
creatures: which laſt ſurmize, I verily hold moſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to my owne ſatisfaction, yet ſo, as I leaue it with
the reſt to each mans particular choice and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer it were, <hi>Greeneway</hi> being well acquainted
with the Springs &amp; al other commodities of the Forreſt,
had ſoone found out this prettie purling fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, both
for puritie and ſituation (as he thought) fitteſt to anſwere
the Phiſitions direction, and there by drinking, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and accompliſhing what he was commaunded,
in verie ſhorte time hee was of his Ague throughly
cured.</p>
            <p>Since that time till this preſent yeere he hath liued
healthfull and ſound, but being againe ſurprized with
the ſame griefe, neceſſitie then enforcing the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his former helpe, he repaired to his auncient
medicine againe, where a ſhort triall had ſoone taught
him, that this was a remedie of greater regard then he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made of it: And thereupon tooke better notice &amp;
aduiſement of it then before he had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1957:8"/>
It happened within the ſpace of one moneth after this,
that one of his ſonnes, and afterwards a ſecond, and then
a third were ſucceſſiuely taken with the Fittes, and each
of them ſeuerally eaſed and holpen by the vſe of this
Well, according to their fathers direction, as he himſelfe
had done before them.</p>
            <p>The neighbours neere vnto him hearing and finding
the truth of this ſucceſſe, began to reſort to the Well, as
either the ſame ſicknes or anie other griefe gaue them
cauſe, and when the experience of many confirmed the
vertue thereof to extend to giue helpe and eaſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Agues and other inward diſeaſes, but alſo to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decinable
to al manner of outward grieuances and ſores,
it drew people in verie great numbers to repaire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the more trials were put in execution, the more
credit and account it hath euer ſince gotten.</p>
            <p>If I thought it not a thing both ridiculous and in
ſome ſort infamous, to ſpread in peoples eares vaine tales
and incertainties, I would then haue ſtuffed this diſcourſe
with ſuch ſurmiſes, as perhaps would go more currant
and plauſible to many, then a bare recitall of the truth
touching the finding of the <hi>New found Well.</hi> And vpon
this conceit I haue thought fit to omit the laying forth of
ſundrie opinions, as they nowe are deliuered among
common perſons, and ſome others of good note touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame.</p>
            <p>I ſpare to diſcourſe vnto you what couiectures are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt abroad, that the ſame Well ſhould haue beene of
knowne, and notable vertue in the daies of the afore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Queene <hi>Eadilflede,</hi> and vſed by her meanes and
maintenance to the generall reliefe of people in thoſe
daies, but afterwards in the outrages and oppreſſions
<pb facs="tcp:1957:9"/>
which the conquering Danes made in the Countrey,
it was cloſed and ſtopped vp to preuent the benefite
which that common rigorous enemie might haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by it: but becauſe I finde no ſuch thing recorded in
any remembrance that I reade or heare of, I leaue the
credit thereof to ſuch proofe as they can make, who
would perſwade the world that it is ſo.</p>
            <p>I haue heard likewiſe ſome perſons of no meane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
report, that there are within this Countie ſome
credible recordes which might be produced, wherein
mention is made of an auncient Well, within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
of Delamere, that many yeares paſt was eſteemed
of great vertue and efficacie, inſomuch as the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dedicated by the firſt chriſtians which had vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to holy Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> the ſame ſtill beareth name (in
the ſaid records) of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Well, and by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
therein gathered, it is ſaid that this late found
Well may be likely to be the ſame: whereof hauing no
farther proofe, then as yet I can attaine vnto, I leaue it as
doubtfull as the former.</p>
            <p>But I will proceede with the further explication of
the late effects of this Water, which ſince the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
and concourſe which people of all ſorts haue made
vnto it, is found to bee profitable, not onely againſt
Agues, which was the firſt virtue reuealed in it, but alſo
againſt all manner of coldes, ſtoppings, grypings, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
collicks, aches, ruptures and inward infirmities, and
no leſſe ſoueraigne againſt ſores and outward anguiſhes,
wounds, ſwellings, vlcers, feſters, impoſtumes and hurts
of the ſeuerall ioynts and members; beſides that, it hath
done no ſmall number of ſtraunge cures, againſt ſorenes
of eyes and eares, blindneſſe, deafeneſſe, lameneſſe, ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:1957:9"/>
of ſinnewes, numbneſſe, weakeneſſe and feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
all which I am able to auerre and proue, by vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
demonſtration from the ſeuerall effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
numbers of people, that haue giuen witneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in theſe three or foure moneths now laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>I call them infinite numbers, becauſe indeede the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
thither immediatlie after the firſt rumour of the
Well, grew vncountable, and the people as well of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
as all the bordering ſhires thereabouts, trauelling
thither daily in greater and greater multitudes (euen till
they amounted by eſtimation to more than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
in a daie) Maſter <hi>Done</hi> euen then at the firſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were great diſturbance to her Highneſſe
Deere in the Forreſt, &amp; occaſion of much other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
to the countrie, yet in regard of the notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that ſicke and diſeaſed, and pleaſure that healthfull
and ſound perſons receiued by it; hath been contented
to allow free acceſſe, and permitted all manner of meete
prouiſion to be brought vnto it, with moſt carefull and
Worſhipfull foreſight and heede, as well that no money
nor ſee ſhould be exacted for the vſe of the water which
God had freelie beſtowed on poore and rich, as alſo that
there ſhould be order and gouernment warilie taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all ſuch as reſorted thither, ſo that no manner of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor,
or diſorder ſhould growe in that place,
whereunto ſuch great aſſemblies are apt and prone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
if good heede and preuention be not vſed.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe it happened well that the Well it
ſelfe falleth within the limits of a walke in the Forreſt,
which hath long time been kept and watched by one
<hi>Iohn Frodſham</hi> the keeper of that walke, who as he was a
very fit and meete perſon, both for his good diſcretion
<pb facs="tcp:1957:10"/>
and eſtimation to take the gouernment and ordering of
people of the inferiour ſort, and for the entertainment
of the better ſort as they reſorted thither, ſo hath he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
great paines and care in diſcharging the truſt in him
repoſed, for ſatisfaction of all manner of reſorters thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and daily endeuoureth himſelfe by all waies and
meanes poſſible, that his Maſters good and forward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to doe all both poore and rich equall furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in their deſires, may honeſtly and reſpectiuely be
accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Now by that which hath been before ſet downe, it
appeareth what diuerſitie of cure this Well water hath
made vpon ſundrie perſons, as ſhall be more largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to ſuch as make doubt of the trueth of theſe reports.
For as it conſequently followeth that (theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
graunted) then is this Water found beneficiall and
medicinable againſt more ſeuerall ſorts of diſeaſes and
infirmities, then any one remedie that hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
knowne heard of, or experimented (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
is indeede wonderfull, and ſcarcely to be beleeued
to ſuch as haue not been eye-witneſſes thereof) ſo were
it a great boldneſſe and an enterpriſe of a very brainſicke
diſpoſition in me, that ſhould affirme the ſame, vnleſſe I
were warranted by the experience of ſo many, ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
ſo wiſe, ſo graue, ſo ſufficient perſons, both in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
Lancaſhire, Darbiſhire, Staffordſhire, Shropſhire,
Flintſhire, Denbighſhire and others, from whence men,
women and children hauing reſorted hither in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
there is not any but haue giuen ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
that they found ſome extraordinarie pleaſure by
drinking, or other vſe of the water (eſpecially thoſe who
vpon any cauſe of griefe haue receiued it) as more at
<pb facs="tcp:1957:10"/>
large I might very well make manifeſt, if I thought it
conuenient or much neceſſarie for me to publiſh that
approbation and teſtimonie vnder their ſeuerall names,
which many of the beſt ranke of the inhabitants of theſe
adioyning countries, haue and doe freely and trulie giue
of it.</p>
            <p>And leaſt it ſhould be expected that I ſhould inſiſt
vpon ſome particular inſtances, or otherwiſe ſuſpected
I dealt not plainelie, but ſought to beguile perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and farre dwellers, with words whereof I had no
proofe, I thinke it not impertinent to ſet downe the
particulars of ſome of the cures made vpon diuers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
in diuers perſons, of diuers habitations: which
though they be skant an hundreth part of thoſe which
might be regiſtred to haue receiued benefit by the Well,
yet it ſhall be ſufficient to any reaſonable minde, to take
viewe and note by theſe of what power and force the
water is found to be: wherein I cannot in any ſort be
conuinced of lying or miſreporting, becauſe they are
teſtimonies taken from the confeſſion of all the parties
themſelues, and witneſſed by the beholders, being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſcores, yea hundreds of people of all theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
who haue ſeene the proceedings as here is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the curing of Agues there is none within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reaſonable diſtance from the place, but know what
numbers haue been, and are dailie cured of that infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
eſpeciallie of ſuch as dwell neere the Well, or haue
ſtaied a competent ſpace to take benefite by the water in
the beſt kinde: which is to receiue it freſh from the
Fountaine it ſelfe: let it ſuffice to name theſe fewe for

            <p>The ſame crouch with diuers others being there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
reſerued as oft as anie haue cauſe to leaue them.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Peter Nightgale</hi> was by this water likewiſe cured
of a Rupture in his bodie.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Ioane Bromhall</hi> of the Middlewich lame of one
arme and one hand, as is known and affirmed by men of
good worſhip, by this water hath gotten helpe, and
hath perfect vſe of her arme and hand againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Olton</hi> of Wettenhall the younger, an honeſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
man, hauing a Rupture many yeeres, and not able
to go without the helpe of a ſteele girdle which he wore
continually, hath heereby gotten remedie, and goeth
now luſtily without his girdle.</p>
            <p>I may not omit among theſe ſome that haue beene ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the gout and ſuch like aches: As one <hi>George Iohnſon</hi>
of Northwich, long time diſeaſed in that ſort, ſo that he
was not able to goe, is by this water holpen and well
amended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtopher Bennet</hi> of Wiruin much eaſed and holpen of
<pb facs="tcp:1957:13"/>
a gout, and ſoreneſſe beſides, called a Wildfire in one of
his legges.</p>
            <p>One Maſter <hi>Iames Hocknell</hi> ſonne to <hi>Iohn Hocknell</hi>
Eſquire, being not able to goe, but was brought to the
Well on horſebacke three or foure times, and became
perfectly amended.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Elizabeth Bradſhaw</hi> of Northwich had ſore legs
twentie two yeeres, and hath here by this water gotten
helpe.</p>
            <p>The ſtraungeſt cure to my iudgement that proceedes
from this water, among all the reſt, is the helpe that it
giues to ſome of the hardneſſe of hearing, wherof there
are no few teſtimonies giuen by many, one that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to be benefited therein is <hi>Randal Wield</hi> a young youth
of Vtkinton.</p>
            <p>This I know vpon my owne knowledge that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
here in the countrey, one Maſter <hi>D. C.</hi> being ſo
deafe that he cannot heare the report of a gunne diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
verie neere him, hauing of this water infuſed into
his eares, it preſently drew forth much corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expectation, what further benefit will inſue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the amendement of this deafnes reſtes in Gods
hands, but there is good hope.</p>
            <p>I haue purpoſely ſpared to remember a Worſhipfull
Knight of Lancaſhire, who hath oft viſited to his owne
great eaſe and comfort this Well, and as well himſelfe as
other Gentlemen of good account, and ſome learned of
his companie haue giuen very great approbation to the
truth of the Welles efficacy.</p>
            <p>One notable vertue it hath not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is
ſoueraignty in curing and helping the Stone, which was
notorious in that one cure it did vpon <hi>Iames Okenthorpe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1957:13"/>
of Eaton, who was tormented both with the Stone and
Strangulion, and hereby receiued remedie.</p>
            <p>No man can better confirme the credit of this, that
the water helpeth the Stone and other hurtfull obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then one Maſter <hi>Iohn VVyttur</hi> of Torporleigh a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubſtantiall Freeholder, who of late was of the ſtone
together with a colde and certaine gryping torments in
his bodie brought euen to deaths doore, and through
helpe (as he thinketh next vnder God, of this water) is
verie well reſtored to his former health.</p>
            <p>I heard an other very ſenſible wiſe Gentleman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and openly auerre, that hee verily beleeued, if he
had not had eaſe by the water of this Well, the diſeaſe of
the Stone had ſurely killed him, the Gentleman is
toward Sir <hi>H. Harrington,</hi> and will confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch
it.</p>
            <p>It hath had no fewe reports of doing good to ſome
ſuch as haue beene there to ſeeke for remedie againſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſickneſſe, Apoplexies, Epilepſies, Letargies, Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and other ſtraunge Symptomes: but eyther I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
theſe proofes are ſufficient, or infinite cannot
ſerue.</p>
            <p>I hold it therefore a needleſſe and vnprofitable labour
to trauell further in theſe recitals of cures: Neither doe
I labour hereby to ſpread an opinion beyond trueth of
the vertue of this Well, which to do were no way to
me worth my labour.</p>
            <p>That I ſhould endeuour to deceiue and beguile
mens eares with a ſtraunge report, would more diſpleaſe
me to thinke my ſelfe ſo gulde in mine owne folly, then
pleaſure me to thinke there were a pleaſure in illuſions,
to labour to draw men the faſter to frequent the place
<pb facs="tcp:1957:14"/>
and come to ſee the Well, I proteſt before God I know
not how that may any way benefit me one farthing.
Only my deſire is to ſatisfy my friends and others of
the truth of that, whereof now there grow many doubts
and diſputations among men.</p>
            <p>They which dwell farre remote reſt doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the large and ample fame thereof ſpread, deſerue
credit or not. Some that dwell neere the place argue and
debate whether or how it is poſſible ſuch ſtraunge and
admirable effects ſhould be produced from a cauſe ſo
ſimple, poore, eaſie and common as the water of a little
Spring.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt ſort thoſe that be generous, gentle and well
diſpoſed, I ſuppoſe theſe confirmations will worke very
farre for their ſatisfaction: becauſe I know not how any
thing may be proued, if it be not a good proofe which is
drawne from the approbation of worſhipfull, wiſe,
learned, rich, poore and altogether, and that not of one,
but of many Shires: and I will neuer beleeue prouerbe
more whileſt I liue, if the prouerbe be not in this cauſe
ſomewhat auaileable which ſaith, <hi>It muſt needs be true
which euery man ſaith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thoſe that doubt of each thing they ſee, becauſe
they preſently apprehend not the reaſon of it, I holde
them not worthie of ſatisfaction, becauſe their peruerſe
opinions are incapable of inſtructions of the true accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of any benefits eyther diuine or naturall. Theſe
are like to the neighbours of ſome excellent and skilfull
Phiſition, who in enuie and hatred do vſually diſable his
skill, and cannot endure to ſee other men flocke to him
for helpe and remedies: yet if griefe, paine, or ſicknes
ſeaſe vpon themſelues, they then are glad to ſue for his
<pb facs="tcp:1957:14"/>
helpe, then for neceſſitie ſake they honour the Phiſition:
not the wiſe man which gaue this precept, but neceſſitie
it ſelfe teacheth them to do him his due reuerence.</p>
            <p>Endleſſe were the labour a man might haue that
would go about to anſwere the obiections which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie
of ſome braines will ſtill brue, and fling in his face
that ſhall commend any truth whatſoeuer, neither will
I enlarge this diſcourſe with ſo tedious a purpoſe as to
conuince that by way of argument, which no equall
mind will much doubt of.</p>
            <p>The Scepticke inquirers which profeſſe doubtfulnes in
all things though neuer ſo manifeſt, and aske why fire is
fire, or why heat is heat, why white is not called blacke,
and why blacke is not called blew: what anſwere deſerue
their friuolous demaunds, but ſilence the reward of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
queſtions?</p>
            <p>They that aske why the water of that Well ſhould be
ſo holſome aboue an other water, eyther on this ſide or
beyond the ſame place, eyther on one this ſide the hill,
or one the tother, are they not like to thoſe which conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Prophets preſcription touching <hi>Naaman,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
if <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> riuers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> were
not as fine waters as that of <hi>Iordan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why was not this precious water (ſay ſome) found out
before this time? or how comes it to paſſe, that in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo bare, void of mixture, and ſo meerely nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
differing from other water, there ſhould be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo diuers, as to be medicinable againſt ſuch diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of diſeaſes, wherof no doubt the cauſes proceed ſome
contrary one to another? Queſtions ſottiſh &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.
Haue not all notable benefits had their ſeuerall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings?
and cannot men tell you of the inuention and
<pb facs="tcp:1957:15"/>
firſt finding of tenne thouſand publike admirations,
whereof ſome haue lien hid and vnreuealed euen till
our daies? and is it any new thing that waters ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſo ſtrange, and ſo diuers operations?</p>
            <p>What meane Scholler hath not read of the Well in
Gnarsborrough forreſt, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerteth leaues, fleſh and
ſuch like into hard ſtone? of the Well in Gloceſterſhire,
which turneth oke rootes as they grow into hard ſtone,
of an other neere Stonie Stratford, conuerting ſtickes
and the like, into the like hardnes of ſtone?</p>
            <p>Are not theſe ſtraunge operations? and can a man
prefently giue a reaſon hereof. Knowes any man the
reaſon why that lake in Snowdon which carrieth the
mooueable Iland, ſhould bring forth Eeles, Perches and
Trouts with onely one eye a peece in their heads, which
no other water beſide doth? or why that Well in Wales,
ſix mile from the ſea, or another in Darbiſhire 40. miles
diſtant from the ſea, ſhould riſe and fall iuſt with the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and flowing of the ſea?</p>
            <p>We are to wonder at, not examine all the ſecret wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of nature, and giuing praiſe to the great Guider of
nature, and ouer-ruler of naturall cauſes, to receiue the
good benefits we find with thankfull humilitie.</p>
            <p>I could heartily wiſh that ſome learned and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
man of ability and iudgement (rather a skilfull Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
then any) would take paines, iudicially to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and publiſh to the world the vertues and vſe of this
good water, as hath heretofore been done by our beſt
bathes in other parts of the Realme. Perhaps ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> or learned Maſter <hi>Iones</hi> could well
ſatisfie the curioſity of the narroweſt inquirers why this
ſhould be, and that ſhould be; they could iudge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:1957:15"/>
of the water, of the colour, of the vaines of the
earth, of the ſituation of the climate, of all the collaterall
cauſes which make it beneficiall.</p>
            <p>If our Well worke the like or as ſtrange effects as Bath,
Buxtons, Saint Vincents or Hally well, what aduantage
haue they of it, ſauing that good fortune hath found
them out ſuch men (as thoſe before named) to publiſh
their vertues.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which named Welles (I meane the Bath) I
muſt needs with great reuerence giue due admiration
vnto, in reſpect of the great fame and antiquitie, it is
knowne to be of. And becauſe it exceeds all the reſt as
in heat, ſo in the ſenſiblenes or manifeſt apparance of
phiſicall or medicinable curing, I hold it great reaſon
it ſhould retaine the preheminence ouer all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And where our Wel wanting that ſenſible heat may
perhaps in that reſpect be diſallowed the name of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable
water: I anſwer nothing but that which Maſter
<hi>Iones</hi> writeth of Buxtons Well, that being not ſo hot, as
the water of Bathe, it healeth more temperately and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
            <p>Thus farre (Bro. B.) as my haſte and ſlender abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
would permit, I haue laboured to impart vnto you
the newes of the <hi>New found VVell.</hi> If you pleaſe you may
commit it to further view, if it be not well reported, or
the newes not well accepted, or my meaning not well
conſtrued, I can ſay no more but this, I would all were
well.</p>
