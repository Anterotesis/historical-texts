            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There was about the place where he fedde his flocke, a certaine thicket all ouergrowne with brembles and thornes, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about with furzes, vnder the couert whereof grewe a soft fine and delicate kind of grasse, the turfe thick, as in such shadie places is often accustomed, wheron laid this tender infant.

And to the intent it might as well in name as otherwyse, resemble the place of education, where it was bred, they called it by the name of <hi>Daphnis.</hi>

               <p>Two yeares were not fullye past and expired, ere one <hi>Dryas</hi> a sheepeheard keeping his sheepe in great quantitye vppon the plaines and downes thereabouts, happened after this also vppon the like, or verie selfe same aduenture. There was indifferent

almost between either of those places, a certaine great caue, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a rocke, sacred sometimes to the <hi>Nimphes,</hi> and therefore called by the name of the <hi>Nimphes Caue,</hi> somethinge crooked within, but altogether round without. In the inward part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were diuers statues of <hi>Goddesses</hi> &amp; other <hi>Nimphes,</hi> wrought finely out of stone, the feete vnshod, the armes all naked, &amp; th'atire buckled on the shoulders, their haires cast onely vpon their necks, without tressing at all, girded they were vpon their loynes, their lookes sweetly smiling, and their countenaunces such, as seemed with interchaungeable fauour in delicate sorte to greete eache other.</p>
               <p>Right vnder the hollowe rising of this caue, sprang in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the bottom a sweet fountaine, which raising it selfe, with a softe bubling, gathered into a pleasaunt springe, wherewith the fresh and fruitfull greues round about the same, were continually watered. Ouer the mouth of the caue, where the ouerflowinge waues with Cristall humor, had wrought from the earth, sondrie kindes of flowers and hearbs of delicate vewe, hong diuers flutes, Pipes, and Flagiolots, made of reedes, which the auncient shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards had often tofore-time sacred vnto the <hi>Nimphes</hi> for their greatest offrings.</p>
               <p>To this caue, a sheepe from out of <hi>Dryas</hi> flocke, that newly had yeaned her lamb, oftentimes in the day frequented, and that with such continuaunce, as the shephearde thinking it manie times to bee lost, endeuoured at the last, to make some deuice whereby to constraine it to feede in companie, without wandring any more as it was accustomed. And going to the Caue to seeke the sheep, with an Osier twig wreathed in his hande, wherewith to fasten the necke and foote thereof togethers, a sight more straunge then looked for, presented it selfe vnto him.

(which was sweete and pleasaunt to behold) sucked the same. The Sheepe seeming therevnto to haue borne a most straunge and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affection, which one while with the licking of her tongue on the visage, and another while with softe and deyntie coying it with her head, it exceedingly did manifest.</p>

               <p>Nowe when night came, that he was to driue his sheepe home to their folde, hauing secretly in the meane time conueied all the iewels and ornaments into his bouget, assoone as he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his house, he began to recompt vnto his wife al that he had seene, and shewed her also what hee had founde: <hi>Nape</hi> was the Sheperdesse called, to whose especial care her husband with many words recommended the regard of the distressed infant, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her thence forward to repute it as her own natural daughter, &amp; in such sort only to nourish and prouide for it. The woman was not stony harted, but according to her shepheards guise began to imbrace and entertain the girle, deeming already that she became a mother vnto it, by meere affection, her conceit grew tender ouer it, and with such feruent loue, and continuall watching did she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to foster it, as that she feared lest the sheepe that whilome sucked the swatheled unpe, should in the beastly regard it shewed be preferred before her. And for that her care stretched that the girle in farther springing yeres might the sooner be taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for hers, she gaue it thence-fro a name Pastorall, and called
<pb facs="tcp:12901:6"/>
her Chloe.</p>
               <p>These two children in processe of time grew to be great, and shewed well by theyr beautie and other complements, that their parentage was not meane, nor their descent deriued from out of old thatched cotages. And about the time that the elder of them, was come to the age of fifteene yeares, and the yonger about two yeares lesse: <hi>Lamon</hi> and <hi>Dryas</hi> at one very instant, and in the selfe-same night interchangeably (as it fell out) dreamed in this sort togithers. It seemed vnto them both, that the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> whose statues and images were in the caue (where you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fountaine was, and where <hi>Dryas</hi> (as is reported) had found his daughter) took <hi>Daphnis</hi> &amp; <hi>Chloe,</hi> and them both ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered to the guidance and protection of a verye yoong boy, gentle in all kinde of behauiours, but of beautie most wonderful, frustrate was his body of garments, his shape curious, his skinne pure as alablaster, his shoulders feathred as wings, his left hand supported with a slender bowe, a small quiuer at his backe, and a fine arrowe in his right hand. Who touching them both with one and the fame dart, gaue charge vnto <hi>Daphnis</hi> thence-forward to feed his goats on the pastures, and to the other immediatlie to keepe flockes of sheepe.</p>
               <p>The heardsmen both at once deepely conceiuing of this visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were sodenly quailed of al their former expectation, insomuch as the fruits of their carefull nurseries, seemed thus contrarie to that they hoped, and what their seuerall badges, might before that, respectiuely haue presaged, to be destined at one instant to the keeping of cattell togethers. For that the markes of theyr birth, had offered vnto their former notice, so manifest intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of farre greater fortune, in full pursute whereof, their carefull endeuors had thitherto sought to conduct them, and that in farre more delicate and daintie maner, than beseemed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of heardsmen, as wel in an honored kinde of vsage to theyr persons, as in liberall training them vppe in letters, and other conuenient skill and demeanours, whereof their yeares at that instant were nothyng ignorant, and that so farre foorth as the largesse of their country dwelling, coulde anye waies affoorde vnto them. Neuerthelesse, forsomuch as the iniunction appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:12901:6"/>
to be deriued altogither from the pleasure of the gods, they determined in their obedience, rather to giue place vnto theyr commaundes, whose prouidence had saued them both from their former perilles, than to yeelde vnto their owne proper fancies, whose greatest respect of care they were sure coulde least of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile them.</p>
               <p>Not long after, these two neighbor-dwellers found meanes to conferre at full, touching both their visions, and by one wine consent, they first agreed to go vnto the caue of the nymphs, and there to offer sacrifices, for the better prosperitie and happy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of their seuerall charges, which offering of theirs, they by one vowe togethers, deuoted to the faire yoong boy, vnto whose protection, by the same <hi>Nymphs,</hi> theyr nurceries had bene before committed, whome they called by the name of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged god, for otherwise by anye more speciall title or particular effect they had not discerned hym. Which doone, they iointly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, whatsoeuer after care of the two youthfull and sweetest of all natures creatures, vppon him, both <hi>Lamon</hi> and <hi>Dryas</hi> recorded as a summe of all their expectation, these foure verses to remaine on the wall of the nymphes, as a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall:</p>

There was not farre from the place where these two gentle Shepheards

kept their haunts a she-wolfe that newly hauing cast her whelps, accustomed there-vpon to run often-times into the flockes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and there to raum the small cattell, to carrie to her yong ones: By occasion whereof the husband-men and sheapheards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the villages about, and seeing their cattell thus to bee destroyed, deuised in the night to make sundrie deepe pittes and trenches and them subtilye to couer againe with thin earth cast vppon small twigges whereby to make the place seeme plaine, so that whatsoeuer came running there-vppon, were it of the sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest waight that might bee reasonablie conceiued, the twigges would presentlie fall vnder them, and whelme them there-with into the pitte.

O cruell victorie, O straunge mischiefe whereof I neither know the name

or am able to determine the qualitie. Is it possible, the lippes whereof the pressure is so delicate, and the closure so excellent, may be attainted with poison, or that within the medicinable compasse of so sweete a refreshing may be included a matter so monstrous as may breede infection. No, no, for then with the far piercing venim therof, had my death long ere this time beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. What then may I tearme it whereof insueth so great a languishment? See, see, the Nightingale howe melodiously shee chaunteth, and my Flute hath forgotten hir wonted musike. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the yong kiddes skippe vpon euery hillocke, and I sitte heere laden with teares. The floures are nowe in their chiefest prime, and <hi>Dorcon</hi> alone maketh chapelets and nosegaies: the Uiolet and the Dasey haue couered the pastures with their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> languishing by his maladie withereth onelie in flames. <hi>Dorcon</hi> is in his gaietie, and shortely will become fairer than I. These, and such like shepeheards iamentations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered hee foorth, till wearied with the remembrance and search of that griefe, whereto he knewe neither remedy nor end, hee left the desolate groue, and with a counterfet excuse returned againe to his <hi>Chloe,</hi> who long ere this time had awaited his presence.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Dorcon,</hi> whose riper yeares had inabled his clownish sconce, both with larger skil, and greater experience, triumphing on the harmelesse simplicitie of either of these two louers, listed not to spend much time in the long and needelesse wooing (as he thought) of hir, whome though of her selfe he were repulsed, yet by imparting some part of that whereof hee had sufficient, to the couetousnesse of him that guided hir) he presumed he might when he list purchase at all times of hir supposed father, fixing therfore his eies on his store of cattell and other coine, wherewith his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring yeares were plentifully inough stored, hee onely wanted but time and meete occasion, to further his pretended confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for which hee thence-forth attentiuely waited, Making therfore a sure reckoning of <hi>Dryas,</hi> whom antient neighborhood, and long acquaintance had linked vnto him in some particular knowledge, it fell out, that by a preatie occasion, his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grewe speedilye to bee effected. <hi>Dryas</hi> hadde a peece of ground adioynyng not farre from the dwelling of the cow-heerd,
<pb facs="tcp:12901:12"/>
whereuppon, whilest hee was there busied, in planting an arbor, <hi>Dorcon</hi> made the often sutuiew thereof a meanes of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: and greeting him euery day, and his people with sundry necessaries wherewith to ease their far set prouision, as well of cheeses, bread, and other vittelles, he one day among the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter in purpose &amp; renouation of their antient continuance their yeres both being alike, their keping of cattel togithers, and such like remembrances, wherewith men of common account are wont to commend their acquaintaunce. In continuall harping wherevpon, he lastly fell on termes of <hi>Chloe,</hi> and to discourse of hir marriage.</p>
               <p>Much was it that the cow-herd, after his subtil clownish guise, inforced vnto <hi>Dryas,</hi> wherby the better to make him selfe seeme a man adapted to such a pursute, &amp; the rather to incorage <hi>Dryas</hi> to make him his son in law, besids the much reputation of his welth euermore thrust forward, to giue vnto him also the greater and more euident demonstration, that he should not marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a beggar or a pinch fist, hee tendred vnto him for his good wil, many faire and husband-like presents, rich for the state of a cow-heard as he was, wherof he praid him to make acceptance, &amp; to giue his good will to the mariage. A yoke of fayre large oxen would he giue for the plough, 4 hiues of bees, fiftie foote square of the best part of his orchard, an ox hide large &amp; thicke for lether, &amp; euery yere besides a faire &amp; principal hecfar. That <hi>Dryas</hi> was couetous <hi>Dorcon</hi> had good experience, and therfore intruded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him so manye faire offers: the delicacie and wealth wherof tickled indeede something exceedinglye the minde of the man, and had it not beene, that a certaine doubtfull feare ouer-tooke him, of some vnlooked for after-clappes, hee had peraduenture, by desire of that commoditie consented to the determined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>But considering afterwardes better of the case, and esteeming by the likelihoods of those ornaments which with <hi>Chloe</hi> hee had had receiued, that hir descent was not so meane, as to respecte a place of so base a calling, nor a shape so far more than seemely, resting in hir excellent proportion, ought to be bestowed vppon a creature so far out fauour, and altogither seruile: hee vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
<pb facs="tcp:12901:12"/>
any further to harken to the sute of <hi>Dorcon,</hi> reckoning fully with himselfe, that if euer after it did happen, that she were recognized by hir parents, &amp; that then it should be known, that for couetousnes of gaine, hee had in so bad and vile maner misprized hir, it could not but turne to his great detriment &amp; irrecuperable vndoing, if at the least wise he might vpon the knowledge thereof be infranchized from death: Led therfore as he was, by the regard of these doubts, he therevppon praied <hi>Dorcon</hi> for very neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoodes sake, to pardon him, and excusing in other sort the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, willed him from thence-forth that hee woulde sue no further vnto him.</p>
               <p>This conceited fore-cast of <hi>Dryas,</hi> was nothing at al pleasing to <hi>Dorcon,</hi> who seeing himselfe now the second time, with so flat resolution put off, could almost (what betweene loue and griefe of so many good gifts, that hee had in vaine bestowed) haue become desperat. It vexed the poore soule to the hart, to see, that his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings-milk cheeses, his fat calues, and bacon, were thus vnto the chuffe <hi>Dryas</hi> imparted, and all for nothing: he could haue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out-right for sorrow, and his humors rumbled togither with so bad a medley, as made his senses wring foorth diuers tender passions from out his wrinckled countenance. But yet recomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted quickly (as to such it often hapneth) of these vncouth pangs, the suttle clown began by a new deuised fraud now to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pas that which before he found so difficult, watching for this cause a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time to find <hi>Chloe</hi> (if it were possible alone) &amp; to this end, bethought himselfe, that vpon custome eche after others they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to driue their flockes at one certain time of the day togithers to drinke, the one of them daily, as it fel out after the other.

<pb facs="tcp:12901:13"/>
and the hinder legges also couered his thighs downe vnto his heeles, the head, as a visard, lay all ouer his face, and thus disguised as hee was, by likelihoode in the full shape and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a woolfe, hee drewe himselfe right vnto the fountaine, whither should come the flockes of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The spring was scituate in a valley verye intricate and crooked, and all the place rounde about for the most part enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with brembles, sharpe pricking furzes, and lowe declining ginipers, in sort, that if a woolfe in very deede he had beene, he might easily haue couched himselfe thereaboute to haue doone a spoile, <hi>Dorcon</hi> bussed himselfe in the thickest of these couerts, waiting the houre when <hi>Chloe</hi> should come, assuring himselfe, that by the fearfull shewe of his shape, hee coulde not choose but amaze hir, and in such amaze might easily seaze vppon hir, and do what he list vnto hir.</p>
               <p>Not long had the woolfe-like cow-heard couched himselfe, but the shepheardesse (as wonted) came with hir dainty flocks, hauing left hir <hi>Daphnis</hi> behind, busied in cutting downe of the most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twigs and boughs, for his goats to browze vpon, against they were returned to pasture, the dogges neuertheles, as accustomed gards vnto hir yonglings, at that instant accompanieng her. And as it is a thing vnto them naturall, to hunt vp and down, &amp; range round about the field, so at the last it befell, that drawing neere vnto the bush where this disguised cow-heard lay couching, they perceiued him bussing, and deeming it some beast, began to baie apase: the fiercest of them herevpon began to snap at the woolfe, and the rest, hardned with this onset, set also vpon him. <hi>Dorcon</hi> was now in an extasie, and not daring to stand vpright, for feare and shame of the disguise by him without effect pretended, the dogges vnweeting of the fraud, tooke no more knowledge of him than whilom did the hounds of <hi>Acteon</hi> vpon their master, disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as he was in the shape of a Hart, but harrieng fast vppon the cow-heard, one in one place, and an other in an other place, so rudely rushed vpon him, as tearing the woolfes skinne from his shoulders, they made him discouer him selfe at the last to be no more than the poore and simple cow-heard <hi>Dorcon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time the maske grew vtterly to be marred, &amp; the sharp

But <hi>Dorcon</hi> contrarie to expectation, hauing susteined more penance than he required, and pestered with the continuall biting of the dogges, could no other waies releeue him selfe then in discouering what hee was, wherewith incite against his will, he cried vehemently to <hi>Daphnis.</hi> The simple youth suspecting as little fraude, as his innocent yeares ministred vnto him occasion of euill, wondering at the accident, and thinking that it had bene done onely but as a iest, wherewith to haue frayed them, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Coweherde, and both he and the Shephardesse rating the dogges, and drawing them thence with their common whistle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe tooke poore <hi>Dorcon</hi> with much paine from out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, whom scarce being able to stande for the many hurts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts about him receiued, hauing nothing wherewith to fende him selfe, they led betweene their armes to the fountaine, and washed his woundes, which done, they brought him by the hand vnto his waie, and recomforting his decaied spirites by all meanes possible left him at the last to the peculiar in sight, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his owne euils, vnknowing alas were these to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die guiles and enterprizes of <hi>Loue,</hi> vnto those tender <hi>Impes,</hi> nor did they at all participate anye parte of the frawde to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or belonging, whose charie regarde of well-doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the onely supporte of their meere simplicitie and good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                  <hi>Dorcon,</hi> now solitarily conceiuing of this so strange an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, had all his imaginations thenceforth vtterly benommed, for euer thereafter to continue a louer. And in this hurlie burlie, the vnaccustomed baying also of the dogges, had so farre scattered abroade the flockes and herdes, as both <hi>Daphnis</hi> him selfe and <hi>Chloe</hi> had much paine, til night to drawe them together againe, the one part whereof being climed to the hiest rockes and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine toppes that might be, and the other fearefully straggled in diuers partes downe towardes the sea coastes.

Neere vnto her was there likewyse keeping of Cattell a certaine young youth, freshe and froolicke as her selfe, who right well handled his pipe, and could thereon playe manie deintie ditties.

His shape white as the colour of milke, an other time red as the glowing fire, his skinne pure, neate, and cleane, as if euen nowe he were come foorth of some pleasant riuer, naked is he alwayes in shew, and euer alone, and without company: him seemeth to haue great felicitie, in gathering my floures, my fruits, and my berries, and that doth he so freely and so carelesse of checke or controlment, as if the plot were his owne, and not belonging at all to anyeother but himselfe, which hauing often perceiued, I indeuored manie times to runne vnto him, fearing least in his tripping and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp and downe, he might happen to breake my mirtle twigs or pomegranat branches, but not for this could I euer so muche as once reach neere vnto him, so nimble is he in his flight, and therewithall so swift, and beeing so escaped, then cooleth hee himselfe couertly, shrowding vnder the rosters, and sometymes vnder the broad spreading poppies, no otherwise than if it were some preatie flieng partridge.</p>

Upon all which speaches, <hi>Daphnis</hi> for his part was not vnmindefull, but finding in him selfe, a perfect patterne of all that by <hi>Philetas</hi> was before discoursed vpon, he founde himselfe nowe in greater distresse then

before, for that <hi>Loue</hi> had long since alreadie begon to touch him to the quicke, wherefore seeing by all similitudes of comparing him selfe with the discourse vttered by <hi>Philetas</hi> betweene him &amp; his <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that the passion be sustained, was only by <hi>Loue,</hi> and that to the quenching and satisfaction thereof belonged, that eche of them might freely and soly inioy eache other, hee began now to studie by all meanes possible how &amp; in what sort he might best endeuour to compasse the same.

Their entermeeting togither was not without the accustomed pleasure and torments, the mixture whereof, neither grewe altogither exempted from the danger of one other particular most strange kinde of accident, and thus fell out the matter.</p>
               <p>There was a company of rich and wealthy youths of the towne of <hi>Metelene,</hi> who intending to take a little pleasure on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, coasted in a calme sea, as it happened from the territorie of their owne citie, downe along the coast of <hi>Metelene,</hi> the boure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whereof, made the passage the more pleasaunt, in that the same is curiously decked with faire and most excelent buildings. These yong men, passing along as they did, by the Island side, landed in diuers places at their pleasure, not offering violence or hurt to any thing, but quietly still tooke the delight they came for, and departed. They fished, angled, and fowled, with ginnes, nettes, and hookes at their pleasure, and the country being fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile of it selfe, they not onely satisfied their delight with present pastime, but filled also the table the better with good vittelles. And forsomuch as their intendment was onely to be merrye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they resolued to fasten their boat for one night, with their corde vpon the sea side, and there continue themselues in a towne hard by vppon the side of the Island.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12901:25"/>It chanced that the vintage, not yet being fully gathered in, the laborers working in the night as well as by day, one of them by occasion, had to vse a strong corde, which for that he had none of his owne, he went to the coast hard by, and tooke the corde wherewith the boat was fastned. These youths in the morning, seeing the hazard of their boat, being so at libertie, made earnest inquirie of the wrong doone, but the party that did it could not be found: wherefore chiding with their host alittle for the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they retired backe againe into their vessell, and hauing cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp along the coast about two leagues and more, they came at the last on that parte of the countrie where <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> pastured their hearde together. And for that the soile on that side the coast was altogither large and plaine, almost without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, they determined to land there againe, and to haue a course or otherwise to hunt, with their dogges or houndes, if so they might be suffered. For which cause they alighting all togither from their boat, drew the same as neere to the shore as coulde be, and cutting downe the braunches from a greene oziar standing hard by, they wreathed the strongest of them that they coulde bend, and therewith fastned their boat safe enough (as they did thinke) to the land.</p>
               <p>Being now on the plaines furnished with their dogs, hounds, and other necessaries, they began to place their toiles, on those sides and places that to them seemed conuenient and necessarie, but their dogges coursing very euill, ranne here and there verye disordered, insomuch, as leauing the game, they ranne into the middest of the heards of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe,</hi> and their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally baying at their very heeles, fraied so much the goats &amp; sheep, that all of them beganne therevppon to be immediatly scattered, whereof the most part of the goats turning directly vppon the sea coasts, <hi>Daphnis</hi> ranne after the one part of them, and <hi>Chloe</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other.</p>
               <p>The goats there continuing, and hauing neither bush or ought else to browze vppon, got them to the oziar wreath, with whiche the boat was fastned, and browzing two or three of them vpon it, quickly riued the same in sunder, whereby the boat being loosed, floted, by reason of the violence of the waues, immediatly vppon
<pb facs="tcp:12901:26"/>
the seas. The <hi>Methiniens</hi> misliking their sporte, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe vnto the coast, missed the boat, and enraged deepely by reason that with such misaduenture, the same, by tempest was thus vehemently carried, had no other reuenge, but altogether fell vpon the poore and solitarie <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Nowe had the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard no meane to make any resistance against a multitude, but defending himselfe as hee coulde, hee kepte them backe, till he had cried and called for more aid. Whervpon <hi>Lamon</hi> &amp; <hi>Dryas,</hi> olde <hi>Philetas</hi> and others a number, that were nerest about them, came foorth, and desirous to knowe the cause of the griefe of the <hi>Methiniens,</hi> they declared, as before you haue heard, that beeing at their sport, and hauing fastened their boat with a strong oztar band, the goates of <hi>Daphnis</hi> by their euill atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce and keeping had browzed the same in sunder, wherein their apparell, money, iewelles, and diuers kindes of prouision being, in the same by misaduenture of the loosenesse and tempest was vtterly lost.</p>
               <p>The whole fault and accusation hereof, they vtterly laid to <hi>Daphnis,</hi> and for sentence therein they were content to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged by <hi>Philetas. Daphnis,</hi> hee contrary-wise pleaded for himselfe, that in keeping his goates there a long time together they neuer did spoile or offence to any man, but that the badnes of their hounds, &amp; their owne vnskilful hunting driuing themselues amongest his heards, made them to take the sea-coast, where whilest he was gathering the greatest number together, two of them lay browzing vppon the greene oziar without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Philetas</hi> hauing heard both allegations, freed <hi>Daphnis</hi> fro hurt, and imputed the whole fault as it was to the <hi>Methi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens,</hi> the yong men enraged herewith, beganne to stand vpon force, and answeared, that either they woulde haue <hi>Daphnis</hi> as slaue for the trespasse, or otherwise be there recompenced their losses.</p>
               <p>Here-vppon ensued on all sides a great hurlie-burlie, and the <hi>Metelins</hi> drawing in still to their aides, the <hi>Methiniens</hi> were quite beaten out with their losses and discomfited. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to their Cittie, they enforced marueilouslie to their rulers, the wrongs receiued by the <hi>Metelians,</hi> not onelye
<pb facs="tcp:12901:26"/>
affirming, that they had beat them, but stoutly also and vntruely inserted, that they had robbed and taken their goods from them. The <hi>Methiniens</hi> conceiuing greate dispite heereof in suche sorte to haue their citizens vsed, and they also descended of their most noblest parentage and houses, denounced immediatlie war in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fielde against the <hi>Metelenians</hi> for the reuengement of these wrongs, but sent them no word at all of this their speedie intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the accomplishment of this exploit, they gaue charge and direction to their Captaine onely for the arming and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of 12. gallies, commaunding him with the strength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to enter the fields and teritories of the <hi>Metelenians,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all pitie to forage, wast, and spoile them of all they could get. And farther strength then this they thought not meet at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to send, winter drawing on as it did, and therefore the lesse meet to trust a greater flote on the sea, than those which were in such maner by them prepared already.</p>
               <p>The captaine slacked no time, but furnished with al things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, coasted that part of the countrie of the <hi>Metelene,</hi> which altogether bordered vpon the sea, and on that side of the land next vnto them, foraged and wasted all the countrie ouer, carryeng away diuers and sundrye booties and praies, as well of cattell, corne, wine, and a great multitude besides of prisoners, all for the most parte laborers, and such as at that instant holpe in wyth the vintage. This doone, hee proceeded further, and foraged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so al along the plaines, where <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Chloe</hi> mainteined their pastures, and they being there in like maner, as the others vnprouided of any resistance, they tooke and did what they would on the borders. <hi>Daphnis</hi> was not as then with his heard, but trauelled a little way to gather greene boughs for his yoong and tender kids to browze vpon, &amp; seeing a far off the great concourse &amp; formost entrance of his enimies, crept into the hollownesse of a certaine crooked passage vnder a rocke, and there hid himselfe. <hi>Chloe</hi> was then a keeping the flockes, who no sooner perceiuing the bruite and outrage alreadie begun, tooke hir to flight, &amp; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to saue hir self by swiftnes, got into the caue of the <hi>Nymphs.</hi> But the foragers hauing quicke sight of hir, followed the tract so neere, as they pursued hir euen hard to the very caue. There
<pb facs="tcp:12901:27"/>
seeing no other remedy, she fell flat vnto the souldiors, &amp; prayeng them for the reuerence and regarde due vnto the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> that would tender no hurt, neither to hirselfe, nor to any of hir beasts. But this petition of hers preuailed not, for the <hi>Methinian</hi> souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours after many villanies and dispites, doone and vttered in diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Images, led both hir and hir beasts away as a spoile, chasing and driuing both hir and them before them, in most cruel manner, and without any pitie or compassion. And seeing nowe that they had fully laden their gallories, with all kind of spoiles and booties of euery sort, they ceased to tyre themselues any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but fearing the vncertaintie of the winter weather, besides the hazard of meetings with any enimies, they desired now none other, but in safetie to returne home to their owne houses, and finding the weather sortable to their purpose, they laid strength to their ores, and made way abroad, the season being so calme, as there was not so much as one puffe of winde wherewith to resist them.</p>
               <p>When all the harrieng of this great spoile and brute was at the last appeased, <hi>Daphnis</hi> sorted himselfe out of his hollowe rhine, and came againe into the plaine, where he left their heards when hee went a feeding, and finding there neither goates nor sheepe, nor any newes at all either of them or of <hi>Chloe,</hi> but onelie the emptie fieldes and plaines a lone without anye other creature or companye, and the flute whereon the <hi>Nymphe</hi> sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye was woont to sound, cast downe and lying on the ground, his heart sweltred within him by exceeding sorrowe, insomuch as hee was not scarce able to stand, but lykelie foorth-with to haue swooned, and shedding foorth aboundaunce of teares, so great was his griefe, as hee could not chuse but crie out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Chloe,</hi> and that also right biterlie. First ranne hee to the foot of a hie and vmbragious rocke, whereon customablie they both were woont to sit and talke togethers, and not hearing any newes of <hi>Chloe</hi> thereabouts, he then trudged as fast as hee could downe to the sea coasts, and there not finding her, he last of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the caue of the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> whether him seemed at the first incursion of these souldiers shee made haste to flie, and casting him selfe downe prostrate there, at the feete of the Images, hee

Wherefore beliberating with all possible speede to be reuenged vpon them, the Prince and councell of that state, caused incontinent to be leuied in their Island, an armie of seuen thousand footemen, and three thousand horsemen, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made Captaine generall, a notable and right valiant gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose name was <hi>Hippasia,</hi> commanding them to leaue the sea (for the winter stormes approching) and to marche with easie iourneies by land, into the territories of the enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippasia</hi> hauing receiued his charge, departed from <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> and with his companie made such speede, as that in verie short space he came to <hi>Methimnia,</hi> where behauing himself right honorablie, wherein he vsed neither crueltie nor tyrannie, anie in the countrie where he came, neither fourraged he their landes, or tooke at all anie praye, spoyle, or bootie from the poore people or labourers. For that standing highly vpon the honor of a Captaine and his owne reputation, he deemed those kinde of proferings to be the workes rather of some thiefe or rouer, than of him that should be a Captaine, or among souldiers esteemed as a generall.

Who had in request with all submission to deliuer, that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimnians</hi> not seeking warre at his handes, or to haue to do with armes, desired only to haue peace. And that beeing enformed that the vprore committed in <hi>Metelene,</hi> began at the first by the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of a fewe young men of their citie, and only betweene the peasantes of the Islande and them, and that the worthiest sort of the <hi>Metelenians</hi> neuer consented to the cause, nor had hetherto till this present entermedled in the matter, they were therefore hartelie sorie for the iniuries by them on their partes offered, and desired therefore, that as good and louing neighbours, they both might thenceforth trafique and liue anew togethers, and for any wrongs by the <hi>Methimnians</hi> to them tendred, or prisoners take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or spoyles made, they were readie to restore and make amendes, in anie sort that reasonablie might be required.</p>

Toe finishing of this strife, brought the Winters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie vpon their backes: the sharpe season whereof, by reason of the great frostes and snowes immediatlye ensuing there-vppon in so great aboundance, became right piercing and hideous. Now was the vncomfortable time wherein nothing then stormes, and blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering northren blastes were so rife, the snowe lay thick lined on the ground, shutting the poore labourers with the great depth therof fast into their houses, the springs ratled downe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with their icie streames, the trees spoiled of their gallant brauerie seemed as dead, the earth appeared no where but euen vpon the verie brimme of the riuers and fountaines. It was now no time to leade the beastes to pastures, nor to suffer them almost to go out of doores. The freesing <hi>Boreas</hi> called for great fires, which according to ancient hospitalitie of shepheards, was made on a large harth in the middest of their halles, the blasing shewe wherof immediatly after the mornings cocke, inuited each one in the cold frostie seasons, to drawe round about it: and there with farre more easie labour then abroade, to dispatch their housholde busines. The hindes and such as tilled and labored the groundes, tooke herein great pleasure, in so much as the bitternesse of the weather, became vnto them for the time being, a releasment of their hard endured labour, so that sporting themselues in diuers housholde pastimes, they chaunted their countrie tunes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

were as if they had beene bunches of grapes, by occasion whereof, the winter being hard, and the ground thicke with snowe, there flocked thither continually a great multitude of birdes, as well thrushes, red-breasts, larkes, ringdoues, and sundry other foules. Under the colour of these, <hi>Daphnis,</hi> by pretence of going a bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hauing prepared his lime-twigs and other necessaries, to come before the house of <hi>Dryas,</hi> and vnder the <hi>Myrtes</hi> aforesaide, pitched his nets, and laid his lime-twigs.</p>
               <p>The distaunce betweene both houses of <hi>Lamon</hi> and <hi>Dryas,</hi> was about halfe a mile, and were it not, that the furie of <hi>Loue</hi> is such, as neither feeleth heat nor cold, weather or winde, whereby to compasse the satisfaction desired, it happilye might haue bin (the season being such as it was) the fowler would haue had litle liking at that instant, to haue passed betweene both houses to lay his twigs, considering y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the same hauing no tract at all, so moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the labouring sheepeheard, as with long standing afterward in the colde and wet, he might peraduenture haue had his paines but hadly rewarded.</p>
               <p>But these, and such like warie coniectures, being scaled from <hi>Loue,</hi> the sheepeheard neither felt nor regarded it, so well able was his youth to out-countenance the burthen therof. Not long had <hi>Daphnis</hi> staid there, before his nettes placed, and the twigs therevpon in order prepared, but downe came the birds by heaps, and fluttred immediatly, by the legges, he tooke and kept which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then returned hee backe to his nooke againe, and there watched his birdes, and faire <hi>Chloes</hi> also, to come thither togethers, but the enuious soile hadde so ramnied in their doores, by sharpenesse of the weather, that there was not so much as a cock or a pullet seene to look out either at doore or windowe. Thus staied the amorous lad all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone long, and till also the middest of the day was reasonablye well spent: his birdes were vppe in his budget, and yet <hi>Chloe</hi> came not, nor any body else appeared to take notice of his bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, according as hee hoped, and faine woulde by some meanes or other haue procured, which seeing the dismaied youth, he began to accuse the vnhappy houre, and vnfauoring planet that raigned at his foorth-going, deeming that hee had not well pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:12901:37"/>
his time, that the gods were vnto his wish at that instant no more fauourable: yet resolued hee not so to depart and loose his long emploted trauell and watching, but desperate howe by any chaunce she might haue occasion to issue foorth, hee beganne to imagine with himselfe, what coulour or excuse most credible, hee might see vpon the cause, whereby to take occasion to visite her.</p>
               <p>If (said he) I should say I came for fire, they might aske me whether neighbors neerer hand were not to giue it, and so laugh at my follie. If I should, being thus farre from home, and now in fowling, craue of their vittelles, they might by search of my budget perceiue that I had enough. If I shoulde aske of their wine, why, we are not without our selues, for it is but thother day since our vintage was in. If I shoule councerfeit a feare of the woolfe, then where is the trace. If I shall tell them, I came to catch birds, why am I not then packing when I haue doone my businesse? If plainely I shoulde then deliuer vnto them howe I came to see <hi>Chloe,</hi> that toie were too plaine, for who is hee so simple that woulde saye to a father and mother, I come to your daughter? Insomuch, as none of these occasions seemed vnto him to be voide of suspicion, as that in handling of anye of them hee coulde not needes be descried. For which cause, seeing no way nowe left to satisfie his intendment, he concluded to make of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitte a vertue, saying to himselfe: Wel, this too cruel season and peruerse enimie to our affections will not euer holde, one day wil the spring time be returned to his prime, and then shall I see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at libertie my <hi>Chloe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilest the louing lad was thus concluding vppon his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient affections, and hauing buckled vp all his trinkets, in full minde to be gone: It seemed that <hi>Loue</hi> expresly pitieng his hard and ouer long sufferance, suggested a sudden occasion, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously sorted to the effecting of this his awaited purpose. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and his family within doores being ready to haue setten down to meate, it fortuned, their faces being turned from the table, and the meat set on the boorde, a mastiffe that was in the house, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to regarde him, suddenly caught in his mouth a great peece of meate from the table, and as it hapned, of the best and
<pb facs="tcp:12901:38"/>
principall part of the same. Which <hi>Dryas</hi> seeing, as the dogge chaunced to go out of doores, he followed, harrieng, and rating him with a great cudgell in his hand, and passing along to beat the dog, sawe <hi>Daphnis</hi> without, yet standing vnder the <hi>Myrtes,</hi> with his trinkets on his backe. Whom when <hi>Dryas</hi> perceiued, forgetting at one instant both his dogge and meate togethers, he louingly turned himselfe to the yong sheepheard, and taking hym by the hand, led him into his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daphnis</hi> seeing the good fortune heereof, coulde not frame himselfe to make any shew of refusall, to that which he had before so feruently longed after, but entred willingly with <hi>Dryas.</hi> Where the first obiect that presented it selfe before his eies, was the sweete <hi>Chloe,</hi> who meeting also hir beloued on a sudden, with great paine, they both with-held themselues that they were not surprised and quite ouerwhelmed with ioy, but modestie, and seemely bashfulnes, casting on hir a secret couert, and meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint in him, that in any sorte hee might not be reuealed, they ioyfully eache for the present saluted the other, as befitted, and so parting on sunder <hi>Daphnis</hi> was by <hi>Dryas</hi> led forward to <hi>Nape</hi> to be welcommed.</p>
               <p>To tell you of the old <hi>Dryas,</hi> how much he made of the youth, were wonderfull, for that being once entred, he could not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that night to returne backe againe. O thrice blessed hap. how fauourable wast thou at this instant to the mutuall desires of these louers, and thou <hi>Loue,</hi> well might it be saide, that thy care in them was not so much as in one iote perished. <hi>Daphnis</hi> looked not to be demanded of his carriage, nor what lucke he had then in his birding, but vnbuckling freely his budget, he referred vnto his friendly host, both the choice and plenty thereof, at his pleasure to be accepted.</p>
               <p>The dayes naturally approched at this instant to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test shortnesse, and nowe the purple couert of <hi>Iupiters</hi> segniory, beganne to take hold in the element, and chasing the fast fleeting <hi>Aurora,</hi> into her westerne cabbin, all bedewed as shee was with hir duskie snowish couering, made <hi>Dryas</hi> both in fire, cheere, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, and all other intertainements to seeke to welcome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doores his guest. <hi>Chloe</hi> was not behinde hand to doo him al

the fauours shee might, yet was she wooed of a great many, and many wealthy proffers were daily made vnto <hi>Dryas</hi> to obtaine his good will to marry her, but the faire shepheardesse, wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted as she was to an other purpose, freely now reioiced at the sight of him shee liked, but not so frankly, as when besides the downes they pastured their fruitful heards for the times, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof affoorded vnto them a farre greater blessednes. Yet <hi>Loue</hi> continuing his good graces in their auowed furtheraunce, made <hi>Dryas</hi> and <hi>Nape</hi> about some secret occasions to withdraw a little their presence, whereby the amazed youth surprized at the sudden motion, and Ioth to leese the opportunitie, raught <hi>Chloe</hi> quickly vnto him, and stole from hir a kisse ere she was aware. O howe hony sweete vnto him was the pressure of those hir candie lippes, and howe much eased hee his minde therein, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whereof was such as hardly he would haue exchanged for a mighty <hi>Seigniorie.</hi>

               <p>But when the <hi>Nymph</hi> also beganne in louing sorte to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him, and seemed to counterfeit an amorous mislike of that hee meant so neare to approche the place where shee was, and yet would not come in, if he had not bene of <hi>Dryas</hi> required, howe neere then beganne his very thoughtes to melt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume him inwardly, when excusing the manner thereof wyth some bashfulnesse, shee was faine to pronounce a free pardon vnto him, or euer hee was able to demaunde it, else hadde hee bin in the retourne of <hi>Dryas</hi> discouered by his very countenance.</p>

                  </hi> whome by a more peculiar affection than to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee feruently embraced, called for what might bee hadde to supper, and afterwards spent foorth the time, vntill the length of the night called them to bed-ward, where, with what kinde, and howe many sorts of imaginations poore <hi>Daphnis</hi> reposed, I leaue to the full pleasing content of euery louer to be discerned.</p>
               <p>The next day calling them foorth to the celebration of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yearly feast, euermore with great and most religious deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion honoured among all the sheepeheards from the highest vnto the lowest of that Island, and all the territories therevnto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, made <hi>Daphnis</hi> (who till his comming to the house of
<pb facs="tcp:12901:39"/>
                  <hi>Dryas,</hi> and the preparation there seene was ignoraunt thereof) to bestir himselfe earely in the morning, with intent to prepare him also with the rest to these sacred obseruances, the custome and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion whereof grew thus. There was at that present a <hi>Princesse,</hi> by lyneall dissent sprong from out the auncient and most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med race of their worthiest Kinges, who swaying the Scepter of that Island<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had with great happines to her people, fame to herself, honour to her countrie, admiration to the world, and loue to her subiects, in a farte estraunged manner of pollicie, peace, and most wonderful successe ruled and raigned by the space of many yeares ouer them. Their Queene was then, and so alwaies continued a virgin, wise was shee as the sagest, reguarded as the mightiest, honoured as the rarest, followed as the fairest, and reputed of as the worthiest: Her yeares as it seemed, were vnto her subiectes most precious, for she might assure herselfe of all the Princes that liued in her time, to be most entierly beloued. Her soueraigntie and rule in the greatest reputation thereof, it principallye bare swaie, and chiefe honour of that Island, yet was shee of auntient, intitled to farre greater gouernements, and as then also besides possessed of larger iurisdictions and kingdomes. The recordation of her happines, her rule, her power, her honour, and vertues, for the manifolde benefites thereout dailie reaped by her exceeding worthines, vnto the vniuersalike of all her louing subiects, made this daye for euermore sacred among them, in which shee liuing they in testimonie of their inseperable and gratefull pietie, loue, dutie, and affection towardes her, with sundrie accustomed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, praiers, vowes, feastes, and hanquetings, do ioyntly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together reioyce, and ten thousand times beseech the soueraigne director of all humaine actions, that long and euer shee may liue blessed, famous, happie, and in all her vertuous actions most hie, peireles, and inuincible among them.</p>
               <p>Of this daies reuerend and most seemely obseruaunce, were fawtors the greatest and mightiest of all the Shepeheardes, for that them-selues challenging in the fertilitie of their fieldes and flocks, whereby their heards mightilie still encreased, and they in riches abounded, to be in this action vnto her rare and most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler clemencie of all others most deuoted, as they that by her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues

and long continuance had euer receiued the greatest benefit, did alwaies therefore ioyntly and willingly, formost of all others procéede in this enterprize. The youthfull and gallantest troppe of them richly trimmed on horse-backe and on foot, exercised in her honer diuers and sundrye feates of actiuitie, the rest, and those that were more auncient, attentiuely reioycing and beholding them, Afterwards they altogether came to a publike place, to that sole end and purpose, specially of long time reserued, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling and sporting themselues vniuersally in all kinde of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, pastimes &amp; dances, they sing before <hi>Pan</hi> and the <hi>Nymphs:</hi> who reuerencing also with like regarde the <hi>Paragon,</hi> whome they honor, assent to their tunes and inusique, and yéelde therevnto for the greater beautifiyng of the same, al swéetnes and pleasure that may be.</p>

And forsomuch as to the agreement of this match, it seemed a thing meet and pertinent to his dutie, to haue him therevnto required, he persuaded him they might continue freends, and let the conclusion of the marriage suspend till the time of the next vintages, which not being long, his L. he had vnderstanding would then be there in person to suruiew the state of his house and maner of the countrie, &amp; then with the good liking on ech part they might be the better solemnized.
