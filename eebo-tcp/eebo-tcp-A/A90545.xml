         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

REPORTS
TO
The Honourable Committee of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
concerning the ſpeedy reducing
of the Iriſh Rebels.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, he deſireth, that there may be a ſpeedy
courſe taken for the ſetling of the poore, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed,
and bleeding Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
in peace and unity, &amp; that there may be ſome pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and religious Miniſters (both Presbyterians
and others) forthwith expedited for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that all poſſible care may be taken for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160059:3"/>
the ſending over proviſions and other neceſſaries
for reliefe of the poor diſtreſſed Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that all Commanders whatſoever that
are under the Command of the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> may forthwith be ſent over, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Great Truſt repoſed in them, that
ſo the Cauſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be no longer detarded,
but with all faithfulneſſe and expediency perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for the eaſing of our diſtreſſed Brethren from
the heavie oppreſſions which they have for many
yeares groaned under.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you (in briefe) the effect and ſubſtance
of the Propoſitions or Report of (the renowned Worthy of
our Times) Mr. PETERS, upon Friday laſt, concerning the
managing of the Affaires for the Kingdom of Ireland; I will
in the next place communicate unto you, the dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and condition of this our native Kingdom of England;
by reaſon of the manifold Plots and Conſpiracies which are
dayly acting and contriving (by the Enemies of GOD) againſt
the Worthies of England, the High and Honourable Court of
Parliament: Yet all their Machavillian Plots, and horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
have been fruſtrated, and taken no effect; For when
they were in the height of their pride, and (almoſt) upon the
finiſhing of their wicked Conſpiracies, it pleaſed God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and bring to light all their barbarous and inhumane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions:
Yet theſe great and malicious Inſtruments, which
have been for many yeares together, the chiefe Diſturbers of
the Peace and Tranquility of England, whoſe hearts have bin
inveterate againſt the Proceedings of our Renowned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are now ſtudying, complotting, and contriving how to
bring their moſt wicked and bloudy Deſignes once again to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160059:3"/>
perfection, and to ſet footing within this our Realme of
England,</p>
            <p>But becauſe I will not detract time, nor trouble the
Readers patience with too much ſuperfluity of former
experiencies, I will confine my ſelfe, and proceed to the
enſuing ſubject, which may be tearmed, Englands vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Scout, giving Her an Alarum of the warlike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that are now beyond the Seas, not onely by a
forreign Enemy, but by Her Native Branches, which I
will here inſert, and faithfully communicate, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>
            <p>The Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which for a long time had ſo inveterately engaged
themſelves in a deſperate warre againſt the Parliament,
are very active beyond the Seas in the Kingdome of
France, and other Parts, and are complotting and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their heads together, how they may contrive &amp; raiſe
a new war in England, uſing their utmoſt endeavours,
(by way of entreat) for the gathering of an Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
And to that end, the greateſt part of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry, together with all the Collonels, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonels, Majors, Captains, and other inferiour
Officers, which were Runagadoes from their Native
Country, having formerly had the honour of great truſt
and eminent places repoſed to their Charge, began to
recollect their memories, and to bethink themſelves of
the gallant dayes which they once enjoyed within the
Realm of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore, having ever ſince
their departure from this Kingdom bin much perplexed
in mind, joyntly concluded, that if it were poſſible for
them to raiſe a Party, and ſome certain ſums of mony,
they would venter once again to ſteere their Coaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160059:4"/>
the Confines of England; And for the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of their Deſign now in agitation, the Queen doth
endeavour to uſe her utmoſt power for the effecting of
it, as formerly ſhe hath done.</p>
            <p>But it is very probable that their Deſigne will bee
ſoon fruſtrated, and all their Plots and Conſpiracies ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confounded; for one ſtorme hath already appeared
againſt them, and no doubt, but many more will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ariſe) ſo that there is ſmall hopes of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
any thing againſt this Kingdome, by reaſon of
a Controverſie and Diſputation that hath lately aroſe
between the Queen and her Confeſſour at <hi>St. Iermans,</hi>
who at a late meeting, told her, that her proceedings
were not well approved of, and that he thought She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to incline towards the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to
deſert the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> At which words, her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
being ſomwhat diſpleaſed, replyed and declared her
ſelf in this manner: That for her Religion, which Shee
was alwayes brought up in from her Infancie, She were
reſolved to live and dye in; And for his Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her, in being pleaſed to ſay, that it was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Her, to permit or ſuffer any of Her ſervants &amp;
followers liberty to aſſociate themſelves with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
in any publike place or meeting whatſoever; to
which her Majeſty anſwered, That Shee were reſolved
to grant them free liberty of Conſcience; intimating,
that when ſhe were in <hi>England,</hi> all her followers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
had liberty and tolleration to uſe their owne wayes
and conſciences, without any diſanulment or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all, and in conſideration thereof, ſhe were reſolved
to grant the ſame liberty to Her Royall Soveraignes
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iends, and Hers, in France, as they fo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>merly have had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160059:4"/>
in <hi>England.</hi> Thus having expreſſed her ſelf ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto her Confeſſour, hee tooke his leave, and being
much perplexed in mind retyred out of the roome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a great fury: what the iſſue of this Diſcord and
Contention may ariſe to, I cannot as yet aſſure you.
Therefore, in the next place, be pleaſed to take notice,
that his Highneſſo the Prince of VVales is very much
perplexed in mind, and cannot approve of the French
faſhions nor wayes, but declares himſelf in oppoſition
againſt them.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you the chiefeſt Obſervations and
remarkableſt Paſſages that have happened within the
Kingdome of France, ſomewhat reflecting upon the
Peace and Tranquility of England, I cannot but put you
in mind of another buſineſſe of great concernment, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of your obſervation, and hath ſome reference to the
former. But drawing to a period, I will only give you a
hint of it and briefly intimate unto you, as followeth:</p>
            <p>From Iarſey we are advertiſed, That the Lord Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Colonell Cartwright, and divers other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are very active in the ſaid Iſland, both in furniſhing
of themſelves with Ammunition, and alſo in keeping
their men together (which is ſuppoſed for ſome deſigne
againſt the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hopton hath cauſed two or three Powder Milles
to be made, and are continually in action with them.</p>
            <p>They keepe ſeverall ſtrong Holds about the Iland,
and are ſuppoſed to be about two thouſand ſtrong, all
compleatly armed, being gallantly experienced in the
Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>The Holds that they keepe are of great ſtrength, moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160059:5"/>
of them being ſcituated upon great Rockes, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with the Sea; ſo that it is to be feared, it will bee
a long time before they are brought to the obedience of
the Parliament; unleſſe upon compoſition.</p>
            <p>But why theſe Gariſons ſhould be maintained and kept
in a defenſive and warlike poſture againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not as yet known: but we may conceive (and it
is too apparent) that they have ſome Deſignes in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> for who can be
ſo deluded, as to thinke that they will ſtill keepe theſe
Holds in defiance, and to endanger both lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
but only they have a ſecret Conſpiracie amongſt
themſelves; and no doubt, but their horrid Plots, and
deſperate deſignes, will at the laſt be brought to light,
and to their everlaſting ſhame, be made manifeſt to the
whole world.</p>
            <p>They are very vigilant, and will not ſuffer a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to go to the Sea, without ſevere examination and
diligent ſearch.</p>
            <p>Hopton hath again renewed his inveterate malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliaments friends, and hath diſarmed all
the well-affected throughout the whole Iſland.</p>
