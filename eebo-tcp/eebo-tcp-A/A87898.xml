         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now for his Clamours againſt the <hi>preſent</hi> King: As

            <p>This <hi>Eye-Salve,</hi> Gentlemen, which our <hi>pretending
Oculiſt</hi> preſents you with, is a medicine of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which (by general report) ſtrook <hi>Milton <hi>Blind:</hi>
               </hi>
and 'tis his Intereſt that You ſhould be ſo too. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but obſerve how full of <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi> it is: and
<hi>One</hi> thing moſt <hi>remarqualle</hi> take notice of.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Safety</hi> is the only Argument he employs, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

Conſider, my Maſters: you are <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
not <hi>Turks; Subjects,</hi> not <hi>Governours; Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> They'll have the <hi>Sword</hi> in their Hands; and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>

to all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>In Order:—and to the <hi>First,</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> place:</p>
            <p>1. Can any thing be more unreaſonable, than to object
<hi>Revenge</hi> as <hi>Dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Private Souldjers?</hi> were
<hi>Ours</hi> the moſt <hi>vindictive Prince</hi> that ever lived (as you
your ſelves know the Quite contrary, ſo much as you
know of him) <hi>They</hi> were ſtill <hi>ſafe.</hi> That <hi>Revenge</hi> muſt
be exerciſed either upon your <hi>Lives,</hi> or <hi>Fortunes.</hi>—</p>
            <p>As to your <hi>Lives:</hi> what would that Cruelty avayl him;
or what ſhould move him to employ it? a Perſonal pique
there can be none, he Knows you not; and beſide;-many
of his Father's Party are mingled with you; that took
up <hi>Arms</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> and not in <hi>Malice.</hi>—Neither are
you look'd upon as <hi>Deſigners,</hi> but as <hi>Souldjours;</hi> under
<hi>command:</hi> and ſuch, as during a ſuſpenſion of the <hi>Civil
Government,</hi> ſubjected your ſelves to the <hi>Law of <hi>Arms:</hi>
               </hi>
—You were neither <hi>Judges,</hi> nor <hi>Executioners;</hi>—your
Buſineſſe was in the <hi>Field;</hi> and the Kings greateſt Harms
were done in the Intervals of Peace.—Further, your
Obligations under your <hi>Preſent General</hi> give you both
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi> From whom, when ever you
<hi>ſtart,</hi> you are <hi>loſt</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>very Circumſtances, would</hi> ſecure <hi>you, even from
a</hi> Barbarous Enemy: <hi>much more then, from a</hi> Prince, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115425:4"/>
by a Principle of <hi>Courage</hi> loves a <hi>Souldjour:</hi>—<hi>by</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
of <hi>Generoſity, <hi>that</hi>
               </hi> loves a <hi>candid Enemy:</hi>—and
by a ſtrong Impulſe of natural Goodneſſe and Divine Charity,
that reckons <hi>Duty</hi> in a <hi>Subject,</hi> as a <hi>Friendſhip:</hi>—and
ſoftens <hi>Treaſon</hi> it ſelf, in his Familiar Diſcourſes, with the
Terms only of <hi>Humane Frailty.</hi>—How eagerly was he
Perſued at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and how miraculouſly Preſerved! yet
after This; with how much <hi>Tenderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> (out
of his Little Stock) did he <hi>Compaſſionate,</hi> and <hi>Relieve</hi> Thoſe
very Perſons, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that ſought his <hi>Life</hi> at <hi>Worceſter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Enough is ſaid to This Point. Examine now your <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
in the Point of <hi>Fortune.</hi> (I do not find many <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi>
among the <hi>Private Souldjery.</hi>) What have you got,
for all your <hi>Hazzards,</hi> but <hi>Hunger, Infamy,</hi> and <hi>Rags?</hi>
When yet your <hi>Thankleſſe Masters have put up <hi>half the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of three Kingdems</hi> into their <hi>private Pockets:</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the venture of a broken Head for't.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſhame, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> bethink your ſelves. Leave theſe
ungratefull wretches to their, <hi>Lot:</hi> and <hi>Save</hi> your
<hi>Souls;</hi> your <hi>Lives;</hi> your <hi>Freedoms;</hi>—<hi>Briefly;</hi>
all the Benefits which your condition is capable
of, you may enjoy; and 'tis not <hi>poſſible</hi> for you to prevail

To end this point; here's the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Whether you ſhould rather ſerve a Pack of <hi>Inconſiderable,
Covetous Traytors;</hi> that contrary to Law, have Rifled,
and Embroyl'd three Nations; and cheated you of your Pay,
that did their buſineſs for them; and then Ruine your ſelves too
into the Bargain;—or on the contrary, Return to your <hi>Right
Maſtor;</hi> Redeem your <hi>Honor,</hi> and your <hi>Country,</hi> by ſerving
Him, who having Loſt all that theſe People Got; yet ſuccoured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115425:4"/>
you? (<hi>Having been</hi> Long <hi>upon this Particular, I ſhall be
the</hi> Shorter <hi>in the Reſt</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> You are adviſed to provide against a <hi>Lawleſſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do ſo, and <hi>Quit Them.</hi> But let me tell you; <hi>They fear
the <hi>Law,</hi> more than the <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> You ſhall be perſecuted for <hi>Conſcience. (<hi>they tell you</hi>
               </hi>)</p>
            <p>No. <hi>They're</hi> affraid of being Laſhed for want on't. Can
you have better <hi>Security</hi> in Nature, for all <hi>Religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;</hi>
than the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of that <hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe <hi>Habitual
Piety;</hi>—<hi>Tenderneſſe</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi>—Exact <hi>Faith,
and Juſtice</hi> to his <hi>Word:</hi> and whoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalterable Firmneſſe</hi>
to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> under ſo great <hi>Temptations</hi> to
<hi>deſert</hi> it;—are ſo unqueſtionably evident?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly. <hi>Trade</hi>
               </hi> will not floriſh under a <hi>Single Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Committee-Trade indeed it's like will down: ſo will the Trade
of Juggling in a Pulpit;—of ſhewing Tricks with Rings,
and Bodkins. <hi>But where's the <hi>Trade</hi>
               </hi> Theſe Fellows drive?
<hi>They would be <hi>Major Generals</hi>
               </hi> again perhaps;—<hi>or
is it, that</hi> Hewſon has a mind to <hi>Cobble</hi> again;—<hi>and my
<hi>Lord-Sir-John-Maſter-Jack-Berkſtead</hi> would fall again
to his old</hi> Trade <hi>of</hi> Thimble-making.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> Your <hi>Arrieres</hi> muſt go to pay the Kings debts.</p>
            <p>No: They that <hi>Oppoſe</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> will probably
be Deſired to pay for <hi>Setling</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> Your <hi>Carcaſes</hi> ſhall be puniſhed, if you have no <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;</hi>
and you recorded for <hi>Traytors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen meaſure <hi>others</hi> by themſelves. The
<hi>Firſt,</hi> hath been their <hi>Practice,</hi> and the <hi>Latter</hi> will be their
<hi>Fortune.</hi> For <hi>Traytor</hi> is a <hi>Brand</hi> upon ſuch as <hi>Reſist Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
not upon thoſe that <hi>Submit</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto; why <hi>no King.</hi>—<hi>Now;</hi>—<hi>why the
<hi>Law muſt run in another Name;</hi>
               </hi> (in truth a ſeaſonable
Conſideration) <hi>and a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> be <hi>Eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons are ſo <hi>Trivial,</hi> and ſo <hi>Tedious,</hi> I ſhall not
trouble my ſelf with the <hi>Particulars. <hi>This,</hi>
               </hi> in ſhort, is <hi>the
groſſe</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Kings</hi> name ſpeakes you <hi>Traytors;</hi>—</p>
