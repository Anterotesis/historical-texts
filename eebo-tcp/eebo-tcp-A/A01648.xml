         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MOst glorious LORD GOD, whose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dwelling is in the highest heavens, and yet beholdest the lowlie and the humble vpon earth, wee blush and are ashamed to lift vp our eyes vnto heaven, because we haue sinned against thee which dwellest in the heavens: But looke downe, wee beseech thee, from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heaven thy dwelling place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:14199:55"/>
and beholde the humilitie of thy servants heere on earth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselues at the foot-stooll of thy mercie, confessing their owne guiltinesse, and begging pardon for their sinnes.</p>
               <p>Wee confesse, Almightie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that thou madest vs at the first after thyne owne image, thou cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedst vs with innocencie as with a garment, thou seatedst vs in paradise a place of all delight and pleasure: But wee haue defaced thine image, wee haue cast off our first covering, we haue thrust our selues out of that pleasant place. Wee ran away from thee, and were not obedient vnto thy voyce: Wee were lost and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before wee came into this world: Our first parents sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst thee, and we sinned in them: They were corrupted, and wee are inheriters of their corruption: They were the parents of disobedience, and wee are by nature the children of wrath: Sinfull and vnhappie children, of sinfull and vnhappie parents? Thou mightest in thy displeasure after their fall haue

Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, O Lord, art thou in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And our miserie is <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>from our selues. But great was thy mercie vnto vs. Wee came into this world in a flood of vncleannesse, wallowing in our mothers blood; and thou didst set open a fountayne for vs to wash in: Wee were washed in the laver of baptisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wee haue returned with the swyne to our wallowing in the myre. Wee came from a place of darknesse into this world, we lived as children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee sat in darknesse, and in the shadow of death: Thou gavest vs thy word to bee a lanthorne vnto our feete, and a light vnto our paths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in thy light wee might see light; that so walking in the way of trueth, wee might attayne ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting lyfe: But wee haue loved darknesse more than light, &amp; haue not beene obedient vnto thy word. Wee came into this world crooked
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14199:56"/>
even from our mothers wombe; and thou gavest vs thy law to be a glasse wherein we might see our deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a rule whereby to square all our actions, words, &amp; thoughts: But wee haue shut our eyes that wee might not see, and wee haue refused to bee ruled by thy law: The law of sinne in our flesh doeth daylie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate vs. The roote of originall sinne which lyeth hidden in vs, doth everie day put foorth new branches: All the parts and faculties of our bodies and soules are so manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of vnrighteousnesse to fight agaynst thy divyne Majestie. Our hearts imagine wicked things, our mouthes vtter them, and our handes put them in practice. Thy mercies everie day are renewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and our sinnes are everie day multiplied agaynst thee: In the day of health and prosperitie we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee, and we never thinke vpon the day of sicknesse and adversitie. Thy benefits heaped vpon vs doe not allure vs to obey thee: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe thy judgements infflicted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14199:57"/>
vpon others make vs afrayde to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee. What couldest thou, O Lord, haue done more for vs, or what could wee haue done more agaynst thee? Thou didst send thy Sonne in the fulnesse of time to take our nature vpon him, to fulfill thy law for vs, and to bee crucified for our sinnes: Wee haue not followed the example of his holie lyfe, but haue everie day afresh crucified him by our sinnes. And now, O LORD, if wee shall become our own judges, we cannot but confesse that wee haue deserved everlasting torments in hell-fire. But there is mercie with thee O Lord: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will wee not despare. Our sins are manie in number: But thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are without number. The weyght of our sinnes is great: But the weyght of thy Sonnes crosse was greater. Our sinnes presse vs downe vnto hell: But thy mercie in Christ Iesus rayseth vs vp. By Satan wee are accused: But by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ wee are defended. By the law wee are convicted: But by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ wee are justified. By our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14199:57"/>
owne conscience wee are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But by Iesus Christ wee are absolued. In vs there is nothing but sinne, death, and damnation: In him there is treasured vp for vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. lyfe, and salvation. Wee are poore: Hee is our riches. Wee are naked: Hee is our covering. Wee are exposed to thy furie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing vs: Hee is the buckler of our defence, and our refuge: Hee is the rocke of our salvation, &amp; in him doe we trust: His wounds are the clefts of the rocke: Giue vs, we beseech thee, the wings of a Doue, that by faith wee may hide our selues in the clefts of this rocke, that thyne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger waxe not hote against vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume vs: Let not thy justice triumph in our confusion, but let thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie rejoyce in our salvation. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the sinfull course of our lyfe past, and guyde vs by thy holie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for the tyme to come: Amende what is amisse, increase all gifts and graces which thou hast alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die given, and giue vnto vs what thou best knowest to bee wanting.

whole Church; especially to that part thereof which thou hast committed vnto the protection of thy servant &amp; our Soveraigne King <hi>CHARLES:</hi> Grant that he may see it flowrishing in peace and prosperitie, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and practice of thy Gospell all the dayes of his lyfe; and after this lyfe ended, crowne him, wee beseech thee, with a crowne of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glorie. Let not the sceptre of this kingdome depart from his house, neyther let there bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a man of his Race to sit vpon his throne so long as the sunne and moone endureth. Of this thou hast giuen vs a pledge alreadie, in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the fruit of the Queens wombe. Let the Queene still bee lyke a fruitfull vyne: And let the Prince grow vp lyke a plant in thyne house. Let thy mercie bee extended to the Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Kings onelie sister, and her princelie issue. How long, Lord just and true, how long shall their enemies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, and say, There, there, so would wee haue it? It is tyme for thee to lay to thyne hand: for

Carrie them backe agayne into their owne countrey (if it may bee for thy glorie and their good) make them glad with the joy of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and let them rejoyce vnder their owne vynes. Wee returne home agayne, and beseech thee to bee gracious and mercifull to the Kings Councell, the Nobilitie, the Magistracie, the Ministerie, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and the Commonalitie.

with the sense of their sinnes, suffer them not to bee swallowed vp in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spare. Stand by those that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to depart out of this lyfe: When their eyes shall bee darkned in the agonie of doath, kindle in their hearts the light of saving fayth: when their eares shall bee stopt, let thy Spirit speake vnto them inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and comfort them: and when the house of their earthlie tabernacle shall bee dissolved, them Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their souls.
