         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

forward to shew
his courage in the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and difficult stratagems
of War, being incited by the
Example of his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
and General, who,
<pb facs="tcp:63381:3"/>
both in Sieges and Field-bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
hath given such glorious
proofs of his Courage and
Conduct, that the Valiant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
behold him without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and Cowards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Terrour. So those whom
<hi>APOLLO</hi> hath inspired to aim
at GLORY and not RICHES,
always endeavour eminently to
excel in things most difficult
or occult. The brightness of a
Genius, like the flame of a
Torch, shines most splendid in
the greatest obscurity; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

the most perspicatious have
been but Moles; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the List, against almost
all Naturalists and Physicians,
that I might imitate the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the Valiant Soldier,
whom the event shows, not to
be out-matcht by the greatest
danger. Right Noble Sir, I
will here prove to you and
the whole Republick of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
that it is not rashly and
Emperically that I have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
many persons by this
Sympathetick way of curing,
but by a method truly Noble
and Heroick. If I shall obtain
any Honour by this Doctrine
of Sympathy, I most humbly
<pb facs="tcp:63381:4"/>
dedicate it to your Honour;
if otherwise, I can offer this,
that they were always esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
praise-worthy, who brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fell in the engagement, tho
they could not obtain the

            <p>MAny Troops of Enemies attack
us on every side, yet if the
Combat were to be in the open Fields,
a man naturally of a brave constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
would defie all their Forces; but
because many times they make their
onset unawares, and creep in under
the name of friendship, and do their
mischief by little and little, it is not to
be admired, if Nature in its most

perfect state should in time fall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.
Man wants Air, Meat and
Drink, for his perservation. But
what inconveniences attend a bad
Air, if it be unwholsome, or offend in
its first qualities, or if by the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
influence of the Stars it breath
a contagion. How do Gluttony and
Drunkenness defile humane nature,
and destroy it? There is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in nature, that is happy in all
particulars: Every thing hath its
Honey and Poison, the one refreshes
us, the other injures us; but are not
mens own voluntary thoughts contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
something that tends to his ruin?
so that 'tis most true, that man does
himself the most mischief. Oh wtetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
condition of Man! who can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
against the incursions of so many
Enemies? There is scarcely a man to
be found, that in all respects is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
We derive an unequal strength
from our seminal beginning, the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
faults of Parents are implanted
<pb facs="tcp:63381:6"/>
into the Children, upon which account
whole Families are prone to some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
vices. Persons of the best consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
robust, and well proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
cannot boast of immunity from
decay, the best proportioned bodies are
liable to be infected with Malignant
Fevers, that universally rages, whose
virulence often makes great havock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. Therefore in this small
Treatise, I intend to shew how this may
be prevented by Sympathy, or Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
Cure. All Physicians, as well
Chymical as Galenical, have one and
the same design, the preservation of
health; and to this end to cure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;
but they have not all the
same methods, for the Chymist, from
meer experience only, ridicules the
fruitless endeavours of the Galenist.
The Galenists on the other side, observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how various events are, explode
the rash attempts of the Chymists,
and extol their own way, and are
mightily pufft up if they can predict
<pb facs="tcp:63381:7"/>
the events of Diseases. It is my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd
opinion, that nothing is more
safe in the cure of Diseases, than to
joyn experience with reason. Our
Reasons are to be sought for
from the examples of Nature, we
ought not to subvert the Nature of
things, by our reasonings and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and erroneous experience. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is best explained by Nature, not
to be overthrown by Reason, which
ought to be rejected if it is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the necessities of Nature. It is
a sort of Intellectual weakness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
sence for reason. Vpon which
account the Honourable Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> in
his experiments concerning the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
parts of Nitre, says, it ought to
be our utmost endeavour, if not in
all things, yet as far as our thoughts
can penetrate, to have such sentiments
that by expressing them, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
what our sences perceive, how
Nature herself is really discerned to
operate, and not to acquiesce in fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
<pb facs="tcp:63381:7"/>
notions, and explications of
things, all which rather create confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and wherein there is no true
knowledge, as an impartial Iudge will
by what is said hereafter soon
discern. When Men of curious
thoughts could not rest satisfied with
this secret and preposterous way of
explaining and curing diseases delivered
by the <hi>Moors,</hi> they received that
Ancient Physick of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and
<hi>Hermes,</hi> illustrated by the principles
of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or rather
of <hi>Hermes</hi> himself; in which Nature,
and her Rival, the Art of Chymistry,
lend assisting hands. And here <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus
Paracelsus,</hi> was the first
that broke the Ice, and his ingenious
restorer <hi>Johannes Baptista Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> and others
that followed, who were a glory to the
<hi>English</hi> Nation, Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,
Descartes,</hi> Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers
of sound Physick and natural
Philosophy, who have not only illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
<pb facs="tcp:63381:8"/>
but in many things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
in others have abridged and
better explained, and added very
many beneficial things, and adorned
them with noble medicaments, and by
this way of study have rouzed several
of the sluggish and lazy Physicians of our
age, from the old dull Physick, bringing
a great deal more light, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations
to former inventions by the
assistance of Chymistry, explaining
Nature by her self, and not by notions
conceived in the head only, or the
dreams of fancy, but by natural
experience well ordered and founded.
Whence it comes to pass, that now this
Art of Physick is inriched with a
vast stock of knowledge. The supream
dispenser of things did not suffer
the whole treasure of knowledge to be
exhausted in the Books of the Antients,
but hath reserv'd some discoveries for
ours and future ages. Neither will
the plea of Antiquity avail here, the
Old age of the World ought to be taken
<pb facs="tcp:63381:8"/>
for Antiquity, which is properly to
be said only of our times, and not
of the younger ages of the World, as
was that of the Antients; that age is
more antient and great with respect to
us, but with respect to the World itself
younger and less. Therefore as we
always expect greater knowledge and
more mature judgment from an old
man, than a youth, upon account of
his experience, from the abundance and
variety of things he hath seen, heard,
and consider'd of, for the same reason
much more should be expected from our
age, than from the times of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
being in a more adult age of
the World infinitely more full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
and observations. I have
trod in the path of the Antients, in
this little tract of Sympathy, and
have not in the least varied from them,
but paid them the greatest veneration,
only where I found them to dissent
from sound Reason and Experience.
I have composed this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<pb facs="tcp:63381:9"/>
with abundance of pleasure, in
which is contained not only the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of other Authors, but those
I have made and experienced myself,
by my practice in Physick, manifold use
of Medicines, and what I have learned
from Chymical observations; for by this
means I have found out many secrets
(to hint some few out of great many)
the manner of curing Madness, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
Epilepsy, Palsy, Dropsy,
intolerable Head-ach, and to disperse
Gouty pains in a very short time, and
that it shall not return suddenly or so
violently; by the Assistance of God, I
can perform these cures, which the fact
itself will testifie, if any person pleases
to make use of my advice. But let
others judge of this. As to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
in respect to this Treatise, I
beg no persons approbation, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to draw any to my party. The
Commonwealth of Learning ought to
be free, and every one to give his vote
according as Reason sways him. Let
<pb facs="tcp:63381:9"/>
all things be done for the love and
study of truth, as becomes Philosophers,
as becomes Physicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for me to have sown the Seeds, and
have cast them into the Earth, which
will either thrive or wither, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of the Ground, and
and the pleasure of God. So Reader, I
I commend thee to the Divine protection,
and my self to thy Favour and
Study.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63381:11"/>
same principles. The Scope of one is
Truth, of the other Health; Physick moves
upon this hinge only, as the sick mans
<hi>summum bonum,</hi> inregard there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Nature herself more worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after, nothing more profitable to
be improv'd, nothing more pleasant to
be known; but here is the Difficulty,
here's the Labour.</p>
            <p>§ 2. That it is in the power of any one
Man to finish and compleat this art, so
that nothing can be added to it, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
folly to imagine, but the greatest sign
of Rashness to attempt, in regard life is
short, and every art long. Before <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
his time they made use of only one
Medicine, as is well known. <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
was so famous in this art, that he excelled
all the Physicians of his time, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
if we consider the present state of
Physick, it is far to be preferred before
that of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>§ 3. There are a great many sorts of
Medicines which mightily improve the
whole art of Physick, all which were
unknown in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> time, by reason of
the negligence of Physicians in not enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
into the secrets of Nature, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Climates. For Rhubarb had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63381:11"/>
not yet purged bitter Choler, nor Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
the sowr juice of the Milt, nor Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
the sweet Phlegm, nor had Cassia,
Sugar or Manna filled the Apothecaries
boxes, or an infinite number of Herbs
of different species, and almost Myriads
of Flowers of various shapes and figures,
yet adorn'd the Botanist's Garden, and
pleasingly deceiv'd the eyes of Men.
We now abound in this Medicinal store
for the comfort and conveniency of the
sick, which we wanted in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his
time. All these lay buried through the
sloth of men, and therefore Physick could
not flourish so in those times as it doth
now, tho Antiquity boast of their <hi>Apollo,
Aesculapius, Machion, Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi>
These persons, if they could live again
in these times would find men far supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to them in experience, and more
praise-worthy, and suceeding ages will
have those that will far exceed all
that went before them. Every Art and
Science is infinite in regard it takes its
original from infinity (that is God) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the goodness of God it daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
and its knowledge is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.
We now well understand those
things which former ages could not find

out, and a great many more, by the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Art of Chymistry.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the necessity of the Art of Chymistry
in this method of Curing.</head>
            <p>§ 1. I Cannot imagine how it came to
pass, that so great a number of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
should fall into this Error and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to esteem Chymical Medicines to be
dangerous and destructive; Whether that
was occasioned by the preparation and
administration of some pretended Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
who prescribe and exhibit in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Distempers, a sort of precipitate
Mercury and liquid Antimony melted
into Glass; who all ought to be expell'd
the Chymical Schools, nay indeed, to
be totally excluded from Chymical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
into perpetual banishment, never to
be recalled. But if these aforesaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and an infinite number more,
as they come out of Natures hand are
destructive, they may be so prepared by
the art of Chymistry, as to be divested
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63381:12"/>
of that destructive faculty, and become
very benign Medicines, and even Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sams:
it is very true, and as manifest as
the day, that Nature produces nothing
perfect, and in all particulars compleat.
If therefore the blemishes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Nature may be corrected by
Art, what Art finishes is more perfect
than what Nature produces. for Art
hath evey thing that Nature has, for
it takes a perfect Nature from it; and
moreover in regard that perfection of
Nature hath something deficient,
Art removes and takes it away, and
that perfection which before lay obscure,
by its Natural imperfections and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,
after Art has cleared it from them,
seem then to be more perfect. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Medicines Nature produces, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are weak or strong, always
carry something connate with them,
that is contrary to the Nature of a
Medicine.</p>
            <p>§ 2. If therefore nothing Natural is
compleat in every particular, but wants.
Art to perfect it, or at least wants Art
to remove that which hinders and
retards perfection, that what, is perfect
may appear and exercise its powers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63381:13"/>
why then should not Chymical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
exceed all others; when beside<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the perfection which they claim from
Nature, by Chymistry they are cleared
from all things that would sully that
perfection, so that being discharged
from them, they seem more perfect, in
regard they retain nothing opposite
therefore I shall not be ashamed to prefer
the excellency of Chymical Medicines
on account of their purity, which by
the benefit of Chymistry, and by
the rules and laws of working by fire,
they claim to themselves, befores all other
Let then all those who imagine that
Chymical Medicines are destructive, lay
aside this opinion, for they are very mild
as Reason dictates, and if they will not
give credit to Reason, even Experience
it self will oblige them to alter their
sentiments.</p>

            <head type="sub">Concerning the influence of the Stars
and Heaven.</head>
            <p>§ 1. NOr is it to be passed by in silence,
whether in the preparation of
Chymical Medicines, regard ought to
be had to Heaven, and the influence of
the Planets. No Philosopher will deny
but that superior bodies act upon inferior;
what is seen by the eyes themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied. For we see every year
upon the Sun's return to us, Plants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
dead, fading and juiceless Trees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
and put on a green and juicy bark,
at that time more especially the Plants
and Trees abound with vital juice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the pores of the Earth being rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Power of the Sun, causes nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
more plentifully to ascend to the
roots of Plants and Trees. Nor do Plants
and Trees only feel the approach of the
Sun, but all Animals, for in the Spring
they are more excited to copulation than
at any other time, because their seed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63381:14"/>
then especially ferments, the animal
spirits being increased by the approach of
the Sun. Minerals are also much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the presence of the Sun, for they
grow more plentifully, and send forth
greater quantities of Mineral vapours in
the Spring than at other times, all things
then abound with radical juice, and
much more than at other seasons; whence
it cannot be denied, that Medicines ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
then are best, and so the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
likewise, for that pure that we look
for in the mixed, that it may be subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to Physick is most plentiful then;
this is evident in the preparation of the
Glass of Antimony, if the day be not
clear the Glass that is wrought off will be
more dusky, therefore the calcination and
melting must be repeated till it come to a
transparent and Violet colour, therefore
this vitrification ought to be performed
in clear weather, unless necessity require
otherwise, which is also to be observed in
melting the Regulus. I will also add, that
the celestial volatile Spirits which descend
from Heaven upon Earth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of mixture, are more copious,
and not only the Earth and Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with those Spirits, but the Air and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63381:14"/>
the whole concave of Heaven also;
whence it comes to pass whilst in mixt
the Vital parts are separated from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
like are joyned to like by Sympathy
and Love, and there grows a pure out
of the mixt, to be purified and prepared,
the wandering Spirits of Heaven which
wander every where being gathered to
it. But let this suffice in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preparation of Medicines.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Generally all things grow in the
Spring, but because mixt bodies are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and every one of them have their
different forms and proprieties, and
radical moistures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to some peculiar Celestial Sign,
which hath a Sympathy and kind of
connexion with that radical moisture,
by which the peculiar moisture of Mixt
grows and flourishes; if so be its Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sign shine above the Horizon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
the benign aspect of the Sun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in a just and exact Chymical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Mixts, regard must not only
be had to the Spring, but also the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and peculiar rising of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and Stars is to be considered, and
especially the rising and setting of these
Planets, who have a sympathy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63381:15"/>
connexion with the mixt to be
prepared.</p>
            <p>§ 3. For we have in our selves the
whole Firmament, with the Planets
and Stars, and as heat penetrates an
Iron Furnace, and the Sun-Glass, so do
the Stars Men with all their proprieties;
so that we may learn all natural things
from the starry Spirit of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Arthritick Gouty persons
bear testimony to this, who feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the change of the approaching sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
are made unwilling Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Astrologers by their pain. So
many sick persons are beforehand sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of future mutations in the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
and the Elements within Man
have a foreknowledge of the changes of
those without. The constellations of
Man and the Heavens are the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For the Heaven is twofold external, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

all the bodies of the Stars in Heaven of

               </gap>
self; and as that Spirit in the great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63381:15"/>
world doth particularly contain all Stars,
so the internal Heaven of Man, which
is an Olympick spirit, particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all Stars, and so invisible Man
is not only all Stars, but one and the
same altogether with the spirit of the
world; as whiteness in Snow. As
all things from within spring, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from what is invisible and occult,
so also visible corporeal substances come
from incorporeal, and spiritual out of
the Stars, and are the bodies of Stars,
and remain in Stars one in another.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The formation of things is in the
Stars, as Iron in the fancy of the Smith.
Hence it follows, that not only all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
but also all Vegetables, nay, even
Stones and Metals, and whatsoever
things exist are Nature, or indued with a
Starry Spirit, which is called Heaven or a
Star: the unseen workman from whom
proceeds the formation, figure and colour
of all things. From this proper and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Star, being the Sun of the Microcosm,
Man is generated, produced, coloured,
form'd, and govern'd; a Star is nothing but
aninsensible body, or living Spirit, without
Reason in Vegetabies, but in those indued
with life (as in Man) with Reason, and is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63381:16"/>
different according to the different forms of
things. But when we say all forms of
things proceeds from the Stars, that is not
to be understood of those visible live Coals
that sparkle in the Heaven, nor of the
invisible body of the Stars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but every ones proper Star; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the firmament above does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
virtues or secret powers into what
is specified below, as some conceit that
the Stars of the firmament do influence
Herbs and Trees, but 'tis nothing so.
Every Vegetable and Animal carries its
own Heaven and Star about itself, and
in itself. The superior Stars by their
motion thro the Zodiack raise up infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Vegetables, supply them with dew,
rain and wind, but don't influence their
internal Star, they do not furnish them
with smell, colour, or form, but all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from that occult workman their
interior Star, and not from without;
the external Stars do neither incline nor
necessitate man.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The Motion of the External
Firmament, with its Constellations, is
free and governed by nothing, so the
Motion in the Firmament and Stars in
the Microcosm (which is not perform'd
materially, but by the Spirits of bodies)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63381:16"/>
with its Constellations is also free, and
not in the least govern'd by the External
Firmament. All things are contain'd
in Man, and he carries all things in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he carries that whereof he was made
in himself, he was made of the World, and
the World he carries in himself, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by the World. The invisible body of
Man, from the breath of God, or which
continues to all future ages, is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Stars. Moreover, as the
first matter (which was confused Essence
without form) call'd by the Philosophers
the Mother of the World, or the Chaos)
was the seed of the great World, so the
Great World is the seed of Man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Man is the last most Excellent, and
most Noble Creature, because he hath
the parts of the Great World, and there
is nothing in the greater World which is
not really to be found in Man himself. All
things were created out of nothing. The
great World was the womb of <hi>Adam,</hi> so the
womb of the Woman that of all his Sons
is the Machine of the whole World.
The Son in all things is like his Parent.
If you know the Parent you know the
Son also. Therefore Man is the most to
be admired Extract and Kernel of the
four Elements, the chief and most fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63381:17"/>
Workmanship of God. Every
creature is truly the Example of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is the whole World, and is alone
intituled to this honour, to co-operate
and converse with them all. But I have
said enough on this subject, it is not my
design at this time to demostrate all things
from the foundation, what cognation a
Star hath with Inferior things, but to
prove some Sympathy and Combination,
as is sufficiently hinted before.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the different way of Curing.</head>
            <p>§ 1 I Now come to the method of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
diseases. This is done either
by Nature, by internal and external Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
or Sympatheticks. Diseases are
most principally cured by Nature, by
Art as she is Natures handmaid; by
the Physician as the Servant of Art by
remedies as they are applyed by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
by the direction of Art. But some
Diseases are subdued by Nature alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
others are cured by the co-operation of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63381:17"/>
the Physician. No person is preserv'd unless
Nature separates the Distemper. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dies unless Nature be overcome: for
Nature is active as well as passive in the
cure of Diseases, and those stand in need
of no Physician; but sometimes by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the stubbornness of the Disease,
Nature is obstructed and languishes,
then the Physician is forced to lend his
helping hand, and to finish and perfect
the lame and imperfect gifts of Nature,
by evacuating, digesting, and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating
assistances. Sometimes the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
goes beyond Nature, as in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Bones out of joynt, and closing
up wide gaping wounds, which Nature
cannot accomplish. When a Distemper
affects the whole Habit of the body, as
in an Hectick Fever, because there is
neither inclination nor aptitude, for the
parts to return to their natural state,
this cure cannot proceed from a Natural
intrinsick cause, that being perform'd
only by the unaffected parts; the cure
therefore of Habitual distempers require
the assistance of Physick, though the cure
cannot be perform'd by Physick only,
for the aformention'd Medicinal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
cannot be perfected but by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63381:18"/>
intervening help of Nature; for the
Setting of limbs out of joynt, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up wounds, is not perfected till
Nature strengthen the Joynt, and
breed new flesh; so also to the curing of
an Hectic Fever there must be a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the internal principle. Nature
and the Physician rectifie all those things
in our body that are repugnant to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for all Cures are perform'd either
by Nature, or her servant the Physician.
When diseases are cured by the help of
a Physician, they put him in mind of
his own duty, For a Physician is not
only a servant of Nature, but ought to
be a servant of Art also. As therefore
Nature moves primarily by its self alone,
when (without remedies) it overcomes,
digests and concocts distempers, and
drives out the cause, restoring the body
to its former state (but this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of Diseases that Nature cures
spontaneously) so Physick and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
are not the first movers, but by
the intervention of helps that are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the disease: but when Nature
succumbs, and hath not strength of it
self to rise, a Physician chosen by the
benignity of God, and one to whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63381:18"/>
all distempers are equal; for there
is such an one, who having attain'd to the
universal Medicine, or <hi>Panacea,</hi> amongst
many of the same kind, is now no more
a Servant, but an Interpreter, Ruler,
and absolute Master: for tis reported
that this universal art of curing was by
the Antients ascribed to some Physicians.
The School of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> laboured hard
after it, giving credit to his arrogance,
whilst he says; <hi>This universal Medicine is
invisible fire, devouring some distempers. This
cures the</hi> French <hi>Pox, Leprosie, Dropsie,
Cholick, Apoplexy, Cancer, Fistula, Schirre,
and all interior maladies.</hi> To which are
added many others. Besides, a Tincture
found out and prepared by <hi>Paracelsus</hi> is a
kind of universal Medicine amongst the
Physicians, which consumes all distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
just as Fire does Wood.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Besides this <hi>Panacea</hi> hath an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
virtue in curing all infirmities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all other Medicines, for it encreases
strength, preserves youth, keeps the
blood free from all putrefaction, purges
whatsoever is contained in the spirituous
parts, and preserves all the members of
the body. But it were to be wished that
what <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and others perhaps were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63381:19"/>
Masters of (although many very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Physicians do much question it)
were vouchsafed to us and others, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators
of the art of Physick, for by that
means we might perchance cure all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
with more expedition, safety and
pleasure. What great pains might we
save in searching to find out the place
affected, and prescribing fit Medicine
for the part aggrieved, the Sex and Age
and applying them at proper times, and
other things necessary to be observ'd in the
art of healing? it would then be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
only to know that the person was
sick, the Physician need not be sollicitor
after nicer inquiries: To what use would
it be to study Anatomy so exactly, to be

that there are a sort of Medicine<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as some preparations of Sulphur, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63381:19"/>
will by their sweet particles mightily
cherish the vital Spirits, yet this is not to
be supposed sufficient, and that Nature is
thereby so corroborated, that without
any other help and assistance it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all the ill that affects it. As the
vital Spirit is injured by many causes,
more Medicines than one will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to remove these many obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for it is impossible that this Spirit
shall be able to expell the Serum in a
Dropsie, or the foulness of the belly in
those troubled with the Iliack passion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Anti-hydropick and Purgative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines;
or dissolve the Stone in the Reins
or Bladder, or disperse arthritick nodes, but
by Medicines appropriated to that end.
Two instruments, are required for the
right performance of all corporeal actions;
one common, the other proper, the
common is the vital Spirit, the proper
some certain parts of the body. For
to a due digestion of the chyle the vital
Spirit is required, as the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
and a right and just consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Ventricle. There is a
diversity of proper instruments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diversity of Actions to
be performed, and to every part its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63381:20"/>
constitution, different from all the
rest. Hence what agrees to one agrees
not to another, and therefore there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found one Medicine to preserve
all particular constitutions, or correct all
errors. Nor will it avail to say, as fire,
consumes all sorts of wood, so this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
medicine, as an invisible fire
devours all distempers, for Elementary
fire does not destroy all things, but
those only that will burn and flame; it
offers no violence to Gold, Glass, or
Earth. But if this universal Medicine
should be allowed to be fire, how comes
it to pass that it should only destroy the
noxious humours, and leave the blood
and the other parts of the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Sympathy, Physically considered.</head>
            <p>§ 1. BUt before I proceed further, it
will be necessary that I should
treat more copiously of Physic, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick,
Magnetick or Diastatick Cure.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63381:20"/>
That part of the doctrine of Physick
which treats of the Sympathy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
of natural bodies is full of pleasure
and admiration. Sympathy is a mutual
and natural affection and combination
between natural things, arising from a
peculiar and occult cognation. From
which affection it proceeds, that one
body attracts another to it self, or being
joyned to it is wonderfully assisted either
in generation or nutrition, in increasing,
or producing certain powers. Others
call Sympathy a consent, when certain
things are joyned together by a mutual
marriage, as bound in a kind of league
one to the another. Therefore because
amongst all natural bodies, there is a
consent or dissent, confederacy or war,
we shall now treat of Sympathy and
Antipathy in general; that if we cannot
find one universal cause, we may make
some essays towards it. There are six de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Sympathy and Antipathy esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
amongst natural bodies. The first
is betwixt Metals and Precious Stones,
for example, between Coral and Gold,
who amicably conspire together to refresh
the heart. The other degree is between
Plants and Metals, as some report of an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63381:21"/>
Hazel twig sprit in two, by which
the Metallists discover Mines of Gold
and Silver, therefore they call it the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Rod, the power of which twig
encreases and strengthens mineral juices,
or those that are of a near nature to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
whose juices this Hazel switch sucks
with its roots out of the earth thrown
up in an heap, and thereby is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
nourished and strengthened.
They carry this Hazel rod at their
fingers ends, and to which part soever
the Rod shall seem to incline, there the
Miners presume there are Mineral Veins.
Some deny this virtue to be in the Hazel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but others as boldly assert it. The third
degree of Sympathy is reckoned between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Plants and the Sun; so the
<note n="*" place="margin">Sun-flower.</note> 
               <hi>Heliotrope</hi> and its species<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and also the <hi>Tragopodium</hi> turn
round with the Sun, so that at Sun rising
it turns its Flowers to the East, at Sun
setting towards the West. The fourth
degree of Sympathy is between Her<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
themselves, as between Rue and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
tree. <hi>Rue</hi> (says <hi>Johannes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> bark.</hi>
There is likewise a secret confederacy between Garlick
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63381:21"/>
Roses and Lillies, for the flowers of them
both will become more extraordinary
fragrant if Garlick be planted near them.
The Sea Squill makes every thing that is
sown near it thrive extreamly. All Pot-herbs
grow mightily if the Herb Rocket
be sown by them. The fifth degree is
between Plants and Animals. Many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it will tame a Bull to tye him to a
Fig tree. The sixth degree is between
Animals themselves, as between a Lizard
and a Man, for a Lizard, as if he were
fore warning a Man against the approach
of a Snake, will catch at him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
him to lick his spittle. This is true,
that a Lizard is a most inoffensive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to a Man (unless it be provoked) so
that a great many put them into their
bosoms without any harm. This is also
evident, that where ever Lizards are
there are no Snakes, one always avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the place where the other is. 'Tis
also manifest that the Lizzard mounts his
head when he sees a Man; and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that if he be sprinkled with
Mans spittle he seems mightily rejoyced
and solaced. So the Dolphin
also is <note n="*" place="margin">A Lover of Man.</note> φιλανθωπος, for in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

make use of Dolphins instead of
Dogs, who will also suffer themselves
to be beaten, if they have been out in
hunting. There is also a mutual love
between Storks and Partridges.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Antipathy is a natural enmity
and repugnancy of natural things, or
when things disagree from each other by
a mischievous secret discord, so the Lyon
trembles at the Cocks crowing, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
hates a Mouse, and cannot endure
the fodder wherein he hath seen one.
So the Snake cannot bear the very shade
of an Ash tree, and amongst Men very
often there is a secret natural abhorernce
of one another; to this disagreement
and Antipathy may be referred, that if
the murderer be present, blood will by
little and little begin to flow from the
wound or nostrils of a Corps lately slain.
They therefore are mistaken who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
this very thing to be attributed to
Sympathy; for the issuing out of the
blood is rather an argument of Revenge
than of Sympathy and Love. For what
Sympathy could there be between inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
enemies, hence also proceeds that
remarkable disagreement between Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and the Loadstone, for a Loadstone
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63381:22"/>
rubb'd with Garlick will not attract
Iron. The enmity between the Oak
and the Olive-tree is so great, that one
planted in the others place quickly dyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The like instances of Antipathy may be
observed in all kinds of Animals, but in
none so conspicuously evident as in Man.
Many swoon at seeing Apples or Pears
pared, others cannot endure the noise of
Cloath, some others can neither endure
to see nor eat Cheese, Butter, Onions, roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pig, Calves-heads; but all these are rather
to be referred to the imagination, as shall
be said in its proper place. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deserve to be laughed at, who seek
for the causes of these, and the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
in the apparent and natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Elements; of which sort
are those who reproachfully call occult
proprieties the refuge of ignorance.
There are a great many dull and lazy
genius's, who imagine that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
of natural bodies are occult,
and upon that account neglect the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Nature, or make no difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
occult proprieties or qualities,
neither exercise their understanding
in searching out the causes of those
occult Qualities, of whom probable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63381:23"/>
causes may be assigned. Of such it
may be justly said, that occult quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are the Asylum of dulness and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Nor is their opinion to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
who think that the exact
causes of natural powers can be nicely
demonstrated; when on the contrary
the Scripture says, many things are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be known, and inexplicable
to the nature of men, the causes of
many things are occult, and many of
the works of God remain hid. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the greatest searchers into nature have
acknowledged, amongst whom <hi>Pliny</hi> says
<hi>Many things are altogether concealed in the
Majesty of Nature. We must not enquire
after Reason</hi> (says he) <hi>but the pleasure of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
'Tis certain, there are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
such natural powers and qualities
in natural bodies, of which the causes
are concealed from us, and of which
we ought modestly to judge according
to natural knowledge, which could
never yet unfold all the causes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
powers. <hi>The cause is not to be enquired
after in every thing, it will be sufficient for
some things to demonstrate that they are.</hi> The
weakness of our understanding will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63381:23"/>
penetrate so far as to attain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of the powers of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
proprieties, which more or less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in the most minute things; whence
many very wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Authors have accounted
it a certain kind of reverence, not to be
more prying into those things than was
useful. For an over-scrupulous tracing
of many things, produces the greater
ignorance, and confounds the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that without all doubt we may
assert, that errors originally arose
partly from Ambition and Envy, and
partly from an over-greedy desire of
knowledge; but altho the reasons of
occult powers cannot be evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
from temperaments, yet it
is not to be doubted, but they proceed
from a peculiar and singular tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is called Ιδιοσυγκασια, 
from a substantial form proper to every
individual.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Ιδιοσυγκασια therefore is nothing,
but the proper temperature of every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body, for whilst the Elementary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
as well primary as secundary, are
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uited together, by a certain celestial

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irtue, for the Heaven terminates the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncretion of bodies, and affords them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63381:24"/>
an exact measure of vivifick light and heat
so that by the accession of celestial heat and
light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in mixing there is made a particular
coalition of the Elements, and so also of the
Elementary qualities, which corresponding
in proportion, and analogy to the forms
of bodies, produces those occult powers
or qualities. For example, bitter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
by an occult power cure drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as many by experience know. If
all these occult qualities proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the form, why would
not sweet Almonds have the same effect,
in regard sweet and bitter Almonds have
both the same specifick form? Therefore
in regard the cause cannot be found in
the form we must descend farther. And
first bitterness itself cannot be the cause,
in regard there are a great many other
bitter things, which have not the same
effect on drunkenness, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it. What is more bitter than
Aloes, and yet the bitter of
Aloes hath no influence that way.
Therefore we must have recourse to this
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or peculiar temperament
that is in bitter Almonds, in which the
Elementary qualities are reduced to a
certain singular proportion by celestial
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63381:24"/>
light and heat, that they may produce
such an effect.</p>

and Antipathy, under a
natural consideration, which was also
absolutely necessary, now we will
handle it Medicinally so far as it assists
us in the art of Physick.</p>
            <p>It is long ago since this way of cure
hath flourisht; some think that <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
Paracelsus</hi> was the restorer of it, others
attribute it to <hi>Parmenses Anshelmus</hi> an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and famous Magician. It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
called Magnetick, for as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
by a secret and occult power
attracts Iron, so and by a like occult
power a disease and a wound in a man
is healed. This art of healing Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
hath abundance of inveterate
Antagonists, and is miserably dilace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and mortally hated, by those that
should countenance and defend it. This
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63381:25"/>
is so difficult, that after the contemplation
of divine Mysteries, nothing is more noble.
This is truly the guide of Philosophizing,
in which it is lawful to pry into the secrets
of things, and easily become masters of
their Arcana's. This is an exercise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
good, wise and learned men,
and a noble pleasure to be desired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all others. And although in this
our Iron age, the number of Impostors
and Sophists abound, and a good man is
searce discerned amongst them, so that
those that endeavour to restore to
light this art of curing are not only
thought illiterate and obscure, but also
feel the effects of an almost universal
hatred. But let the enemies to this art
go on with their meer empty babbling,
who acquire nothing but ignorance, in
which they mightily solace themselves.
But the scribble of the ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or such
such like things, will not be capable of
destroying it, in regard it was confirm'd
and established long before <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>
Therefore they act very rashly, that
would ruin that, for the madness of a
few persons, which hath been confirmed
by long tract of time, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
cannot be accomplisht, in regard it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63381:25"/>
cannot be suppress'd by craft or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination.
In the mean time Let every
one enjoy his own method of study.
But my business is not in the least to
spend time in any further refuting of
these things; but for brevity sake refer
these unskilful persons to the writings
of the famous <hi>Tidicaeus, Goclenius, Fraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeus,
&amp;c.</hi> for whatsoever it wanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and can be thought of, is to be found
there, with submission to others judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and why shall we discredit such
excellent men, and rather depend on
some Sciolists, who out of a stubborn tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
argue that this art is vain and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and exclaim that it was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and obscurely delivered on no other
design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to exercise idle wits. Far be
it that we should imagine, that these
learned men would designedly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
any thing that was false to
future memory, who always industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
endeavoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by experience, and
as much as was possible by reasons, to
find out truth, and made reputation with
posterity their aim, which was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
with empty trifles, but from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and difficult things, built upon a
sure and solid foundation. To this may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63381:26"/>
be added the consent of diverse Nations:
for experiments of this Sympathetick or
Magnetick Cure (not only from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
but also from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> especially
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as also the <hi>Arabians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,
French</hi> and <hi>Germans, Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>English</hi>) are every day turned over by the
hands of the learned, who all with one
voice (although in different Languages)
assert this art of healing to be true and
natural, and not diabolical; of which
more hereafter. Indeed Ignorance it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is the mother of Admiration. For
who is it that proceeds in this art as he
ought? or who can inform, that wants
the foundation? Scarce one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of a thousand. What wonder
then is it that many have found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
frustrated of their designed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> end.
<hi>They are happy whom other mens misfortunes
make wary.</hi> Why should they not believe
the writings and most approved experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of such men, both antient and
modern, which say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Art doth not
deny us to use natural causes for the
production of natural and true effects?
Wherefore they are <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the
opinion of these learned men, who
affirm that all things that have life, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63381:26"/>
well Plants as Animals, do multiply by
a certain Spirit? (of which we have
treated before) who give no credit to
the consent of such great men, but ascribe
the effect of this cure not to Reason, but
rather to the Devil, and the vain trifling of
Magicians, than to God, and the power
of Nature. But I pray who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the opposers of Art? Those truly
who have but just smelt to these mens
writings, or never read Books but in
haste, just as the Dogs running drink
water out of the River <hi>Nile;</hi> who in
regard they understand not the nice
secrets of Nature, lay the blame of the
dulness of their apprehension on the
inquisitive Philosophick Physician and
Art. But what is more unjust than for
men to hate what they are ignorant of?
What is more rash than for an unskilful
man to pass his judgment upon any thing?
It was not without cause that the Poet
long ago said, <hi>Nothing is more unjust than
an unskilful man; who never thinks any
thing well done but what he does himself:</hi> as
if he had said Knowledge has no enemy
but the Ignorant. No truly wise man
ever denied this Art. Let them consider
these things, if it be an Art, how it is;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63381:27"/>
if not, how it is not; or let them wait
the time wherein God and Nature may
raise up some by whom Art may appear
more bright and conspicuous. And <hi>let
not the Shooomaker go beyond his Last:</hi> For
naturally the like Nature in its own like
Nature, hath a perpetual action and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and not different in <hi>Specie,</hi> much
less in <hi>Genere.</hi> For by how much the
diversity of things is greater, by so much
also the unity of things is greater.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Nature indeed disposes all things
<hi>in potentia,</hi> for Art as much as it can actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to perfect. Nature affords us the
matter of Glass, it never produces Glass
itself. Nature is the Mother, Art the
Daughter, where Nature ends, there
Art begins. And this is the order and
rule of truth; and no otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We
can make no certain judgment of those
things which are not evident to us; and
we ought to give a favourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of those things that seem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It is Wisdom therefore to suspend
our judgment concerning those things
of which we have no knowledge or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
rather than so bitterly to inveigh
against them, in regard the abuse of any
thing doth not take away the true use.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63381:27"/>
Amongst Artificers of different degrees
one must be more excellent than the
other. <hi>For Art doth not depend on the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
but the Artificer on Art.</hi> Therefore
it ought especially to be considered if
this method of cure be lawful, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be forbidden by any divine or
humane law; for that is the test of what
is lawful or unlawful. As for Holy
Writt I can find no Text either in the
Old or New Testament where Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
or Magnetical Cures are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
when yet the Divine Legislator
<hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates
a great many sins. But as to
the Civil Law, there cannot be shown
one little in the Digests, Books of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have any reference
to a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> prohibition of this way of Cure?
How many Hereticks hath Holy Writt?
How many Impostors in Physick, and
contentious Brawlers in the Law? But
the piety and probity of these disputes
is praise worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> are desired
to consider that the faults of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
are not to be imputed to the Art.
But, as the Lawyer says, <hi>Let not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

his own Deity. But by how much the

increases, by so much the more is the
love of it augmented.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Arguments of those that deny
Sympathetick Cure.</head>
            <p>§ 1. IF any person is sollicitous to know
the cause of Sympathetick or
Magnetick Cure, and especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sympathetick Unguent, I
will produce him various Authors both
for and against this subject, whose rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I will succinctly relate, and leave
every one to a free and undetermined
Judgment. And in the first place, there are
some who deny that there is any thing in
it: others opposing these, undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Magnetick Cure, and engaged as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63381:28"/>
warmly for their Sympathetick Powder
and Ointment, as for Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
The first, tho they allow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
to be all natural things, and
the way of composition to be void of all
suspicion, yet they say the cure itself
is without any Philosophical or Physical
foundation. For first, that cure is not
performed according to the Indications
necessary in curing distempers and
wounds: for in a Natural, Medicinal,
and Methodical Cure of diseases and
wounds, many indications, and they
different, occur, to all which a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
regard must be had, in a certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
according as the different times of
the diseases and wounds require; which
is not done here, for by one Remedy,
and by only one Unction, they pretend
indifferently to cure all different distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
Secondly here is no natural manner
of application for mutual touching,
whereby the power of the Medicine or
Unguent may be conveyed to the
affected part, as is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But here is none, for the Medicine
is not applied to the part affected, but
to water appropriated to a certain Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63381:29"/>
Medicine, and the Ointment
or Powder is rubb'd on the instrument
that gave the wound. Thirdly, here
can be no virtual action or touching.
It is true indeed, that there are various
occult proprieties in Nature, from
whence Sympathy and Antipathy take
their original; but in this Sympathetical
Cure, there is no evident reason of a
Virtual action. The Load-stone attracts
Iron, by an occult power, but not from
a too remote place, a just distance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
Plants are hurtful, mischievous,
and unlucky to one another, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are Animals; but no action is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
at a very remote distance, and that
Power cannot be diffused to immensity
and infinity; but when by the power of
Sympathetick Cure, only by the Urine
of sick persons, Sweat, Vomit, or Stool
shall be caused, by certain Sympathetick
Medicines, or when we use Water or
Sympathetick Powder prepared for the
closing up a wound in one travelling, or
absent twelve twenty or more miles, what
proportion of distance is here between
Agent and Patient? But if that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Magnetick and Balsamick Powder
be efficacious with things very distant,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63381:29"/>
it is objected, How I pray can such a
power proceed from a quantity of Urine,
clotted blood, and the purulent matter of
wounds? how can those Balsamick
Spirits pass thro so many heaps and folds
of intermediate matter, break thro a
Chest, have access to a remote languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
body, as also to a wound in a Bed,
perhaps and a Chamber close shut every
way? but if when the air is turbulent,
the Suns beams can scarce exert their
powers, and extend themselves to our
bodies, how will those travelling Spirits,
which are so easily agitated by rough
winds, reach the body and wound of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
hurt? but here is admitted no Vital
or Medicinal Spirits operating at great
distance.</p>
            <p>§ 3. In regard things of this kind do
not remain in Urine, Blood split, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
concrete matter, but vanish at the
first moment; for Urine vanishes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
as also Blood once cooled, can
no longer exercise any faculty pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to life. Fourthly, whether what is
performed be done not by the assistance
of any Medicine, but by the help of
Nature. We see that in wounds,
where Nature cures distempers, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63381:30"/>
endeavours and procures healing and
consolidation, especially if all obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are removed, and the wound be
carefully lookt after, which is done
by keeping it clean, and washing it
twice a day, with the Urine of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who will deny that consolidation
to proceed from Nature it self (to wit)
by the internal Balsam of Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
its healing. Dogs and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
often cure their own wounds by
licking of them; and why may not
something of this kind be expected from
Nature? In the Fifth place, No pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can proceed from the Spirit or Soul
of the world, which is accounted the
vehicle of this magnetick faculty; for a
non entity hath no affection, no action,
in the examination and confutation,
whereof let us consult other Authors.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Defence of Sympathetick Cure.</head>
            <p>§ 1. THere are others who oppose
these strenuously, undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63381:30"/>
the defence of Sympathetick cure.
<hi>Fracastorius, Goclenius, Tidicaeus, Freigius,
Helmont,</hi> &amp;c. are of opinion, that we
ought not altogether to disbelieve it,
in regard they have proved this
cure for so long a time, by the certain
experience and affirmation, not of vain
men, but of those most worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
they say the matter lies here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
probability and verisimilitude drawn
from the secrets of Philosophy, and the
testimony and approbation of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Philosophers can add any thing to
its reputation; they say the foundation
of the whole cure is that wunderful
and occult consent of natural things, as
the Loadstone, and whatsoever hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a Magnetick Nature, in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
Compass, in Sun-dyals or Clocks,
always and infallibly distinguishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Quarters of the world from the North.
So also, say they, the cure of bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
very far distant, without all
doubt may be performed by Medicines
that possess a Magnetick quality, by a
energy arising from thence. And in
regard that between agent and patient
there is required a kind of repassion,
they assert that something like it is to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63381:31"/>
be found here. Mans Urine impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Sympathetick Medicine, acts
upon its own body, which causes sweat,
vomitings, and stool, and without any
difficulty or detriment. Moreover, a
weapon sprinkled with humane blood
operates on the wound given, and the
wounded Flesh also operates on the
weapon, infusing something of it self
into it, and although that is so small,
that the degree of its alteration and
mutation cannot be perceived by us,
nevertheless it is so much that the
weapon hath contracted a certain cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
affinity and consent with the
wound; and so similitude, which is
not the same, is as it were the same.
From thence the Magnetick Oyntment
acting upon the whole, is as if it act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the wound, it being joyned in a
sort of affinity to the weapon. The
defenders of Magnetick cure endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to explain all these things better,
where amongst other things they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these. A Magnetick virtue is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
from the weapon anointed; to
the wound, by reason of the Cognation
and Continuation of Nature, which a
successive impulsion follows thro the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63381:31"/>
middle of the air, impregnated by the
universal and primary Spirit of the world,
with a Magnetick Vigour and Power.
There is a Balsamick Spirit in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent
(Mummy especially being in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
blood.) This is excited or rather
called forth for the producing a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
effect, by a like Spirit and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
to it, (to wit) by the universal
Spirit of the world. This Spirit, that
calls forth, directs and disposes bodies,
and tyes things to it self by a
mutual knot of Nature, is not <hi>every
Spirit,</hi> but a <hi>determinate</hi> one, to wit,
that which being present and touching,
causes the effect, and which failing, it
ceases. Therefore this motion must be
acknowledged the first cause in all Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick
cares let it be what it will.
This directs and brings the Sanative
power, sixt in the Spirit and Balsamick
Medicine, to the body and the wound
itself; for these are Sympathetick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and reciprocally desire each other;
and by reason of this occult yet natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
appetite, they conspire to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
effect; so that in the whole it
may be truly said, the Magnetick cure
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63381:32"/>
of diseases, as well as wounds, is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a meer transplanting of virtues,
which the appetite between the Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Spirit and the Spirit of the World
causes and perfects. That there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sympathy in this Cure is sufficiently
experienced; in which first is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
the subject or the matter in
which, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humane Blood, Urine,
Excrement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cause from which; the universal
Spirit of the world viewing all things.
Thirdly, the Instrumental cause, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Cure cannot be perfected,
which is the Medicine or Unguent sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetically
prepared.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Libavius</hi> allows no Sympathy, and
argues that it is only of natural things,
but Sympathy is a continuation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and its agreement: for although
the bodies of the Magnet and Iron are
at a distance, yet Nature is so continued
in them, that they agree together: and
why shall not we assert that there is a
kind of continuation, and therefore
Sympathy between Urine and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
the Wound and the Ointment,
as also Powder magnetically compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
But what that is, in what it consists,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63381:32"/>
and how it is performed, and what is its
cause, this is that which is to be
enquired into. There was never any
person yet that was so arrogant as to
pretend to demonstrate all these things
particularly. Yet we ought not to stand
still, but to endeavour a search after it,
as far as our understandings can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate.
Daily experience shews that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are Magnetically cured in the most
desperate diseases, sick persons being
absent, by exciting a great steam in
Urine, without any pain at heart, and
weakness in the head; and this I my
self have two hundred times experienced
by those that have been afflicted with an
inveterate Head-ach, Palsy, Running
Gout, Scurvy, Asthma, Hypochondriac
distempers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is certain and
no body in their right wits will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it, that by the help of Sweat almost
all distempers are curable, by transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with Vegetables, by the means
of Sulphur microcosmically prepared.
Much may be taken away from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisick
constitution by the help of Sweat,
and likewise much may be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it to other bodies, as is manifest
in those that have the Pox, Leprosie,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63381:33"/>
Itch and Plague. Howsoever it is done,
it is infallibly true, that by the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, men are cured after this
manner by Urine, and that Wounds are
healed, although at some miles distance.
To what purpose then is it to shut our eyes
against the light manifest of experience,
although we cannot trace out the true
and adequate causes, how these things
come to pass? The Magnet draws Iron,
and each are in a wonderful manner
mutually affected; but who yet hath
been found so ingenious, to discover the
true causes that produce that affection,
although many systems have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on that subject; the same thing ought
to be thought of Sympathetick cure, and
especially its Medicine, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
attribute it to a Diabolical art,
although it is very effectual beyond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or else we must call in question,
or altogether deny the truth of matter
of fact.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the false conjectures of those that
think this Art diabolical.</head>
            <p>§ 1. BUt we ought here by the way
to consider, whether the Devils
have any such power, as some attribute
to them in this Magnetick cure. The
power of the Devils is great and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
yet they could not so much
as enter into the Swine without divine
command or permission. Moreover,
there is no power granted them over
the will or understanding of man, but
only over the Senses and Fancy; it is
certain that they work great and stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
things without Man, not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by the motion of generation and
alteration, which is beyond their power
to effect, but only by local motion. So
they can cause Thunder, Lightning,
raise the Wind and Storms, and mix the
Elements together, but they cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
any thing that is peculiarly proper
to God. Therefore they cannot create
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63381:34"/>
new species, nor work real miracles,
but those that are such in shew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
only, which are called lying
signs, while they deceive the eyes by
their tricks, imposing upon the sight, and
stirring up false species in the fancy, or
doing such things as are produced by
natural causes, therefore they cannot
claim the name of Miracles. But pray
were there any that before <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
his time raised the dead, by incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Medicines only, or the power of
the Soul. Did <hi>Moses, Elias, Elisha,</hi> or
any other of the Prophets work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
They did indeed raise the dead, the
Elements obeyed them, but it was not by
any dexterity of art, not by their own
power. There was no Magical Impiety,
no Cabalistical Vanity, no Fantastical
Imaginations in these persons; but the
arm of God. Those things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or any other of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
who preceeded or followed <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
were either false or Diabolical,
but almost all of them are fabulous.
The Poets tell of <hi>Hypolitus,</hi> that being
dismembred, was brought back from
Hell, and restored to Life by <hi>Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius;</hi>
but this was either spoken Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63381:34"/>
or invented and feigned by
the Painters and Poets. To this we have
<hi>Plato</hi>'s testimony, who in his <hi>Cratylus</hi>
saith this is a fiction. <hi>Philostratus</hi> relates
that the Ghost of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that is, rather
the Devil, was raised by <hi>Apollonius,</hi>
which the Soothsayers at this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
But what are these but fabulous
and monstrous pretensions? Or if the
Heathens did any thing in Antient times,
that caused admiration they were lying
signs.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Those things, that the Devil
wrought by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians in
<hi>Moses</hi>'s time, were either the effect
of natural causes or meer trifling delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Of this kind were what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
admired in their Idols, Caves, and
Groves, amongst all of which there was
nothing that could properly deserve the
name of a miracle. We read in the 20th
Chap. Book 6. of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that Magick
was never more in vogue than in his
time, and <hi>Pliny</hi> says, <hi>There were never
more Magicians than in</hi> Nero's <hi>time, and</hi>
(he adds) <hi>never was their folly more
known;</hi> to wit, at that time, when <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
and many others were astonished
with wonder at the miracles of Christ;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63381:35"/>
then they say it was the Devil (if he
had any) exercised his utmost power,
by the Magicians, that by his works he
might eclipse the then flourishing
name of Christianity. But what was
then done by his Emissaries, that could
even affect the minds of the vulgar?
<hi>Iulian</hi> as much as he could cultivated
Natural and Diabolical Magick, that he
might imitate the works of Christ's
Disciples. But who did we hear he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to life? When do the winds obey
him? When did he cure the blind? Is
there any thing like this said to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the Modern Magicians, or
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who are continually turning
over the <hi>Cabala;</hi> or by others, who to
the disgrace of the Christian Religion,
are now maintained by great men?
What besides meer vain pretensions,
mock impostures, childish trifles, deceits
and cheats? Who therefore will believe
those that lived before <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his
time wrought such miracles. All these
things were done either by the assistance
and help of the Devil, or by natural
causes, and therefore not to be accounted
Miracles, or proceeding from incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Physick, or any faculty of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63381:35"/>
Soul: for example, to turn Water in
to Ice, to produce Rain, Hail and Snow,
or such like delusions. But to cure
Paralyticks, and other sick persons by a
word, to raise the Dead, to create new
substances, to make the Earth transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to the very Center, to change the
nature of Fire, is not the work of a
Creature but the Creator, who is the
Lord of Nature, and is not confined by
its Laws. Although <hi>Menecrates</hi> of old
successfully cured many of the Falling
Sickness, and never appeared in publick,
but like a Deity, cloathed like <hi>Iove</hi>
himself in Purple, with a Crown on his
head, carrying a Scepter in his hand,
and honoured like a God by those
he had cured, as one who if he pleased
could remove even <hi>Iove</hi> himself from
Heaven. Who is ignorant what the
Ghosts and such like follies of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
were? There are so many Absurdities
and Impieties in all these things, that
they deserve totally to be obliterated, to
say no worse of them.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Jews Cabalistical way of Curing.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Iews</hi> Cabalistical Cure is not to
be thought of without indignation,
being nothing but a pernicious superstition,
which by collecting, dividing and transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Words, Names, and Letters, dispersed
here and there in Scripture, according
to their own Fancy, and composing one
out of another, they frame members of
Sentences, Inductions, and Parables.
Thus they would adapt the oracles of
God to their own fictions, and by
wrestled accounts of Words, Syllables,
Letters, and Numbers, they endeavour
to bring forced proofs for their own
perfidiousness. And moreover, being
pufft up with these trifles, they brag,
that they have found out, and know the
ineffable mysteries of God, and secrets
beyond any things the Scripture hath
revealed, and blush not with the greatest
assurance to say, by these they can P'ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy,
heal, and work miracles. What
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63381:36"/>
can a perfidious <hi>Iew</hi> utter more impious
and blasphemous? These are their
wretched words, <hi>Moses</hi> received this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical
Art from God in the Mount,
which hath been successively dilivered
down to posterity, only by word of
mouth, like the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philosophy,
without any written remains. They
give out, that <hi>Moses</hi> by his knowledge
herein performed all those miracles that
Scripture records of him, his turning
the Rod into a Serpent, the Rivers into
Blood, and all those many calamities he
brought upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by help of this; by this art
<hi>Ioshua</hi> caused the Sun to stand still;
<hi>Elijah</hi> restored the blind to sight, and
called down Fire from Heaven. But
this is nothing but a vain and impious
fiction of men superstitiously desperate,
for they cannot attribute these, and the
other wonderful works of God, to the
Art and Industry of Man, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
and apparent sacriledge. The
Rabbins pretend, that the <hi>Cabala</hi> was
first communicated to <hi>Moses,</hi> and so
continued to the succeeding <hi>Iews,</hi> and
was not only known to those Prophets,
who are recorded in holy writ; but also
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63381:37"/>
to a great many more. It is manifest,
that neither <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> or any other of
the Prophets wrought any miracles, but
by the particular command of God.
What God did by them the Prophets
themselves cannot be said to have done,
either of their own proper motion, or by
any such Art; nay, they were not so much
as foreseen by them, as we have before
noted. For this cause <hi>Moses</hi> and the rest
of the Prophets after him, so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it, that they attribute all these
works to God. <hi>Thus saith he: The Lord
commanded this: The word of the Lord came
unto me, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly, if the Power of the
<hi>Cabala</hi> be so great, as the <hi>Iews</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
lye concerning it, how comes it
to pass then in regard they have culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
it so long, both in the present and
former ages, and are so very conversant
in it, that by its, assistance they have
performed nothing that can raise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
even in Children? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when <hi>Iosephus</hi> lib. 20. Chap. 6.
reports, that it was very common and
familiar in his time. But they never did
any thing, that can have the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to a Miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63381:37"/>
§ 2. I conclude therefore with other
learned men, that this whole matter is
nothing but a sort of Allegorical sport,
that idle persons imploying themselves
about particular Letters, Points, and
Numbers (which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue
very much admits of invented according
to their own pleasure. This wretched
<hi>Iewish</hi> progeny goes on further, and in
regard the miracles of) Christ, were so illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
and manifest, that they cannot
be denied, and yet they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him for the Messiah, and the
promised seed; they villanously some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
attribute them to Magick, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the <hi>Cabala,</hi> and utter such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
expressions against the Eternal Son,
that their very remembrance forces me
to silence. By these things which we
have toucht on by the way, it is easie to
perceive that this vain Superstition of
the <hi>Cabala</hi> was not abolished at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, as a great many Authors
assert, who have wrote on this subject.
But indeed those studies which now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
are nicely inquired into, and as
proudly bragged of not only by the Jews,
but also by a great many nominal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
prove that it is not extinct (as it is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63381:38"/>
to be wished it were) but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
(with grief be it spoken) it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more studied in any age. Thus you
see in short what is the Jews <hi>Cabala,</hi>
which many that are greedy of the
Jewish impiety swallow down. This
Cabalistical Art, as also Magick, chiefly
consists in words and characters. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
indeed, that anciently Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
and the names of Magicians were
held sacred. And I also know that this
specious name is now at this time given
by some to those wicked arts, by which
Satan endeavours to darken the glory of
God, and obstruct mans salvation. Not
only the thing it self, but also the name
of this art ought to be an abomination
to every good man; because there can
be no figure either in Wood or Stone,
or engraven in any other matter, which
in it self hath the power of acting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi>
figure is nothing but a certain situation,
and order of parts, from whence the
modification of quantity arises. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in regard quantity is not active by
it self, nor figure likewise, which is only
the <hi>modus</hi> of quantity, by necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
it cannot be the principle of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63381:38"/>
mation or action, nor can a Statue as
such, produce another Statue or quality.
Whence then proceeds that power and
efficacy that the Jews and Magicians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to words and characters? If it is
neither from God, Nature, or Art, it
must be from something else, to wit, the
Devil; who by these sort of stratagems
endeavours to entice miserable mortals
to pay devotion to him. Therefore the
practicers of such detestable arts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
punished with the utmost seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
both by the Laws of God and Men.
There was never any want of Natural
Remedies, but the fault lies generally in
our gross ignorance. As there are two
sorts of Physicians, one who cures mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously,
the other who cures natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Medicines; so there are two ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals
of distempers, one Natural, the
other from Heaven: The word of the
Lord heals those from Heaven, and
Natural distempers are cured by Natural
means.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Power of Imagination in Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
Cure.</head>
            <p>§ 1. THere are some who affirm, that
Sympathetick Cure is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so that the Fancy contributes very
much upon this occasion. I indeed
confess, that in imaginary distempers, the
fancy hath a great power, I mean the fancy
of the sick person, not of the Physician.
The reason is evident, because the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ought to be proportionable to the
Distempers, and if the malady, be imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the remedy ought also to be so. But who
can believe, that a Physician can cure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
distemper, whether it be Natural,
or Imaginary, by his own Fancy? The
Imagination of a Woman, hath no
power beyond her own body: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
active in the place where it predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates.
But if it be of any force, it is
most especially observable in the effects
it hath upon Infants, that Women are
big with, who by the power of a strong
imagination, are affected with many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63381:39"/>
strange accidents, by being so closely
united to their Mothers, with whom
they enjoy the same animal life; it is
not to admired if they have a joynt
suffering with them, and their tender
bodies are affected with the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
which their Mothers so strongly
conceive, especially since the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
proceeds from the Animal Faculty,
which rules in the formation of the
Foetus. Hence proceeds the different
figures, various Monsters, and for the
most part the affections that are in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
as Parents often tell us: for it is
common to all Animals in the heat of
coition to imprint that image they
strongly behold upon their seed. <hi>Iacob</hi>
well knew this when he so cunningly
found out a way to have his Sheep
speckled. This is the occasion of those
horrid worms which sometimes make a
noise in womens wombs as if they were
big with child. Strong Imagination al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
extreamly alters the Body: So in Fear
it contracts the Spirit, and in Joy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
it. These and a great many other
things are evident truths, which it is not
my purpose longer to insist on. How
this comes to pass, <hi>Suarez Metaph. Disp.
18. Sect. 8. Art. 25. tells us. Imagination
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63381:40"/>
moves the Body, at which motion the humour
and the vital Spirits which alter the Body, are
excited.</hi> Which cannot be said of any
but the own proper body of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
which works by Imagination: for
on the other side, it is impossible for any
body to be altered by the imagination
of another, because there was never one
instance yet brought that could but in
appearance seem to confirm it; as also
that it is not in the least consonant to
Reason, which says that Imagination is
an immanent act. The foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of using these secret Medicines on
any body consists in this, that you take
care to correct the humane blood very
well, either by increasing, or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; by that means you may perform
whatsoever you please, and free the
body of the decumbent committed to
your care, from Choler, Phlegm and
Melancholy; but by the assistance of
what Medicine this effect is to be
wrought, I shall at some time discover.
<hi>Galen</hi> says that good hope and confidence
are beyond Physick: For he cures most,
whom most repose trust in. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
have discovered curious and
wonderful things concerning the passions
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63381:40"/>
of the Soul, and the Physicians have
done so likewise.</p>
            <p>§ 2. What Medicine is there in the
world that heats, removes love, and
creates discord more than Anger? what
chills more than Fear? and comforts
and refreshes more than Joy? What
feeds and nourishes more than good
hopes? and what is more killing than
Despair? therefore there is a very great
secret mystery contained in the Passions
of man. If you seriously consider the
power of Imagination and the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul, you'll conclude that
nothing is more curious, more true, more
pleasant and secure than the effects of
a high exalted Imagination: how great
and how wonderful it is the light of
Nature manifestly shews, as well in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s
Rod, related by <hi>Moses,</hi> as in those
that are pregnant, who mark their Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
with the thing they long for, as was
said before. The Imagination or Fancy
of a man is a Loadstone, that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
beyond thousands of miles; nay, in
its exaltation it attracts to it self whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it pleases out of the four Elements.
But the Imagination hath no efficacy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it first draw to it self the thing thought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63381:41"/>
of by its attractive power, that it may
beget out of itself a Native Spirit, the
Architect of the Imagination; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Imagination, as if it were big,
makes an impression on it, which tho
like the wind it cannot be toucht, yet it
is corporeal. Moreover, the Fancy or
imaginative power of man, in respect of
its own nature, is Magnetick, in attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fancies of other men, as we see
by those that yawn. A strong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not only changes its own body, but
also that of another, by a certain virtue
which the similitude of the thing bears to
that to be changed, which a strong Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
moves, as is apparent in the
numness by gnashing of the Teeth, or
the rubbing of one piece of Iron against
another, which nums the Teeth. In
like manner yawning provokes yawning.
In these, and the aforementioned things
consist all the secret of Physick. And
now Physician set thy self about this
matter, and be vigilant, because you
have read that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> told the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
<hi>Be so much the more attentive to his
words, by how much the Teacher is concise:
for thereby he instructs you that you ought to
understand much of secret things, but to say,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63381:41"/>
or write little.</hi> Some seem in this to run
beyond their bounds, when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they can engrave the description of
the Stars upon Gems and Metals, but
this is very vain. Superstitious Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought never to cohabit with true
and solid Physick. For it is nothing else
but the Owl of the Devil, invented for
the catching of Souls; but Physick is
truly the gift of the great and good God,
for the comfort of humane life, by which
man is led to contemplate the goodness
of his Creator, and to observe the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
regard he takes of him, who by such
great store of Medicines hath provided
against the variety of calamities that are
incident to humane Nature.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Learned men are not ignorant,
when they cure by Signets or Charms,
that no virtues flow from them, but
only from the opinion of the Person.
But that opinion withdraws us from the
contemplation of the works of God, and
teaches us to disdain virtues created by
Almighty God, and ascribes Powers to
things, which they are not indued with,
neither by the supream Diety, Nature,
or Art. Wherefore the Author of lyes
here easily mixes his poison. I have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63381:42"/>
read of an old Woman, that was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afflicted with the Tooth-ach, who
earnestly desired a Student in Physick,
to give her a Medicinal Spell to hang
about her; he being ignorant what to do
in this matter, to avoid the old Womans
importunities, wrote in a small piece of
Paper, which he folded up in a piece of
fine Linnen, and hung it about her Neck:
the pain immediately ceased. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
she found her Teeth to ake again,
she made use again of this Charm, or
salutiferous Paper, and never without
success; at last meeting with a person
averse to these superstitions, he unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this mighty Charm, found this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
wrote in it, <hi>The Devil break your
Neck.</hi> What I pray could this sentence
successfully either act upon, or infuse
into the Imagination or Body? God
would have Physick accompanied with
Piety, and expects himself to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
and worshipped in the use
of it. Nevertheless, many things lye hid
in the bosom of Nature, not to be
apprehended by humane sence, which
although by reason of our ignorance
they seem superstitious and irrational
(because their causes are unknown to us),
yet are very far from being guilty of that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63381:42"/>
crime. We read of <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi>
that he was cured of a Quartane Ague,
by a great slaughter of his Enemies.
From whence many of Antients super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously
imagined, that a Quartane Ague
was curable only by Pollution. <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi>
was of this opinion. But this cure
of <hi>Fabius</hi> certainly happened by a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of joy, the squalid juice and Foeces
of the Quartane being mollified and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed,
and not in the least from pollution.
In the same manner I think that a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in it self, either by Faith or Credibility,
cannot effect any thing, but it causes a
sudden motion of the Spirits and Minds,
in very soft and tender Natures, by
which the blood is carried about by a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Flux, and at once removes the
Morbilick causes from the parts aggriev'd,
by which means the distemper ceases.
Here is no Superstition unless superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons create it, by attributing the
effect to other causes. So very often
there is a more occult virtue in those
Amulets that are hung about persons,
which growing hot by touching the
body, send forth atoms, and little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
and effluviums, when we perceive
them not, and infuse into us efficacious
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63381:43"/>
Antidotes, which we receive in at the
mouth and thro the skin. Learned Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
made use of these formerly out of
choice, when the Distemper was proof
against alteratives and purgatives, for
there is a congenite propriety of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and discord between some things,
by which they alter themselves without
any apparent touch, as Amber attracts
Straws, the Magnet Iron. <hi>Galen</hi> much
commended the power of Piony hung
up, and the thread wherewith a Viper
hath been strangled: He writes that
Wolfs Dung hung up is a remedy that
gives ease in the Cholick, he commends
the Jasper, <hi>Omphatites, &amp;c.</hi> for the same
virtue, so we use the liver of a Wolf, the
heart of a Hedge-hog, the lungs of a
Fox, the bone in the heart of a Deer,
Swallows, Frogs, the liver of a Goat,
Mans Skull, the flesh of a Cuckow, the
liver of a Kite, the ventricle of an Hen,
the little Hedge-sparrow. <hi>Trallianus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
many more such like to cure the
Falling Sickness, and ease the pain of the
Cholick: he gives ease in the Gout by
such sort of Medicines; by the same Art
he cures Quotidian and Quartan Agues,
and mitigates the raging pain of the Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:63381:43"/>
§ 4. I have by often experience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that the skin of Snakes being
applied to a womans belly in hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
causes her speedily to bring forth,
(this is to be understood when the Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
is come to maturity, and in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
state.) These and many other things
have a natural cause, and therefore may
be vindicated from Superstition. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times they used Charms-against
Hail and against Scalding. <hi>Caesar</hi> used
to secure himself a prosperous Journey
by thrice repeating a Charm. I do not
deny that tricks of the Devil had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
some efficacy, but I believe they
proceeded from a wicked Author. Our
Saviour hath taken away all that power
from him, and restored us Captives to
liberty. There is something due to
Verses, sweet Voices, and Tunes; the
internal commotions of the mind are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
by them: and the blood which
affects to run out of its due channel very
often, by this pleasant method is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from its exorbitant motion,
which is the cause of many dangerous
diseases; as we daily see happen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
disturbed with passion. Therefore
the Musician <hi>Damon</hi> being where a <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63381:44"/>
Piper was playing to some young
men that were drunk, and about to act
some mad pranks, bid him play a Dorick
tune, and they immediately desisted
from their rude enterprizes, because that
part of the irrational Soul that is subject
to the affections is incited and mitigated
by irrational motions. The Cure that is
performed by Cunning is equivalent to
all Magick can do, for it is a kind of
Stratagem in Physick. There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
person that thought he was nothing
but a Soul, and upon that account refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all food, because, said he, Souls eat
not. At last a faithful Physician got a
Table to be spread at midnight, and the
provisions being brought in by naked
men that he knew not, they sat down
with great silence. He asked them what
they were doing? One in a low mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
voice answered they were eating.
He presently asked what Countrymen
they were? answer was made, they
were Souls. But, says the sick man,
Souls eat not: Another answers, we eat
after our own manner, not as men do;
he leaping out of bed, said Pray let me
partake of your Banquet: This being said
he sits down and eats, and was cured of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63381:44"/>
his distemper. Another that supposed
he had so great a Nose that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him to go through any Gate, as
he was asleep an ingenious Physician
joyns an Oxes gut filled with blood to
his Nose; when he awoke he made
grievous complaints of the largeness of
his Nose; the Physician asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would permit him to cut it off?
extending both his hands, he earnestly
begs him to do it: The Physician cuts
the gut, and squeezing it hard, squirts
the blood into the sick mans eyes, and
so throws away the gut. He being struck
with this false imagination was freed
from his distemper. One that imagined
he lived without a Head, was cured by
putting Lead on his Head. A woman
that fancied she had Frogs in her Belly
was cured by giving her a purge, and
putting Frogs in her excrement. And
in this age some perswade melancholy
men that they are bewitched, and cure
them by Holy Water, who being sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
therewith are restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
health.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of some Observations and Examples in
this Magnetick Cure.</head>
            <p>§ 1. BY what hath been said before in
this short Treatise, although it
is not accurately handled, you may see
that those Battering Rams levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me are not able to overthrow my
design of Sympathetick Cure; but that
in this way of Cure I may still (make
use of Medicines out of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
but particularly out of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal)
with a safe Conscience, without
breach of Charity towards my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
infringing the Laws, or any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Superstition. That divine
harmony of Parts, by which Parts
and Members industriously concur to the
mutual assistance of each other when
affected, teach and perswade us to this:
for like are pleased with, and preserved
by their like. Parts taken from Brute
Animals are very often subservient to
the like parts of our bodies, and are more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63381:45"/>
particular medicinally assisting in this
Magnetick Cure beyond all others.
Thus the prepared brains of a Hare
much comfort and relieve our brains,
when they are discomposed, and out of
order. The famous <hi>Sennertus</hi> amongst
others. <hi>Lib. 1. prax.</hi> informs us, that the
lungs of a Fox or Calf are very sanative
to those troubled with the Ptysick, or
any other distemper of the Lungs; even
the very Women know that the Bone of a
Deersheart is a Soveraign Cordial, and that
Cordial Waters are prepared from it.
The Dispensatories tell us, that the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of an Hen is a specifick against the
weakness of the Ventricle. Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
say, the Liver of a Wolf cures all
distempers incident to the Liver. It is
very well known that the Pizzle of an
Hart is a great assistant to those that
have an imbecility in generation. But
we may expect better success from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
prepared from the parts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
body; in regard nothing can be
more consentaneous and agreeable to the
parts afflicted. The great lights of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
(those excellent friends to Nature)
understood this, and thought it neither
sin nor shame to prepare such sort of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63381:46"/>
Medicines, and to administer them to
the sick Sympathetically, or Magnetically.
I have followed these as my Guides, in
regard a Medicine may be had from a
mans own body. They are not prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from any part of the body but what
is the most contemptible part thereof;
and these are either from a living
or dead body: Those taken from a living
body, are either such as Nature designed
to be cut off, as the hair, beard and nails;
or those which proceed spontaneously
from it, as Excrements, or else those
which Nature drives out as superfluous,
as Spittle, Ear-Wax, Sweat, Milk, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
monthly courses, the Secundine,
the Navel-string, the Cawl, Urine, and the
Dung; to these may be added, Lice and
Worms; as also those things that may
be taken away without any hurt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
as the Seed, Blood and Stone.
Those taken from a dead body are, the
Skull, the moss of the Skull to which some
other things are put in to compose this
Sympathetical Unguent, the Skin, Fat,
Bones and Flesh; out of which the best
Medicines in this Sympathetick Cure
are compounded, which indeed are very
salutiferous and necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63381:46"/>
I will discover some Sympathetical
Medicines, which have often been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.
If a person be afflicted with a
constant Fever, and his Life is despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, where all other Medicines prove
ineffectual, then use this Magnetick
cure. Take the morning Urine of the
sick Person, and pour it into a Brass or
Iron Vessel, to this put the white and
yolk of an Egg, which mixing well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
let them boil, this done put 'em
into a pot, that you can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
stop so close, that no air can get
in; then put the Pot into an Ants nest,
digging the pit pretty deep. If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
is mortal, the sick man will
soon end his days, but if otherwise, after
a very severe fit, he'll immediately
find himself perfectly recovered. In
the most dangerous Consumption, boyl
a new laid Egg in the persons Urine,
and throw it into a Fish-pond, where
is plenty of Fish, and the Distemper will
gradually decrease: Or make Dough
with Meal and the Urine like a Cake,
bake it like Bread, and cast it to the
Fish and Dogs to be devoured, and the
Distemper will daily decrease. I have
cured those, that have been intolerably
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63381:47"/>
afflicted with the Head-ach, by putting
them into a great Sweat by the Urine,
without administring any Medicine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
although the persons have been
many miles distant, and this I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with good success, especially to
persons of the best Quality. I have cured
many persons, that were absent of a
raging tooth-ach, by mixing my Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick
liquor with some blood let
out of their gums. I have cured some
that were troubled with the bleeding at
the nose by the blood that fell from
their nostrils, sent to me in a glass or
earthen vessel well stopt, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 
opening a vein, or taking any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
inwardly. So I have healed up
wounds that have lain open a great
while, by my Magnetick liquor, though
the medicine never touch the wound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This Recipe is especially to be observed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and very worthy the taking notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Take Sulphur Vivum, Spirit of Wine

work wonderful things; to wit, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriors
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63381:47"/>
of that person whose ordure it
was will be mightily inflamed, and no
other part of his body, and although he
be many miles distant. This Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath undoubtedly a great effect on
the ordure of the person absent as well
as present; why may not sweat, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
stool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be caused in Man by
certain Medicines applied to the Urine?
There is no body will question, that
very great sweatings may be raised sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical
by the Urine. I am not the
only person that asserts it. I have the
Famous <hi>Engelbertus</hi> of <hi>Engelen</hi> a <hi>Maestriecht</hi>
Physician on my side, a person most
worthy to be believed, and most indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
studious, and exquisitely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Metals, whose singular art and
dexterity in transmutation all Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
admire and reverence; he hath
found out a Secret never sufficiently to be
admir'd; who, putting in Horse-shoe
nails one half into a liquor invented for
that purpose, immediately turns them
inro fine Silver: And what is more to
be observed, (he says) that those Nails
that were strait when they were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Philosophical liquor come out
crooked. This person, whose truth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63381:48"/>
and reputation are both very great, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
extols this way of curing by
Sympathy, because, being at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi>
by the assistance of Mr <hi>Reddeswitz</hi> (who
communicated this relation to me) he
had very great sweats caused sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
by his urine; insomuch that this
celebrated man, like another <hi>Aeson,</hi> was
restored to a new Nature.</p>
            <p>3. But if I am asked, whether this
way of Cure will succeed in all Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents?
I answer, as purges, vomits and
sudorificks, internally applied, for the
most part operate, but sometime have
no effect on several bodies, so experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells us, it sometimes happens in
curing by Sympathy.</p>
            <p>4. I might here offer a great many
more things of this nature, but it is
not expedient to divulge all together;
and if we should be more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in explaining and unfolding many
more things of this kind, our little Book
would encrease, and swell beyond what
we designed.</p>

            <p>§ 1. AMongst other things, which
render a Physician both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and beloved, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
is, that being sent for to the sick,
by prescribing Medicines according to
Art and Experience, he can accomplish
his desired end; which is to reduce the
Patient to an healthful state, by expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Distemper. For this reason,
the best Physick is most absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in the Cure of Madness, for
they that labour under this distemper
are afflicted both in body and mind.
Nature instructs us, that one man should
be subservient to another, whomsoever
he is, for this reason, only because he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63381:49"/>
is a man. All things are made remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
by their excellency; the Vine for
its fruitfulness; Wine for its fine taste;
the Hart for its swiftness. Is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
askt, Why labouring Cattel have
the strongest backs? Because the only
proper use to be made of them is to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
burdens. A quick scent is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary for a Dog to track his game,
swiftness to follow them, and courage
to seize and fasten on them. It is the
most commendable thing, for every one
to consider for what he was born. What
is Man's particular excellency? REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON.
'Tis by this he excels all other
creatures, who are irrational, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
are ignorant of its excellent
use; by this he imitates God. Perfect
Reason is therefore Mans <hi>Bonum Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
all other things he holds in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the Brutes. <hi>Musonius</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
what God was, says, <hi>Man only, of
all creatures that inhabit the Earth, is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God, and adorned with Godlike Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
for there is nothing to be found even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Gods themselves more excellent than
Prudence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Madness is a daily commotion of the mind,
arising from the fiery heat of the Spirits, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with Audacity and Fierceness, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Fever, or madness is when the function
of the principal Faculties of the Brain is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
accompanied with a raging passion, which
is void of a Fever, and proceeds from a fire that
heats the brain.</hi> I call it depraved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it divests a man of the use of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63381:50"/>
understanding and reason, hurrying
him on to vain thoughts, and absurd
discourse, and precipitating him to
wicked actions. I also added Anger,
to discriminate it from Melancholy,
which is attended with Fear, and all
things appear full of Sorrow; but here
an ungovernable rage rules, and that
not without an angry restlesness. They
err therefore that imagine all Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
to be Madness, for they do not
only differ in the bare symptoms, but
in the very essence. I subjoyned, that
Madness proceeds from the fire that
heats the brains, for the very essence
of this affection consists in heat, whose
off-springs are anger and tumultuous
rage, as cold is the cause of fear and
sorrow. Lastly, without a Fever, by
this it is distinguishable from a Phrensy.
This <hi>Aretaeus</hi> also testifies, who asserts it
in the whole to be a diuturnal alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mind free of a Fever. <hi>For,</hi>
says he, <hi>Wine inflames the mind, and by
Drunkenness makes men delirious, but this is
soon raised and soon over, but Rage is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
Although</hi> (says he) <hi>it may happen
that Madness may be attended with a Fever,
but yet it is none of its symptom; that is, it</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:63381:51"/>
doth not proceed from that particular distemper
of the brain, but was some former Fever; but
in a Phrensy it is secondary, and a symptom of
it: for the Fever follows the inflamation from
which the Phrensy arises.</p>

would here be understood to mean eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great delirium that is not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Fever; but without it, seizes
on a man, and turns him raving. But
we every day see this happens after a
different manner: for some Mad men
are fierce and bold, and fall upon every

prodigious strength, and do a great deal
of mischief unless they are chain'd fast;
which sort of Madness is properly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to the right use of their sences, yet
their minds are perplexed with various

these kinds very briefly. I have before

               <p>The person thus distempered is fierce,
unruly, of a cruel countenance, and

               <p>§ 4. <hi>Melancholy is a Delirium, without a
Fever, attended with fear and sorrow.</hi> In
this Definition <hi>Delirium</hi> is the <hi>Genus;</hi>
which is common to it with <hi>Phrensy</hi> and
Madness; but in the other parts it is
distinguisht from them, because Phrensy
hath a fever, and Madness is without
fear and sorrow. The part affected is
the brain, as is manifest by its imperfect
actions. The imagination is many ways
depraved, yet nevertheless so, <hi>That the
number of fools should be infinite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Wherefore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63381:52"/>
let the Physician consider, from what
humour of the body the Melancholy it
self had its original: if from a sanguine
humour, the signs of it are such as these;
redness in the face and eyes; heat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the parts near the head;
largeness and fulness of the Veins;
much laughter; which is one of the
principal signs, proving that Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeds by the adustion of the blood.
But if none of these signs appear, or
but remissly, show themselves together
with fury, fierceness and a raging
confidence, then we must conclude that
this Melancholy proceeds from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustion
of the Choler. But if neither
of these are perceived, but rather that
cold predominates in the whole body,
accompanied with fear and sorrow, the
complaints of that patient will soon
discover, that his Melancholy arises
from the adustion of the Natural Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
But it will not be useless, first
to shew the common signs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
descend to the particular. The
common signs are, fear, sorrow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and aversion to humane society.</p>

               <head>The Signs of Melancholy.</head>
               <p>§ 5. The conceits and imaginations
of Melancholy persons are very various.
Some have imagined themselves to be
earthen vessels; others that they were
brute Animals; others desire death, which
they very often procure for themselves;
and, which is very much to be wonder'd
at, at the same time are much terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
at and afraid of it. Some,
imitating of <hi>Democritus,</hi> always laugh;
others, like <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> are in perpetual
mourning. There are those also that
fancy themselves divinely inspired, and
believe they can predict things to come.
But it would be too tedious to recite all
their wild fancies in this short Treatise,
and much more too long to shew all
their causes; this being a thing of that
nature that is accounted amongst im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities;
but if any person pleases to
exercise himself in this contemplation,
he shall have my free leave for it; but
on this condition, that he Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
explain himself: for Example sake,
let him demonstrate that Dryness was
the cause that made the person believe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63381:53"/>
himself to be an earthen vessel, and that
Levity was that which induced another
to believe that he had no head, to cure
which an Hat of Lead was made use of,
the weight whereof soon made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that he was not headless. But
let us proceed to the particular marks:
Those persons whose whole constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are affected with Melancholy are
attended with these symptoms: they
are slender, lean, have broad Veins, are
hairy, nasty, rough, black, sometimes
red, but never yellow; then they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
melancholy in all circumstances,
either by reason of their own natural
constitution, or on account of want of
sleep, cares, anger, sorrow, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diet, which might burn up the
blood, and convert it to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
Hypocondriack Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is thus known; you'll first observe all
the symptoms of a bad stomach, <hi>Flatus,</hi>
gurgulations, crudities, acid belchings,
a dryness of the belly, and a levity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the belching, and that the
distempered person shall be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of all the uneasinesses that attend
the Hypocondriack. The reason of
this sorrow and fear is, the cloudiness of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63381:53"/>
the Brain and Animal Spirits, which of
their own nature ought to be clear. I
will demonstrate it by this example;
for if external darkness occasions fear
and sorrow, will not that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
more effectually cause them? But
perhaps you will say, are not fear and
sorrow passions of the Heart, why then
do you place their causes in the Brain?
I answer, The aforementioned passions
have their original from the opinion of
evil; but when the spirit is dark and
cloudy, it will deprave the imagination,
so as to raise in us an opinion of present
and future evil, and on this account it
affects us with fear and sorrow.</p>

               <head>The Cause of Madness.</head>
               <p>§ 6. As for what belongs to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Cause of these distractions,
there was never person yet that could
please himself, much less any body else.
The Antients were of opinion, that
Madness did proceed from an <hi>Idiopathia,</hi>
by an immoderate heat, the Brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnt by the Summer Sun, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
burning with extraordinary heat
being applied to the head, or by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63381:54"/>
excessive use of Spices and strong Wines
But this often arises from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity
of the Matter itself. And this
Matter is hot: for it is either the Blood,
Yellow Choler, or burnt putrid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
<hi>Fernelius</hi> asserts, that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
proceeds from hot blood. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is said to proceed from Choler, and
that for the most part burnt. When
heat without a Fever shall come to that
immoderate height that it shall burn
the juice, by which means rapid flames
are driven about; so, that what is fluid
in the juices, is converted into foul soot,
and burns the rest into black feces.
Hence arise foul spirits, and according
to the sierceness of the flame, so is the
raving more or less: for Choler, of
what sort soever it is, by its sharp power
doth inrage men. The provocations
of yellow burnt Choler are very sharp.
Wherefore in regard Madness doth arise
from the vicious juices, they can be no
other than biting juices; and of this
sort only are yellow and black Choler.
Neither can it come from Melancholy,
unless it is defiled with some putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or roasted by a sharpness, which
gives it a malignant acrimony. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63381:54"/>
Phlegm is not any way accessory
to it. Briefly then to run over these
matters, Madness owes its original, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from an intemperate heat of the
brain without matter, or from matter
extreamly burnt, that is, hot Blood,
yellow Choler roasted, or not duly boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or putrid or burnt Melancholy.
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> says that Madness rages most
in Autumn, and seizes upon a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
It may be answered, that it is for
this reason, that in Autumn that sharp
Choler is suppressed that grew in the
Dog days; but it corrupts by the power
of colder weather: for sometimes it
turns putrid without adustion, as is most
evident in a quartane Fever.</p>
               <p>Phrenzy, Madness, and Melancholy
differ, by reason they proceed from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
causes, as I have shewn before.
Thus they may be discriminated: A
Phrensy is attended with a vehement
Fever, and soon destroys a man, but
Madness is void of a Fever, and may
continue a long time. Melancholy is
different from both, being quiet, free
from raving pride, tho oftentimes it
may break out into Madness, and turns
fear into audacity. The matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63381:55"/>
is cold. I now proceed to the
common differences. It is indeed a
very great malady, but yet not incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though not without great hazard,
the least degree of Madness being very
unsafe. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and others attribute
the chief cause of Madness and Rage,
to certain Spirits in Nature that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
about, which he calls Phantasms;
and says that they are neither celestial,
nor infernal, yet invisible; and follow
men about like dogs, and insinuate
themselves into the minds of men of too
copious fancies, and make them distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We shall pass by these notions, in
regard they exceed our apprehension,
and would rather with others be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be ignorant of the real cause,
than to run the hazard of being mad
our selves, by endeavouring after enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
beyond our abilities. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
then, that something supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is the cause of Madness: for it is
impossible that by nature, an humane
body, for the most part consisting of
an icy substance, should endure the
most severe cold of the winter without
being frozen, or so much as growing
torpid; but Mad men are not affected
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63381:55"/>
with any such matter, but will lye along
day and night naked upon the coldest
Marble without any harm, and if you
touch them shall feel them warm; and
yet we see Animals that are accustomed
to the cold, and fortified against it with
thick hairy Skins or close Feathers, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure so much cold without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
but require warm Stables;
Birds either hide themselves, or retire
into warmer Countries; the wild beasts
hide themselves in Dens and Caves;
Water freezes into Ice, Bread, Eggs,
Apples, and Flesh freeze so very hard
that you cannot cut them, and nothing
hardly is proof against frost but igneous
Spirits, as Spirit of Wine, Nitre, Vitriol,
Salt, Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We also read in the
Evangelists of many distempers that
proceeded from Spirits, as that Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<hi>Mark</hi> 19. That was sorely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and falling often into the water
and fire, his distemper was occasioned
by a Spirit within him, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
calls a dumb and deaf Spirit, and
<hi>Luke</hi> 11. he cast a Spirit out of the dumb
man; <hi>Luke</hi> 13. mention is made of a
Woman that had a spirit of infirmity for
eighteen years, that had bowed her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63381:56"/>
down that she could not stand straight.
Why may not diseases proceed from
diverse Spirits now in our days, and so
be partakers of the same original. I
now go on to the Signs of the Causes.</p>
               <p>§ 7. From an intemperate heat, void
of matter; if this be the case, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
person will be like one drunk and
out of their wits, and the delirium will
be continual, without remission, and it
will encrease by little and little, so that
there will appear no evident cause that
occasioned it. If it proceed from yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Choler not burnt, it seizes all on a
sudden, attended with mighty brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
without sleep, and they ll be very
studious to do mischief; they are thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diligent: for the Choler is mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
There are many afflicted with
this sort of Madness. They are in a
continual restlesness, by reason of their
variety of opinions, occasioned by the
wandring images that are in their minds,
whence comes their rambling talk from
the swelling juice. They are watchful.
The worst sort of Madness proceeds
from yellow burnt Choler: These are
always prompt to cruel actions, full of
Pride, making a great noise, cruel and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63381:56"/>
rash: But if it proceed from Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defiled by putrid matter, not burnt,
they are angry, and break out into rage,
with tears and silence. But if from
burnt Melancholy, then they are very
angry, and will fall upon persons silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with cruel rage, and when once they
begin to talk, never leave off. These
are very mischievous, but not so raging
as those whose distemper proceeds from
Choler. After we have by these signs
discovered the Causes of Madness, let
us now shew by what Remedies it may
be relieved. And here indeed is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a Physician of sound judgment:
for Remedies ought speedily to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to these Madmen, lest the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
grow too obstinate.</p>

recommend my incomparable Drink

be cured of his Madness. After this
close up and heal the wound according
to art. But this method of Cure looks
more like an Executioner than an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

I administred some Narcotick Medicines
prepared of Opium, but without any
effect. Afterwards I gave her restoring
Medicines, evacuating Choler, and
comforting the Brain, and those furious
spirits began to diminish; then she took
my most successful Drink against Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for eight weeks. When she had
drank all the Drink, her Choler being
purged, and her Body strengthened, she

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63381:58"/>
years in his own family a person that was
reputed infallible for the cure of Madness.
<hi>Anno</hi> 94, upon account of some ill affairs
returning home he began to break every
thing that lay in his way, and look very
terribly upon all those he met in the
house; they secured him, for if he could
have got a Knife or Sword, he would
have murdered every body. His Wife
asked my advice, what was requisite to
be done in this affair: I ordered him
my Medicines, that have been often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
against this distemper. After
three months he began to be calm and
composed. And though he was not
entirely restored to the perfect use of his
Reason, yet he is now so well recovered,
that at this time he uses an Ax, Saw, a
Knife, and other instruments, without
hurting himself or any body else.</p>
               <p>§ 11. <hi>Michael Dollo,</hi> a young man of
twenty four years: Mad by name and
omen, being of a sanguine melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
temperament, was a Servant to the
most serene Princess of <hi>Waldeck;</hi> he was
delirious from his Childhood. At last, in
<hi>Iune</hi> 96, he imagined himself to be some
great Noble-man, afterwards a Prophet;
then followed a most deplorable Madness.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63381:59"/>
When he was in these fits, he was
forced to be chained Hand and Foot,
or else he had murdered himself and
those about him. By the command of
the Princess I administred Medicines
proper on this occasion. After he had
taken them for a Month in his common
Drink, he was so well as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained.
He lived very composed for
a year, and then died very quietly.</p>
               <p>§ 12. The same year one <hi>D. T.</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of fifty years old, living in the
New City of <hi>Culemburg,</hi> of a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Phlegmetick temper, a person o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
very honest and modest, was
much troubled with the palpitation of
the Heart, afterwards with a Syncope,
and at last with Madness. I was sent
for to him in that sad condition, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him from that misery. At first I
gave him Laxatives, because he was
bound, then I gave him my other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
in order. At last, after five
weeks, he recovered, and lives very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately,
does his business, but has not
so good a judgment as he had before.</p>
               <p>§ 13. In the year 1697, <hi>Mary Bouters,</hi>
of a Sanguine Phlegmetick temper, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
a diligent and Industrious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63381:59"/>
woman, falling very sick in <hi>May,</hi> at last
became Mad; other Physicians being
made use of before, I also was sent for.
After I had used my means, at five
weeks end she was very well, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
the right use of her reason as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to this very time.</p>
               <p>§ 14. In <hi>March 1698, D.</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> a very
worthy Gentlewoman in the County of
<hi>Waldeck,</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vehemently afflicted with
Madness for some months, so that four
strong men could scarcely hold her.
At the beginning of night I gave her
my resolving Tincture. After she had
taken the Tincture she was very quiet;
then I administred the other Medicines
according to order and prescription:
in a months time she took leave of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and now is, and always conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
free from any sign of Madness.</p>
               <p>§ 15. The same year in <hi>Iune, ANNA
CARLS,</hi> thirty six years old, had a most
excessive pain in her Head and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings,
by reason of the retention of
her Menstruums; in a months time she
fell melancholy, and that was followed
by Madness. The Magistrate of the
place considered what was best to be
done, and in regard she was a poor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63381:60"/>
woman, he sent for me to assist her.
This Madness in a short time by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
care was cured; in two months
time, by Gods blessing on the Medicines
she recovered, and now continues well
in the right use of her reason.</p>
               <p>In <hi>August 1698, Mary N.</hi> of a
Sanguine Phlegmetick temper, about
twenty four years old, coming off a
Journey, had a continual Fever, the
Fever ceasing, she was troubled with a
great pain in the head. She was mad
for some days, and upon that account
endured severe tortures, day and night,
she had a very stern countenance, and
was stark mad for four weeks. When
I was sent for to her, I gave her my
common medicines against Madness.
In a month she recovered, and is now
sound and strong, and every way in
her right sences. I have omitted a great
many examples of the curing of Madness,
that I might not seem long and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
to my Readers. So, friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
enjoy these at present, and in a
little time expect more: So farewel.</p>

               <head>Whether a Cure may be performed by Sympathy.</head>
               <p>IT would be time very ill spent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the causes of any thing,
whether intrinsecal or extrinsecal, before
we can demonstrate that the thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
doth really exist. Wherefore the
Learned being to treat of any Art or
Science, before they explain what it is,
and to what use it is subservient, have
always used first to examin into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
or possibility of its existence, so
that the existence being proved, it may
serve for a foundation for the subsequent
discourse. Which method we design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here to observe, do first assert, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63381:61"/>
in regard Sympathy is a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
affection, by which different things
concur to the same action, and tend to
accomplish the same end, so that the
patient doth freely admit of the action
of the Agent, and the Agent by the
proper impulse of its own Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
its action on a proper Patient,
there is no doubt but very many things
come to pass in the world, by the way
of sympathy.</p>
               <p>But to say nothing of the first, second,
and other qualities of the Elements, to
wit, of those the most secret reason
of whose actions is evident to our
eyes and understanding, and mutually
act and re-act, suffer and re-suffer, in
an apparent manner, it is the common
received opinion of almost all, that
those things are only said to act by
sympathy or antipathy, which have a
reciprocal communication, for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
mutual preservation or destruction,
by an occult reason and quality far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from those that are elementary,
which sort of action was therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
supposed to proceed from the
whole substance, and so to surpass hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
understanding. For the better
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63381:61"/>
treating of the Causes of Sympathy
and Antipathy, it will be necessary to
say something of the first qualities: and
to avoid confusion in a matter of this
difficulty, I will first shortly and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
lay down the opinions of the
most accurate Philosophers upon this
subject, that I may not longer detain
my candid Reader. And, 1. They say,
to find out all qualities in due order
and method, it will be necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in mixt bodies, the Substance it
self, the mode of the Substance, and
the Accidents. 2. They say, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is twofold Total, the very Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Entity itself, Partial, that is, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Form. 3. They say, Matter
may be considered as it is a pure pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
simply indifferent to receive all
Forms, or as it is the first Elementary
Matter, which is, Fiery, Airy, Watry,
and Earthy. 4. They say, the Mode
of Substance is twofold, one of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the whole Physical Entity,
as Subsistence, Existence and Union;
the other, they say, is the Mode of the
Substance of the first Matter only, not
as it is a pure Power, but as it is stampt
from the precise Elementary Form in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63381:62"/>
it. 5. They say, Accidents that arise
from mixt Bodies, some are produced
from the Form, as it is mixt, others
as it is living, others from the Form of
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither as mixt or living, but as it is
the Form of it specifically such.
6. They say, those things that are
produced from the Form as it is mixt,
are produced from it as it contains the
Elements virtually and eminently, as
the four first qualities, Heat, Cold,
Moisture, Dryness; and the second
qualities which proceed from their
intervention: Those that proceed from
Heat, are the qualities of opening, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying,
attenuating, separation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Those that proceed from Cold, are
thickning, repelling, condensing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Those that proceed from Moisture,
softning, and relaxation; and from
Dryness, hardning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. Accidents
that are produced from the Form, as it
is living, are the Faculties that operate
under some determinate degree of life,
either vegetative, sensitive, or rational.
8. Those that follow, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Form, neither as it is
mixt or living, but as it is specifically
such, are neither the first qualities, nor
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63381:62"/>
those that proceed from their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
nor Powers contained under
any determinate degree of life, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
every mixt and living thing would
possess them) as the Anti-epileptick
power in the Piony, the attraction of
Iron in the Magnet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But from
the force and power of the Form, as it
is precisely such; for the particular
Mode of a Substance, is specifically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Form to its due and
fit qualities, so that although the Form
doth give Form to the Matter accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to other Modes of Substance, it does
not produce in it such a quality, as is
evident in Rhubarb, whose smaller
parts have a laxative virtue, and the
thicker are restringent. Mastick in
one part is solutive, so some Animals
in one part carry Poison, in another an
Antidote. It is to be observed, that
the affections that proceed from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
that arises from the Form of a
thing, as it is specifically such are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
wonderful, because their cause
is not evident, as others are, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
because they work no change on
any external sense, as other affections
are determined by the whole Substance,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63381:63"/>
because they proceed from a Form to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
determined by the Matter, as the
Power of the Magnet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
occult; as if we were wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of their nature, but because they
are not perceived by the external sence.
These are indeed fine and specious
words, but stand upon a weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
fabulous Peripateticism; and if a
storm should attack them, they would
without doubt perish under their own
Rubbish. And sirst, supposing all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to be mixt, and to be composed of
a collection of the Elements, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the greatest violence to experience
and right reason, in regard Bodies,
which are supposed to be mixt, are
only the product of water impregnated
with ferment, as I have plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
before in the beginning of this
Treatise, by evident Examples. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
a Non-entity can have no passions,
how can qualities arise from the Form
of a mixt that no where exists; but
admitting this, how will those quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which they call the first, come by
their original, to wit, Heat, Cold,
Moisture, Dryness, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
immediately, as it were out of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63381:63"/>
the bosom of a mixt; for those quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
equally belong to all things, and
not only to the first Elements, as they
pretend, because all Bodies, and all Air,
Water and Earth, are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
heat or cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
remaining unchanged; nay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Fire itself may have greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
degrees of Heat, and the beams of
the Sun are in themselves wet and dry,
and receive it not from Fire. But the
reason of that consequence is, say they,
because mixts have those qualities as
they contain the Elements, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
as some assert, or virtually and
eminently, as others, which in mixts
are reduced into act, by the advention
of the form of the mixt; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if those qualities were called the
first, because they exist in the first Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the Elements; then also gravity
and levity, which are called moving
qualities, would also be first qualities,
because they are also in the Elements.
For gravity and levity are equally indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
with respect to heat or cold, and
many things are light or heavy, in
which not even potential heat or cold
can be perceived, but if gravlty and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63381:64"/>
levity did proceed from heat or cold,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> then those things would be lightest
that participated most of Fire, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof is manifested in red hot
Iron, heated Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because the
fire doth not make them in the least
lighter, and so the Earth should be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than Gold, Tin, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which according to their suppositions,
being mixt bodies, have more fire in
them, as was said before. Neither do
gravity and levity proceed from them
mediately, to wit, by the mediation
of rarity and density; for then Oyl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thicker would not be lighter than
Water, and oyly substances would not
swim upon the Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if
those first qualities (as they call them)
do not rise from those things which are
commonly called the Elements, from
whence will this suppositious Off-spring
of theirs deduce its pedigree, that is,
these second qualities, which they will
have to proceed from the intervention
of the first, which is impossible to prove,
although we should grant that heat and
cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the first qualities, and
do primarily exist in the first bodies.
For if they proceeded from the first
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63381:64"/>
qualities, we could by them give an
exact judgment of those first qualities,
which I will shew to be simply impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
by an example. We can give no
judgment concerning the first qualities
from colours; for almost all Herbs, tho
very different in their own natures,
are of a green colour. Whiteness is in
the cold Snow and hot Arsenick, also
in the Flower of a white Poppy,
and the Flower of Galangals, and
there is a milky juice in hot
Wood-spurge and in cold Succory
and Lettice. 2. Neither can we make
any judgment of the qualities from
taste; for bitter Opium cools, and
Camphire has a taste like hot Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the juice of Poppies, refrigerates
Acids, as Vinegar, Oyl of Sulphur, of
Vitriol, juice of Barberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> heat,
for they dissolve Coral, Stones, Pearls,
and Shells, and dissolution and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are the Actions of Heat. 3. Nor
can we make any better judgment of
these first qualities from Scents. For
first, man of all Animals has the worst
smell, and many things that smell strong
are cold, as Camphire, Opium, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many things that have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63381:65"/>
scent are hot, as Arsenick, Mercury,
Verdigrease, Cantharides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lastly, no
judgment can be given of the first
qualities, from thickness, softness, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
subtilty, dryness, lubricity, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,
and roughness; for there is none
of them that proceed more from cold
than heat, as is evident from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for many thick things are hot
and many cold, and so of the rest.
But also the qualities of the third rank,
which they call occult, cannot proceed
from the figuration of Matter, by
the form from the mixture of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
altho we should grant mixture,
the figure of the form of fire would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
produce heat, of water moisture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so they cannot any way produce
occult qualities; for they themselves
grant they do not proceed from the first
qualities; for example, The Anti-epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptical
virtue is in the Piony, because
its form is pre-determined from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
form of the Elements, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the form of the Earth, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from the mixture
of two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this cannot by
no means be from the reason before laid
down, to wit, the power of opening in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63381:65"/>
the thinner parts of Rhubarb, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of such parts, nor of binding in the
thicker parts, and in Mastick: for then
all close and thick things would lay just
claim to this propriety; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the thinner, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to experience. And forasmuch as
they say, that qualities are not called
occult, because they not sufficiently are
known to us, but because they are not
perceived by the external sences, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are, either Sight is not an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sence as well as Taste, or if it be, the
curve attraction of the Iron by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
which the sight clearly discerns,
is more occult than moisture in the
Water, or heat in the Fire, and
Sun which is perceived by the feeling.
And in regard no body yet was ever
capable to demonstrate, why Fire is
hot or Water moist, any more than
why the Magnet draws Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
then either all those qualities are
occult, or none. For if the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that are more intermediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to our sences, are not more known
than the occult, much less the second
that arise from them; besides, what
things soever flow from one and the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63381:66"/>
same principle, one of them cannot be
said to he more occult, and the other
less, but all those qualities proceed from
one and the same principle, therefore,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is nothing in what is
compounded, but Matter Form and
Ferment; but form is one and the same
in all things (Man only excepted) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
different qualities cannot proceed
from it: Matter is one and the same in
all, (to wit) Water, and for the same
reason cannot be the root and fountain
of so many diverse qualities; therefore
smells, tastes, colours, proportions, and
different figures proceed from ferment
as from their original; so also, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive,
repulsive, sympathetical and
antipathetical power proceed from it,
or from nothing; for Water, before it
was fermented, had neither taste, smell or
colour, nor endued with so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
proportions, nor purgative, delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or antidotal, cephalick, splene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
hepatick or arthritical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
according to the diversity of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to which it is united it is capable
of receiving myriads of signatures; by
this it becomes a Metal, in Gold yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
in Silver white, in Vermilion it
is red, in Vitriol green or blue: else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63381:66"/>
it becomes a Plant, in Rue of a
green colour, with a sad coloured
Flower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is bitter, with a nauseous
scent, and has a quality of expelling
poison, with an antipathy to Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts.
Then it is an animal in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantula,
of a dusky colour, like a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of an hurtful quality to man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but particularly to trace out how fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by sporting is capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
so many signatures and proprieties,
is not my present design. These things
therefore being premised, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the original of forms, which is
so obscure and unknown, that the
whole doctrine of Sympathy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
hath hitherto remained quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated,
but that truth may (if it be
possible) shine in these abstruse myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I have thought convenient to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all the most celebrated opinions, and
see which of them will best explain the
Phoenomena's of Nature, and at last to
lay down my own opinion concerning
Forms. The first then is, the opinion
of the Peripateticks, asserting, that
there is a substantial form in sensitives
and vegetables, which, with Matter,
doth make up the Compound. These
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63381:67"/>
Forms, they say, are immaterial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal,
and are not composed of
Matter, as an essential part; yet, that
they are material in as much as they
depend on Matter, <hi>in esse, fieri &amp; operari,</hi>
but they do not understand what they
say; for if they are material, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
either be subject to generation or
corruption; for Matter is neither ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither can they inform
Matter, for then the same thing would
inform itself; if immaterial, then they
will not be subject to corruption, and
consequently not to generation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be produced from nothing;
but Forms have nothing but Matter or
its accidents to arise from; but (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own confession) they do
not proceed from Matter a from an
essential part, therefore they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from its accidents, or from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but it cannot be from its acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
for then accidents would not
only produce a form but create it.
Moreover, form would not be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
in regard it was produc'd from
something else. They say the form is
produc'd from nothing of its own, not
nothing of its subject; but this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63381:67"/>
will not remove the difficulty, in
regard they will not allow it to be made
from a subject, that is, from Matter, as
an essential part, therefore it is yet es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
produced from nothing. If
the form were produced out of the
power of the matter, it either would
exist Matter, or not; not the latter,
(because as was said before) it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of nothing; if the former, its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
will be either physical or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical;
not physical, because Matter
is pure power, and a physical existence
is act: if it be only metaphysical,
as they distinguish, how would Form
receive a physical existence from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when no body doubts that it itself
hath none. Another opinion is, that
of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who in regard they
saw that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s opinion could not
well be defended, and substantial Forms
seeming unaccountable to them, denied
that there were any such thing, and had
recourse to Atoms for the constitution
and generation of a Natural Body, saying,
that there were two principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
Bodies, Atoms and Vacuum, the
existence of Atoms and the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of them, considering how much
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63381:68"/>
was added every hour to those things
which grow slowly, and how much
those things diminished which were in
a decaying state; as in the nourishment
of Vegetables and Animals, and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
decreasings; in the mean while
not observing that Branches, Leaves,
Flowers, Fruits and Seeds every year
become Trees, that if every thing were
exactly weighed, we must allow that
every hour they require several ounces
of nutriment. The same thing also
happens in the nourishment of Animals;
if the quantity of the meat and drink
that is received in be compared with
the excrement; (and besides the trunk
of Trees every year grows larger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> grow) those that
are of opinion that they require indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Atoms, and that the matter cannot
be performed any other way, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by the testimony of the sences,
in regard nothing, as was proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is required to the nutrition of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
besides water. Besides, they
say those Atoms are indivisible, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
of the same nature, on account
of the identity of their matter, whence
there can be no disparity. Besides,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63381:68"/>
they say, they are endued with magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
figure, gravity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
one is greater and heavier than another;
and that they have different figures, to
wit, spherical, cubical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a
very difficult matter to be believed. But
if it be enquired, how this can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
that they have different fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
in regard Atoms cannot be felt,
and that concrete bodies do receive fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and proportions from the forms by
ferment, as was said before, and not
from those Atoms that have no Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Lastly, they assert that Atoms,
which cannot be divided have no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum
in them, but that all concrete
Bodies, as they are harder or softer,
have more or less of Vacuity. For
they say, that Fire, Forms, Spirit, the
Souls of Brutes, the effluviums of the
Magnet, of Amber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made of
the flower of Matter, of more subtil A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
than other Bodies are compos'd of.
Hence it follows, that Bodies, by how
much the more compact and hard they
are, and have more matter, by so much
the more active they are: Spirits, forms,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> because they have much Vacuum
are less active, because a Vacuum is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63381:69"/>
and nothing cannot be attractive;
besides, the same thing would give a
form to itself, for rarity and density do
make no specifical difference, and if the
animal spirits in Brutes should perceive
all things (for they do not distinguish
them from the soul, and that from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament)
the like would be perceived
by it self, that is, the more subtile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
which are the Soul, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
other sensibles, and less subtile
Atoms. Lastly, they say that all things
are generated by the conjunction of
Atoms, and to be destroyed and ruined
by their separation; and that all the
propreties of Nature have their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and are explained by the various
ways of their agitation, conjunction,
separation and disposition, and are
moved by their own innate gravity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
general proprieties to them, to
wit, magnitude, figure, identity of
substance, gravity, and also specifical
proprieties, as are the different species
of Figures, smoothness, sharpness, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
roughness, bluntness, rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and these they say are congenite
proprieties, and exist in their subjects
as they are such. Then they adscribe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63381:69"/>
to 'em proprieties that inhere or may be
separated from their subjects, and only
inhere in 'em as they concur to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or corruption of concrets, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion,
position, connexion, order and
number. In the first place, I ask if mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
figure, and general and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
proprieties, as are the species of
Figures, round, oblong, orbicular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if they concur and are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will ever generate any other
qualities different from themselves? For
Magnitude, Gravity, different Figures,
as plainness, Angularity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
different dimensions, according
to longitude and latitude and profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
but will never produce Smells,
Tastes, Colours, or other qualities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifest or occult. For qualities ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
other qualities like themselves,
and no other, as heat in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can only produce heat; so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
pieces of Figures joyned or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
produce diversity of Figures, and
nothing else beside. This is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of some Physicians, that in every
Compound there is a Form, and that
it is distinguished according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of things. In such thick
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63381:70"/>
mists as this is, I ought (Candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
to use philosophical liberty, and
deliver my opinion amongst the rest,
for the confirmation of sympathetical
Cure, I must beg leave to repeat some
things about Ferment, namely, that
there is something always coevous and
concreated, that prepares Matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its last perfection by its union to
the Form, and is not produced out of
the power or dispositions of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and is neither created anew, or
can be annihilated of its own accord.
That I may not be without witness,
I will produce some Examples: The
Spittle of a Mad Dog being forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Flesh by biting, makes Men,
Oxen, Sheep, Dogs, Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> run
mad, and use the actions, and have the
qualities of Dogs, as biting, and fearing
the Water. So those that drink the
Blood, or eat the Brains of a Cat will
have their qualities. The sting of the
Tarantula will make both Men and
Brutes like Tarantula's, restless, and in
constant motion. Those that drink the
blood of wild Beasts will be of a savage
temper. The biting of an Asp, besides
other bad symptoms, will cause the a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticulations
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63381:70"/>
of that creature, as frequent
gaping, the turning of the body and
members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The flesh of lascivious
animals, as Sparrows. Sthinci, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
letchery in those that eat them.
These things being laid down, I say
first, When the sensitive soul of man
(for this venom doth not affect the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
and rational soul, at least not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately)
or a brute that happens to
be bit, wounded, or to eat, as is said
before, has the same operations as the
mad Dog, Tarantula, Cat, Asp, Wolf,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the vital operations are not
only changed, but the natural also, as
may be seen in the urine of those that
are afraid of water; we must either
own that they have two forms,
to wit, the form of a Dog, an Ox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or else that it is the soul of a Dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
from whence these operations proceed,
and so we must judge of the rest, or
else we must allow the operations of
the mad Dog do not proceed from his
form, but may equally proceed from
the form of the Ox, the Horse, the
Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We must also allow that the
form of the mad Dog is not in his spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor by that can be transplanted: We
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63381:71"/>
must own also, that Oxen, Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that are bitten have their own form;
and as the soul of the Dog is not in his
spittle, so neither is that of the Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula
in its poison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwise there
would be no need of seed, or diversity
of sexes for generation, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
although all things were <hi>Ex Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;</hi>
the natural consequence then is
(in regard the operations that are in the
Ox, Horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bit by the mad Dog
are altogether the same operations
of the mad Dog himself, (and so
of the other examples) that the soul
of the mad Dog, Tarantula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is
not capable of being transplanted by
biting or wounding; for if that were
possible, then there would be two souls
together at once in every part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and other absurdities; that the souls
of brutes are altogether the same, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they to be distinguished speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically
of themselves, and in their own
nature; but all the difference arises
from the accession of different ferments.
This is very evident in Vegetatives, for
wholsom herbs, if they grow near the
holes of Serpents, have the same
power as the Serpents poison; so Wine
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63381:71"/>
will have a laxative power from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and their forms shall remain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and unchanged: There may innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
examples be produced for the
distinction of ferments. Therefore fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
make the form of things very
ductile, and operations are diversified
according to the diversity of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus the Sun hardens mud, and
softens wax, and appears through a
window painted of diverse colours,
sometimes red, then blue, yellow, green
and black. But in regard in Animals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
and their effects, and in dry bones,
in all things and in all places in the world
where ferment is, there is a form. <hi>For there
is nothing so dead which doth not partake of
some sence of life, and consequently of form: nor
there any place of the world where the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the soul are not perceived, by vegetation,
nutrition, evident or obscure sence.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
then that nothing which seems to
be altogether dead acts, <hi>The Action doth
not wholly proceed from the ferment, but from
the form by ferment in matter.</hi> Whence it
follows, that there are as many degrees
of participation of form as there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of things that receive form, not that
form in it self hath any degrees, for it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63381:72"/>
no accident; but on account of the
greater or lesser perfection of things, as
they are disposed by ferments, its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
appear sometimes more bright,
sometimes more obscure; for all things
which for a long time are not altogether
destitute of their ferment, are in some
measure capable of form, as may be
observed in some things which seem
quite dead, yet they have real life, and
produce their like in specie, as Radishes
cut in little pieces and put into the
ground will yield Radishes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also
incontradictable experience tells us, that
those things have very strong sense and
imagination which seem dead. <hi>And in
regard every thing loves it self, and every part
affects to be joyned to its whole, that part of
ferment received in the Philtre,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>affects
to be joyned with man; whence it comes to
pass, that it carries away the soul of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
(as it were) so that the soul of both
operate the same way in two bodies, by reason
of one symbolizing ferment, and so have a
joint feeling.</hi> So the spirit of the blood
of any living person put into a Glass
hermetically sealed, will shew whether
the person whole bloud it was, is well
or ill, though he is very far distant, by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63381:72"/>
the alteration of the colour into dull,
livid, clear and red, in Fevers, Jaundice,
Melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So will Vegetables
and Minerals situated in their own
sphere, if their ferments are sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,
and do neither change or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
each other. <hi>Antipathy</hi> or Aversion
proceeds from the contrary, and is found
amongst those things whose ferments
are Assymbolical, and will bind up,
change or destroy each other, or differ
with respect to the places in which they
are made; or produce unlike effects.
And although those things which mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
destroy each other, and can have
no sympathetical fellow feeling, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
one another in the whole species;
yet individual particulars, which have
the greatest Antipathy, may be brought
to agree together by long custom, as is
evident in administring purgatives to
the brain of any person, for they will
cease to stir the humours, and become
common food. So, many persons, by
the constant use of Poison, can take it
without any prejudice; and Tygers,
Bears and Lyons, by frequently lapping
Womans Milk, grow mild and tame.
But this sort of Sympathy ceases with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63381:73"/>
that very individual, and is not further
communicated to the whole species;
but it is very probable that the Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and Antipathy which belongs to
all the individuals of a whole species,
proceed from the Ferments of places,
continually penetrating and affecting
each other before the production of
any individual. But let this suffice to be
said concerning the cause of Love and
Hatred amongst those things which act
by contraction of Matter, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of Virtue in a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.
We must make a further inquiry
into those things which act at a distance,
the scrutiny whereof hath hither to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled
the greatest Geniuses, calling it a
Magnetick Virtue, from its simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to the power of the Loadstone.
Some are of opinion, that it proceeds
from sound in a moment, equally pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
close Bodies. Others by the
emission of Effluviums; others say
it is a faculty influencing its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by irradiation; others by fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Extatically raised: And to conclude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
others from Atoms. I thought fit to set
down here the most celebrated opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the truth may appear more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63381:73"/>
evident, but because there has yet
been no true distinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Sympathy, Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and of both of them from Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
therefore I shall treat succinctly
of them. It is evident from all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Sympathy and Antipathy in its
different complications, they that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
act upon each other in different
ways, whether it be by assisting, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating,
attracting, driving away,
inclining, by aversion, destroying, and
changing; either have a determined
sphere of their actions, or have no
boundary between the Poles of the
World. Those, whose actions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
either operate at a certain
distance, as the Loadstone draws Iron,
Amber, and Mastick, Chaff, Straw and
Paper, and these things that delight in
each others Society as the water Lilly and
Butter flower Lizards and Men, or are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
to each other, as Coleworts and
the Vine, and so of the rest of that sort,
or else operate by touching each other
only, and those either externally touch
or else are internally applied, as Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Antidotes. Those whose
actions are not circumscribed by any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63381:74"/>
bounds, either being afflicted affects
the other, as in the example of Spirit,
or Salt of Blood, or of Wine growing
with that in the Vessel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or one
being affected the other is not, as the
Magnet and the Pole; so <hi>e contra,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Therefore all things that agree or disagree, do
not exert Sympathy or Antipathy properly so
called, nor can Sympathy be called Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
For altho the Magnet acts at a
distance, both as to its sphere and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of attraction, as Sympathy does,
yet are neither the Magnet or the Pole
affected with each others affections, as
was said before. Therefore also when
Sympathy and Antipathy are called by
the names of Love and Hatred, that
is only a mistake, and not strictly and
philosophically speaking. And this is
especially to be observed, that, <hi>that
Sympathy which acts at the greatest distance,
is always between the Parts and the whole,
Love and Hatred are not always so.</hi>
Lastly, briefly, to relate the difference
between Magnetism and Electricity,
Love and Hatred, Sympathy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
it is thus, Magnetism agrees with
Electricity, Love and Hatred, that it
acts within a certain sphere by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63381:74"/>
and repelling, and disagrees with
Electricity in this, that whatsoever
it draws or repels, it communicates to
it some of its own virtue, but Electricity
does not so. But those things that
love or hate one another amongst
vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> communicate their
virtues to each other mutually, either
by embracing, inclining, or aversion;
the power of the Magnet extends itself
only to Iron, and things composed of
Iron, and to another Magnet. Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Bodies want rubbing, to attract well,
but the Magnet, and those things that
act by love or hatred do not. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrical
Bodies also will not attract if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bodies be interposed, nor will those
Bodies that act by love or hatred. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Magnet hath not only its orb
of attraction by which it acts within a
certain sphere, but also its orb of virtue,
turning itself constantly towards the Pole,
let the distance be what it will. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
agrees with love and hatred, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
so called in this, that they alter
each other; and with the Magnet,
that they act at a distance, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
penetrate close bodies; neither are
they tied to the laws of Dimensions.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63381:75"/>
And, moreover, they have this peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to themselves, that one of them being
well or ill affected, by that with which
it agrees or disagrees, the other at a
distance is affected after the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Let this at present suffice to
have been said of Sympathy, Love and
Hatred, and Magnetism. We now
come to examine the opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acting at a distance. And, first,
some to find the cause thereof, say, that
in the exteriour part of Man, that is,
in the Blood and Spirits, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
extatick power, and this not in
Man only, but also in Brutes and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
and their parts, that wants to
be excited from death (in regard it is
sleepy) by an exalted imagination, a
vehement desire, or some such like art,
as in the sympathetical unguent, or
Powder an extatick virtue is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Blood spilt upon a stick by the
unguent, which drives away whatever
was hurtful from the lips of the wound
from whence the Blood proceeded, and
that this may be perform'd at a distance,
they say, that there does lye concealed
in the Universe, a certain Spirit which
they call the great <hi>Magnale,</hi> which is the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63381:75"/>
procurer, confederate, and assistant to
the actions of Sympathy and Antipathy,
and by whose means, Magnetism, as
in a vehicle, is conveyed to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
object, which they prove by the
Magnetism of the strings of two Lutes,
being tuned unisones, that one being
struck upon, the same string of the other
at a distance will vibrate, and the rest
be unmoved. But to confute this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
first, it is objected, that its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
suppose entities without any
necessity; for it is not necessary to the
production of such operators, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
such a Spirit different from Forms,
which they call their great <hi>Magnale,</hi>
And, moreover, it doth not agree with
their principles; for they deny that
there is a Soul of the World, or an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Form, in regard they say, that
all specifical distinction doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
proceed from Forms. Also they
assert, that Forms are Lights, and differ
in specie, and are new created in the
instant of Generation by the Father of
Lights, and again annihilated by
accidents; and although it should be
granted that there was such a Spirit, and
that it was the procurer of those actions,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63381:76"/>
it would be impossible for Vegetables,
irrational Animals, and their parts, to
send forth these imaginations to so
great a distance, although we should
grant that all things do live, and so
consequently do participate of some
sort of sence and fancy, in regard those
things which have a more apparent life,
as Animals, and those that have the use
of reason, cannot extend the power of
their fancy to so great a distance:
neither do they operate as such things
can so operate; for those things that
are endued with the most noble fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
must needs be most operative,
as is evident in the example of the
strings of an Instrument tuned unisones,
if this were performed by this Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
fancy, as they pretend, it would
be perceived at any distance, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
one was struck, the other unisone
string would move in any part of the
world, which is contrary to manifest
reason and experience, for it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
but within a certain distance;
and beyond that no motion is ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
but what is said of the fancy of
Animals and Vegetables, that convert
our fancy to be like theirs, as a Mad-dog
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63381:76"/>
the Tarantula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not infer any
thing of the Magnatism of the fancy to
very distant places; for in all these
things, is required either the contraction
of motion or virtue within a certain
sphere, but in the mean time it cannot
be denied, that if a mans fancy be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
taken up about a thing mightily
desired, although the thing may be at a
great distance, he shall have a sort of
view of it, as if it were present before
him, and be (as it were) transformed
into the thing desired; but there is no
person in his right wits will believe,
that a fancy extatically raised, shall be
carried thousands of leagues to the wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-for
object. And if we should grant
that an extatick fancy should be carried
to this distance, yet nevertheless it could
not operate by itself either on Friend
or Foe, by causing so many different
compassions as are performed sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically,
in regard all actions (besides
those that are proper to Souls) proceed
from Ferments. I should have said
more at this time, but that it is almost
the discourse of every one, that
fancy of itself doth transmute all things,
and upon this reason only I thought
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63381:77"/>
fit to say something briefly of its actions.
Others, to prove that there is this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at a distance, say, first, that all
Bodies send forth Beams, in which the
Soul acts by its own presence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
a power of acting to them,
and that these rays are corporeal, and
contain in them a portion of vital spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and upon that account live, and
that their life is the same with that of
the Animal whose excrements they
were; also that there is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation
of those rays at every distance
though never so great; the like also is
perform'd between the blood and any
other part of the body that is separated
from it at never so remote a distance.
But first we answer, if granting these
effluviums from blood, urine, sweat and
excrements, if they be corporeal, it is
impossible that they should have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation
at any distance; for if the
greatest body was rarify'd even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Atoms, it would not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to supply effluviums for a thousand
Leagues, and if it was allowed that
it would suffice, in regard they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them no vehicle, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63381:77"/>
miss of the right way, but if they
say, this concatenation proceeds from a
Soul, it must necessarily follow, that
there is a certain Soul which fills the
whole space from Pole to Pole; but
admitting that there were a Soul that
extended itself to all places, those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
effluviums could not accompany
it for the reason before alledged. We
also see that the Blood and Excrements
in a Glass or Box, are not diminished,
which would of necessity be, if they
were continually sending forth corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
effluviums, to so great a distance.
Again, when they assert, that Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have life, this indeed is true;
but what Naturalist will be so impious
to assert it has the same life with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,
to wit, that of a man endued
with a rational Soul. To demonstrate
these effluviums, they say, that Onions
and Garlick will force tears from the
Eyes at a good distance. Helebore,
Pepper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make sneezing Powder;
Saffron, Henbane, and Opium, will
cause sleep at a distance, and that a man
himself becomes much lighter by the
effluviums that proceed from him in
one night; and a great many instances
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63381:78"/>
of this kind; but this is not general,
for all these effluviums proceed in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
manner from Bodies that have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
heat, and those that abound with
watry moisture, caused by the heat of
the Sun or Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove, from Mercury and
Antimony by infusion, always impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their Menstruums, and losing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their weight for many years;
so likewise Musk, Civet, Benzoin, the
Magnet and others, send forth effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
and smells, but lose nothing of their
weight. But if this were so, they would
certainly be lighter by the emission of
these corpuscles, which is contrary to
experience; for by the accession of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ferments their virtue is weakned,
or it decays by time; but because they
lose nothing of their former quantities
and weight, it naturally follows, that
those effluviums are not corporeal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they are violently forced from them
by internal or external heat. But that
ferments in their own places, or in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
places they are, by their rays do
constitute a certain sphere, which sphere
is as extensive as any of their power can
be perceived, which rays are cloathed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63381:78"/>
either with vapours violently excited
from them, by the internal heat in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and in other things that want
heat by an external one, or with
others vapours raised from the earth:
but in regard these rays proceed from
other, which, from what hath been
said before, do not in the least send
forth any corporeal effluviums, as the
Load-stone, Amber, Garlick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when
they operate at a remote distance, it is
not in the least to be conceived to be
by the emission of corpuscles, because
they are not diminished, <hi>&amp;c. but only by
the fermentation of watry vapours raised in
the air,</hi> and so of others of this nature;
now in regard the emission of vapours
is a violent act, especially in those things
which are without heat, those that
practice by Sympathy and Antipathy do
observe that those effects do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
proceed from them. Such efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums
cannot be raised from the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are already separated from
the bodies of Animals, but by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heat; therefore such a concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot be in the Winter. <hi>And yet
the Winter doth not in the least hinder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Sympatheticks.</hi> The opinion of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63381:79"/>
the Atomists ought to be considered; but
in regard we have before largely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their principles, in our precedent
discourse of forms, it will not be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to repeat it. We have also refuted
their opinion, who hold that this sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical
power proceeds from the Stars
and Sun in the beginning of our Book;
where we have shewn that the matter
doth not in the least depend on them,
as they are endued with such and such
virtues; for the Earth, before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sun, contained in it self the
ferment of all Vegetables, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all powers. Seeing then that
Sympathy is not caused in remote places
from the fancy of things extatically
raised, nor from Atoms, nor from the
concatenation of corporeal effluviums,
or from a soul operating out of its own
proper body, nor from that infinite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that lay over the waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(with deference to others judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
to find out a way how that Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
or Compassion comes to pass,
seeing by innumerable examples it is
evident that it really exists. From what
has been said before it is very manifest
that every compound consists of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63381:79"/>
Form and Ferment; from Matter
it has its quantity and consistence, to
form it owes that it lives and is sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
more eminently or obscurely, as
was proved before; and all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of what nature soever proceed from
ferment, and also all mutations for good
or bad. Hence therefore it appears
that the blood and spirits in the veins of
a man, being affected with a Jaundice,
or Melancholy ferment, the spirits of
blood in the Glass hermetically sealed,
are also affected, changing the colour
into livid, yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and so we
must judge of other examples of this
nature) to wit, of Sweat, Excrements
and Urine; that their spirits are in a
like manner affected by the blood as the
ferment is, although at a great distance.
And in regard that ferment cannot can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be produced of it self within the
Glass so closed, it must necessarily be
carried thither, whence it is manifest
that Ferment penetrating the Glass her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically
sealed, is not tyed to the laws
of dimensions, which is also apparent
in the Magnets penetrating Marble,
Stones, Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is evident
by what is said before, that the forms
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63381:80"/>
of things in themselves do not differ in
specie, but <hi>in numero, (but that all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of things proceed from Ferments)</hi> and
that they are as it were the beams of
the universal Form, which we have
demonstrated. <hi>And those beams do meet
and are united in the center of the universal
Form.</hi> From hence it is manifest, that
the beams of Forms, both of the whole
and part that do sympathize, do meet
together, and are both alike affected,
(whether it be whole or part) for the
Form of the one of itself can thus
change the beams of the other, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
things do not alter themselves by
a Soul, but only by it live and are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
When the Ferment of one Form
(it being spiritual) is carried with the
beams of another affected at a distance,
that they may have private and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
intercourse, the one affects the
other, either with good or evil, the
whole drawing to itself the sickness of
the part, or the part that of the whole,
or communicating to it strength and
health, that was before communicated to
the other by another friend present, altho
both be not present, it is sufficient if it
be applied either to the whole or part.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63381:80"/>
The same must be said of Diseases con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by one Enemy to another. but
in regard nature herself may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
cured of all Diseases, the
Physician her Servant, (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
calls him) ought especially to be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to preserve her whole in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
that is, he ought to have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
regard, that those three things
which constitute innate Nature, to
wit, that the <hi>Humidum radicali, Spiritus insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>calor innatus,</hi> should agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a just union and proportion,
lest the fat moisture should grow desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
thro heat, and the heat should
extravagantly waste its <hi>Pabulum,</hi> and so
wrong the Spirits. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the <hi>Egyptians, Arabian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
and all the Tribe of Caballists,
made such diligent search after, and so
extolled that universal Medicine, which
by preserving the strength of Nature,
drives away all distempered affections.
so the Wonderful <hi>Atoth</hi> of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi>
the <hi>Lapis vivificus</hi> of <hi>Severinus Crollius</hi>
and others admirers of Chymistry. To
these may be added the learned precepts
of the Lord <hi>Verulum,</hi> laid down in his
Book of Life and Death. This makes it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63381:81"/>
clearly evident those are much mistaken,
that heap in so many single Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
into the Sympahetical Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or powder, believing that such a
virtue resides only in those Simples so
mixt together. For it is not upon the
account of the Ingredients that the
sympathetical powder or unguent ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
at a distance, for a Medicine is not
required, that of itself, or of its own
proper virtue, should operate at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but it is sufficient if it be of a
sanative virtue, although it be not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by its own wings. For a curing or
destructive virtue being applied to one
or other of those that sympathize, it
is carried by the beams of the spiritual
Forms, (as was said before) to its friend,
that he may participate of the joy or
sorrow, but that such friends or enemies
have such perception with joy or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is owing to the form, which only
endues things with sence (as we have
proved) but the cure, destruction, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or transmutation, proceeds from the
ferments carried with the form. Thus
in Fevers, Gout, Consumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if you mix a little of the sick persons
blood or urine with Dogs meat, the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63381:81"/>
Dogs will not contract the distemper,
nor will it be conveyed to them (as some
falsly imagine) for they are not capable
of having those distempers; but if the
distemper be cured (as it very often
happens to be) because part of the
morbifick ferment in the blood and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
is destroyed or bound, by
their stronger ferments, and so those
little affected particles of the morbifick
ferment being eat by the Dog, the whole
is affected, and so the sickness ceases.
So also when any Vegetable, or its seed
that is particularly a friend to Man, or
any member of him, and opposite to
his distemper is watred with the filth
of the distemper, and put into the
ground to grow, there also part of the
ferment is bound or destroyed, by their
ferments that overcome it, and so the
rest of the distemper in the Man is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;
but that this Herb so watered by
a mans morbifick ferment, being given
to a Man, or other Animal, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them with the the distemper, is
not only untrue, but impossible, unless
the morbific ferment, with which the
plant was watered, does change its
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>native nature in whole or part, into
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63381:82"/>
its destructive nature, as happens to
Sage infected by the breath of a Toad,
and to Plants that grow near Serpents
holes but if this were so, the power of
the distemper would encrease, which
otherwise is expelled. The curious
Reader may find many more wonderful
things resulting from transplantation:
I could bring a great many instances to
prove the truth of this Sympathetick
cure, but I have long enough exercised
the patience of my candid Reader,
wherefore for the present I shall omit
them; nevertheless, if any person of
this noble faculty shall desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of them, I shall be always very
ready to give him a private account of
them. I ought to have added to this
Treatise a more clear account of the
method of Sympathetick Cure, but by
the assistance of Almighty God I shall
have a further occasion of writing. I shall
conclude my discourse, by shewing my
worthy Readers that all this mystery pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceeds
from natural ways and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
altho the matter is performed by the
most subtile spirits. My opinion deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hereseems sufficiently to have shewn,
that we have no need to admit of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63381:82"/>
action of a distant agent in this way of
Cure or healing. I have described to
you the true way of each his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
by which some Medicines are
corporeally mixt, with this or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
subject. It is the sign of a
mean spirit, and the effect of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a dull understanding, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there is any Magick or Charm
in it, and to confine all the Actions of
Nature within the limits of our dull
sences, before we have sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the cause and principles upon
which our judgment ought to depend.
Neither will there be occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Oracle, either of an Angel or
Demon to resolve this difficulty. You
have here, friendly Reader, my senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sympathetick cure, forbear to
caluminate, for 'tis the sign of a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
and Effeminate person, to reproach
one absent. If you have a mind to
confute me, set about it, and disprove
this my sympathetical cure, by candid
Arguments, and not revile it with base
Language. Pray answer me, that I
may wash off the stain, I shall esteem
it an honour to be convinced by you,
in regard I am of an age as fit to learn
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63381:83"/>
in as to teach. I pretend to nothing
absolutely true, but probability. If I
have not handled the subject so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
as I should, be pleased to consider
that I endeavoured both to please and
profit. There perhaps will be some one
or other of a better Genius, who may
be pleased with what you ridicule,
may extol what you despise, and will
cite this out of <hi>Horace</hi> in my Favour.</p>

               <p>To prove the truth of this Sympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
cure beyond all doubt and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy,
we will here set down some of
its wonderful effects, in the following
cures, performed here at <hi>London</hi> in the
year 1699.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> I undertook
a Country Gentleman, one Mr <hi>N. W.</hi>
about 26 years of age, of a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Sanguine temperament, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a deep Melancholy, and was so bad
for 3 months together, that he voided
his Excrements without knowing it, by
the help of God in 14 days I so far
recovered him, that he made water and
went to stool as orderly as any man,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63381:83"/>
at last he grew perfectly well, by sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick
cure, so that in a short time
he returned home.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of <hi>Iune,</hi> one Mr <hi>Smith</hi> an
Upholsterer in St <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> of a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
phlegmatick complexion, about
56 years old, came to me, being so very
bad of the Gout, that he had kept his
Bed a long time; he had used all means
possible, and nothing proved effectual
to ease his pain, or open his Body,
which was so costive, that he had been
forced to purge twice a week. But as
soon as he entred into my method of
sympathetick cure, he found great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation
of his pain by sweating, and
went to stool every day without taking
any internal Medicine, having gone
on in my method for a fortnight, he
was so well, not only to rise, but walk
abroad about his Business, his Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
open after the cure; and I do
not hear he has felt any Gouty pains
since.</p>
               <p>On the third of <hi>Iune,</hi> I undertook
Captain <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Golden Square,</hi> 63 years
old, of a sanguine phlegmetick temper,
for many years he had been afflicted
with a shortness of breath, with sore
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63381:84"/>
pains, and much Flegm, that was so
deeply fixt, that it could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
He had also for 22 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
great pains in his Reins, and
made bloody water every day. He
was under my cure for eight weeks,
but presently felt some abatement of
the pain, and the tough Flegm began to
loosen, and he began to fetch his breath
with more ease, and before being often
obliged to take something to keep his
Body open, he now has 2 or 3 stools a-day,
and so continues. His bloody U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
is likewise altered, and tho he move
about, little or no blood comes from him
in his water, and the pain in his Reins is
quite gone, and God be thanked is well
in all respects; his appetite that was
gone, increased every day, and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
is good.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of <hi>Iune,</hi> Mr <hi>Iohn Meyer,</hi>
living in St. <hi>Katherines</hi> near the <hi>Tower,</hi>
came to me; he had so great a Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
that he could not turn his head,
and had intolerable pains both in hands
and feet; by my sympathetick cure in
a short time I so recovered him, that
his pains much abated, and he could
turn his head; and whereas before he
was not capable of <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ng abroad, now
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63381:84"/>
he is capable of going about his business:
and has been several times to visit me,
and to testifie the Cure.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> Collonel
<hi>T. Bremer,</hi> aged about 40, of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
sanguine temper, was very much
troubled with Ischiatick pains in both
hips; he had the advice of several learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Physicians, been at several Baths in
<hi>England,</hi> and drank all the waters, yet
could find no ease. He was resolved to
enter into my sympathetick way of cure,
and presently found some abatement
of the pain. He continced sweating
sympathetically for three weeks, and,
God be praised, is so well recovered as
to return to his Regiment in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22d of <hi>August</hi> I undertook
Brigadeer <hi>De Vilate,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel
of the Regiment of <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, who
had been 14 years troubled with a Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matism
and the Gout, which caused
much weakness in his feet. He had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the advice of several Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any effect; by my method of cure
he soon found benefit, and continuing
it for some weeks, his strength began
more and more to encrease. This was
performed by sweating and purging him
sympathetically.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:63381:85"/>
On the 4th of <hi>September</hi> a Servan
Maid of Sir <hi>Iohn Hubant</hi> in <hi>Soho-square,</hi>
who had been much afflicted with such
violent pains in her breast, that she could
not rest either night nor day, after I
had sympathetically sweated, purged,
and sometimes vomited her for some
weeks, her body was in good order
again.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of <hi>October</hi> I undertook one
of the Domesticks of the Lord Marquis
of <hi>Normanby,</hi> who was severely troubled
with a Rheumatism; after he had been
a fortnight under my sympathetick cure,
he recovered.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of <hi>November,</hi> one Mrs
<hi>Lagoe</hi> came to me; she had both the
Rheumatism and Scurvy, to such a degree,
that shewas not able to stir without a stick
in one of her Legs she had sores, running
with sharp humours. She was not only
sympathetically cured of her Diseases, but
also of her sores without other means.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> Mr <hi>Henry
Taylor,</hi> Brazier, at the corner of <hi>Princes
Street</hi> near <hi>Leicester Fields,</hi> came to me to be
cured, being very weak in his Stomach,
and troubled with a Rheumatism for a
long time; after a few weeks he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63381:85"/>
On the 1st of <hi>December,</hi> I undertook
the wife of Mr <hi>Williams,</hi> Dyer, at the
<hi>Queens-head and Star</hi> near <hi>Exeter Change,</hi>
who had a Bloody Flux; she had made
use of the advice of several able Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and finding no benefit, was cured
by sympathy, without purging, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or sweating.</p>
               <p>Several other cures might be added,
but to avoid tedious prolixity, let these
suffice.</p>
