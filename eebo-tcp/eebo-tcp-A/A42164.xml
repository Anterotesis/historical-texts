            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with thoſe fallacious Arguments; I thought
it my Duty to Anſwer them: That the World may
ſee the Malice and Rage of ſome Seditious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who, by loading the Duke with Scandalous
Aſperſions, endeavour to leſſen his eſteem with the
King: And, if that will not do, to brand his
Reputation in the opinion of the Credulous Multitude;
That they may the ſooner introduce their own <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes</hi>
into the <hi>Government;</hi> which are not more
fatal to the King, than Deſtructive to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>Therefore, kind Reader, beware, and think
not, whilſt theſe Stigmatize the Duke, they are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94457:3"/>
Innocent themſelves: 'Tis their Guilt makes them
endeavour to overthrow the Government; And, they
had rather ſee the Nation Ruined then themſelves

it when you will, Whoever ſhall go about to
Fortify the preſent Government againſt Faction, and
Rebellion, ſhall, by the Seditious, be reported to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce

Knowing, at the ſame time they do ſo, they win

And by this Device, commonly, they deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from that Puniſhment which they ought

               <p>This Act of 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. doth not reach
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> For, it was made (as
the Reaſoner well obſerves) to throw <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Recuſants</hi> out of all Offices, and Places of
Truſt: And, to diſplace them from the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,

Or, of His Royal Highneſs the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>York;</hi> which words, Or of His Royal

of his Perſon, and, that he is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the meaning of the aforeſaid <hi>Act.</hi> For
the words of the Act bear this Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> That no Perſon or Perſons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94457:5"/>
whatſoever, are intended to be in any place

               </p>
               <p>But, admit the Duke had taken the <hi>Teſt,</hi> as
in the <hi>Act</hi> mentioned, when he was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to do it: Had he not too officiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf, even in that point, that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
did not think convenient to oblige him?
Would not his Adverſaries have inſinuated into
the Vulgar, that what he did, was a force upon
him, and not his own inclination? Nay, what
ſhould he have gained in the opinion of the
People, by paſſing ſuch a Complement? Are
not many in the Houſe of Lords, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that do not humour them according to their
<hi>Capricio,</hi> called Recuſants? And, thoſe who
affect coming to <hi>Church,</hi> called <hi>Church-Papiſts?</hi>
By this, it is plain, the Duke did not lay
down his ſeveral great Offices becauſe he was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94457:6"/>
a Recuſant; Or, to avoid the puniſhment of
that Law againſt <hi>Papiſts;</hi> But for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>I perceive we are not like to want ſuch
Men as <hi>William Prynne</hi> to ſearch into Princes
Cabinets. God forgive them that do it: But,
if it fare with them as (in King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt's time) it did, with others, upon that
account; I ſhall not wonder: 'Tis prudence
in Princes to keep a correſpondence even, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their Enemies: Muſt therefore, their
Subjects quarrel their proceedings, that know
not what it tends to? A Civil Behaviour or
Complement is the leaſt that is due to the
<hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pope:</hi> We are obliged to Trade in
thoſe Countries: Yet, we cannot, with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Security, without a Correſpondence:
Neither can any Foreign War be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
without Allyances: And, who are
more proper to tranſact ſuch Affairs, than
prime Miniſters of State? Thoſe are to be
wondred at, who call the Duke <hi>Papiſt:</hi>
When the Reaſons they give for it, are no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94457:9"/>
more to be valued, than the <hi>Rheume</hi> that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
from the <hi>Popes</hi> Eyes, when he read the
pretended Letters: The <hi>Pope</hi> might, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
weep, when he heard the Duke was
a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> It being ſuch a report as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
ruined the <hi>Romanists</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> And
brought our moſt Proteſtant King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt to the Block: And, under ſuch another
pretence againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> probably, the Duke
may Suffer, though no <hi>Papist:</hi> The <hi>Pope's</hi>
Joy, may be great, for the Fall of <hi>Charles,</hi>
and <hi>James,</hi> But his Tears are for his <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;</hi>
who are many times obnoxious to the
Law, but muſt alwayes be the Sacrifice to the
unhallowed Fury of Faction, and Fanaticiſm.
In Fine, it is ſtrongly to be believed, that
thoſe who will not relinquiſh their Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Wayes; and, groſs Lying: Will not,
at laſt, ſtick at Perjury, and Subornation:
And therefore, no wonder if ſuch ſimple
Pamphlets of <hi>Briefs, Beads,</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi>
and ſuch Stuff, is part of the Dukes Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>

               <p>It is affirmed, in this fifth Reaſon, That

               <p>The <hi>Reaſoner</hi> would do well to conſider
that, (according to the meaſures himſelf has
taken) a man may have been of <hi>ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions:</hi>
And, after that, be a true <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But, ſince all the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94457:11"/>
foregoing Reaſons to prove the <hi>Duke</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi>
are only Sophiſtical, Malitious, and Spiteful,
the <hi>Reaſoners</hi> Witneſſes to make good his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
and laſt Argument, <hi>are</hi> not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
For, admit the <hi>Duke</hi> had been at
<hi>Maſs,</hi> &amp;c. If they be honeſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> 'tis not
to be thought they would inform againſt the
<hi>Duke:</hi> If they are falſe <hi>Knaves,</hi> they ought
not to be <hi>Credible</hi> Witneſſes: Beſides, there
is ſomething to be ſaid for <hi>Curioſity:</hi> The
Duke, as other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> may have been
at a <hi>Quakers,</hi> Or, other <hi>Fanatick Meeting,</hi>
or at <hi>Maſs;</hi> muſt this, therefore render him
ſuſpected to be of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Opinion? No,
I rather think, that thoſe who are true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
by hearing, and obſerving the <hi>Errours</hi> of the
<hi>One,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Other,</hi> are <hi>better</hi>
confirmed in our Proteſtant Doctrine: And,
further, this Argument is to be looked upon
as moſt fallacious: For, if the <hi>Reaſoner</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to prove the Duke to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> by
his Witneſs that he has ready to produce:
Yet, he may, by the ſame Evidence, prove
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94457:12"/>
him to be a Member of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
allowing, only, Our <hi>Liturgy</hi> to be
the <hi>Engliſh Maſs,</hi> which, to the hot headed
<hi>Phanatick</hi> ſeems to be as Criminal and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
as the <hi>other,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Reaſoner</hi>
ſeems to aim at nothing elſe, but to make the
Duke declare Himſelf: And therefore, he
will call Him <hi>Papist,</hi> or what he pleaſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than be ignorant of what he ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſires to know: And, probably he is ſo
inquiſitive, becauſe he would ſuit his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
according to a proſpect of the Times,
(as 'tis very likely, he has often done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
which, this reſervedneſs of the Duke
perhaps, may hinder: And, to ſuch nimble
Wits, it is a great diſgrace, to be outwitted,
in paying an early Devotion, to what is like
to ſucceed, be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> what it will:
And, for this cauſe, perchance the <hi>Reaſoner</hi>
may think himſelf obliged to remain an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi>
till he knows better what to truſt to:
But, now if theſe <hi>Anſwers</hi> ſhall give him,
Or, his Adherers any Satisfaction, I ſhall be
very glad: And, that I may the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94457:12"/>
them from that wicked Sin of <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> I
ſay, that thoſe who will not allow the
Duke to be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> do ſeem (Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with <hi>Himſelf)</hi> to condemn His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Father, who Educated Him; And alſo,
the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal

Yet, <hi>theſe</hi> have taken the <hi>Teſt.</hi>
               </p>

to all thoſe who are Traducers

That, they ſpeedily pull off their viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,

Otherwiſe, the time may come, (and,
