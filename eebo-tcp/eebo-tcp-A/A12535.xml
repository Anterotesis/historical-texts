            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

These definitions doe containe thrée differences: the obteyning of the authoritie, the maner of administration therof, and the butte or marke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it doeth tend and shoote.

But as such absolute administration in time of warre when all is in armes, and when lawes hold their peace because they cannot be heard, is most necessarie: so in time of peace the same is very dangerous, as well to him that doeth vse it, and much more to the people vpon whom it is vsed: whereof the cause is the frailtie of mans nature, which (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) can not abide or beare long that absolute and vncontrouled authoritie, without swelling into too much pride and insolencie. And therefore the Romanes did wisely, who woulde not suffer any man to kéepe the <hi>Dictatorship</hi> aboue sixe monethes, because the <hi>Dictators</hi> (for that time) had this absolute power, which some Gréekes named a lawfull tyrannie for a time. As I remember, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (who of all wryters hath most absolutely &amp; methodically trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the diuision and natures of common wealthes.) maketh this sort of gouernment to be one kind of kings. But all commeth to one effect: for at the first, all kings ruled absolutely, as they who were either the heads and most ancient of their families, deriued out of their owne bodies, as <hi>Adam, Noa, Abraham, Iacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Esau,</hi> reigning absolutely ouer their owne children and bondemen, as reason was: or els in the rude world amongst barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; ignorant people, some one then whom God had endued with singular wisdome to inuent thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the nourishing and defence of the multitude, and to administer iustice, did so farre excell other, that all the rest were but beastes in comparison of him; and for that excellencie willingly had this authoritie geuen him of the multitude, and of the Gentiles when he was dead, &amp; almost when he was yet liuing, was taken for

               <p>TO be better vnderstoode hereafter, it is necessary yet<note place="margin">Respublica.</note> to make a third diuision of the Common wealth by the partes thereof. A Common wealth is called a socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or common doing of a multitude of frée men, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and vnited by common accord &amp; couenants among themselues, for the conseruation of themselues as wel in peace as in warre For properly an host of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not called a common wealth, but abusiuely, because they are collected but for a time, and for a fact: which done, ech deuideth himself from others as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if one man had, as some of the olde Romanes had (if it be true that is written) fiue thousande, or tenne thousande bondmen whom he ruled well, though they dwelled all in one Citie, or were distributed into diuers villages, yet that were no commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth: for the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no communion with his master, the wealth of the Lord is onely sought for, and not the profit of the slaue or bondeman. For as they who write of these things haue defined, a bondman or slaue is as it were (sauing life and humane reason) but the instrument of his Lorde, as the axe, the sawe, the chessyll and gowge is of the Carpenter. Trueth it is, the Carpenter looketh diligently to saue, correct and amend all these: but it is for his owne profite, and in consideration of him self, not for the instruments sake. And as these be instruments of the Carpenter, so the plow, the cart, the horse, oxe or asse, be instruments of the husbandman: and though one husbandman had a great number of all those, and looked well to them, it made no common wealth, nor could not so be called. For the priuate wealth of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18309:9"/>
is onelie regarded, and there is no mutuall societie or portion, no law or pleading betwéene the one and the other. And (as he saith) what reason hath the pot to say to the Potter, why madest thou me thus? or why doest thou break me after thou hast made me? euen so is the bondman or slaue which is bought for money: for he is but a reasonable and liuing instrument, the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his Lord and master, reckoned among his goods, not otherwise admitted to the societie ciuill, or Common wealth, but is part of the possession and goods of his Lord. Wherefore, except there be other orders and administrations amongst the Turkes, if the prince of the Turkes (as it is written of him) doe repute all other his bondmen and slaues (him selfe and his sonnes onelie fréemen) a man may doubt whether his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration be to be accounted a common wealth, or a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or he rather to be reputed onely as one that hath vnder him an infinite number of slaues or bondmen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom there is no right, law, nor Commonwealth compact, but onely the will of the Lord and Segnior. Surely none of the old Gréekes would call this fashion of gouernment, <hi>Remp.</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THen if this be a societie, and consisteth onely of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the least part therof must be of two. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralest, and first coniunction of two, toward the making of a further societie of continuance, is of the husband &amp; of the wife, after a diuers sort, each hauing care of the familie: the man to get, to trauaile abroade, to defende:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18309:9"/>
the wife, to saue that which is gotten, to tarie at home, to distribute that which commeth of the husbandes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, for the nutriture of the children, and family of them both, and to kéepe all at home neate and cleane. So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath forged ech part to his office: the man sterne, strong, bold, aduenturous, negligent of his beautie, and spending. The women weake, fearefull, faire, curious of her beautie, and sauing. Either of them excelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in witte and wisdome, to conduct those thinges which appertaine to their office, and therefore where their wisdome doeth excell, therein it is reason that ech should gouerne. And without this societie of man and woman, the kinde of man could not long endure. And to this societie men are so naturally borne, that the Prince of all Philosophers, in consideration of natures, was not afraide to say, that a man by nature is rather desirous to fellow himselfe to another, and so to liue in couple, than to adherd himselfe with many. Although of all things, or liuing creatures, a man doeth shew him selfe most politike, yet can he not well liue without the societie and felowship ciuill. He that can liue alone, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is either a wilde beast in a mans likenes, or els a god rather than a man. So in the house and family is the first and most naturall (but priuate) apparance of one of the best kindes of a common wealth, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aristocratia,</hi> where a few, and the best doe gouerne, and where not one alwaies: but sometime, and in some thing one, and sometime and in some thing another doth beare the rule. Which to maintaine for his part, God hath geuen to the man great witte, bigger strength, and more courage, to compell the woman to obey by reason, or force: and to the woman beautie, faire countenance, and swéete words, to make the man to obey her againe for loue. Thus ech obeyeth and commandeth other, and<note place="margin">Domus, seu familia.</note> they two together rule the house. The house I call here

And when many cities, boroughs and villages, were by common and mutuall consent for their conseruation ruled by that one and first father of them all, it was called a nation or kingdome. And this séemeth the first and most naturall beginning and source of cities, townes, nations, kingdomes, and of all ciuill societies.

The rulers sought ech to kéepe &amp; maintaine their posteritie, as their sonnes and nephewes, and such as should succéede them, and carie their names when they were dead, and so render them being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall by nature, immortall by their fame and succession of posteritie: hauing most earnest care to maintaine still this their cousinage and common familie, aswell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst forraine and barbarous nations, which were not of their progenie, tongue, or religion, as against wilde and sauage beastes.

dayly to a great multitude, and the reuerence due to the old fathers in such and so great number of equals fayling by the reason of the death or doting of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: eche owing their merites of education apart to their Fathers and Grandfathers, and so many arising, and such equalitie among them, it was not possible that they should be content to be gouerned by a fewe. For two things being such as for the which men in societie and league doe most striue, that is, honour and profite, no man of frée courage can be contented to be neglected therein, so that they were faine of necessitie to come to that, that the more part should beare the price away in election of Magistrates and Rulers. So that either by course or by lot ech man in turne might be receiued to beare rule, and haue his part of the honor: and (if any were) of the profite which came by administration of the commonwealth. For whosoeuer came of that olde great Grandfathers race, he accounted himselfe as good of birth as any other. For seruice to the commonwelth, all, or such a number had done it, as they coulde not bée accounted few. And if a few would take vpon them to vsurpe ouer the rest, the rest conspiring together would soone be masters ouer them, and ruinate them wholly. Whereupon necessarily it came to passe, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth must turne and alter as before from one to a few, so now from a few, to many and the most part, ech of these yet willing to saue the politicke bodie, to conserue the authoritie of their nation, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against all other, their strife béeing onely for empire and rule, and who should doe best for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, whereof they would haue experience made by bearing office and beyng magistrates.

For it is not enough to say that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of a multitude of houses &amp; families, which make stréetes &amp; villages, and the multitude of the stréetes and villages make townes, and the multitude of townes the realm, &amp; that fréemen be considered only in this behalfe, as subiects and citizens of the commonwealth, and not bondmen, who can beare no rule nor iurisdiction ouer

fréemén, as they who be taken but as instruments &amp; the goods and possessions of others. In which consideration also we doo reiect women, as those whom nature hath made to kéepe home and to nourish their familie &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not to meddle with matters abroade, nor to beare office in a citie or common-wealth no more than children and infants: except it be in such cases as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is annexed to the bloud and progenie, as the crowne, a dutchie, or an erledome; for there the bloud is respected, not the age nor the sexe. Whereby an absolute Quéene, an absolute Dutches or Countesse, those I call absolute, which haue the name, not by being maried to a king, duke, or erle, but by being the true, right and next successors in the dignitie, and vpon whom by right of the bloud that title is descended: These I say haue the same authoritie although they be women or children in that kingdome, dutchie or erledome, as they should haue had if they had bin men of full age.

               <p>NO man is a knight by succession, not the King or prince. And the name of prince in England <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> betokeneth the kinges eldest sonne or prince of Wales: although the King himselfe, his eldest sonne, and all Dukes be called by generall name Princes. But as in Fraunce the kings eldest sonne hath the title of the Daulphine, and he, or the next heire apparant to the Crowne is Monsire, so in England the kinges eldest sonne is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Prince. Knights therefore be not borne but made, either before the battaile to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them the more to aduenture their liues, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conflict, as aduauncement for their hardinesse and manhoode alreadie shewed: or out of the warre for some great seruice done, or some good hope through the vertues which doe appeare in them. And they are made
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18309:14"/>
either by the king himselfe, or by his commission and royall authoritie geuen for the same purpose, or by his Lieutenant in the warres, who hath his royall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute power committed to him for that time. And that order séemeth to answere in part to that which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes called <hi>Equites Romanes,</hi> differing in some pointes, and agréeing in other, as their common wealth and ours doe differ and agrée: for neuer in all points one common wealth doeth agrée with another, no nor long time any one common wealth with it selfe. For all changeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to more or lesse, and still to diuers and diuers orders, as the diuersitie of times doe present occasion, &amp; the inutabilitie of mens wittes doeth inuent and assaye new wayes, to reforme and amend that wherein they doe finde fault. <hi>Equites Romani,</hi> were chosen <hi>ex censu,</hi> that is, according to their substaunce and riches. So bee knights in England most commonly, according to the yerely reuenue of their landes, being able to maintaine that estate: yet all they that had <hi>Equestrem censum, non legebantur Equites.</hi> No more are all made knightes in Englande that may dispende a knights land or fée, but they onely whom the king will so honour. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Equites</hi> was vncertaine, and so it is of knights, at the pleasure of the Prince. <hi>Equites Romani</hi> had <hi>equum publicum.</hi> The knights of England haue not so, but finde their owne horse themselues in peace time, and most v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually in warres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Census Equester</hi> was among the Romans at diuers times of diuers value: but in England whosoeuer may dispende of his frée landes fourty poundes sterling of yerely reuenue, by an olde lawe of England, either at the coronation of the king, or mariage of his daughter, or at the dubbing of the Prince knight, or some such great occasion, may be by the king compelled to take that order and honor, or to pay a fine, which many not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18309:15"/>
so desirous of honour as of riches, had rather disburse: Some, who for causes are not thought worthie of that honour and yet haue abilitie, neither be made knightes, though they would, and yet pay the fine of xl. l. sterling, at that time when this order began, which maketh now Cxx. l of currant money of England: as I haue more at large declared in my book of the diuersitie of standards, or the valor of monies.</p>
               <p>When the Romanes did write <hi>Senatus populusque Romanus,</hi> they séemed to make but two orders, that is, of the Senate, and of the people of Rome, and so in the name of people they contained <hi>Equites</hi> and <hi>plebem:</hi> so when we in England doe say the Lords and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: the knights, esquires, and other gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with citizens, burgesses and yomen, be accounted to make the Commons, In ordayning of lawes, the Senat of Lords of England is one house, where the Archbishoppes and Bishoppes also be, and the King or Quéene for the time being as chiefe, the knights and all the rest of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Citizens and Burgesses which be admitted to consult vpon the greatest affaires of the Realme, be in another house by themselues, and that is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house of the Commons, as wee shall more clearely describe when we speake of the Parlement. Whereupon this word knight is deriued, and whether it doe betoken no more but that which <hi>miles</hi> doeth in latine, which is a Souldier, might be mooued as a question. The worde Souldier now seemeth rather to come of sould &amp; paime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and more to betoken a waged or hired man to fight, than otherwise, yet <hi>Caesar</hi> in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries called <hi>soldures</hi> in the tongue gallois, men who deuoted &amp; swore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a certaine band or oath one to another, and to the Captaine: which order if the Almains did follow, it may be that they who were not hyred, but being of the Nation, vpon their owne charges, and for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18309:15"/>
and by such common oath or band that did follow the wars, were (possibly) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> called knights or <hi>milites,</hi> and now among the Almaines some are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lanceknights, as souldiers of their band not hyred, although at this day they be for the most part hirelings. Or peraduenture it may be that they which were next about the Prince, as his guarde and seruants, picked or chosen men out of the rest, being called in the Almaine language <hi>knighten,</hi> which is as much to say as serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: these men being found of good seruice, the worde after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was taken for an honor, and for him who maketh profession of armes. Our language is so changed, that I dare make no iudgement thereof. Now wee call him knight in English, that the French calleth <hi>cheualier,</hi> and the Latine <hi>equitem,</hi> or <hi>equestris ordinis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when any man is made a knight, he knéeling downe is stroken of the Prince, with his sword naked, vpon the back or shoulder, the Prince saying, <hi>sus</hi> or <hi>sois chiualier au nom de Dieu,</hi> and (in times past) they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded S, <hi>George,</hi> &amp; at his arising the Prince saith, <hi>auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cér.</hi> This is the maner of dubbing of knightes at this present: and that terme dubbing, was the olde terme in this point, &amp; not creation. At the coronation of a king or Quéene, there be knights of the bath made, with long &amp; more curious ceremonies. Knights bannerets are made in the field, with the ceremonie of cutting off the poynt of his standert, and making it as it were a baner: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a bacheler knight, is now of a greater degrée, allowed to display his armes in a baner as Barons do. But this order is almost growen out of vse in England. But how soeuer one be dubbed or made a knight, his wife is by and by called a Lady, as well as a Barons wife: he himselfe is not called Lord, but hath to his name in common appellation added this sillable, Sir, as if he before were named <hi>Thomas, William, Iohn or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18309:16"/>
afterward he is alwaies called Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>William,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and that is the title which men giue to Knightes in Englande. This may suffice at this time, to declare the order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, yet there is an other order of Knights in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land which be called the Knights of the Garter. King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, after he had obtained many notable victories, King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Fraunce, King <hi>Iames</hi> of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being both prisoners in the tower of London at one time, and king <hi>Henrie</hi> of Castel the bastard expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of his realme, and Don <hi>Petro</hi> restored vnto it by the prince of Wales and Duke of Aquitaine called the blacke prince, inuented a societie of honour, and made a choise out of his owne realme and dominions, and all Christendome: and the best and most excellent renoumed persons in vertues and honour, he did adorne with that title to be knightes of his order, gaue them a garter decked with golde, pearle and precious stones, with the buckle of gold, to weare daily on the left legge onely, a kirtle, gowne, cloke, chaperon, collar, and other august and magnificall apparell both of stuffe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion exquisite and heroicall, to weare at high feasts, as to so high and princely an order was méete: of which order he and his successors Kinges and Quéenes of England to be the soueraigne, and the rest by certaine statutes and lawes among themselues, be taken as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and fellowes in that order, to the number of xxvi.

This hath his reason, for the Etimologie of the name serued the efficacie of the worde. <hi>Gens</hi> in Latine betokeneth the race and sirname, so the Romanes had <hi>Cornelios, Sergios, Appios, Fabios, Armilios, Pisones, Iulios, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, Valerios,</hi> of which who were <hi>Agnati,</hi> and therefore kept the name, were also <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and remayning the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18309:17"/>
memorie of the glorie of their progenitors fame, were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gentlemen of that or that race. This matter made a great strife among the Romanes, when those which were <hi>noui homines,</hi> were more allowed, for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues new and newly shewen, than the old smell of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient race newly defaced by the cowardise and euill life of their nephewes and discendants coulde make the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be. Thus the <hi>Cicerones, Gatones,</hi> and <hi>Marij</hi> had much a doe with those auncients, and therfore said <hi>Iuuenalis:</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Malo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis</l>
                  <l>Aeacidi similis vulcaniaque arma capessas,</l>
                  <l>Quám te Thersiti similem producat Achilles.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But as other Common wealths were faine to doe, so must all Princes necessarilie follow: that is, where vertue is, to honour it. And although vertue of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent race be easier to be obtained, aswell by the example of the progenitors, which encourageth, as also through habilitie of education and bringing vp, which enableth, and the lastly enraced loue of tenants and neighbors to such noblemen and Gentlemen, of whom they hold, and by whom they doe dwell, which prieketh forwarde to ensue in their fathers steps. So if all this do faile (as it were great pitie it shoulde) yet such is the nature of all humaine things, and so the world is subiect to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie, that it doeth many times faile: but when it doeth, the prince and commonwealth haue the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that their predecessors had, and as the husbandman hath to plant a new trée where the old fayleth, so hath the Prince to honour vertue where he doeth finde it, to make gentlemen, esquires, knights, barons, earles, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quises and dukes, where he séeth vertue able to beare that honor or merits, and deserues it, and so it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes béen vsed among vs. But ordinarilie the K. doth onely make knights, &amp; create barons, or higher degrées:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18309:17"/>
for as for gentlemen, they be made good cheape in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For who soeuer studieth the lawes of the realme, who studieth in the Uniuersities, who professeth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sciences: and to be short, who can liue idly, and without manuall labour, and wil beare the port, charge and countenance of a Gentleman, hee shall bee called master, for that is the title which men geue to esquires and other gentlemen, and shall be taken for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For true it is with vs as is said, <hi>Tanti eris aliis, quanti tibi feceris:</hi> And (if néede be) a king of Herauldes shall also geue him for money armes newly made and inuented, the title whereof shall pretende to haue béene found by the sayd Herauld in perusing and vewing of olde Registers, where his Auncestors in times past had béen recorded to beare the same. Or if he will doe it more truely, and of better faith, he will write that for the merites of that man, and certaine qualities which he doeth sée in him, and for sundrie noble actes which he hath perfourmed, he by the authoritie which he hath, as king of Heraulds and armes, geueth to him his heires these and these armes, which being done, I thinke hee may be called a Squire, for he beareth euer after those armes. Such men are called sometime in scorne, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the first head.</p>

               <p>A Man may make doubt &amp; question, whether this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making gentlemen is to be allowed or no, &amp; for my part I am of that opinion that it is not amisse. For first the prince looseth nothing by it, as he should doe if it were as in France: for the yeoman or husbandman
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18309:18"/>
is no more subiect to taile or taxe in England than the gentleman: no, in euery payment to the King the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is more charged, which he beareth the gladlier, and dareth not gainesay, for to saue and kéepe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation. In any shewe or muster, or other particular charge of the towne where he is, he must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his purse wyder, and augment his portion aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or els he doeth diminish his reputation. As for their outward shew, a gentleman (if he wil be so accoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted) must goe like a gentleman, a yeoman like a yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a rascall like a rascall: and if he be called to the warres, hée must and will (what soeuer it cost him) array himselfe, and arme him according to the vocation which he pretendeth: hée must shew also a more manly courage, and tokens of better education, higher sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and bountifuller liberalitie than others, and kéepe about him idle seruaunts, who shall doe nothing but wayte vpon him. So that no man hath hurt by it but he himselfe, who hereby perchance will beare a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sayle than he is able to maintaine. For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the policie and gouernment of the Commonwelth it is not those that haue to doe with it which will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie themselues, and goe in higher buskins than their estate will beare: but they which are to be appointed, are persons tried and well knowen, as shall be declared hereafter.</p>

               <p>THose whom we call yeomen, next vnto the nobilitie, knights and Squires, haue the greatest charge and doings in the common wealth, or rather are more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled to serue in it than all the rest: as shall appeare hereafter. I call him a yeoman whom our lawes doe call <hi>Legalem hominem,</hi> a word familiar in writtes and enquestes, which is a fréeman borne English, and may dispende of his owne frée land in yerely reuenue to the summe of xl. s. sterling. This maketh (if the iust va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue were taken now to the proportion of monies) vi. l. of our currant money at this present. This sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confesse themselues to be no gentlemen, but geue the honor to all which be or take vpon them to be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and yet they haue a certaine preheminence and more estimation than labourers and artificers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly liue wealthily, kéep good houses, and doo their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, &amp; trauaile to acquire riches: these be (for the most part) farmors vnto gentlemen, which with grasing, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of markettes and kéeping seruaunts not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle as the gentleman doth, but such as get both their own liuing and part of their maisters, and by these meanes do come to such wealth, that they are able and daily do buy the landes of vnthriftie gentlemen,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18309:19"/>
and after setting their sonnes to the schoole at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, to the lawes of the Realme, or otherwise lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them sufficient landes whereon they may liue without labour, doe make their said sonnes by those meanes Gentlemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These be not called masters, for that (as I said) pertaineth to Gentlemen onely. But to their surnames men adde Goodman: as if the surname be <hi>Luter, Finch, White, Browne,</hi> they are called good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Luter,</hi> goodman <hi>White,</hi> goodman <hi>Finch,</hi> goodman <hi>Browne,</hi> amongst their neighbors, I meane not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance, or in lawe. But in matters of lawe and for distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if one were a knight, they would write him (for example sake) Sir <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> knight, so if he be an Esquire, <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> Esquire or Gentleman, if he be no Gentleman, <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> yeoman. For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the Gentlemen they which claime no higher degrée, and yet be to be exempted out of the number of the lowest sort thereof, be written Esquires. So amongst the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, labourers, lowest and rascall sorte of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, such as be exempted out of the number of the ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilitie of the popular be called and written yeomen, as in the degrée nxet vnto Gentlemen.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18309:19"/>
haue aduentured their liues to and with him and his. These are they which in the olde world gat that honour to Englande, not that either for witte, conduction, or for power they are or were euer to be compared to the gentlemen, but because they be so manie in number, so obedient at the Lordes call, so strong of bodie, so harde to endure paine, so couragious to aduenture with their Lorde or Captaine going with, or before them, for else they be not hastie nor neuer were, as making no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of knowledge of warre. These were the good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in times past, and the stable troupe of footemen that affraide all France, that would rather die all, than once abandon the knight or gentleman their captaine, who at those daies commonly was their Lorde, and whose tenauntes they were, readie (besides perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all shame) to be in danger of vndoing of themselues, &amp; all theirs if they should shew any singe of cowardise or abandon the Lorde, Knight or Gentleman of whom they helde their liuing. And this they haue amongest them from their forefathers tolde one to an other. The gentlemen of Fraunce and the yeomen of England are renowned, because in battle of horsemen Fraunce was many times too good for vs, as we againe alway for them on foote. And Gentlemen for the most part be men at armes and horsemen, and yeomen commonly on foote: howsoeuer it was, yet the gentlemen had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the conduction of the yeomen, and as their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were eyther a foote or vpon a litle nagge with them, and the Kinges of Englande in foughten bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles remaining alwaies among the footemen, as the Frenche Kings among their horsemen. Eche Prince<note place="margin">Geman in the Saxon is a maried man, and hereof commeth our yeoman, for after mariage men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted setled members in the common wealth, but not before.

What a yeoman is I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, but from whence the word is deriued it is hard to say: it cannot be thought that yeoman should be said
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18309:20"/>
a young man, for commonly wée doe not call any a yeoman till he be maried, and haue children, and as it were, haue some authoritie among his neighboures. Yonker in low Dutch betokeneth a meane gentleman, or a gay fellow. Possible our yeomen not being so bolde as to name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they came home, were content when they had heard by frequentation w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> low Dutchmen, of some small Gentleman (but yet that would be counted so) to be called amongst them, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker man, they calling so in warres by mockage or in sport the one an other, when they came home, yonker man, and so yeoman: which worde nowe signifyeth among vs, a man well at ease, and hauing honestly to liue, and yet not a Gentleman; whatsoeuer that word yonker man, yonke man, or yeoman doeth more or lesse signifie to the Dutchmen.</p>

These haue no voyce nor authoritie in our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and no account is made of them but onely to be ruled, not to rule other, and yet they bee not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neglected. For in Cities and corporate townes for default of yeomen, enquestes and Juries are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neled of such maner of people.

               <p>The officers in Parlement are the Speakers, two Clarkes, the one for the higher house, the other for the lower, and the Committies.</p>
               <p>The Speaker is he that doeth commend and prefer the billes exhibited into the Parlement, and is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the Parlement. He is commonly appointed by the King or Quéene, though accepted by the assent of the house.</p>

               <p>THe Prince sendeth foorth his rescripts or writtes to euery duke marques, baron, and euery other Lorde temporall or spirituall who hath voyce in the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be at his great counsell of Parlement such a day (the space from the date of the writte is commonlie at the least fourty dayes:) he sendeth also writtes to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18309:23"/>
Sherifes of euery shire, to admonish the whole shire to choose two knights of the Parlement in the name of the shire, to heare and reason, and to geue their aduise and consent in the name of the Shire, and to bée present at that day: likewise to euery citie and towne, which of auncientie hath béene wont to find burgesses of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, so to make election, that they might be present there at the first day of the Parlement. The Knightes of the shire be chosen by all the Gentlemen and yeomen of the shire, present at the day assigned for the election: the voyce of any absent can be counted for none. Yeome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I call here (as before) that may dispende at the least xl. s. of yerely rent of frée lande of his owne. These méeting at one day, the two who haue the more of their voyces be chosen knights of the shire for that Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: likewise by the pluralitie of the voyces of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and burgesses, be the burgesses elected. The first day of the Parlement the Prince and all the Lordes in their robes of Parlement doe méet in the higher house, where, after prayers made, they that be present are written, and they that be absent vpon sicknes, or some other reasonable cause (which the Prince will allowe) doe constitute vnder their hand and seale some one of those who be present, as their procurer, or atturney, to geue voice for them, so that by presence or atturney and proxey they be all there, all the princes and Barons, and all Archbishops and bishops, and (when Abbots were) so many abbots as had voice in Parlement. The place where the assemblie is, is richly tapessed and hanged, a princely and royal throne as appertaineth to a king, set in the middest of the higher place thereof. Next vnder the prince sitteth the Chancellor, who is the voice and Orator of the Prince. On the one side of that house or chamber sitteth the archbishops and byshops, ech in his ranke, on the other side the dukes and barons. In the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18309:23"/>
middest thereof vpon woolsackes sitteth the Judges of the realme, the maister of the roules, and the secretaries of estate. But these that sit on the woolsackes haue no voice in the house, but onely sit there to answere their knowledge in the law, when they be asked, if any doubt arise among the Lordes, The secretaries do answere of such letters or thinges passed in counsell, whereof they haue the custodie and knowledge: and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the vpper house, whose consent and dissent is giuen by ech man seuerally and by himselfe, first for himselfe, and then seuerally for so many as hee hath letters and proxies, when it commeth to the question, saying onely content or not content, without further reasoning or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying. In this meane time the knights of the shires and burgesses of the parliament (for so they are called that haue voice in parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and are chosen as I haue said before, to the number betwixt iij. C. and iiij. C.) are called by such as it pleaseth the Prince to appoint, into an other great house or Chamber by name, to which they answere: and declaring for what shire or towne they answere then they are willed to choose an able and discréete man to be as it were the mouth of them al, and to speake for and in the name of them, and to present him so chosen by them to the Prince: which done they comming all with him to a barre, which is at the nether end of the vpper house, there he first praiseth the Prince, then maketh his excuse of vnabilitie, and prayeth the Prince that he would commaund the commons to choose another. The Chancellor in the Princes name doth so much declare him able, as hée did declare himselfe vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thanketh the commons for choosing so wise, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créete and eloquent a man, and willeth them to goe and consult of lawes for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Then the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker maketh certaine requests to the Prince in the name of the commons, first that his maiestie would be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18309:24"/>
that they may vse and enioy all their liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges that the common house was woont to enioy.</p>
               <p>Secondly that they might franckly and fréely say their mindes in disputing of such matters as may come in question, and that without offence to his Maiestie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that if any should chaunce of that lower house to offend, or not to do or say as should become him, or if any should offend any of them being called to that his highnes court, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues might (according to the ancient custome) haue the punishment of them. And fourthly, that if there came any doubt, wherupon they shall desire to haue the aduise or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestie or with any of the Lordes, that they might do it: all which he promiseth in the Commons names, that they shall not abuse, but haue such regarde as most faithful, true and louing subiectes ought to haue to their Prince.</p>
               <p>The Chauncelor answereth in the Princes name, as apperteineth. And this is all that is done for one day, &amp; sometime two. Besides the Chauncelor, there is one in the vpper house who is called Clarke of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who readeth the billes. For all that commeth in consultation either in the vpper house or in the neather house, is put in writing first in paper, which being once read, he that will, riseth vp and speaketh with it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: and so one after another so long as they shall thinke good. That done they go to another, and so another bill. After it hath bin once or twice read, and doth appeare that it is somewhat liked as reasonable, with such amendment in wordes and peraduenture some sentences as by disputation séemeth to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: in the vpper house the Chauncelor asketh if they will haue it ingrossed, that is to say, put into parchment: which done, and read the third time, and that eftsoones if any be disposed to obiect disputed againe among them,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18309:24"/>
the Chauncelor asketh if they will go to the question: and if they agrée to go the question, then he saith, here is such a law or act concerning such a matter, which hath bin thrise read here in this house, are yée content that it be enacted or no? If the not contentes be moe, then the bill is dashed, that is to say the law is annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and goeth no further. If the contentes be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moe, then the Clarke writeth vnderneath: <hi>Soit baille aux commons.</hi> And so when they sée time, they send such billes as they haue approoued by two or thrée of those which do sit on the woolsackes to the commons: who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king licence, and comming into the house, with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, saith to the speaker: Maister speaker, my Lordes of the vpper house haue passed among them and thinke good, that there should be enacted by Parliament such an act, and such an act, and so readeth the titles of that act or actes. They pray you to consider of them, and shew them your aduise, which done they goe their way. They being gone, and the dore againe shut, the speaker rehearseth to the house what they said. And if they bée not busie disputing at that time in an other bill, hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them streight way if they will haue that bill or (if there be moe) one of them.</p>
               <p>In like maner in the lower house the speaker sitting in a seate or chaire for that purpose some what higher, that he may sée and be séene of them all, hath before him in a lower seate his Clarke, who readeth such billes as be first propounded in the lower house, or be sent downe from the Lords. For in that point ech house hath equall authoritie, to propound what they thinke méete, either for the abrogating of some lawe made before, or for making of a newe. All billes be thrise in thrée diuerse daies read and disputed vpon, before they come to the question. In the disputing is a maruelous good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vsed in the lower House. Hée that standeth vp
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18309:25"/>
bareheaded is vnderstanded that he will speake to the bill. If mo stand vp, who that first is iudged to arise, is first heard, though the one do praise the law, the other disswade it, yet there is no alteration. For euery man speaketh as to the speaker, not as one to another, for that is against the order of the house. It is also taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the order, to name him whom yée do confute, but by circumlocution, as he that speaketh with the bill, or he that spake against the bill, and gaue this and this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And so with perpetual Oration not with alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he goeth through till he do make an end. He that once hath spoken in a bil, though he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed straight, that day may not reply, no though he would chaunge his opinion. So that to one bill in one day one may not in that house speake twise, for else one or two with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation would spende all the time. The next day he may, but then also but once.</p>
               <p>No reuiling or nipping wordes must be vsed. For then all the house will crie, it is against the order: and if any speake vnreuerently or seditiously against the Prince or the priuie Counsell, I haue séene them not onely interrupted, but it hath bin moued after to the house, and they haue sent them to the Tower. So that in such a multitude, and in such diuersitie of mindes, and opinions, there is the greatest modestie and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of spéech that can be vsed. Neuerthelesse with much doulce and gentle termes, they make their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as violent and as vehement the one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they may ordinarily, except it be for vrgent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and hasting of time. At the afternoone they kéepe no parliament. The speaker hath no voice in the house, nor they will not suffer him to speake in any bill to moue or disswade it. But when any bill is read, the speakers office is, as brieflie and as plainly as he may to declare the effect thereof to the house. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18309:25"/>
do assent to such billes as be sent to them first agréed vpon from the Lords thus subscribed, <hi>Les com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ont assentus,</hi> so if the Lords do agrée to such billes as bee first agréed vpon by the Commons, they sende them downe to the speaker thus subscribed, <hi>Les Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neurs ont assentns,</hi> If they cannot agrée, the two houses (for euerie bill from whence so euer it doth come is thrise reade in each of the howses) if it bée vnderstoode that there is any sticking, sometimes the Lordes to the Commons, sometime the Commons to the Lordes do require that a certaine of each house may méete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so ech part to be enformed of others meaning, and this is alwaies graunted. After which méeting for the most part, not alwaies either part agrées to others billes.</p>
               <p>In the vpper house they giue their assent and dissent each man seuerallie and by himselfe, first for himselfe, &amp; then for so many as he hath proxie. When the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler hath demaunded of them whether they will go to the question after the bill hath bin thrise read, they saying onely content or not content, without further reasoning or replying: and as the more number doth agrée, so it is agréed on, or dashed.</p>
               <p>In the neather house none of them that is elected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knight or Burges can giue his voice to an other, nor his consent or dissent by proxie. The more part of them that be present onely maketh the consent or dissent. After the bill hath bin twise reade, and then engrossed and eftsoones reade and disputed on ynough as is thought, the speaker asketh if they will goe to the question. And if they agrée he holdeth the bill vp in his hand and saith, as manie as wil haue this bill go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, which is concerning such a matter, say yea. Then they which allow the bill crie yea, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as will not, say no: as the crie of yea or no is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18309:26"/>
so the bill is allowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or dashed. If it be a doubt which crie is the bigger, they diuide the house, the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker saying, as many as do allow the bill goe downe with the bill, and as many as do not sit still. So they diuide themselues, and being so diuided they are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred who make the more part, and so the bill doth spéed. It chaunceth sometime that some part of the bill is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, some other part hath much contrarietie and doubt made of it: and it is thought if it were amended it would goe forward. Then they choose certaine <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> of them who haue spoken with the bil &amp; against it, to amend it, and bring it in againe so amended, as they amongst them shall thinke méete: and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is engrossed, yea &amp; some time after. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these <hi>committees</hi> is no preiudice to the house. For at the last question they will either accept it or dash it, as it shal séeme good, notwithstanding that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the <hi>committees</hi> haue done.</p>
               <p>Thus no bill is an act of Parliament, ordinaunce, or edict of lawe, vntill both the houses seuerally haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vnto it after the order aforesaid, no nor then neither. But the last day of that parliament or session the Prince commeth in person in his Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t robes, and sitteth in his state: all the vpper house sitteth about the Prince in their states and order in their robes. The speaker with all the common house commeth to the barre, and there after thankesgiuing first in the Lordes name by the Chauncelor &amp;c. and in the commons name by the spaeker to the Prince, for that he hath so great care of the good gouernement of his people, and for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them together to aduise of such thinges as should be for the reformation, establishing and ornament of the common wealth: the Chaunceller in the Princes name giueth thankes to the Lordes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons for their paines and trauailes taken, which he saith the Prince wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18309:26"/>
and recompence when time and occasion shall serue, and that hee for his part is readie to declare his pleasure concerning their procéedinges, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same may haue perfect life &amp; accomplishment by his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authoritie, &amp; so haue the whole consent of the realme. Then one reades the Titles of euerie act which hath passed at that session, but onely in this fashion: An act concerning such a thing &amp;c. It is marked there what the Prince doth allow, and to such hée saith: <hi>Le roy,</hi> or <hi>la Royne le veult.</hi> And those bee taken now as perfect lawes and ordinances of the realme of England and none other, and as shortly as may be put in print, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be some priuate cause or law made for the benefit or preiudice of some priuate man, which the Romans were wont to call <hi>priuilegia,</hi> These be onely exemplified vnder the seale of the Parliament, and for the most part not printed. To those which the Prince liketh not, hee answereth, <hi>Le Roy</hi> or <hi>la Royne saduisera,</hi> and those be accounted vtterly dashed and of none effect.</p>
               <p>This is the order and forme of the highest and most authenticall court of England, by vertue whereof all those thinges be established whereof I spake before, and no other meanes accounted auailable to make any new forfaiture of life, member, or landes of any English man, where there was no lawe ordained for it before. Now let vs speake of the said partes when they bée se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall.</p>

               <head>Of the Monarch, King or Queene of England. CHAP. 4.</head>
               <p>THe Prince whom I now call (as I haue often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Monarch of England, King or Quéene,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18309:27"/>
hath absolutely in his power the anctoritie of warre and peace, to defie what Prince it shall please him, and to bid him warre, and againe to reconcile himselfe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into league or truce with him at his pleasure or the aduice onely of his priuie Counsell. His priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell be chosen also at the Princes pleasure out of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or baronie, and of the Knightes, and Esquires, such and so manie as he shall thinke good, who doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult daily, or when néede is of the weightie matters of the Realme, to giue therin to their Prince their best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice they can. The Prince doth participate to them al, or so many of them as he shall thinke good, such lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and messages as come from forren Princes, such letters or occurrentes as be sent to himselfe or to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, and kéepeth so many ambassades and letters sent vnto him secrete as he will, although these haue a particular oth of a counceller touching faith and secrets administred vnto them when they be first admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that companie. To that herein the kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is farre more absolute than either the Dukedome of Uenice is, or the kingdome of the Lacedemonians was. In warre time, and in the fielde the Prince hath also absolute power, so that his word is a law, he may put to death, or to other bodily punishment, whom he shall thinke so to deserue, without processe of lawe or forme of iudgement. This hath bin sometime vsed within the Realme before any open warre, in sudden insurrections and rebellions, but that not allowed of wise and graue men, who in that their iudgemment had consideration of the consequence and example, asmuch as of the present necessitie, especiallie, when by any meanes the punishment might haue bin done by order of lawe. This absolute power is called martial law, and euer was and necessarilie must bee vsed in all campes and hostes of men, where the time nor place do
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18309:27"/>
suffer the tarriance of pleading and processe, be it neuer so short, and the important necessitie requireth spéedie execution, that with more awe the Souldier might be kept in more strait obedience, without which neuer cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine can doe any thing vaileable in the warres.</p>
               <p>The Prince vseth also absolute power in crying and decréeing the money of the Realme by his proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely. The money is alwayes stamped with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces image and title. The form, fashion, maner, weight, finenesse and basenesse thereof, is at the discretion of the Prince. For whome should the people trust more in that matter than their Prince, seeing the coine is onelie to certifie the goodnesse of the mettall and the waight, which is affirmed by the Princes image and marke? But if the Prince will deceiue them, and geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for siluer or golde, or enhaunce his coyne more than it is woorth, he is deceiued himselfe, as well as hée doth goe about to deceiue his Subiectes. For in the same sort they pay the Prince his rents and customes. And in time they will make him pay ratablie or more for meate, drinke, and victualles for him and his, and for their labour: which experience doeth teach vs nowe in our dayes to bée done in all Regions. For there euer hath béen, and euer wil be a certaine proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwéen the scarcitie and plentie of other things, with golde and siluer. For all other measures and weights, aswell of drie things as of wet, they haue accustomed to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished or altered by the parlement, and not by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proclamation onely.</p>
               <p>The Prince vseth also to dispence with lawes made, whereas equitie requireth a moderation to be had, and with paines for transgression of Lawes, where the payne of the Lawe is applyed only to the Prince. But where the forfaite (as in popular actions it chaunceth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18309:28"/>
many times) is part to the Prince, the other part to the declarator, detector or informer, there the Prince doth dispence for his owne part onely. Where the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall action is intended by inquisition (that maner is called with vs at the Princes suite) the Prince gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth absolution or pardon, yet with a clause, <hi>modo stet rectus in curia,</hi> that is to say, that no man obiect against the offendor. Whereby notwithstanding that he hath the princes pardon if the person offended will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him the accusation (which in our language is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the appeale) in cases where it lieth, the princes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth not serue the offender.</p>
               <p>The prince giueth all the cheife and highest offices or magistracies of the realme, be it of iudgement or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, temporall or spirituall, and hath the tenthes and first fruites of all Ecclesiasticall promotions, except in the Uniuersities, and certaine Colledges which bée ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt.</p>
               <p>All writtes, executions and commaundements, bée done in the Princes name. We doe say in England, the life and member of the kings Subiectes are the kinges onely, that is to say, no man hath <hi>hault</hi> nor <hi>moyenne</hi> iustice but the king, nor can holde plea thereof. And therefore all those pleas which touch the life or the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation of man, be called pleas of the crowne, nor can be done in the name of any inferior person than he or she that holdeth the Crowne of England. And like wise no man can geue pardon thereof but the Prince onely: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in times past there were certaine Countie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines, as Chester, Durham, and Elie, which were <hi>hault</hi> Justicers, and writtes went in their name, and also some Lorde Marchers of Wales, which claymed like priuiledge: al these are now worn away. The supreme iustice is done in the kings name, and by his authoritie onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:18309:28"/>The Prince hath the wardshippe and first marriage of all those that holde lande of him in chiefe. And also the gouernment of all fooles naturall, or such as be mad by aduenture of sicknesse, and so continue, if they be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This being once grounded by acte of Parlement (although some inconuenience hath béene thought to growe thereof, and since that time it hath béene thought very vnreasonable) yet once annexed to the crown, who ought to goe about to take the club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hand? And being gouerned iustly and rightly, I sée not so much inconuenience in it, as some men would make of it: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other rights and preheminences the prince hath, which be called prerogatiues royals, or the prerogatiue of the king, which he declared particularly in the bookes of the common lawes of England.</p>
               <p>To be short, the prince is the life, the head, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of all things that be done in the realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And to no prince is done more honor &amp; reuerence, than to the king and Quéene of England: no man spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the prince, nor serueth at the table, but in adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knéeling, all persons of the realme be bare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before him: in so much that in the chamber of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence where the cloath of estate is set, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare walk, yea though the prince be not there, no man dare tarrie there but bareheaded.

               <p>IN times past (as may appeare to him that shall with iudgement reade the Histories and antiquities of Englande) the courtes and benches followed the king and his Court wheresoeuer he went, especially shortly after the conquest.

               <head>Of the times of pleading called Termes &amp; of the Chauncellor and Chauncerie. CHAP. 12.</head>
               <p>TWo thinges may be moued in question here, how all England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (being so long and so large, and hauing so many shires and prouinces therein) can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered of iustice in one place, and in 3. benches, be they neuer so great? Another (whereas the Kinges Bench is exercised in criminall causes, and in all pleas of the crowne, and the common place in all ciuil causes, real, and personal) what place then hath the Chauncerie?</p>
               <p>The first question will séeme more marueilous, and haue more occasion of doubt, when I shall also tell that the Law is not open at all times, no not the third part of the yeare. But where all other: Cities and common wealthes had all the yeare pleas, suites and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, except for certaine holy daies and haruest, and vintage, or when for some vrgent cause the Lawe was commaunded to be stopped, which is called <hi>Iustitium:</hi> Contrarie in ours it is but fewe times open. That is onely four times in the yeare, which they call Termes. After Michaelmas about ten daies, during fiue or sixe wéekes at the least. After Christmas about a moneth, enduring by the space of thrée wéekes. Then from xvij. dayes after Easter by the space of thrée wéekes and od daies. Likewise from the sixt or seuenth day after Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie sunday, during two wéekes and odde daies. All the rest of the yeare there is no pleading, entring nor pursuing of actions. This small time, and all that but in one place may séeme verie iniurious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who must be faine to suffer much wrong for lacke of Justice and of place and time to pleade: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18309:32"/>
that hereafter I intend to answere more fully, and in the meane while that shal suffice which the wise <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> answered to one who mooued that the pleading place in Rome might be couered ouer with canuas as their theaters were, to the intent that the plaintifs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendantes that were there might pleade their matters more at ease, and not bee in so much danger of their health by the heate of the Sunne striking full and open vppon their heads, which was no small griefe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, specially at Rome. Nay (saith <hi>Cato</hi>) for my part I had rather wish that al the waies to the place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were cast ouer with Galthrops, that the féete of such as loue so well pleading, should féele so much paine of those pricks in going thither as their heads do of the Sunne in tarrying there: hée meant that they were but idle, whot heads, busie bodies, and troublesome men in the Common wealth that did so nourish plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: good labourers and quiet men could be content to ende their matters at home by iudgement of their neighbours and kinsfolke without spending so their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vppon Procurers and Aduocates whom wee call Atturneis, Counsellers, Sergeantes, and generallye men of lawe. Those he accounted profitable citizens, who attend their honest labour and busines at home, and stande not waiting and gaping vpon their Rolles and processe in the law: as for the other, by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was no matter what mischiefe they suffered. To the other question of the chancerie, this I answer: That our lawe which is called of vs the common law, as yée would say <hi>Ius ciuile,</hi> is and standeth vppon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>Ius summum:</hi> and their maximees be taken so straitly that they may not depart from the tenour of the wordes, euen as the old ciuill lawe was. And therefore as that lacked the helpe of a <hi>Pretor</hi> (which might <hi>moderari illud ius summum,</hi> giue actions where
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18309:32"/>

So he that putteth vp his bill in the chauncerie, after that he hath declared the mischiefe wherein he is, hath reléefe as in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <hi>Forum.</hi> And for so much as in this case he is without remedie in the common lawe, therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the chauncellor according to equitie and reason to prouide for him, and to take such order as to good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science shall appertaine. And the court of the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie is called of the common people the court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, because that the Chauncelor is not strained by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour or forme of wordes of lawe to iudge but <hi>ex aequo</hi> and <hi>bono,</hi> and according to conscience as I haue saide. And in this court the vsuall and proper forme of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of England is not vsed, but the forme of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by writing, which is vsed in other countries accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ciuil law: and the triall is not by xij. men, but by the examination of witnes as in other courtes of the ciuill law.</p>

               <p>THe court of common pleas is the kings court, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are holden all common pleas betwéene Subiect &amp; Subiect, of all matters of Common law: so called, for that it serueth for the exact and precise administration of the common law.</p>
               <p>The Judges in this Court are, Lord chiefe Justice of the common pleas, thrée other his associates. The Sergea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the law, whose number is sometime more, sometimes lesse, at the pleasure of the prince. These all are sworne to serue the turn of the common law at this barre.</p>
               <p>Two of them are alwayes appoynted to serue the Princes turne in what Court soeuer, and are called the Q. Sergeants.</p>
               <p>The officers of this Court are the Custos Breuiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thrée Protonotharies, the Clarke of the warrants, the Clarke of the Essoynes, diuers Atturneyes, Fillisers for euery shire, Exigenters for euery shire, the Clark of the Juries, the Cirographer for fines, the Clarke of the Quéenes siluer for errors in this Court committed, the Clarke of the seale, as before for the kings bench.</p>
               <p>The Custos breuium is chiefe Clarke in the court, and he hath the custodie of all the writtes whatsoeuer, returnable into this court, come they in either at the day of the returne, or after the day, which is called <hi>Post diem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Protonotharies are they which after the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue appeared in Court, doe enter the matters in suite, and make the pleadings, and enter them.</p>
               <p>The Fillisers are they which make vp all meane
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18309:36"/>
proces vpon the original writtes, and the same writtes returned by the sherife, are by the atturneyes deliuered to the Custos breuium to file or string, there to remain of record.</p>
               <p>The Exigenters are such as make out the exigents and writs of proclamation into euery Countie, where the parties are, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the measne proces or summo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will not appeare.</p>
               <p>The Clarke of the warrants is he which dooth take the warrants of an Atturney, which shall prosecute for the plaintife or defendant: and is he that enrolleth all déedes acknowledged before the Justices of the same Court.</p>
               <p>The Clarke of the Essoynes is hee which doeth es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyne the defendants in euery action, before the day of his appearance.</p>
               <p>An essoyne is an ordinarie delay by office of Court in action: and the officer before whom the Clarke is to take these essoines, is the puny Justice in the common pleas, who for that purpose sitteth thrée dayes before the Tearme.</p>
               <p>The common Atturneyes are such as are allowed in this Court by the Lorde chiefe Justice of the common pleas, and his assistance, to prosecute or defend according to the instructions of their Clients, for the plaintife or defendant.</p>
               <p>The Clarke of the iuries is he that doeth make the <hi>Venire facias,</hi> to the sherife to warne the Juries by.</p>
               <p>The Cirographer is he that hath the writte of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the concord brought vnto him, and he maketh Indentures tripartite, whereof two are deliuered to the partie for whose vse the fine is acknowledged. And the third part is reserued with him. And all the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same fine, according to the statutes made, are endorced on the third part remayning, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18309:36"/>
called the foote of the fine.</p>
               <p>The Clarke of the Quéenes siluer is a distinct Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the fines, and is he who setteth downe the money that her Maiestie is to haue for the fine, according to the yerely value of the land confessed, knowen, deposed, or agréed vpon.</p>
               <p>All errors in this court committed, are reformed in the kings bench, before the Lord chiefe Justice, &amp; other Justices there assistant, by writte of error.</p>
               <p>There is also the Clarke of the outlawries, who is the kings Atturney generall, and hee entereth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawrie for the Quéene, after the exigent deliuered: and he maketh all the writtes of outlawrie, and none are to be made but by him.</p>
               <p>The matters of the common pleas are all suites of common law commenced by any writte, originall, real, or personall.</p>
               <p>Reall are such as touch the inheritance, or fée of any man.</p>
               <p>Personal are such as touch tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sitory things, as goods, chattels, personall wrongs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The difference betwéene a writte originall, and a writte iudiciall, is this: the originall saith in the ende of it (in the person of the king or Quéene) <hi>teste meipso,</hi> or <hi>meipsa, apud Westmonasterium.</hi> The iudiciall writte saith in the end, <hi>Teste Christophoro Wray,</hi> or <hi>Teste Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobo Dier,</hi> or such other as shalbe Lord chief Justice of either of those benches.</p>
               <p>The order of processes how they follow the one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other. In this court is first a <hi>summoneas</hi> in some action, then an <hi>Attachias,</hi> but in most a <hi>Capias,</hi> then a <hi>Capias pluries</hi> then <hi>Exigi facies,</hi> and a proclamation into the Countie where the defendant dwelleth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Summoneas</hi> is the original, and goeth out of the Chancerie, and is directed to the sherife, to bring the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18309:37"/>
partie by a day.</p>
               <p>The sherifes order in seruing this writte, is to goe himselfe, or his Baylife, to the land, and there to garnish the partie, by sticking vp a sticke on his land, which done, the sherife returneth two common pledges, <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Do,</hi> and <hi>Richardus Ro,</hi> and two <hi>Summonees, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus Den, Henricus Fen.</hi> After the summonees, if the partie come not in, issueth out an <hi>Attacheas,</hi> in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a precept, to authorize the sherife to goe to his land or house, and there to take a pledge for his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>But if the partie plaintife meane to outlaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, he getteth a <hi>Summoneas</hi> out of the Chancery to the sherife to warne the party, who returneth <hi>nihil habet, &amp;c.</hi> Then the plaintife getteth a <hi>Capias</hi> to take his bodie, and then a <hi>Lias capias,</hi> then a <hi>pluries capias,</hi> to all which the sherife returneth in order as they be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, <hi>Non est inuentus.</hi> After which if the party ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not, goeth out to the sherife the <hi>Exigi facias,</hi> and a proclamation to proclayme the partie in fiue seuerall Countie dayes: after which proclamations if he do not appeare, he is returned <hi>Quinto exactus, &amp; non compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit, &amp; ideo vtlagatu,</hi> vnlesse he doe first purchase a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas,</hi> to the Court to surcease. The <hi>Supersedeas</hi> is graunted at the suite of the plaintife, to stay the outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and is an apparance to the suite, for the defendant suggesting to the court, that his erige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>improuide ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit,</hi> shewing that the defendant was alwayes readie to appeare by his Atturney. This done, the plaintise declareth the defendant answereth, if the answere be is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suable they procéede to triall. The maner of procéeding is either to ioyn issue, &amp; so to passe to verdict, or els to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre. The triall is by verdict, when the question is made <hi>de facto,</hi> as, where the matter was done, when, by whom, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>If any fines or amerciaments, which in latine bée called <hi>mulctae,</hi> be leuied in any of the said Courts vpon any man, or any arrerages of accounts by the latines called <hi>reliqua,</hi> of such things as is of customes, taxes, subsidies, or any other such occasions, the same the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife of the shire doeth gather, and is respondent therfore in the Exchequer. As for other ordinarie rents of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall lands, and most commonly for the taxes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and subsidies, there be particular receiuers and collectors, which do answere it into the Exchequer. The sherife hath vnder him an vnder sherife at his charge and appointment, learned somewhat in the lawe, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if he be not learned himselfe, and diuers bailifes which be called errants, whom he maketh at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, who can knowe each land and person in the shire, and their abilitie to goe vpon enquestes, either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine, or to summon him to appeare whom the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife shall appoint: and for this cause to the sherifes as to the minister most proper of the lawe the writtes be directed.</p>
               <p>When any thing commeth to an issue of the déede or fact, there is a writ or writing directed to the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife of the shire where the lande is, whereupon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie is, or where the man dwelleth of whome the money is demaunded, which writ is called <hi>venire faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> Then after the same effect an <hi>alias, pluries</hi> or <hi>distrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> according to the nature of the action to the returne of the shirife. And if for any disobedience of not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and appearing there be a fine (which the Latins doe call <hi>Mulcta</hi>) set vpon any iurors head, the sherife is charged with it, and taketh the distresses which in Latin be called <hi>Pignora,</hi> and answereth therefore to the exchequer. The sherife also is readie by himselfe or by his vndersherife to serue aswell the Justices of peace

in their quarter sessions as the Justices called <hi>Itineran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in their great assises, when they come into the shire, which is twise in the yeare, to dispatch and voide acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons criminall and ciuill depending at the common law, and which be come nowe to the issue. He hath also the charge of all the prisoners co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the prison which we call the goale, and when any is condemned to die, it is his charge to sée the sentence executed. To be short, he is as it were the generall minister and highest for execution of such commaundementes according to the lawe as the Judges doe ordaine, and this is ynough for the sherife.</p>

               </head>
               <p>OF what manner and order of men in the common welth the xij men be I haue already declared. The sherife alwaies warneth xxiiij. to appeare, least perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture any might be sicke or haue a iust cause of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: and if there be not enowe to make an enquest, the absentes be amersed. For although they be called xij. men, as a man would say <hi>duodecim viri,</hi> yet if they be xvi. xx. or the whole number of xxiiij. that is no matter, xij. they must be at the least to make an enquest, or as some call it a quest. An enquest or quest is called this lawefull kinde of triall by xij. men. In actions ciuill which is either of contractes or for land, or possession when so many of those which be warned appeare at the call as be able to make an enquest, which as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no lesse then xij, either part when they be come taketh their chalenges against so many of them as they will, which be that he may not spende so much lande a yeare, he is alied, féed, or seruant to his aduerse partie,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18309:42"/>
he is his enemie, &amp;c. And two of the whole number doe trie, and allow or disalow the rest.</p>
               <p>If after exceptions there bee so many reiected, that there is not a full enquest, in some cases that day is lost, in some the enquest is filled <hi>ex circumstantibus:</hi> when the quest is full, they be sworne to declare the trueth of that issue, according to the euidence and their conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Then the Sergeants of either side declare the issue, and each for his clyent saith as much as he can. Euidences of writings be shewed, witnesses be sworne, and heard before them, not after the fashion of the ciuill law, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that not onely the twelue, but the Judges, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and as many as be present may heare what each witnesse doeth say: The aduerse partie, or his aduocats which we call Counsellers and Sergeants, interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth sometime the witnesses, and driueth them out of countenance.</p>
               <p>Although this may séeme strange to our Ciuilians now, yet who readeth <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> well shall sée, that there was no other order and maner of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning witnesses, or deposing, among the Romanes in their time. When it is thought that it is inough plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before them, and the witnesses haue said what they can, one of the Judges with a briefe and pithie recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, reciteth to the twelue in summe the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Sergeants of either side, that which the witnesses haue declared, &amp; the chiefe points of the euidence shewed in writing, and once againe putteth them in minde of the issue, and sometime geueth it them in writing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering to them the euidence which is shewed on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, if any be, (euidence here is called writinges of contractes autenticall, after the maner of Englande, that is to say, written, sealed, and deliuered) and biddeth them goe together.</p>
               <p>Then there is a Baylife charged with them, to kéepe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18309:42"/>
them in a chamber not farre off, without bread, drinke, light or fire, vntill they be agréed: that is, till they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée vpon one verdict concerning the same issue, and vpon one among them, who shall speake for them all when they be agréed: for it goeth not by the most parte, but each man must agrée. They returne, and in so fewe words as may be, they geue their determination: fewe I call sixe, seuen, or eight wordes at the most, (for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the issue is brought so narrow, that such number of words may be inough to affirme or to deny it,) which done, they are dismissed to goe whether they will. The partie with whom they haue geuen their sentence, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the enquest their dinner that day most commonly, and this is all that they haue for their labour, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they come, some xx. some xxx. or xl. miles or more, to the place where they geue their verdict all, the rest is of their owne charge. And necessarily all the whole xij. must be of the shire, and iiij. of them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred where the land lieth which is in controuersie, or where the partie dwelleth who is the defendant.</p>

fewe more or lesse, and they did finde the King to his warres an hundreth able men. Lath, and rape I take to be names of seruice, for that so many townes in old time, and in the first pouertie of the Realme did méete together in one day to carrie the Lordes corne into his barne, which is called in old English a Lath. Or that they mette at commaundement of the Lord to reape his corne.</p>
               <p>Wapentake I suppose came of the Danes, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture<note place="margin">Or as some say, because in such places the subiects had their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and there did take their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> of the Saxons.

               </head>
               <p>IT may appeare strange that of xxxvi. shires, whereof each shire is diuided into diuerse hundreds, each hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred containing diuerse parishes, all pleading should be but in one place, that is in Westminster hall, and that but in certaine times of the yeare, making little more than one quarter of the yeare in the whole. And one would thinke that there should be much lack of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and right, and much wrong take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without redresse. But it is not so: The people beyng accustomed to liue in such an equalitie of Justice, and that in such sort that the rich hath no more aduantage therein than the poore, the proces, and procéedinges to the iudgement beyng so short, and iudgementes also beyng peremptorie and without appellation: Yet to helpe for small matters, where no great summe is in question there are other courtes. In euery shire from thrée wéekes to thrée wéekes, the sherife for small thinges not passing xl. s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and in certaine hundreds and liberties the bailie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from thrée wéekes to thrée wéekes holdeth plea. And whosoeuer is possessioner and owner of a mannor, may holde from thrée wéekes to thrée wéekes, or at his pleasure of his tennantes and amongest his tenauntes a court cslled a court Baron. And there his tenauntes beyng sworne make a Jurie which is not called the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but the homage. These princip allie doe enquire of the copie holders, and other frée holders that be dead since the last court, and bring in their heires, and next successours, and likewise of incrochment or intrusion of any of the tenauntes against the Lorde, or among themselues. They make orders and lawes amongest
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18309:44"/>
themselues, the paine of them if they be after broken, commeth to the Lord. And if any small matter be in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, it is put to them, and commonly they doe ende it. But these courts doe serue rather for men that can be content to be ordered by their neighbors and which loue their quiet and profit in their husbandrie, more than to be busie in the law. For whether party soeuer wil, may procure a writte out of the higher Court, to remoue the plea to Westminster.</p>
               <p>In cities and other great townes there be diuers li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties to holde plea for a bigger summe, which doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine as wel as the common law, and after the same maner, and yet for them that wil, it may be remoued to Westminster hall.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight ordeyned first a President, Counsellers and Judges, one for the Marches of Wales, at Ludlow, or elswhere: another for the North parts of England, at Yorke, where be many causes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. These two are as be Parlements in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But yet if there be any matters of great consequence, the partie may moue it at the first, or remoue it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to Westminster Hall, and to the ordinarie Judges of the Realme, or to the Chaunceller, as the matter is.</p>
               <p>These two Courts doe heare matters before them, part after the common law of England, and part after the fashion of the Chauncerie.</p>

These fiue enquests are sworne before them to enquire of all heretiques, traitors, theftes, murthers, manslaughters, rapes, false moniers, extortioners, riottes, routes, forcible entries, vnlawfull games, and all such thinges as bée contrarie to the peace and good order of the Realme, and to bring in their verdict. If they among themselues vppon their owne knowledge doe finde any culpable, they cause one of the clarkes to make the bill. And if any bee there to complaine vppon any man for these faultes, he putteth in his bill, which bill is presented first to the Justices sitting vppon the bench, to sée if it be conceiued in forme of lawe, which done y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> complainant doth deliuer it to one of these enquestes, &amp; after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant is sworne, he declareth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what he can, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe of it.

               <p>If they do not finde it true, they write on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>ignoramus,</hi> and so deliuer it to the Justices, of whom it is rent into péeces immediatly: he that is indicted is accompted a lawfull prisoner, and after that time loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked more streitly vnto.

The Justices of the peace do méete also at other times by commaundement of the Prince vpon suspition of warre, to take order for the safetie of the shire, sometimes to take musters of harnesse and able men, and sometime to take orders for the excessiue wages of seruantes and labourers; for excesse of apparell, for vnlawfull games, for conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and euill orders in alehouses, and tauernes for punishment of idle and vagabound persons, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as I haue said, for the good gouernment of the shire, the Prince putteth his confidence in them. And commonlie euery eare, or each second yeare in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Somer or afterwardes, (for in the warme time the people for the most parte be more vnrulie) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the calme time of peace, the Prince with his Counsell chooseth out certaine articles out of penall Lawes alreadie made for to represse the pride and euil rule of the popular, and sendeth them downe to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18309:46"/>
willing them to looke vpon those points, and after they haue mette together, and consulted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues how to order that matter most wisely and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly, whereby the people might be kept in good order and obedience after the law, they deuide themselues by thrée or foure: and so ech in his quarter taketh order for the execution of the said articles.</p>
               <p>And then within certaine space they méete againe and certifie the Prince or his priuie Councell, how they doe find the shire in rule and order touching those points and all other disorders. There was neuer in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth deuised a more wise, a more dulce and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor a more certaine way to rule the people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are kept alwayes as it were in a bridle of good order, and sooner looked vnto that they should not offend, than punished when they haue offended. For séeing the chiefe amongst them, their rulers to haue this speciall charge, and doe cal vpon it, and if occasion so do present, one or two presently either punished, or sent to prison for disobedience to those olde orders and lawes, they take a feare within themselues, they amende, and doe promise more amendment. So that it is as a new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushing of the good lawes of the Realme, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repressing of disorders, which doe naturally rest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men.</p>
               <p>But as the inuention of this, and the vse and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is the most benefit that can be deuised for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commonwealth of England: so when it shalbe misused, dissembled with, or be contemned, &amp; be done <hi>pro forma ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <head>Of hue and crie and recognisaunce taken vppon them that may giue euidence. CHAP. 22.</head>
               <p>BY the olde lawe of England, if any theft, or robberie be done, if hee that is robbed, or hée that séeth or perceiueth that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is robbed do leuie hue and crie, that is to say, do crie and call for aide, and say that a theft or robberie is done contrarie to the Princes peace and assurance: the Constable of the village to whom he doth come, and so make that crie, ought to raise the parish to aide him and séeke the théefe, and if the théefe be not found in that parish, to goe to the next and raise that Constable, and so still by the Constables and them of the Parish one after another. This hue and crie from parish to parish is caried, till the théefe or robber be found. That parish which doth not his dutie, but letteth by their negligence the théefe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, doth not onely pay a fine to the king, but must repay to the partie robbed his dammages. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie English man is a sergeant to take the théefe, and who sheweth himselfe negligent therein, doth not only incurre euill opinion therefore, but hardly shall escape punishment: what is done with the théefe or robber when he is taken, I shall shew you hereafter. The same manner is followed if any man bée slaine, for streight the Murtherer is pursued of euery man til he be taken. So soone as any is brought to the Justices of peace by this hue or crie, by the Constable or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who doth pursue the malefactor, hée doth examine the malefactor, and writeth the examination and his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18309:47"/>
confession: then he doth binde the partie that is robbed, or him that sueth, and the Constable, and so many as can giue euidence against the malefactor to be at the next sessions of gaole deliuerie, to giue their euidence for the Quéene. He bindeth them in recognisance of x. pound, xx. pound, xxx. pound, xl. pounde, or C. pound, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his discretion, and the qualitie of the crime: which certified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnder his hand, is leuied vpon the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, if they faile of being there.</p>

               <head>Of the Coroner. CHAP. 23.</head>
               <p>BUt if any man, woman, or child, be violently slaine, the murtherer not knowen, no man ought or dare burie the bodie before the Coroner hath seene it. The Coroner is one chosen by the Prince of the meaner sort of gentlemen, and for the most part a man séene in the lawes of the Realme, to execute that office. And if the person slaine, (slaine I call here, whosoeuer he be, man, woman or Childe that violently commeth to his death, whether it be be by knife, poison, cord, drowning, burning, suffocation, or otherwise, be it by his owne fault or default, or by any other) if (I say) the person slaine be buried before the Coroner do come (which for the most part men dare not doe) he doth cause the bodie to be taken vp againe, and to be searched, and vppon the sight of the bodie so violently come to his death he doth empanell an enquest of twelue men or mo, of those which come next by, be they strangers or inhabitants, which vppon their othes, and by the sight or view of the bodie, and by such informations as they can take, must search howe the person slaine came to his death, and by whom as the doer or causer thereof.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18309:48"/>
These are not inclosed into a streit place, (as I tolde before of other enquestes) but are suffered to goe at large, and take a day, sometime after xx. or xxx. daies, more or lesse, as the fact is more euident, or more kept close, to giue their euidence, at which day they must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare there againe before the said Coroner to giue their verdict. So sometime y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person to haue slaine himselfe, sometime the brother, the husband, the wife, the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, some of acquaintance or stranger, such as God wil haue reueiled, be taken. For whosoeuer they do finde as guiltie of the murther, he is streight committed to prison, and this is against him in the nature of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, which is not a full condemnation, as ye shal sée hereafter.</p>
               <p>The empanelling of this enquest, and the view of the bodie, and the giuing of the verdict, is commonly in the stréete in an open place, and in <hi>Corona populi:</hi> but I take rather that this name commeth because that the death of euery subiect by violence is accounted to touch the Crowne of the Prince, and to be a detriment vnto it, the Prince accounting that his strength, power, and Crowne doth stande and consist in the force of his people, and the maintenance of them in securitie and peace.</p>

               <head>Of the Constables. CHAP. 24.</head>
               <p>THese men are called in the elder bookes of our lawes of the realme <hi>Custodes pacis,</hi> and were at the first in greater reputation than they bée now. It may appeare that there was a credit giuen vnto them not altogether vnlike to that which is now giuen to the Justices of peace. To this day if any affraie chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

to be made, the Constables ought and will charge them that be at debate, to kéepe the Princes peace, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer refuseth to obey the Constable therein, all the people wil set straight vpon him, and by force make him to render himselfe to be ordered. Likewise if any be suspected of theft, or receiuing, or of murther, or of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, the Constable may take such persons, yea enter into any mans house with sufficient power to searche for such men till hée finde them: and if hée sée cause, kéepe the suspected persons in the stockes, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie, till he bring them before a Justice of the peace to be examined. But for so much as euery little Uillage hath commonly two Constables, and many times ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, labourers, and men of small abilitie be chosen<note place="margin">One or two constables, hedborowes: or tithingmen</note> vnto that office, who haue no great experience, nor knowledge, nor authoritie, the Constables at this present (although this they may doe vpon their owne authoritie) yet they séeme rather to be as it were the executors of the commaundement of the Justices of peace. For the Justice of peace as soone as he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by complaint that any man hath stollen, robbed, slaine, or any seruant, or labourer without licence, hath departed out of his masters seruice, or any y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liueth idle and suspectly, knowing once in what parish hée is, hée writeth to the Constable of the Parish, commaunding him in the Princes name, to bring that man before him: The Constable dareth not disobey. The man is brought and examined by the Justice, and if the Justice doe finde cause, hée commiteth him to the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable to conueye him further to the Princes gaole, where the partie must lie till the Justices of peace doe méete either at their quarter sessions, or at their gaole deliuerie, and that the lawe hath either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned or acquited him. These Constables are called in some places Headborowes, in some places Tithingmen, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18309:49"/>
be like to them, who are called Consuls in many towns and villages in Fraunce. The Constables are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made and sworne at the Léetes of the Lordes, chosen thereto by the homage, and they kéepe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice sometime two, thrée, or foure yeares, more or lesse.<note place="margin">Kinningstable is Regia virgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, the Kinges rod or wand, signifying the Kinges power or authoritie, a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is the vse of maces &amp; white staues by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>HOwe théeues and murtherers and other malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors against the crowne and the peace are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and brought into holde to answere to iustice, partly by hue and crie, partly by information, and partly by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Justices of peace and the Constables: and howe at the quarter Sessions they bee indicted, or else by the Coroners, ye haue hearde before. Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as yée may perceyue by that which is also gone before) is but a former iudgement of xij. men which be called enquirers, and no definitiue sentence, but that which in latin is called <hi>praeiudicium,</hi> it doeth but shewe what opinion the countrey hath of the malefactor: and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18309:49"/>
therefore commonly men be indicted absent, not called to it, nor knowing of it. For though a man be endicted, yet if when he come to the araynement, there be no man to pursue further, nor no euidence of witnesse or other triall and <hi>indices</hi> against him, he is without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie acquited. No man that is once indicted can be deliuered without arainement, For as twelue haue giuen a preiudice against him, so twelue againe must acquite or condemne him. But if the prisoner be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, but sent to prison vpon some suspition or suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour, &amp; none do pursue him to the enditement, first being proclaimed thus, <hi>A.

And these be called acquited by proclamation. Twise in euerie yeare, the one is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in lent what time there is vacation from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Westminster hall, the other is in the vacation in summer, the Prince dooth sende downe into euerie shire of Englande certaine of his Judges of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hall, and some Sergeantes at the lawe with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to heare and determine iointlie with the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the peace all matters criminall and all prisoners which be in the gaoles. These Judges doe goe from shire to shire till they haue doone their circuit of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie shires as be appointed to them for that yeare: at the ende of the terme going before their circuit, it is written and set vp in Westminster hall on what day and in what place they will be. That day there mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the Justices of the peace of that shire, the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife of that shire, who for that time beareth their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and asketh after allowance for it in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18309:50"/>The sherife hath readie for criminall causes (as I writte before at the Sessions of inquirie) four, fiue or six enquestes readie warned to appeare that day to serue the Prince, and so many more as hée is commaunded to haue readie to goe in ciuill matters betwixt priuat me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they call <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> because that worde is in the writte.</p>
               <p>In the towne house, or in some open or common place, there is a tribunall or place of iudgement, made aloft vpon the highest bench, there sitteth the two Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which be sent down in commission, in the middest. Next them on ech side sitte the Justices of peace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their estate and degrée. On a lower bench before them, the rest of the Justices of peace, and some other Gentlemen or their Clarkes. Before these Judges and Justices there is a table set beneath, at which sitteth the <hi>Custos Rotulorum,</hi> or kéeper of writs, Thexchetor, the vndersherife, and such clarkes as doe write. At the ende of that table there is a barre made with a space for the enquestes, and twelue men to come in when they are called, behinde that space another bar, and there stand the prisoners which be brought thether by the Gayler, all chayned one to another. Then the Cryer cryeth, and commaundeth silence. One of the Judges briefly telleth the cause of their comming, and geueth a good lesson to the people. Then the prisoners are called for by name, and bidden to answere to their names. And when the <hi>Custos rotulorum</hi> hath brought foorth their endictments, the Judges doe name one or two, or thrée of the prisoners that are indicted, whom they will haue arraigned. There the clarke speaketh first to one of the prisoners: <hi>A. B.</hi> come to the barre, holde vp thy hand. The Clarke goeth on: <hi>A. B.</hi> thou by the name of <hi>A. B.</hi> of such a towne, in such a countie, art endicted, that such a day, in such a place, thou hast stolen
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18309:50"/>
with force and armes an horse, which was such ones, of such colour, to such a valor, and carried him away feloniouslie, and contrarie to the peace of our soueraigne Lady the Quéene. What sayest thou to it, art thou guiltie or not guiltie? If he will not answere, or not answere directly guiltie or not guiltie, after hée hath béene once or twise so interrogated, he is iudged mute, that is, dumme by contumacie, and his condemnation is to be pressed to death, which is one of the cruellest deathes that may be: he is layd vpon a table, and an other vpon him, and so much waight of stones or lead laide vpon that table, while as his body be crushed, and his life by that violence taken from him. This death some strong and stout harted man doeth choose, for being not condemned of felonie, his bloud is not corrupted, his lands nor goods confiscate to the Prince, which in all cases of felonie are commonly lost from him and his heires, if he be foreiudged, that is, condemned for a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon by the lawe. If hee confesse the Indictment to bée true, then when he is arraigned, no twelue men go vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, there resteth but the Judges sentence, of the paine of death.</p>
               <p>If he pleade not guiltie, as commonly all théeues, robbers and murtherers doe, though they haue confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fact before the Justice of the peace that examined them, though they be taken with the maner, which in Latine they call <hi>in flagranti crimine,</hi> howsoeuer it bée, if he pleade there not guiltie, the Clarke asketh him how he will be tried, and telleth him he must say, by God and the Countrey, for these be the words formall of his triall after indictment, and where the Prince is partie: if the prisoner doe say so, I will be tried by God and the Countrey, then the Clarke replyeth, Thou hast béene indicted of such a crime, &amp;c. Thou hast pleaded not guiltie: being asked how thou wilt be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18309:51"/>
tried, thou hast aunswered by God and by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Loe these honest men that be come here, be in the place and stead of the Countrie: and if thou hast any thing to say to any of them, looke vpon them well and nowe speake, for thou standest vpon thy life and death. Then calleth he in the first Juror. <hi>B. C.</hi> come to the booke, and so giueth him an othe to goe vprightlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prince and the prisoner, &amp;c. If the prisoner obiecteth nothing against him, he calleth an other, and so an other, till there be xij. or aboue: and for the most part the prisoner can say nothing against them, for they are chosen but for that day, and are vnknowen to him, nor they know not him, as I said beyng substantiall yeomen, that dwell about the place, or at the least in the hundred, or néere where the felonie is supposed to be committed, men acquainted with daily labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and not with such idle persons as be readie to doe such mischiefes.</p>
               <p>When the enquest is full, and the prisoner hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected nothing against them, as in déede seldome he doeth, for the cause aboue rehearsed: The clarke saith to the cryer, <hi>countes,</hi> (in French as ye would say rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) and so nameth all those that be on the quest. The crier at euery name crieth aloude, one, then two, thrée, foure, and so till the number be full of twelue or more, and then saith good men and true: and then saith aloude: If any can giue euidence, or can say any thing against the prisoner, let him come now, for he standeth vpon his deliuerance. If no man come in, then the Judge as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth who sent him to prison, who is commonly one of the Justices of peace: he (if he be there) deliuereth vp the examination which he tooke of him and vnderneath the names of those whom he hath bound to giue euidence: although the malefactor hath confessed the crime to the Justice of the peace, and that appeare by his hande
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18309:51"/>
and confirmation, the twelue men will acquite the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, but they which should giue euidence pay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizaunce. Howbeit this doth seldome chaunce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in small matters, and where the Justice of peace, who sent the prisoner to the gaole, is away. If they which be bound to giue euidence come in, first is read the examination, which the Justice of peace doeth giue in: then is heard (if he be there) the man robbed what he can say, being first sworne to say trueth, and after the Constable, and as many as were at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the malefactor: and so many as can say any thing, being sworne one after an other to say truth. These be set in such a place as they may sée the Judges and the Justices, the enquest and the prisoner, and heare them, and bee heard of them all. The Judge after they be sworne, asketh first the partie robbed, if he knowe the prisoner, and biddeth him looke vpon him: he saieth yea, the prisoner sometime saith nay. The partie pursuiuaunt giueth good ensignes, <hi>verbi gratia,</hi> I knowe thée well ynough, thou robbedst me in such a place, thou beatedst mée, thou tookest my horse from me, and my purse, thou hadst then such a coate and such a man in thy companie: the théefe will say no, and so they stand a while in altercation, then he telleth all that he can say: after him likewise all those who were at the apprehension of the prisoner, or who can giue anie <hi>indices</hi> or tokens which wée call in our language euidence agaynst the malefactor. When the Judge hath heard them say ynough, hée asketh if they can say any more: if they say no, then hée turneth his speache to the enquest. Good men (saith he) ye of the enquest, ye haue heard what these men say against the prisoner, you haue also heard what the prysoner can say for himselfe, haue an eye to your othe, and to your duetie, and do that which God shall put in your mindes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18309:52"/>
to the discharge of your consciences, and marke well what is saide. Thus sometime with one enquest is passed to the number of ij. or thrée prisoners: For if they should be charged with more, the inquest will say, my Lorde, wée pray you charge vs with no more, it is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our memorie. Many times they are charged but with one or two. At their departing, they haue in writing nothing giuen them, but the enditement, the clarke repeating to them the effect of it, and shewing more, that if they finde him guiltie, they shall enquire what goods, landes, and tenementes the said person had at the time of the felonie committed: and if they finde any, they shall bring it in: if no, they shall say so. If they finde him not guiltie, they shall enquire whether he fled for the felonie or no.</p>
               <p>And there is a Bailife to waite vpon them, and to sée that no man doe speake with them, and that they haue neither bread, drinke, meate, nor fire brought to them, but there to remaine in a chamber together till they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. If they be in doubt of any thing that is saide, or would heare againe some of them that giue euidence, to interrogate them more at full, or if any that can giue euidence come late: it is permitted that any that is sworne to say the trueth, may be interrogated of them to enforme their consciences. This is to be vnderstood, although it will séeme straunge to all nations that doe vse the ciuill Lawe of the Romane Emperours, that for life and death there is nothing put in writing but the enditement onely. All the rest is doone openlie in the presence of the Judges, the Justices, the enquest, the prisoner, and so many as will or can come so neare as to heare it, and all depositions and witnesses giuen aloude, that all men may heare from the mouth of the depositors and witnesses what is saide. As of this, so is it of all other prisoners after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same sort. By that time
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18309:52"/>
that the enquestes for the prysoners be dispatched, it is commonly dinner time, the Judges and Justices goe to dinner, and after dinner returne to the same place: if the enquest be not readie for the prisoners, they goe to some other enquests of <hi>Nisiprius,</hi> which be ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and priuate, to driue out the time. The enquestes haue no sooner agréed vpon their charge one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they tell the Baylife, and pray to bée heard, and considering that they bée themselues all this while as prisoners as I saide before, it is no maruell, though they make expedition. The prisoners be sent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to the barre, the enquest which hath agréed, is called for each one of the Jurie by his name, to which he answereth. Then the Clarke asketh if they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed, and who shall speake for them. One or mo saith yea. He that speaketh for them all is called the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and commonly it is he that is first sworne: then the prisoner is bidden to holde vp his hand. The clarke saith vnto him, Thou art endicted by the name of <hi>A.</hi> of such a place, &amp;c. being therefore arraigned thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thereto not guiltie, beyng asked howe thou would be tryed, thou saydst by God and thy countrey. These honest men were giuen to thée by God and thy Prince for thy Countrey: Hearken what they say. Then he asketh of the enquest, what say you? Is hée guiltie or not guiltie? The foreman maketh aunswere in one worde, guiltie, or in two, not guiltie: the one is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the other acquiteth the prisoner. So that neither Judge nor Justice hath to doe, or can reuerse, alter or chaunge that matter, if they say guiltie. The Clarke asketh what landes, tenementes, or goods, the prysoner had at the time of the felonie committed, or at any time after. Commonlie it is aunswered, that they knowe not, nor it shall not greatly néede, for the Sherife is diligent ynough to enquire of that, for the Princes and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18309:53"/>
his owne aduantage, and so is the excheator also.</p>
               <p>Of him whom the twelue men pronounce guiltie, the Judge asketh what he can say forhimselfe: if he can reade, he demaundeth his Clargie. For in many felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as in theft of Oxen, Shéepe, Money, or other such thinges, which be no open robberies by the high way side, nor assaulting one by night in his house, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him that is there in feare, such is the fauour of our Lawe, that for the first fault the felon shalbe admitted to his Clargie, for which purpose the Bishop must send one with authority vnder his seale to be Judge in that matter at euery gaole deliuerie. If the condemned man demaundeth to be admitted to his booke, the iudge commonly giueth him a Psalter, and turneth to what place he will. The prisoner readeth as well as he can (God knoweth sometime verie slenderly:) then he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Bishops commissarie, <hi>legit vt clericus?</hi> The Commissarie must say <hi>legit</hi> or <hi>non legit,</hi> for these bee wordes formall, and our men of Law be very precise in their wordes formall. If he say <hi>legit,</hi> the Judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth no further to sentence of death: if he say <hi>non</hi> the Judge foorth with, or the next day procéedeth to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which is done by word of mouth onely: Thou A. hast bin endicted of such a felony, and thereof ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, thou hast pleaded not guiltie, and put thy selfe vpon God and thy Countrie, they haue found thée guiltie, thou hast nothing to say for thy selfe, Lawe is, thou shalt first returne to the place from whence thou camest, from thence thou shalt goe to the place of execution, there thou shalt hange till thou be dead. Then hée saith to the Sherife, Sherife do executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: hée that claimeth his Clargie, is burned forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the presence of the Judges in the brawne of his hande with a hot yron marked with the letter <hi>T.</hi> for a théefe, or <hi>M.</hi> for a manslear, in cases where Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie

               <p>FOr any felonie, manslaughter, robberie, murther, rape, and such capitall crimes as touch not treason, and <hi>laesam maiestatem,</hi> we haue by the Lawe of England no other punishment, but to hang til they be dead: when they be dead, euery man may burie them that will, as commonly they be. Heading, tormenting, dismembring, eyther arme or legge, breaking vpon the whéele, empa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling, and such cruell torments, as be vsed in other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the order of the law, we haue not: and yet as few murthers committed as any where: nor it is not in the Judges or the Justices power, to aggrauate or mitigate the punishment of the Law, but in the Prince onely and his priuie Counsell, which is maruellous sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doone. Yet notable murtherers many times by the Princes commaundement, after they be hanged with corde till they be dead, be hanged with chaines while they rotte in the ayre.

If the wife kill her husband, she shalbe burned aliue. If the seruant kill his master, he shall be drawen on a hurdle to the place of execution: it is called <hi>petit trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> Impoysoners, if the person die thereof, by a new law made in king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eights time, shalbe boyled to death: but this mischiefe is rare, &amp; almost vnknowen<note place="margin">Quaere.</note> in England. Attempting to impoyson a man, or laying awayt to kil a man, though he wound him dangerously, yet if death follow not, is no felonie by the law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for the Prince hath lost no man, and life ought to be geuen we say, but for life onely.</p>
               <p>And againe, when a man is murdered, all be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, and shall die, euen he that doeth but hold the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to geue light to the murtherers. For mitigation and moderation of paines, is but corruption of Judges, as we thinke. Likewise, torment or question, which is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the order of the ciuill law, and custome of other countreies, to put a malefactor to excessiue paine, to make him confesse of himselfe, or of his felowes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, is not vsed in England, it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for seruile. For what can he serue the commonwealth after as a fréema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hath his body so haled and tormented, if he be not found guiltie, and what amends can be made him? And if he must die, what crueltie is it so to torment him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Likewise, confession by torment is estéemed for nothing, for if he confesse at the iudgement, the triall of the twelue goeth not vpon him: if he denie the fact, that which he said before; hindereth him not. The nature of Englishmen is to neglect death, to abide no torment: And therefore he will confesse rather to haue done any thing, yea to haue killed his owne father, than to suffer torment: for death our nation doeth not so much estéeme as a meane torment. In no place shall you sée malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors goe more constantly, more assuredly, &amp; with lesse lamentation to their death, than in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18309:54"/>Againe, the people not accustomed to sée such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tormentes, will pitie the person tormented, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the Prince and the Judges, who should bring in such crueltie amongest them, and the twelue men the rather absolue him. There is an olde lawe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that if any gaoler shall put any prysoner beyng in his custodie to any torment, to the intent to make him an approuer, that is to say, an accuser, or <hi>Index</hi> of his complices, the Gaoler shall die therefore as a felon. And to say the trueth, to what purpose is it to vse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For whether the malefactor confesse or no, and whatsoeuer he saith, if the enquest of twelue doe finde him guiltie, he dieth therefore without delay. And the malefactor, séeing there is no remedie, and that they be his Countrie men, and such as he hath himselfe agréed vnto it, doe finde him worthie death, yéeldes for the most part vnto it, and doeth not repine, but doeth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himselfe to aske mercie of God.</p>
               <p>The nature of our Nation is frée, stout, hault, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of life and bloud: but contumelie, beatings, serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and seruile torment, and punishment, it wil not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. So in this nature and fashion, our ancient prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Legislators haue nourished them, as to make them stout hearted, couragious, and souldiours, not villaines and slaues, and that is the scope almost of all our policie.</p>

               <p>IN causes ciuill there is another order: for if after the matter be pleaded to the issue, &amp; the twelue men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon impaneled, the euidence brought and pleaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them on both the parties, the twelue séeme to be partiall, and to haue giuen sentence contrarie to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence shewed vnto them: the partie gréeued may bring against them, and the partie for whom the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is giuen, a writ of attaint: and whereas before vpon the first quest commonlie they all be yeomen, now vpon this attaint must goe xxiiij. gentlemen dwelling within the shire, and twelue at the least of the hundreth where the land lyeth. The matter is pleaded againe before the same Judges. The partie defendant is not onely now he who claimeth the land, but also all and euery of the yeomen, who by their verdict did giue it him.</p>
               <p>There must in the attaint no more euidence be brought in, but onely that which was brought in and alledged before the first enquest. And if this second enquest<note place="margin">No more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the behalfe of the plaintife but of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

If this seconde enquest doe finde that the first enquest hath gone partially, and against the euidence brought in before them, the first enquest is called attainted,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18309:57"/>
and accounted as periured and infamed.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pounds. Attaints be verie seldom put in vre, partly because the gentlemen will not méete to slaunder and deface the honest yeomen their neighbours: so that of a long time, they had rather pay a meane fine than to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and make the enquest. And in the meane time they will intreate so much as in them lyeth the parties to come to some composition and agréement among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, as lightly they do, except either the corruption of the enquest be too euident, or the one partie is too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuate and headstrong. And if the gentlemen do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, gladlier they will confirme the first sentence, for the causes which I haue said, than goe against it. But if the corruption be too much euident, they will not sticke to attaint the first enquest: yet after the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue attainted the yeomen, if before the sentence be giuen by the Judge (which ordinarily for a time is differred) the parties be agreed, or one of them be dead, the attaint ceaseth.</p>
               <p>If at any time before the sentence be giuen or put in execution, there bee found some such errour in the writ, in the processe, or forme (as our lawiers be verie precise and curious of their formes) that it may be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, it is brought afresh to the disputation by a writ of errour, and all that is done reuersed.

And further, because such thinges are not commonlie done by meane men, but such as be of power and force, &amp; be not to be dealt withall of euerie man, nor of meane Gentlemen: if the riot be found &amp; certified to the Kings Connsell, or if otherwise it bee complained of, the<note place="margin">Sent for by Sub poena.</note> partie is sent for, and he must appeare in this starre

chamber, séeing (except, the presence of the Prince onely) as it were the maiestie of the whole Realme before him, being neuer so stout, he will be abashed: and being called to aunswere (as hee must come of what degrée soeuer he be) he shall be so charged with such grauitie, with such reason and remonstrance, and of those chiefe personages of England, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handeling him on that sort, that what courage soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee hath, his hart will fall to the ground, and so much the more, when if he make not his answere the better, as seldome he can so in open violence, he shal be commaunded to the Fléete, where he shall be kept in prison in such sort as these Judges shall apppoint him, lie there till he be wearie aswell of the restraint of his libertie, as of the great expences, which he must there sustaine, and for a time bee forgotten, whiles after long suite of his friendes, hee will be glad to be ordered by reason. Sometime as his desertes be, he payeth a great fine to the Prince, besides great costes and dammages to the partie, and yet the matter wherefore he attempteth this riot and violence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the common Lawe. For that is the effect of this Court to bridle such stout noble men, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which would offer wrong by force to any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner men, and can not be content to demaund or defend the right by order of Law. This court began long before, but tooke greate augmentation and authoritie at that time that Cardinall <hi>VVolsey</hi> Archbishoppe of Yorke was Chauncelor of Englande, who of some was thought to haue first deuised y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Court, because that he after same intermission by negligence of time, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the authoritie of it, which was at that time maruellous necessarie to do, to represse the insolencie of the noble men and Gentlemen of the North partes of England, who being farre from the King and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18309:60"/>
seate of iustice made almost as it were an ordinarie warre among themselues, and made their force their Lawe, banding themselues with their tenantes and seruantes to doe or reuenge iniurie one against an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they listed. This thing séemed not supportable to the noble prince King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight: and sending for them one after another to his Court to answere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the persons before named, after they had had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance shewed them of their euill demeanor, and bin well disciplined as well by wordes, as by fléeting a while, and thereby their purse and courage some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what asswaged, they began to range themselues in order, and to vnderstand that they had a Prince who would rule his subiectes by his lawes and obedience.

               <p>HE whom we call a ward in England, is called in Latine <hi>pupillus,</hi> and in Gréeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. A warde or infant is taken for a childe in base age, whose father is dead. The Romanes made two distinctions <hi>pupillum &amp; minorem,</hi> the one to xiiij. yeare old, the other was accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence to xxv. And as <hi>pupillus</hi> had <hi>tutorem,</hi> so <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> had <hi>curatorem</hi> till he came to the age of xxv. These
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18309:61"/>
tutors or curators were accountable for the reuenues of the pupils minors lands, &amp; great prouision and many lawes and orders be made for them in the bookes of the ciuil law, for rendering iust and true accounts. So that to be a gardian or tutor was accounted among them to be a charge or trouble, a thing subiect to much encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and small profite, so that diuers meanes were sought for, to excuse men from it. With vs this is clean contrarie, for it is reckoned a profite to haue a ward. For the Lord of whom the Ward doth hold the land, so soone as by the death of the father the Childe falleth Warde vnto him, hee seyseth vppon the bodie of the Ward, and his landes, of which (so that hee doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Ward) he taketh the profite without accounts, and beside that, offering to his Warde couenable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without dispergment before the age of xxj. yeares if it bee a man, of fourtéene if it bée a woman. If the Warde refuse to take that mariage, hee or shée must pay the value of the mariage, which is commonly rated according to the profite of his landes. All this while I speake of that which is called in French <hi>garde noble,</hi> that is of such as holde landes of other by knight ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,<note place="margin">Guardian in Chiualrie, and gardian in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage.</note> for that is an other kind of seruice which we call in French <hi>gard returier,</hi> we call it gard in socage, that is of such as doe not holde by knight seruice, but by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the plough. This wardship falleth to him who is next of the kinne, and cannot inherite the lande of the Warde, as the vncle by the mothers side, if the lande doe discend by the father, and of the fathers side, if the lande discend by the mother. This gardian is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the reuenues and profites of the land, as the tutor by the ciuill Lawe to the warde or pupil so soone as he is of full age.</p>
               <p>The man is not out of wardshippe by our Law till xxj. yeare olde, from thence he is reckoned of ful age, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18309:62"/>
as in the Romane Lawes at xxv. The woman at xiiij. is out of warde, for she may haue an husbande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe Knightes seruice, say our Bookes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our wiues be in the power (as I shall tell you hereafter) of their husbandes, it is no reason, she should be in two diuers gards.</p>
               <p>Many men do estéeme this wardship by Knightes seruice verie vnreasonabie and vniust, and contrarie to nature, that a Fréeman and Gentleman should bée bought and sold like an horse or an oxe, and so change gardians as maisters and Lordes: at whose gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely his bodie but his lands and his houses should bee, to be wasted and spent without accounts, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to marie at the wil of him, who is his natural lord, or his will who hath bought him to such as hee like not peraduenture, or else to pay so great a ransome. This is the occasion they say, why many gentlemen bee so euill brought vp touching vertue and learning, and but onely in deintinesse and in pleasure: and why they bee maried verie yong, and before they bee wise, and many times do not greatlie loue their wiues. For when the father is dead, who hath the naturall care of his Childe, not the mother, nor the vncle, nor the next of kinne, who by all reason would haue most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall care to the bringing vp of the infant and <hi>minor,</hi> but the Lord of whom he holdeth his lande in knightes seruice, be if the King or Quéene, Duke, Marques, or any other, hath the gouernment of his bodie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or else who that bought him at the first, seconde, or thirde hand. The Prince as hauing so many, must needes giue or sell his wardes away to other, and so he doth. Other do but séeke which way they may make most aduantage of him, as of an Oxe, or other Beaste. These all (say they) haue no naturall care of the Infant, but of their owne gaine, and especially
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18309:62"/>
the buyar will not suffer his warde to take any great paines, either in studie, or any other hardnes, least he should be sicke and die, before he hath maried his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sister, or cousin, for whose sake he bought him: and then all his money which hee paide for him should be lost. So hee who had a Father, which kept a good<note place="margin">But the Lord shall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for the wast, by losse of the warde: or treble dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, if that suffice not.</note> house, and had all thinges in order to maintaine it, shal come to his owne, after he is out of wardshippe, woods decaied, houses fallen downe, stocke wasted and gone, Lande let foorth and plowed to the baren, and to make amendes, shall pay yet one yeares rent for reliefe, and sue <hi>ouster le main,</hi> beside other charges, so that not of many yeares, and peraduenture neuer hee shall bee able to recouer, and come to the estate where his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left it. This as it is thought was first graunted vpon a great extremitie to king Henrie the 3. for a time vpon the warre which he had with the Barons, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward increased, and multiplied to more and more persons and grieuances, and will bee the decay of the nobilitie and libertie of England. Other againe say, the warde hath no wrong, for either his father pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the land, or it did discend vnto him from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors with this charge. And because hee holdeth by knightes seruice, which is in armes and defence, séeing that by age hee cannot do that whereto he is bounde by his lande, it is reason hee answere that profite to the Lord, whereby hee may haue as able a man to do the seruice. The first knightes in Rome, those that were chosen <hi>equitts Romani</hi> had <hi>equum publicum</hi> on which they serued, and that was at the charge of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and Wardes, as appeareth by <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> because that those persons could not do bodily seruice to the Common wealth. Wherefore this is no new thing, but thought reasonable in that most wise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and to the prudent King <hi>Seruius Tullius,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:18309:63"/>
As for the education of our common wealth, it was at the first <hi>militaire,</hi> and almost in all thinges the scope and deseigne thereof is <hi>militaire.</hi> Yet was it thought most like, that noble men, good knightes, and greate captaines would bring vp their wardes in their owne feates and vertues, and then marie them into like rase &amp; stocke wher they may find and make friends who can better looke to the education or better skill of the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of a Gentleman, than hée who for his higher nobilitie hath such a one to holde of him by knights seruice, or would doe it better than he that looketh or may claime such seruice of his ward, when age and yeares will make him able to doe it. That which is said that this manner of Wardshippe began in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, cannot séeme true. For in Normandie and other places of Fraunce the same order is.</p>
               <p>And that Statute made in King <hi>Henrie</hi> the thirds time touching wards, to him that will wey it wel, may séeme rather a qualification of that matter, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the fashion of wardship was long before: but of this matter an other time shall bée more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to dispute. This may suffice to declare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</p>

               <head>Of wiues and mariages. <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe wiues in England bee as I saide <hi>in potestate maritorum,</hi> not that the husbande hath <hi>vitae ac ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis potestatem,</hi> as the Romans had in the old time of their Children, for that is onely in the power of the Prince, and his lawes, as I haue said before, but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they haue before mariage, as soone as mariage is solemnised, is their husbandes, I meane of money, plate, iuelles, cattaile, and generally all moueables. For as for land and heritage followeth the succession, and is ordered by the Law as I shall say hereafter: and whatsoeuer they get after mariage, they get to their husbandes. They neither can giue nor sell any thing either of their husbandes, or their owne. Theirs no moueable thing is by the law of Englande <hi>constanti matrimonio,</hi> but as <hi>peculium serui aut filq familias:</hi> and yet in moueables at the death of her husbande she can claime nothing, but according as he shall will by his Testament, no more than his sonne can: all the rest is in the disposition of the executors, if he die testate. Yet in London and other great cities they haue that Lawe and custome, that when a man dieth, his goods be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into thrée partes. One thirde is imploied vppon the burial and the bequestes which the testator maketh in his Testament. An other third part the wife hath as her right, &amp; the third third part is the dewe and right of his children, equally to be diuided among them. So that a man there can make testament but of one third of his goods: if he die intestate, the funerals deducted the goods be equally diuided betwéene the wife and the children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18309:65"/>By the common Law of Englande if a man die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate, the Ordinarie (which is the Bishop by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intendment) sometime the Archdeacon, Deane, or Prebendarie by priuilege and prescription, doth commit the administration of the goods to the widowe or the child, or next kinsman of the dead, appointing out portions to such as naturally it belongeth vnto, and the Ordinarie by common vnderstanding hath such graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and discretion as shalbe méete for so absolute an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for the most part, following such diuision as is vsed in London, either by thirdes or halfes. Tur fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers newly conuerted to the Christian faith had, such confidence in their pastors and instructors, and tooke them to be men of such conscience that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that matter to their discretion, and belike at the first they were such as would séeke no priuate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to themselues thereby, that being once so ordeined hath still so continued. The abuse which hath followed was in part redressed by certaine actes of Parliament made in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, touching the probate of Testaments, committing of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; mortuaries. But to turne to the matter which we now haue in hande, the wife is so much in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war of her husband, that not onely her goods by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are streight made her, husbandes, and she looseth all her administration which she had of them: but also where all English men haue name and surname, as the Romans had, <hi>Marcus Tullius, Caius Pompeius, Caius Iulius,</hi> whereof the name is giuen to vs at the Font, the surname is the name of the gentilitie and stocke which the sonne doth take of the father alwaies, as the old Romans did, our daughters so soone as they be maried loose the surname of their father, and of the family and stocke whereof they do come, and take the surname of their husbandes, as transplanted from their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18309:66"/>
familie into another. So that if my wife was called before Philippe Wilford by her owne name and her fathers surname, so soone as she is maried to me she is no more called Philippe Wilford, but Philip Smith, and so must she write and signe: and as she chaungeth husbandes, so she chaungeth surnames, called alwaies by the surname of her last husbande. Yet if a woman once marie a Lorde or a Knight, by which occasion she is called my Ladie, with the surname of her husbande, if hée dye, and shée take a husbande of a meaner estate<note place="margin">Yet she is no Ladie by the common law, although so called of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</note> by whom she shall not be called Ladie (such is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we do giue to women) she shall still be called La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with the surname of her first husband and not of the second.</p>
               <p>I thinke among the old Romans' those mariages which were made <hi>per coemptionem in manum,</hi> and <hi>per e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh both the husband and the wife capable of all the benefites which our lawe doth giue vnto them and their lawfull Children. In so much that if I marie the Widowe of one lately deade, which at the time of her husbandes death was with childe, if the childe be borne after mariage solemnised with me, this Childe shalbe my heire, and is accounted my lawfull Sonne, not his whose childe it is indéede, so precisely wee doe

               <p>Although the wife be (as I haue written before <hi>in manu &amp; potestate mariti,</hi> by our Law, yet they be not kept so streit as in mew, and with a garde as they be in Italie and Spaine, but haue almost as much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as in Fraunce, and they haue for the most part all the charge of the house and houshold (as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> the wiues of the Gréekes had in their time) which is indéede the naturall occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, exercise, office and part of a wife.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lawe may séeme somewhat rigorous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wiues, yet for the most part they can handle their husbandes so well and so dulcly, and specially when their husbandes be sicke, that where the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them nothing, their husbandes at their death of their good will giue them all. And fewe there be that be not made at the death of their husbandes either sole or chiefe executrices of his last wil and testament, and haue for the most part the gouernment of the Children and their portions: except it be in London, where a peculiar order is taken by the Citie much after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of the ciuill Law.</p>

Also the manner is, that the lande which the wife bringeth to the mariage, or purchaseth afterwardes, the husbande can not sell nor alienate the same, no not with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nor shée herselfe during the mariage, except that she be sole examined by a Judge at the common lawe: and if he haue no childe by her and she die, the land go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to her next heires at the common law: but if in the mariage he haue a child by her, which is hearde once to crie, whether the childe liue or die, the husband shal haue the vsufruite of her landes, (that is the profite of them during his life) and that is called the courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of England.</p>
               <p>Likewise if the husband haue any land either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance descended or purchased and bought, if hée die before the wife, she shall haue the vsufruite of one thirde part of his landes. That is, she shall holde the one thirde part of his landes during her life as her dowrie, whether he hath childe by her or no. If he hath any children, the rest descendeth streight to the eldest: if he hath none, to the next heire at the common lawe: and if she mislike the diuision, she shal aske to be indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the fairest of his landes to the third part.</p>
               <p>This which I haue written touching mariage and the right in moueables and vnmoueables which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereby, is to be vnderstood by the common lawe when no priuate contract is more particularly made. If there be any priuate pactes, couenants, and contracts made before the mariage betwixt the husbande and the wife, by themselues, by their parents, or their friends, those haue force and be kept according to the sirmitie and strength in which they are made, And this is y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of wiues and mariage.</p>

In some places the yongest is sole heire: and in some places after an other fashion. But these being but particular customes of certaine places and out of the rule of the common lawe, do litle appertaine to the disputation of the policie of the whole Realme, and may be infinite.

               <p>AFter that wee haue spoken of all the sortes of frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to the diuersitie of their estates and persons, it resteth to say somewhat of bondmen, which were called <hi>serui,</hi> which kind of people and the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them and about them doth occupie the most part of <hi>Iustinians</hi> Digestes, and Code. The Romanes had two kindes of bondmen, the one which were called <hi>serui,</hi> and they were either which were bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, taken in warre, left by succession, or purchased by other kinde and lawfull acquisition, or else borne of their bonde women and called <hi>vernae:</hi> all those kinde of bondmen be called in our lawe villayns in grosse, as ye would say immediately bonde to the person and his heirs. An other they had (as appeareth in <hi>Iustinians</hi> time) which they called <hi>adscriptitij glebae</hi> or <hi>agri censiti.</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18309:68"/>
These were not bond to the person, but to the mannor or place, and did follow him who had the mannors, and in our law are called villaines regardantes, for because they bée as members, or belonging to the mannor or place. Neither of the one sort nor of the other haue wée any number in England. And of the first I neuer knew any in the Realme in my time: of the seconde so fewe there be, that it is not almost worth the speaking, but our lawe doeth acknowledge them in both those sorts.</p>
               <p>Manumission of all kinde of villaines or bondemen in England, is vsed and done after diuers sortes, and by other, and more light and easie meanes than is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Ciuill lawe, and being once manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is not <hi>libertus manumittentis,</hi> but simplie <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> howbeit, since our Realme hath receiued the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, which maketh vs all the Christ bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and in respect of God and Christ, <hi>conseruos,</hi> men began to haue conscience to holde in captiuitie, and such extreme bondage, him whom they must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be his brother, and as wee vse to terme him, Christian, that is, who looketh in Christ, and by Christ to haue equall portion with them in the Gospel and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>Upon this scruple, in continuance of time, and by long succession, the holy fathers, Munkes and Fryers, in their confession, and sperially in their extreame and deadly sicknesses, burdened the consciences of them whom they had vnder their hands: so that temporall men by little and little, by reason of that terror in their conscience, were glad to manumitte all their villaines: but the said holy Fathers, with the Abbots and Priors, did not in like sort by theirs, for they had also consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to empouerish and dispoyle the Churches so much as to manumit such as were bond to their Churches, or to the mannors which the Church had gotten, and so
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18309:69"/>
kept theirs still. The same did the Bishops also, till at the last, and now of late, some Bishops (to make a péece of money) manumitted theirs, partly for argent, partlie for slaunders, that they séemed more cruell than the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie: after the Monasteries comming into tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mens hands, haue béene occasion that now they bée almost all manumitted. The most part of bondemen when they were, yet were not vsed with vs so cruellie nor in that sort as the bondmen at the Romane ciuill law, as appeareth by their comedies: nor as in Gréece, as appeareth by theirs: but they were suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye copihold land, to gaine and get as other serues, that now and then their Lords might fléese them, and take a péece of money of them, as in Fraunce the Lords doe taile them whom they call their subiects, at their pleasure, and cause them to pay such summes of money as they list to put vpon them. I thinke both in France and England, the change of religion, to a more gentle, humane, and more equall sort, (as the Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in respect of the Gentiles,) caused this olde kinde of seruile seruitude and slauerie, to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that moderation, for necessitie first to villaines regardants, and after to seruitude of lands and tenures, and by little and litle finding out more ciuil and gentle meanes, and more equall to haue that done which in time of heathenesse, seruitude or bondage did, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished the whole. For although all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be brethren by baptisme in Jesu Christ and therefore may appeare equally frée, yet some were, and still might be christened being bond and serue, and whom as the baptisme did finde, so it did leaue them, for it changeth not ciuill lawes nor compacts amongst men which be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to Gods lawes, but rather main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth them by obedience.</p>
               <p>Which seeing men of good conscience hauing that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18309:69"/>
scruple whereof I wrote before, haue by little and little found meanes to haue and obtaine the profite of serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and bondage which gentilitie did vse, and is vsed to this day amongst Christians on the one part, &amp; Turkes and Gentiles on the other part, when warre is betwixt them vpon those whom they take in battaile. Turkes and Gentiles I call them, which vsing not our Lawe the one beléeueth in one God, the other in many Gods, of whome they make images. For the lawe of Jewes is well inough knowen, and at this day so farre as I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne, amongst all people Jewes be holden as it were in a common seruitude, and haue no rule nor dominion as their owne prophesies doe tel, that they should not haue, after that Christ promised to them, was of them refused: for when they would not acknowledge him, obstinately forsaking their helpe in soule for the life to come, and honor in this world for the time present, not taking the good tidings, newes, and Euangell brought to them by the great grace of God, and by the promise of the Prophets fructified in vs which be Gentiles, and brought forth this humanitie, gentlenesse, honor, &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie knowledge which is séene at this present. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the purpose.</p>
               <p>This perswasion I say of Christians, not to make nor kéepe his brother in Christ, seruile, bonde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling for euer vnto him, as a beast rather than as a man, and the humanitie which the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doeth teach, hath engendred through Realmes (not néere to Turkes and Barbarians) a doubt, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and scruple to haue seruants and bondmen: yet necessitie on both sides, of the one to haue helpe, on the other to haue seruice, hath kept a figure or fashion thereof. So that some would not haue bondmen, but <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripticii glebae,</hi> and villaines regardant to the ground,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18309:70"/>
to the intent their seruice might be furnished, and that the countrey being euill, vnholsome, and otherwise bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, should not be desolate. Others afterwards founde out the wayes and meanes, that not the men, but the land should be bound, and bring with it such bondage and seruice to him that occupieth it, as to carie Lords dung vnto the fields, to plowe his ground at certaine dayes, sowe, reape, come to his Court, sweare faith vnto him, and in the end to hold the land but by copie of the Lords Court rolle, and at the will of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This tenure is called also in our lawe, villayne, bonde, or seruile tenure, yet to consider more déeply all land, euen that which is called most frée land, hath a bondage annexed vnto it, not as naturally the lower ground must suffer and receiue the water &amp; filth which falleth from the higher ground, nor such as <hi>Iustinian</hi> speaketh of, <hi>de seruitudinibus praediorum rusticorum &amp; vrbanorum,</hi> but the land doeth bring a certaine kind of seruitude to the possessor. For no man holdeth lande simply frée in England, but he or shee that holdeth the crowne of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: all others hold their land in fée, that is, vpon a faith or trust, and some seruice to be done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Lord of a mannor, as his superior, and he againe of an higher Lord, till it come to the prince, and him that holdeth the crowne.</p>
               <p>So that if a man die, and it be founde that hee hath land which he holdeth, but of whom no man can tell, this is vnderstoode to be holden of the crowne, and in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, which is much like to knights seruice, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto it thrée seruices, homage, warde, and mariage: that is, he shall sweare to be his man, and to be true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of whom he holdeth the land, His sonne who hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the land after the death of his father, shalbe maried where it pleaseth the Lord.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18309:70"/>
He y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>holdeth the land must fréely of a temporal man (for franke almose and franke mariage hath another cause and nature) holdeth by fealtie onely, which is, he shall sweare to be true to the Lord, and doe such seruice as appertayneth for the lande which hee holdeth of the Lord.</p>
               <p>So that all frée land in England is holden in fée, or <hi>feodo,</hi> which is as much to say, as <hi>in fide,</hi> or <hi>fiducia.</hi> That is, in trust and confidence, that he shall be true to the Lord of whom he holdeth it, pay such rents, do such seruice, and obserue such conditions as were annexed to the first donation. Thus all sauing the Prince bée not <hi>veri domini,</hi> but rather <hi>fiduciarii domini,</hi> and <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessores,</hi>

he interpreteth <hi>vetitum namium,</hi> in what language I know not: whereas in trueth it is in plaine Dutche, &amp; in our olde Saxon language, <hi>wyther nempt, alterum accipere, or vicissim rapere,</hi> a worde that betokeneth that which in barbarous Latine is called <hi>represalia,</hi> when one taking of me a distresse, which in Latine is called <hi>pignus,</hi> or any other thing, and carrying it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the iurisdiction wherein I dwell, I take by order of him that hath iurisdiction, another of him again or of some other of that iurisdiction, and doe bring it into the iurisdiction wherein I dwell, that by equall wrong I may come to haue equall right. The maner of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presalia,</hi> and that we call withernam, is not altogether one: but the nature of them both is as I haue descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the proper signification of the wordes doe not much differ.</p>
               <p>But to returne thether where wée did digresse: ye sée that where the persons be frée, and the bodies at full libertie, and <hi>maxime ingenui,</hi> yet by annexing a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the land, there is meanes to bring the owners and possessors thereof into a certaine seruitude, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther libertinitie: That the Tenants beside paying the rent accustomed, shall owe to the Lord a certaine faith, duetie, trust, obedience, and (as we terme it) certaine seruice, as <hi>Libertus,</hi> or <hi>Cliens patrono:</hi> which because it doeth not consist in the persons, for the respect in them doth not make them bonde, but in the land &amp; occupation therof, it is more properly expressed in calling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the other Lord of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fée, then either <hi>libertus</hi> or <hi>cliens</hi> can doe the one, or <hi>patronus</hi> the other: for these wordes touch rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> persons, &amp; the office &amp; duety betwéene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

But this is onely by couenant, and for a time, and during the time it is <hi>vera seruitus.</hi> For whatsoeuer the apprentice getteth of his owne laboure, or of his maisters occupation or stocke, he getteth to him whose apprentice hee is, he must not lie foorth of his masters dores, he must not occupie any stocke of his owne, nor mary without his maisters licence, and he must doe all seruile offices about the house, and bée obedient to all his masters commaundementes, and shall suffer such correction as his maister shall thinke méet, and is at his maisters cloathing and nourishing, his maister being bounde onely to this which I haue said, and to teach him his occupation, and for that hee serueth, some for seuen or eight yeares, some nine or tenne yeares, as the masters and the friendes of the young man shall thinke méete, or can agrée: altogether (as <hi>Polidore</hi> hath noted) <hi>quasi pro emptitio seruo:</hi> neuerthelesse that neither was the cause of the name Apprentise, neither yet doeth the worde betoken that which <hi>Polidore</hi> supposeth, but it is a French word, and betokeneth a learner or scholer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apprendre</hi> in French is to learne, and <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> is as much to say in French (of which tongue wée borrowed this worde, and many more other,) as <hi>discipulus</hi> in Latine: Likewise he to whom hée is bounde, is not called his Lord, but his master, as ye would say, his Teacher. And the pactions agréed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be put in writing, signed and sealed by the parties, and registred for more assurance: without being such an Apprentice in London, and seruing out such a serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the same Citie for the number of yeares agréed vpon, by order of the Citie amongst them, no man bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer so much borne in London, and of parents Londoners, is admitted to bée a Citizen or frée man of London: the like is vsed in other great Cities of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18309:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Besides apprentises, others be hyred for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and be called seruants, or seruing men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">The sonnes of freemen of London are also free by byrth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome.</note> throughout the whole Realme, which be not in such bondage as apprentises, but serue for the time for dayly ministerie, as <hi>serui</hi> and <hi>ancillae</hi> did in the time of gentilitie, and be for other matters in libertie as ful frée men and women.</p>
               <p>But all seruants, labourers, and others not maried, must serue by the yeare: and if he be in couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he may not depart out of his seruice without his masters lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and he must geue his master warning that hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, one quarter of a yeare before the terme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare expireth, or els he shall be compelled to serue out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeare. And if any young man vnmaried be without seruice, he shalbe compelled to get him a master, whom he must serue for that yeare, or els he shall be punished with stockes and whipping, as an idle vagabond. And if any man, maried or vnmaried, not hauing rent or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sufficient to maintaine himselfe, doe liue so idlie, he is enquired of, and sometime sent to the gaole, sometime otherwise punished as a sturdie vagabond: so much our policie doeth abhorre idlenes. This is one of the chiefe charges of the Justices of peace in euery shire. It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for vngentlenes and dishonor, and a shew of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if any gentleman doe take another gentlemans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant (although his master hath put him away) without some certificate from his master, either by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that he hath discharged him of his seruice. That which is spoken of men seruants, the same is also spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of women seruants. So that all youth that hath not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reuenues to maintaine it selfe, must néedes with vs serue, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> after an order as I haue written. Thus necessity &amp; want of bondmen hath made men to vse frée men as bondmen to al seruile seruices: but yet more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally and fréely, and with a more equalitie and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18309:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than in time of gentilitie slaues and bondmen were wont to bee vsed, as I haue said before. This first and latter fashion of temporall seruitude, and vpon paction is vsed in such countries, as haue left off the old accustomed manner of seruauntes, slaues, bondmen, and bondwomen, which was in vse before they had receiued the Christian faith. Some after one sort, and some either more or lesse rigorouslie, according as the nature of the people is enclined, or hath deuised amongst themselues for the necessitie of seruice.</p>

               <p>THe Archbishops and Bishops haue a certaine pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar iurisdiction vnto them especially in four man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of causes: Testamentes and legations, Tithes and mortuaries, mariage and adulterie or fornication, and also of such thinges as appertaine to orders amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest themselues and matters concerning religion. For as it doth appeare, our ancestors hauing the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth before ordeined and set in frame, when they did agrée to receaue the true and Christian religion, that which was established before, and concerned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne policie (which their Apostles, Doctors, and Preachers did allowe) they helde and kept still with that which they brought in of newe. And those thinges in kéeping whereof they made conscience, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them to bee ordered and gouerned as such thinges of which they had no skill, &amp; as to men in whom for the holinesse of their life and good conscience, they had a great and sure confidence. So these matters
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18309:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ordered in their Courtes, and after the fashion and maner of the law ciuill or rather common by citation. libell, <hi>contestationem litis,</hi> examination of witnesses pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily, by exceptions, replications apart and in writing, allegations, matters by sentences giuen in writing, by appellations from one to an other as well <hi>a graua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> as <hi>a sententia dèfinitiua,</hi> and so they haue other names, as Proctor, Aduocates, Assessors, Ordinaries, and Commissaries, &amp;c. farre from the maner of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the common law of Englande, and from that fashion which I haue shewed you before. Wherefore if I say the Testament is false and forged, I must sue in the spirituall Law, so also if I demaunde a legacie: but if I sue the Executor or Administrator, which is he in our Lawe, who is in the ciuill Lawe <hi>haeres,</hi> or <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum mobilium possessor ab intestato</hi>) for a debt which the dead ought me, I must sue in the temporall Court. These two courtes the Temporall and the Spiritual, be so diuided, that whosoeuer sueth for any thing to Rome or in any spirituall court for that cause or action which may bee pleaded in the temporall Court of the Realme, by an olde lawe of Englande hee falleth into a <hi>premunire,</hi> that is, he forfetteth all his goods to the Prince, and his bodie to remaine in Prison during the Princes pleasure: and not that onely, but the Judge, the Scribe, the Procurer and Assessor which receiueth and doth maintaine that vsurped pleading, doth incur the same daunger. Whether the word <hi>premuniri</hi> doth betoken that the authoritie &amp; iurisdiction of the Realme is prouided for before, and defended by that Law, and therefore it hath that name <hi>praemunire</hi> or <hi>praemuniri,</hi> or because that by that Lawe such an attemptor hath had warning giuen before to him of the daunger into which he falleth by such attempt, and then <hi>praemunire</hi> is barbarouslie written for <hi>praemonere, praemoneri</hi> (as some
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18309:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men haue helde opinion) I wil not define, the effect is as I haue declared: and the Lawe was first made in king <hi>Richard</hi> the secondes time, and is the remedie which is vsed when the spirituall iurisdiction will goe about to encroach any thing vpon the temporall courts. Because this court or forme which is called <hi>curia chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitatis,</hi> is yet taken as appeareth for an externe and forraine court, and differeth from the policie and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernment of the Realme, and is an other court (as appeareth by the acte and writ of <hi>praemunire,</hi>) than <hi>curia regis aut reginae:</hi> Yet at this present this court as well as others, hath her force, power, authoritie, rule and iurisdiction, from the royall maiestie, and the crowne of England, &amp; from no other forrain potentate or power vnder God, which being graunted (as in déede it is true) it may now appeare thy some reason that the first statute of <hi>praemunire</hi> whereof I haue spoken, hath now no place in England, séeing there is no pleading <hi>alibi quam in curia regis ac reginae.</hi>
