         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY knowing that <hi>Hades,</hi> a terme vſed in the Creede, is the place
generall, where ſoules are before Gods throne, diuided there, fat
enough, by heauen &amp; hell, ſo that in ſpeach of the holy, <hi>Hades</hi> the
generall, by difference of the Perſon, is <hi>Heauen,</hi> and in the wicked,
<hi>Hell,</hi> as we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly terme <hi>Hell:</hi> which place is on high, out of this
world by Apo. 14. &amp; all Iewes in <hi>Cether Malc.</hi> fol. 11. by knowing
of this great light cometh to Religion. Firſt their opinion falleth,
who thank God for ſending his ſonne to redeeme the Fathers from
<hi>Hades,</hi> to <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> that is, from Paradiſe to Paradiſe. So <hi>Limbus
Patrum</hi> and <hi>Purgatorie</hi> fall: when <hi>Hades</hi> hath onely two partes,
Heauen and Hell. So our madnes falleth, who in the Creede, put
for that Part of <hi>Hades,</hi> which holdeth the faithfull, and is heauen
or Paradiſe, the part which holdeth the wicked, and put for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
Hell, to which they that goe, periſh for euer. Here ſtandeth the
Article: Our Lord being in body crucified, dead and buried, had a
ſoule immortall, as all men, which went hence to God: &amp; being in
<hi>Hades,</hi> holy, had not hell but heauen. This is all. When the Goſpel
began ſcant any held ſoules immortall. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſheweth that. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was needfull the Creed ſhould haue it. When the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was graunted, very many Creedes did omit the article: becauſe
in ſpeach of a man, to die &amp; to go to <hi>Hades</hi> is all one. Of an horſe,
Grekes would ſay, <hi>he is dead.</hi> Of a man, more: <hi>He is dead &amp; gone to
Hades.</hi> This matter vnknowen hath vexed the world by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of one Greeke worde. And two Biſhops vexed their owne. Againſt
whom two ſmal writings folow: beſides much otherwiſe printed &amp;

               <hi>they must blame
them ſelves: and not rage with hereticall Satanean madnes vpon
ſuch as force them to faith. Now what grace the D. hath in his
wordes, all may ſoone iudge: conſidering what him ſelfe graunteth:
and how in his eſcape afterwardes he differeth from all the worlde.
This was the question:</hi> Whether our Lords ſoule went hence
to Gehenna: or hence to Paradiſe: <hi>Iohn Cant. and all vexed by
him know that, and for one of theſe two opinions the Princes religion
was to be esteemed. And if I. C. had invented a going from Paradiſe
to Gehenna, Geneveans would haue renowned him over the world.
Now marke how rightly the right reverend Father and Doctor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of him ſelfe the lye vnto him ſelfe, fol 219.</hi> We haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in the word of God ſo to faſten Chriſts ſoule vnto Hell
for the time of his death, that it might not be in Paradiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it deſcended into Hell. <hi>Now</hi> Iohn Cant. <hi>will graunt, that
he damneth them both: and iustifieth the adverſary, as a Greeke E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
printed at</hi> Hannawe <hi>required Sir</hi> Iohn Forteſcue <hi>once
Queene Elizabeths greek Reader, to determine, whether both Biſhops
were not condemned most certeinly by their owne graunt. The ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
feigning of a new Satanean fable that our Lord went from
Paradiſe to Gehenna: and to Hades, as from Paulls to London, from
Winchester to England, from England to Europe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Europe to this
world, from part to the whole: and againe, the fable that he went not
to Hades, that is, in trueth, to the world of ſoules, till his body was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
and again his feigning thriſe, at Paules, Hades in S. Matthew,
cap. 5. twiſe, with 10. once, where Gehenna is the text, perverting the
originall with wresting Scriptures and Fathers to an opinion that
neuer came into holy mindes, this excuſeth not his Lye, but
augmenteth his impiety: that befooleth all Scriptures of
God, and all Divines that ever have bene in the
world. Curſed be he that maketh the blinde
wander out of the way, and let all
the people ſay, Amen.</hi>

            <head>The argument and effect of the Epistle
following.</head>
            <p>I. C. was adviſed in a worke dedicated to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and
to the moſt Noble, our King now, That he ſhould not burne for
<hi>Gehennaes</hi> honour, leaſt he burned in <hi>Geheaenaes</hi> ſhame for ever and
ever: At the firſt he ſkoffed all trueth of God and the King: but
being taught how he was caught in his owne ſyllogiſme thus: The
place which our Lordes ſoule went to hence, telleth what <hi>Hades</hi> (his
<hi>HELL</hi>) meaneth in the Creede: But <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is the place which our
Lord went to hence: Therefore Paradiſe is the <hi>HELL</hi> of the Creed,
being taught how he was caught, he ſent his Chaplayne M. <hi>Greffrey
King,</hi> obteyning the Queenes hand for his leaue, to agree with his
adverſarie: and he vpon agreement, returned preſently, ſaying that
he ſhould be ſent againe: but preſently after he came home, hee
would write. Conditions were not kept. The libell was ſtill ſolde:
and <hi>Machmadiſme</hi> was in it: and a contumelious mockage of Chriſt
and all Chriſtians &amp; Iewes: when he ſaid <hi>Ruben</hi> the Iewe his Ebrew
Epiſtle was forged: whereby he hindred the defence of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and deſerved rooting out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides that, after the King was ours,
Paules ſold the treaſon of the libel. For not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to his covenant,
three Greeke Orations plaid vpon him: and one dedicated to the
King and <hi>Brettiſh</hi> nation in Queene <hi>Elizabets</hi> dayes: And after all,
this Epiſtle. At the firſt ſight he laid the blame on <hi>Bar Lo,</hi> that vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
his auctoritie, as being guiltles: yet when at the Court a Duke
ſhewed what he had done, he fell as dead, &amp; ſoone died. The party
greeued was much greeued at his death: becauſe he had proteſted
he never ſpake againſt him. Yet as <hi>Ely,</hi> ſo he by ſoftnes paid for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
blame: while he repreſſed not bad ſoules. And his Gentlemen
wiſhed <hi>Bar Lo</hi> vnborne: as more griefe to the Archbiſhop then all
that ever were his adverſaries: not only for his libel againſt the
Scottiſh miſt: full of moſt deadly treaſon: and full of blaſpemy and
lying againſt God and man: But alſo for his Satanean declamation
at Paules againſt the beſt Nobilitie, and the beſt bent for the good
of the State: againſt whom the Iſcariot railed and raged: whereby
the Nobilitie iuſtly terme him: The vileſt that is this day vnder the
cope of heaven: as bent againſt God, the King, the Nobilitie, and
all humanitie. So <hi>Bar Lo</hi> will be his notation.</p>

a rocke: that no ſtorme, windes, nor waues can ſhake it. And if we

through the vaile of his fleſh into the moſt holy. Which they that
will denie, may as well denie all religion and trueth of God. You
haue moſt highly iniuried the Maieſtie of God: pretendinge that
<pb facs="tcp:14233:4"/>
               <hi>Sheol</hi> Pſal. 16. was the Devils lodge, which no Ebrew euer thought,
neither ſuffreth Moſes to thinke: contemning the Goſpell for the
hand of God receaving the holy ſoule of our Lord: pervertinge ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of death into the ſecond death, Act. 2. to befooll all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
turning Saint Paul to <hi>Gehennean</hi> darknes: where he purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſpeaketh of the Goſpells brightnes: in theſe three iniuries you
ſtaine all the Bible, while you make ſome iarr from all the reſt, and
befoole the moſt holy Writers. This your ſinne is haynous. So
your deſpiſing of Ebrew DD. For their owne tongue, wilbe holden
of the Scottiſh miſt and <hi>Brettiſh</hi> nation, and all nations a brutiſh
parte. and no leſſe the reiecting of Heathen Greeke, for the Creede
penned for heathen: and your reſtrayning of Greeke only to Poets:
and your teaching as generall that <hi>Hades</hi> in them is vgly, this your
learning wil be holden babiſh. Alſo where D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> reiecteth the
world of ſoules, as checking all Iewes in their owne tongue, his
wrangling was ſenſeles: that he knew no place where ſoules were
togeather. Hath he euer ſeene in this world all bodyes togeather;
other ſaw them not, yet the ſpeach, this world is currant with all
men. And for <hi>Hades</hi> Macedones call it Heaven. <hi>Portus</hi> Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
would haue taught you ſo much, though you ſought no dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Graetians. And in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Hades</hi> is <hi>Iuppiter.</hi>
To your blame for denying the lxx. in Pſal. 110. a warrant for the
New Teſt. Greeke, you ſay nothing, as damned. And D. <hi>Bilſon</hi>
ſaith: the Greeke Fathers vnderſtood not <hi>Joſephs Haden.</hi> Such
owles you bring to <hi>Athens:</hi> and make your <hi>Witgifte</hi> a ſcoph to all
learned. Alſo you anſwer nothing to your blame for ſaying, that
it were better the trueth of <hi>Daniel</hi> were hid, then antiquitie ſhould
be diſgraced for miſſing. Others thought it a graceleſſe ſpeach. So
when you condemne Saint Paul for curſing <hi>Ananias,</hi> which thing
he was bound to doe, by expreſſe lawes, for ſtryking treacherouſlie,
and miſleading the blind, you check Chriſt that promiſed a mouth
that no adverſarie could reſiſt, and befoole Moſes for making a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for an open impudent iudge. The blind, the deafe, the officers
may not lightly be curſed: but in open wilfulnes they be curſed, as
<hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Sedechias</hi> of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and the Phariſes. Mat. 23.
Herein you ſtand at the mercy of God. Moreover touching. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Ruben</hi> the Iew, you haue iniuried Chriſt our Lord, &amp; all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
moſt wickedly. If he had not bene anſwered, all Chriſtians
<pb facs="tcp:14233:5"/>
had bene worſe thought of. Now he &amp; all the Iewes in the Empire
ſpeak better of Chriſtianity. And ſome by that haue bene baptized:
and one D. told that he would be baptized and come to Englande:
he is the man that prefaced to Aruc. So a rare learned Iew, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at <hi>Baſil</hi> one gaue <hi>Rubens</hi> epiſtle, and ſhewed the apoſtles <hi>Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall</hi>
rare ſkil, he made requeſt to the Profeſſours, when the party
was gone, to deſire him to returne to inſtruct him more fully: (but
the party could not) and afore requeſted his teacher to tranſlate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ebrew, as he ſpake to him, the new Teſtament. This deſerued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then your language. You ſay the party feigned that whiche is
written of his praiſe: and ſcoph his ſkil in Ebrew and Greeke: and
terme him an aſſe, and offre all diſgrace. For all, Chriſtians &amp; Iewes
ſhould thinke you vnworthy to haue the benefit of Chriſtian poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
And as you know you haue the Anathema maran Atha giuen
you. It returneth to the giuer if you deſerue it not. If your deſert be
doubtles, you are ſurely miſerable: as in your perpetual vntruthes
and miſvſing of the Realmes authoritie to Satans ſlavery. So when
you ſcophed the hope in the <hi>Scottiſh mist,</hi> and the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> nation,
what meant you but to endeuor to ſet millions to kill one another.
Six yeres <hi>Beza</hi> noiſed a Teſtament bent badly, and <hi>Geneua</hi> meant
to kill one for leaning on the Scottiſh miſt: as three Scottes there
then tolde the party: and <hi>Beza</hi> wrote much alike to your old head.
Yet the party boldly printed the Scottiſh miſt then to be his King.
And now with what face can you looke for any good ſubiect, who
knowes the bleſſing of the Scottiſh miſt turned to a ſhyning ſunne
ever to wiſh you well: after your ſo great endevour to overthrow
your owne nation; The <hi>Brettiſh</hi> nation would, as <hi>Davids 37.</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
haue layde their life in their hands for their lefull Prince, then
