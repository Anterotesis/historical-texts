            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

An Intereſt in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the Satisfaction of the Death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is that by which every Chriſtian muſt ſtand or <hi>fall</hi> before the dreadful Tribunal of the Juſtice of God.

            <p>It pleaſed God in gracious Condeſcenſion to Human Frailty, before the Fulneſs of Time came that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould offer up himſelf, once in the End of the World, when he appeared to put away Sin <hi>by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> in that mean time to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Sacrifices which were not voluntary Devotions by the Will of Man, either gratulatory to God, or repreſentative to the Offerer, but exact Performances according to the expreſs Precept of God.

            <p>It evidently alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Sacrifices were of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, becauſe they were only to be ſuch Offerings of Beaſts and Fowl, as were not by natural Diſtinction, but by poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſelected to be clean and made capable to be ſacrificed; all other Species being excluded as unclean.</p>

            <p>This Reconciliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſfion is always expreſſed under the Notion of Ranſom, Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Redemption, Propitiation and Expiation; all which is to be performed by the Death of a ſlain Sacriſice:<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> For the Scripture teſtifies, without ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion of Sins.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> But it is not poſſible that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99140:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away Sins.</p>
            <p>The Divine Justice could not take Plcaſure in any Sacrifices which were offered (tho by the Typical Law) for Sin, ſo as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to receive Satisfaction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Son of God came into the World, a Body was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him, therein to do the Will of God; by the which Will we are ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99140:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out the atoning Propitiation and Satisfaction only obtained by the Blood of Chriſt, is an evil Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to palliate the deſperate Wickedneſs and Sinfulneſs of Sin, to make void the Law of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Righteouſneſs which is the in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Worſhippers thus purged, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.2.</note> as the Scripture ſaith, having no more Conſcience of Sins,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note>

God, to believe on him whom he hath ſent.</p>
            <p>For this is the true <hi>Cabala,</hi> the faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation,<note place="margin">1 Tim 1.15.</note> That Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came into the World to ſave even chief Sinners.</p>
            <p>In the Caſes of Life and Death according to univerſal Juſtice in the World, it is fatal not only to be an Outlaw, flying from Juſtice, Mute in refuſing to anſwer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but it proves no leſs mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to ſuggeſt a Plea which the Law will not allow.</p>
            <p>If a Criminal condemned to die be favoured with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, and then by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign's Commiſſion intruſted with an important Imployment, the faithful Diſcharge of that Truſt is meer Duty, but not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and he remains ſtill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor, liable to the former Sentence by the Law of Attaint and Death, from which not any thing can deliver but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99140:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Soveraign, laid hold on, and legally pleaded by the Criminal. It is thus according to the Rule of Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Judg of all the World and every Mortal Creature, that God might be juſt, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.25, 26</note> and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him which believeth in Jeſus. Therefore we muſt not be ignorant of Saton's Devices; the Popiſh Doctrine of Merit, by Works ſprinkled (as they ſay) by the Blood of Chriſt, available to Juſtification and Salvation, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1, 2.</note> is an Antichriſtian Departure from the Faith, and the teaching of Lies in Hypocriſy: For there cannot be any Work poſſible to be accepted by Divine Juſtice, but what is an Act of Obedience to the Law; and the beſt Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of ſuch is but, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, that of an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant; <note place="margin">Luke 17.10.</note> When we ſhall have done all thoſe things which are commanded us, we muſt ſay, We have done that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99140:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was our Duty to do. Therefore the Obſervance of a preſent Duty (the Neglect or Male-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof would be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Guilt) cannot in any juſt Conſtruction be aſſumed or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to expiate a precedent Tranſgreſſion guilty of Felony and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Yet this Truth doth not in any degree exempt from the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable and indiſpenſable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Duty annexed to the Covenant of Grace: So that there is not in the leaſt degree any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for Antinomian Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation,</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99140:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fulfilling of the Law.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another Method of the Depths of Satan to cloud the Glory of God's free Grace, and the compleat Merit of Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs, and alſo to ſhake the Confidence of a Sinner's Hope to obtain Remiſſion and Acceptance, by ſuborning the Act of Faith to ſhare in the Merits of Chriſt. Now how weak and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this Suppoſition is, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Conſideration of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Caſes of Civil and Natural Inſtances in Judicature: Tho the guilty Perſon cannot have Benefit unleſs he plead the Royal Pardon, yet there is no Virtue in the Plea and humble Claim, but only in the extenſive Validity of the Pardon. Likewiſe in deſperate Sickneſs, or deadly Wound, the healing Virtue is not in the meer Application, or receiving the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Balm, or <hi>Elixir;</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Patient cannot be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99140:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
healed without the Reception or Application of the Remedy.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with a Sinner before the Divine Tribunal: Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Truth and Goodneſs of the Promiſe, and embraces and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon it; that is, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt for compleat Salvation from the Condemnation and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſinful Death, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Acceptance with God, and for Participation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to be communicated to all thoſe who by Faith receive Chriſt, and ſo have an Union of Life with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now as in the Body the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Nerve is the Ligament, the Veſſel and Conveyance for vital Union and Motion unto all the Members by the Blood and Animal Spirits: So Faith to the Soul is a Means of vital Union with Chriſt, and of the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Merits of Chriſt. All
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99140:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is effected by the Spirit of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Cor. 5.17.</note> without which we are none of Chriſt's, <note place="margin">James 2.26.</note> and Faith it ſelf is dead.</p>
            <p>The Look of one ſtung, with the deadly fiery Serpent, to the Brazen Serpent, had no ſhare in the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue of that Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; yet without looking up to the Brazen Serpent the Perſon ſtung could receive no Benefit but muſt die. So Faith hath no juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue inherent in it ſelf: For what may prevail to juſtify, muſt make the Conſcience perfect. Conſequently the Efficient of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection muſt of it ſelf be perfect; but Faith cannot be ſuch, for it is not of our ſelves, <note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> it is the Gift of God.

Faith is not able through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Corruption to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any perfect Work. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture repreſents the Lord Jeſus Chriſt under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the weak in Faith, <note place="margin">Iſa. 42.3. Mat. 12.20</note> that he will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax, but will bring forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Victory: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from any Virtue and Power inherent in the Work of Faith, but from the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Strength, <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.24.</note> which only is to be found in the Lord Jeſus by (periſhing) Sinners, who ſly for Refuge unto the Hope that is ſet before them, Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Even as the Man-ſlayer under the Law could not be ſecure from the Avenger of Blood, if he were found out of the City of Refuge; it was only the City of Refuge which conferr'd and eſtabliſhed his Preſervation and Safety: So
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99140:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Sinner cannot be ſaved from Wrath to come, without Faith in Chriſt. But the Propitiation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, by the Blood of the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, can only make a Sinner perfect before the Tribunal of God's infinite Juſtice. Therefore to aſſign any degree of Ability to any Act of Faith as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Juſtification, is to uſurp upon Chriſt, and to incur the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Animadverſion of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. <note place="margin">Job. 40.14.</note>

            <p>For the State of every Man ſince the Fall is a Complication of Miſery under Condemuation, Dementation, and mortal Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

a new End and Mark, the Glory of God, and the Prize of our high Calling in Chriſt Jeſus, our Eternal Salvation.</p>

            <p>It being impoſſible to make way for immenſe Mercy to be manifeſted without Satisfaction to infinite Juſtice which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt be expoſed to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Contempt, and Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Accordingly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> whom God hath ſet forth for a Propiriation, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins; that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him, even of the ungodly, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Jeſus.

towards God, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Scripture fully and always teſtifies, that Remiſſion of Sins is an Act of abſolute Sovereign Juſtice, vouchſafed upon plenary Satisfaction, repreſented under the Notion and Terms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <note place="margin">Rom. 3.24, 25.</note> Propitiation, Ranſom; which word <gap reason="foreign">

according to the judicial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Sentence of Law. This cannot poſſibly be obtained, or performed, unleſs due Satisfaction were made to the infinite Juſtice of the Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>For Pardon upon any other leſs or diluted account muſt leave the Juſtice of God violated and void of Satisfaction: Alſo the Sinner muſt be without poſſbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Conſcience free from Guilt; conſequently never able to arrive at Peace, <note place="margin">Act. 13.39. &amp; 10.36, 43.</note> which flows from being juſtified by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1. Eph. 2.14.</note> who is our Peace with God.</p>
            <p>It is alſo abſurd Contradiction to imagine any Benefit can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be <hi>obtained</hi> by the atoning Virtue of the Death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, regenerating Power of the Spirit of Chriſt make the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a new Creature.</p>
            <p>There is the manifold multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious Wiſdom of God magniſied
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99140:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to a Sinner, that the Work of Grace may be compleatly perfect, in reſpect of the Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and of the damning Guilt and deadly Corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the deſperate Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every Sin.</p>
            <p>Yet the manifold Wiſdom of God decreeing from Eternity, and effecting in the fulneſs of Time, the Redemption of Sinners by the Blood of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, could not poſſibly have any Cauſe or Motive antecedent to the <hi>Eternal</hi> Purpoſe of God, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus out Lord, and from the beginning of the World was hid in God.</p>
            <p>For it was both impoſſible for a ſinite narrow Intelligence, to conceive how God ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh: And it would have been impious, blaſphemous Preſumption, to imagine that the Son of God, who knew no Sin, ſhould be made a Propitiatory Sacrifice for Sin, unleſs the Will
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99140:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God had ſo promiſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>Indeed the immenſe Goodneſs of God made this known imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Man's Apoltacy, by the Promiſe of the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to break the Serpent's Head;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> that is, to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and more evidently by the Inſtitution of Sacrifices. For it is a moſt abſurd Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Soveraignty of a Creator, and Contradiction to the Duty of a Creature, to impoſe upon God the neceſſity of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the groundleſs Fancy of a guilty Malefactor in the higheſt degree of deſperate Wickedneſs,<note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> to be a Price of Redemption from everlaſting Wrath: Conſidering alſo that Man had no Title of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or rightful Power over any of his Follow-Creatures,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any of them a Sacrifice for his Sin.</p>
            <p>Indeed It was an early and due Apprehenſion that every Sin was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99140:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of capital Guilt, and Forfeiture of Life: But it could never have entered into the Heart of Man, to conceive how God could be juſt, and the Juſtifier of Sinners,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.26. &amp; 4.5.</note> until God had revealed it by his Spirit and the Word of his Grace. The Apprehenſion of Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attainable by Sanguinary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, could not be a Primary Notion in any Human Mind, but conſequent and derivative from the Inſtitution of Sacrifices by the expreſs Command and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, without which it was impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>For Faith cannot be or ſubſiſt without a word of Command and Promiſe: But to fancy a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip to appeaſe the juſt Wrath, and to conciliate the Favour of the Majeſty of the Great and Terrible God, the Creator of all Beings, by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Offering not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted expreſly by God, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption becoming a dumb Idol,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99140:26"/>
or ſome precarious Superſtition; and is an effectual practical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the inſinite Perfections of God, obtruding and impoſing the Blood and Carcaſs of a wretched Calf or Sheep, to expiate the Guilt of moſt nefandous Crimes, and ſatisfy infinite Juſtce. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any poſſible ground of Reaſon to imagine that the Ceremonial Ordinances of Sacrifices,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.1.</note> and other Rites of Divine Worſhip and Service, were inſtituted by God, with reſpect to, or Motive from the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Practice or Expectation of profane Sinners, who offered their Devotion to Devils, as the Word of God expreſly teſtifies,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.20.</note> That <hi>the things which the Gentiles ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sacrifices, and all other Typical Services and Ordinances, were by God appointed, until the time of Reformation, when Chriſt came an High Prieſt of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99140:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good things to come, (that is everlaſting) who by the eternal Spirit offer'd himſelf without Spot to God, by his own Blood to purge our Conſciences from dead Works (that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> from Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Death) to ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>The Ceremonial Law had a Shadow of good things to come, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.1, 4, to 10.</note> but not Virtue to make the Comers thereunto perfect; <hi>For it is not poſſible that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore becauſe in Sacrifices and Offerings for Sin God could not take Pleaſure, as therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Satisfaction to Juſtice: When Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, he faith,<note place="margin">Heb.</note> 
               <hi>A Body haſt thou prepared me; Lo I come to do thy Will, O God;</hi> by the which Will we are ſanctiſied through the offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once: But this Will of God was not induced by any

Temporary Conſideration, it was from everlaſting, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note>

               <hi>God hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Purpoſe and Grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the World began.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It could not then be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with any Human Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Expiation of Sin by any Sacrifice of any Creature, that Jeſus Chriſt was conſtitued and given by God to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation and Redemption for Sinners. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> But contrariwiſe, God having according to the Counſel of his own <hi>free</hi> Will made known to our firſt Parents in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Fall the Myſtery of his Will in the Promiſe of the Seed of the

Woman to break the Serpent's Head; And then for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that Promiſe, and for the ſupport of Faith, inſtituted Sacrifices, revealed firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> then to <hi>Noah,</hi> and conſequently in them to the whole World of Mankind:</p>
            <p>Noah <hi>builded an Altar unto the Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.20, 21.</note> and took of every clean Beaſt, and of every clean Fowl, and offered Burnt-offerings upon the Altar. And the Lord ſmelled a ſweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> or a Savour of Reſt and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Now this could not he affirmed or believed, unleſs ſuch Sacrifices had been according to the expreſs Inſtitution of God, who (as was before obſerved) only could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Diſcrimination of Beaſts clean and unclean: All which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was performed and accepted with reſpect to,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.2.</note> and in virtue of the Offering and Sacrifice of Chriſt himſelf to God for a ſweet ſmelling Savour.</p>

For the more full underſtanding hereof, it is our Parts and Duties ever to remember the great Mercy of God, how that (all the World being wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Sin by breaking of the Law) God ſent his only Son our Saviour Chriſt into this World, to fulfil the Law for us, by ſhedding of his moſt precious Blood to make a Sacrifice and Satisfaction, or (as it may be called) amends to his Father for our Sins, to aſſwage his Wrath and Indignation conceived againſt us for the ſame. But here may Man's Reaſon be aſtonied, reaſoning after
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99140:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this faſhion: If a Ranſom be paid for our Redemption, then is it not given us freely. For a Priſoner that paid his Ranſom, is not let go freely; for if he goes freely, then he goeth without Ranſom. For what is it elſe to go freely, than to be ſet at liberty without paying of Ranſom? This Reaſon is ſatisfied by the great Wiſdom of God in this Myſtery of our Redemption, who hath ſo tempered his Juſtice and Mercy together, that he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Juſtice condemn into the everlaſting Captivity of the Devil, and his Priſon of Hell, remedileſs for ever without Mercy, nor by his Mercy deliver us clearly without Juſtice or Payment of a juſt Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom But with his endleſs Mercy he joined his moſt upright and equal Juſtice. His great Mercy he ſhewed unto us in delivering us from our former Captivity, without requiring any Ranſom to be paid, or Amends to be made on our parts; which thing by us had been impoſſible to be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99140:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
done: And whereas it lay not in us that to do, he provided a Ranſom for us; that was the moſt precious Body and Blood of his own moſt dear and beſt beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, who beſides this Ranſom, fulfilled the Law for us perfectly; and ſo the Juſtice of God and his Mercy did embrace together, and fulfil the Myſtery of our Redemption.</hi>

                           <hi>And of this Juſtice and Mercy of God knit together, ſpeaketh St.</hi> Paul <hi>in the third Chapter to the</hi> Romans; <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>All have offended, and have need of the Glory of God; but are juſtified freely by his Grace, by Redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſent forth for us, for a Reconciler and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker through Faith in his Blood, to ſhew his Righteouſneſs. And in the</hi> 10th <hi>Chapter, Chriſt is the End of the Law unto Righteouſneſs to every Man that believeth. And in the</hi> 8th <hi>Chapter, That which was impoſſible by the Law, in as much as it was weak by the Fleſh, God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99140:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſending his own Son in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinful Fleſh, by Sin damned Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, which walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit. In theſe aforeſaid places the Apoſtle toucheth ſpecially three things, which muſt go together in our Juſtification. Upon God's part, his great Mercy and Grace: Upon Chriſt's part, Juſtice, that is, the Satisfaction of God's Juſtice, or the Price of our Redemption by the offering of his Body and ſhedding of his Blood, with the fulfilling of the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and throughly: And upon our part true and lively Faith in the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, which yet is not ours, but by God's working in us. So that in our Juſtification is not only God's Mercy and Grace, but alſo his Juſtice, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth the Juſtice of God; and it conſiſteth in paying our Ranſom, and fulfilling of the Law: And ſo the Grace of God doth not ſhut out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99140:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Juſtice of God in our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only ſhutteth out the Juſtice of Man; that is to ſay, the Juſtice of our Works as to be Merits of deſerving our Juſtification. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> declareth here nothing upon the behalf of Man concerning his Juſtification, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a true and lively Faith, which nevertheleſs is the Gift of God, and not Man's only Work without God. And yet that Faith does not ſhut out Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread, and the Fear of God, to be joined with Faith in every Man that is juſtified; but it ſhutteth them out from the Office of juſtifying. So that altho they be all preſent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him that is juſtified, yet they juſtify not altogether. Nor the Faith alſo doth not ſhut out the Juſtice of our good Works, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be done afterwards of Duty towards God: (for we are moſt bounden to ſerve God in doing good Deeds, commanded by him in his holy Scripture, all the days of our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99140:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Life) but it excludeth them, ſo that we may not do them to this intent, to be made good by doing of them. For all the good Works that we can do be unperfect, and, therefore not able to deſerve for our Juſtification: But our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth come freely by the meer Mercy of God, and of ſo great and free Mercy, that whereas all the World was not able of themſelves to pay any part towards their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, it pleaſed our Heavenly Father of his inſinite Mercy, without any our deſert or deſerving, to prepare for us the moſt precious Jewels of Chriſt's Body and Blood, whereby our Ranſom might be fully paid, the Law fulfilled, and his Juſtice fully ſatisfied: So that now Chriſt is the Righteouſneſs of all them that truly do believe in him. He for them paid their Ranſom by his Death, he for them fulfilled the Law in his Life: So that now in and by him, every true Chriſtian Man may be called a Fulfiller of the Law; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

            <p>It is moſt abſurd Folly and Contradiction, to own a Nominal God, and to deny the Eſſential Attributes of the infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Deity. Eternal Being, Truth and Goodneſs are the infinite Perfections of one Almighty, All-ſufficient God.</p>
