            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE Occasion of this following Treatise, was
the extravagant Doctrine of <hi>Pre-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
which of laie hath been so warmly manag'd,
that it wants but a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttle more to be made a 13th.
<hi>Article in the Creed of some persons.</hi> I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
the humour, but yet as <hi>Comoedians</hi> do, when
they dress up an <hi>Ape,</hi> to make it appear more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
The Ingenious will discern it at first sight.</p>
            <p>To such as enquire the real Design of this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I answer, the graver Conferences carry their
meaning in their <hi>Frontispiece;</hi> and the more jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cose
are not without their most <hi>solid Morals;</hi>
which perhaps may be more taking to some Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
than if they had appear'd in a common Dress.</p>
            <p>In the whole Discourse I have advanc'd <hi>many
things wholly new</hi> and unblown upon, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the 14<hi>th. Dialogue,</hi> where the <hi>Nature,
Conceptions, and Actions of unbody'd Spirits</hi>
are distinctly treated of. If I am ask'd for my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
I answer, <hi>What appears reasonable,
wants no other Recommendation than being
so;</hi> and as to what appears over strange, Let the
Reader consider, that <hi>Philosophy had never been
improv'd had it not been for new Opinions;</hi>
which afterwards were rectify'd by <hi>abler Pens,</hi>
and so the first Notions were lost and nameless, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
new Superstructures; but such a Fate is too
agreeable for my Iudgment to repine at, or my
Vanity to hope for.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I have more reason to beg pardon of my
Brethren, the Members of the <hi>Athenian Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi>
than of the World, in that I have only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>

the Subject to them, without taking the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in the Composure; but my <hi>Impatient Book-Seller,</hi>
alledging the nearness of the <hi>Term,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
the hurrying it into the Press; some of our
Members being just now gone out of Town, &amp; some
retir'd at present to their Estates in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>However, to make amends for any thing of
Errors which have happen'd by haste, and want
of review, (which are many) I think fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
the World <hi>Two more Pieces,</hi> which shall
have the inspection of the <hi>whole Society.</hi>—
As this only pretends to <hi>Uisions of the Soul,
before it comes into the Body;</hi> so the other
two will treat <hi>of the Sentiments of the
Soul when in the Body, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> in Infancy,
Dreams, Trances, Dotage. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>the manner
of its Existence in a separate state,</hi> till it is
joyn'd again to the Body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Treatise is Matter of Ridicule, and
a Dream; <hi>(see the last Dialogue.)</hi> The <hi>Two
following</hi> will bear more grave Discourses, being
certain Truths; and perhaps <hi>the deepest Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that Revelation or Natural Philosophy
can treat of;</hi> and we hope they may be so manag'd
as not to be a little welcome to the world, both as to
removing many false Notions, and advancing
<hi>something new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing more I have to offer, that whereever the <hi>Reader</hi>
meets with such Terms as <hi>Time, Place,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> attributed

but as something <hi>that bears such proportion to Spirits,
as Time, Place and Matter do to Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done, and doubt not but to meet with both <hi>Applauses</hi>

               <p>Your Curiosity seems to argue a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of fixing there; but you'll be of another
Mind when I tell you, that <hi>Incorporation</hi> is a
Penalty inflicted upon Souls for their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances

a Clog,</hi> the most officious Enemy you
can meet with in betraying you to false Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and irregular Conclusions. In short,
you'll find no agreeable Object, but at such
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61174:6"/>
times as you withdraw, and converse with
<hi>Beings</hi> as simply immaterial as yourself. Now
you are an unconfin'd Agent, a Stranger to
those grosser Terms of <hi>Body, Place</hi> and <hi>Time:</hi>
As yet you know nothing of <hi>Magnitude, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
or <hi>Motion,</hi> and those innumerable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
that result from them, by false Notions
of their Nature. And when you come into the

the Nature of <hi>Angels, Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Immaterial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
as now you are of those material ones.</p>

               <p>What surprizing Relations are these!
Shall I ever forget this inorganical way of
Converse? These immediate Conceptions,
without the Assistance of Sense? This simple
Particularity of Perception, without Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Division? In short, this Nature that I
carry about me? If so <hi>(dear Minister of Fate)</hi>
lay down some Rules for me to take along
with me, which, after I am imbodied, may
restore this Knowledge to me, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

Shou'd I say really what that is, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
cou'd not understand it, because of an
Incongruity (as urged before) betwixt the

up, as <hi>Time</hi> is, in <hi>Eternity.</hi> Before this
<hi>Coelum Empyreum</hi> and its material Inclosures

and when the last Fire (a part of that mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

the Definition now made of it; but a new
inexpressible <hi>Something,</hi> which cannot be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
out of the Language of Spirits, into that

Time</hi> as <hi>Eternity, Place</hi> as <hi>Incircumscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability.—</hi>

'em, that they come as near an Adequate
Conception of these things—when they think
not at all of them, as they do in their most
<hi>Elevated Contemplations.</hi> However, not to
leave 'em altogether in the dark, a Collection
of what you now do in this <hi>pre-existent State</hi>
will (if deliver'd according to their Capacities)
not make 'em less ignorant, especially when

they retir'd to their Closets, and were ready

were almost distracted. The Roaring of our

the Elements clear'd up, and Men ventur'd

that imperious <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Rational Souls,</hi>
who daily subject us to their Abuses, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
the Tyranny which their Brethren,
now incorporate in the Lower World, usurp
over us.</p>
                           <p>But, not to tire your Patience with remote
Circumstances, I shall only apply my self to
what's materially pertinent to the Business in
hand, not doubting to prove, but that we
ought to be equal, at least, if not preferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Accounts that have ever yet been judg'd
sufficient for a Distinction of Priority in other
Cases.</p>
                           <p>And <hi>First,</hi> An <hi>Apple-tree</hi> is an Existent in
Nature, as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
of her Laws; is never drunk nor glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous,

its own Shame: But all this, and greater Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
than these, are committed by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
against the <hi>juster Laws of Nature.</hi> Now
the Consequence is plain, that <hi>Mankind</hi> being
greater Aggressors upon the Privileges of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than we, we must be dearer to Nature
than they; and we doubt not but the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was design'd us, only they got the start
by some Trick and Circumvention, and wou'd
now endeavour to perpetuate their Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Custom. Thus far to our purer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and exacter Observance of Nature's
Laws; which is our first Argument for Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

after Incorporation; in which, <hi>Nature</hi> shews
a particular Care of us, by assuming us into
her <hi>immediate Midwifery;</hi> but, as if she were
afraid to be accessary to the <hi>monstrous Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Man,</hi> leaves him to the Caprices and
Whimseys of his own Lust, to beget, or not
beget, as he pleases. And when he is begot,
what Image bears he? Perhaps he'll tell ye,
the Image of the <hi>God of Nature.</hi> But we beg
his Pardon there, and shall take the Freedom
to tell him, that his Vices have effac'd that;
and now, instead of his polluted <hi>Body, Legs,
Arms, Feet, &amp;c.</hi> we can shew an innocent
<hi>Trunk, Root, Branches, Fruit, &amp;c.</hi> And as to
his Immortality, we are not yet behind him;
for we can't be annihilated, but are always
somewhere, or in some thing. Nay, the last
Fire it self shall beget in us (as well as in him)
a more glorious Change, and not destroy us.
But as to our Converse, or Knowledge in the
Laws and Constitutions of <hi>Nature,</hi> he is far
our linferior; and he might quickly discern it,
if he wou'd but use the same Measures for
Trial, as he does with his Neighbours; who,
if they can do well, he concludes they can say
well. But when do we act irregularly? Are
we not always just, temperate? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi>

judicious Auditory) has been pleas'd to offer
to relinquish the Advantages of the former
part of his Harangue, when he found he had
spent his Stock of Calumny, to raise a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
in your Unbyass'd Judgments against
the Dignity of our <hi>Order,</hi> and afterwards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of Accommodation, being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the weakness of his Cause, wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
one <hi>Topick</hi> void of <hi>Accusation, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
or <hi>Pride,</hi> (as he calls it,) we might add,
or <hi>Reason.)</hi> But as we are not against any
Overtures of Peace that shall be decreed by
this <hi>Worthy Assembly;</hi> so we shall endeavour
to shew a deep resentment of any dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Terms to attain it.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore we restore our <hi>Antagonist</hi> all
the Advantages he can make of the former
part of his Discourse; which we shall discuss
particularly.</p>
                           <p>And first, We never treated these <hi>Vegitables</hi>
as <hi>Non-Existences</hi> in Nature, nor have they
proved one Act of Tyranny which we have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61174:16"/>
exercis'd over 'em. And why they shou'd
boast of their not being, drunk, injurious,
lying, quarrelling, circumventing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very
ridiculous; since their Organs incapacitate
them from such Functions. Suppose it were
criminal to fly, shou'd a Rock boast of its
Virtue in refraining? Not, unless Nature had
given it Wings, Power and Pleasure to fly:
And they'll come off no better in accusing us
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>quarrelling, injustice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It shews the
great variety of Functions we are capable of.
Besides, in doing so, we pursue an appearance
of some Good, (for we can't will Evil as
Evil,) and in doing so, we act naturally; so
that at the same time as they accuse us of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they accuse themselves of bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fructifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is natural to them.
As for that observation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Natures assuming
them into her <hi>immediate Midwifry</hi> and Care,
and leaving us to our own pleasure in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
'tis an argument of our prehemenence;
for Nature deals with them as Parents do
with Children and Fools; they must be fed,
kept out of Fire and Water, and Provision
made for 'em; but we being above such lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
usages, are able to procreate without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
and are accordingly left to our selves;
<hi>Nature always employing most of her Care where
her works are most weak and imperfect.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the defacing our first image by our
Vices, we have already answer'd it above;
in shewing how ridiculous and foreign it is to
urge a Case out of their own <hi>Classis,</hi> altho'
if they were capable to understand it, we
cou'd tell 'em of a remedy for our restoration.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61174:17"/>
But what a wretched Argument they bring
to make their Duration equal to our Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
upon supposition of Non-annihilation;
for tho' we grant 'em to be always somewhere
or in something after a specifick dissolution by
Motion, (or Fire, which is the same,) yet
they come to be nameless,—indistinguishable,
and as hard to find out, as when they lay in

'tis as good to be nothing, as an undefinable

                           <p>The next Argument insisted on, was, <hi>Their

it expects in both conditions they make the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dead.</speaker>
               <p>—That every individual person is
fated to all the Actions of his Life; yea, even
the most minute and inconsiderable; as for
instance, to get up at such a time of the Day,
to feed himself precisely at such an Hour, and
with such a certain number of bits, to go over
the Streets at so many Steps, to VVhore and
be Drunk at such a time, to go to Prayers
and be Melancholy at such a time, to dispute
against his Principles at such a time: In short,
that all that we <hi>think, say, and act,</hi> are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
predestin'd, and run as links in an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Chain of Causes.—VVhat think ye of
the Reasons of this Hypothesis now? That
we are made up of two parts, a Soul, and a
Body; and that when these are conjoyn'd we
must live necessarily as long as we do live; and
that so long as we do live, we must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have a mind which has its perception by
the Senses: That as this perception is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so is the choice that we make by it: As for
instance, Something that is good, or at least
appears so to the perception, offers it self, and
as such, 'tis impossible to refuse it, as a proper
Object to the mind, as 'tis also impossible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perception, to choose an Evil as such;
and thus we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to VVho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing for those
Arguments which our reason offers, that we
should refrain, carry not along with 'em so
great a good to our perception, as those other
reasons that induce us to it, and as a great
power necessarily commands a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sser, so the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61174:20"/>
will necessarily chooses it as most agreeable to
it, and thus I refrain VVhoring, when there
appears a greater good to let it alone: Thus
I am fated to make so many steps in walking
the length of my Chamber, because to step so
far at a step, appears more agreeable to my
Constitution, Fancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to step further
or shorter, and therefore as most agreeable, it
most inclines my will, which therefore is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to act accordingly: As to the Body
it depends necessarily upon the Mind, for my
Hand cannot move of it self, unless I move it,
and if I move it, it is necessitated to move; and
can't help it; and thus, Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> I'm ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to be Damn'd, because the way to
it, had more appearance of good in it, than
walking in another way, and therefore I cou'd
not but choose it. Oh! what an <hi>Unhappy
Wretch</hi> was I, that was not fated to examine
this Doctrine by the same Measures that I did
all others; truth is only known by falshood,
and falshood by truth; black by white, and
white by black, and every thing by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
What a Mysterious Riddle then is
this, <hi>Which is both, and all one? viz.</hi> Do, or
do not do, 'tis fated. If I wou'd have done
a thing, and examin'd it's contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> cou'd
not do it, or <hi>vice versa,</hi> then there had been
fate in the case, otherwise <hi>Hobbism,</hi> or a
new Riddle, whose Solution had been Ruine
in one World, and Damnation in another.
What's the meaning of Laws, Rewards, and
Punishments? For if I act what I must act,
Why am I bid to do so, or forbid to do so?
If I rob my Neighbour, Why shou'd a little
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61174:20"/>
superinduc'd Law take hold of me, and not
that great Law of Fatality preserve me since I
act agreeable to it? What injustice can I do
when eternal Fate stands by me, and warrants
all my Actions? Fool that I am, was I to
live my Life over again, I wou'd only believe,
and warrantably too, that Fate, though it be
like a Law, yet it speaks not in this manner;
<hi>This Man shall do thus, and this thing shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
that Man,</hi> but rather thus, whatsoever a
Soul chooseth, such and such things shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow; for 'tis not the Action, but the
Consequence of the Action, that is Fate.—If
Fate had design'd, that if <hi>Paris</hi> Ravish'd <hi>Helena,</hi>
the <hi>Grecians</hi> shou'd contend with <hi>Troy</hi> about it:
But this was once in <hi>Paris</hi>'s power to do, or
not to do without Compulsion or Necessity.
Thus <hi>Apollo</hi> foretold <hi>Caius,</hi> That <hi>if he begat a
Son, that Son would kill him,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
and not necessary, thus <hi>Plato; If it
were not thus, the ill have a protection for their
Vices, and the Good deserve no praise.</hi> To which
I might add, <hi>That there are certain Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts,

and being deaf to all Intreaties and Reasons,
violently thrust me out of Possession. How

of what I once was!—Assist me,
<hi>Fancy:</hi> What Hair had he?—Right. And
what a Face?—That's exact.—Now,
for a Body, Arms, Thighs, Legs and Feet?
They are more easie.—So.—Now, for

               <p>Mankind has very different Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of me: Some, when they see me,
run stark mad immediately. Others come on
purpose swearing, all's Delusion, a Cheat, or
an Imposition on the Senses; and when they

we have particular Commissions to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
'em, with a witness. A Third Sort,
a little wiser than both, keep s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with their Hair bolting up an end. But here
and there are a very few that have more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Conceptions of us, and neither seek nor
flee our Company, knowing that we Souls
and Spirits have no more Power over 'em in
Bodies, than we have out; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Power we have at any time is only lent
us, and also limitted, and not to be extended
when and where we please. So that we are
really no more in our own Nature and Power,
than what their Fancy makes us. Thus Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
secures some against us; and Religion a

my Leave of it, or its bidding me Farewell.—
And cou'd I quietly brook such an abrupt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
Separation from a Comrade, I had been

What tho' it was deaf to my Counsels and
Reasonings, yet it was my other Part; and as

be damn'd, has bewitch'd the other World
with fruitless Discourses, unprofitable Disputes,
needless Digressions, of <hi>Posse, Esse, Quiddity,
Predicament,</hi> and a Thousand such Sounds;
by which they have lost their own Reason,
and despoil'd their Followers of theirs too.
They will make every thing disputable, so
much as the <hi>Pre-Existence of Souls:</hi> Nay, they'll
not believe the <hi>Existence of a Deity,</hi> if their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist
proves it not by a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> in <hi>Mood</hi>
and <hi>Figure. Two</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> is not <hi>Five</hi> amongst
them, without a Consequence from just
Premises. A certain <hi>Heretick Pedant</hi> the other
Day maintain'd a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and proselyted a
simple Country Gentleman by such seeming
Reasons, as he wanted Sense to confute.—
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61174:31"/>
One of 'em, as I was inform'd, was this,—
<hi>It wou'd be ridiculous to think, that when a Gnat
pushes back a parcel of Air with its Wings, that
parcel drives another before it, and that another;
and so the stirring of the Little Toe of a Flea shou'd
raise a Bunch upon the Back of the Universe.</hi> The
unthinking <hi>Plebeian</hi> having long wish'd <hi>Suicide</hi>
no Murder, because his Mistresses Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
made him weary of his Life, straightway
retir'd out of the Assembly, and thank'd his
pitying <hi>Genius</hi> for providing a way to cure his
Melancholy, <hi>viz.</hi> by the help of a <hi>Vacuum;</hi>
resolving to lay the Fault upon Nature in the
Day of Judgment, that he was accidentally in
a place, where he cou'd not live any longer,
for want of Breath. Whereupon he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
made and executed his <hi>Last Will and
Testament,</hi> and took his Leave of all his
Friends.—And, in order to find out a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi>
he caus'd all his Blunderbusses, Guns
and Musquets to be laid over a Gate, ready
to discharge; and behind 'em, two of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
well mounted, with a hanging Carpet
between 'em, with so much Lead at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
as to keep it tight and perpendicular;
and thus, having wish'd Happiness to his fair
Tormenter, he order'd the Pieces to be fir'd,
and his Servants (to whom he had bequeath'd
his Horses for this last Office of Friendship)
to set Spurs to their Legacies, and follow the
scowr'd Road, he himself bringing up the
Rear, and charging about for the <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
But after he had almost run himself out of
breath in a vain Pursuit of it, he retir'd to the
Assembly of <hi>Virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

broke up, saluting his Teacher by the Name
of <hi>Mad-man,</hi> and <hi>Beggar of Questions.</hi> But the
<hi>Virtuoso,</hi> to maintain his Credit, asserted that
the Gentleman might have found the <hi>Vacuum</hi>
if he had follow'd close up to the Carpet.
Whereupon, another of the Gentleman's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
resenting his Friend's Disgrace,
order'd the same Trial again, resolving to
keep up close to the windy Engine, to prove
the Assertion a Falsity; but he, to keep
Ground, ran himself out of breath, and fell
down dead: Which Accident upheld the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

               <p>
                  <hi>Another wou'd prove,</hi> That a small Thread,
which was equally twisted, and all of the same
Matter, wou'd sustain a greater weight than a
Cable Rope that was unequally twisted. <hi>To prove
which, he offer'd this Reason,</hi> That being all of
a strength, it had no place to break first. <hi>A little
School-Boy that stood by, wish'd his Father
had known that Secret before his Ship-wreck.</hi>
It had been all one, <hi>(reply'd another of his Form-fellows;)</hi>
for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Thread wou'd have broke close
by the Ship, by reason of the Additional Weight of
the rest of the Thread. In like manner, if the
Thread hang'd in a perpendicular Line, with a
Weight at the End of it, it wou'd break at the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
End, because the Lower End wou'd not bear so
much Weight as the Upper End, by the Weight of
the Thread. Nay, Suppose the Thread laid upon
a Level, and extended beyond its strength; having
no place to break first, it must break in all places
at once: For if Particulars cannot act beyond their
Power, Generals cannot; both coming under one
Predicament. <hi>Three Quarters of the Auditory

So that that Orator also sate down with

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Third stood up, and, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prove any thing, drove all the Auditory
out of the little Wit they had left, by asking,</hi>
Whether there may not be an Infinity of Worlds, this
Globe being not so big as those above? Whether
this World might not be made out of the Ruins of a
preceding Old One? Whether these Globes may not
be the Excrements of the Sun? Whether it might
not be better for the next Generation to be taught
to go upon All Four, for several good Reasons that
might be given? Whether the Representatives of
Nature's <hi>Pudenda</hi> were not a more proper Badge
of Honour to wear at a Cavalier's Girdle, than a
Sword; since this is a Mark of Death, and that
of Life? Whether this Tuft of Grass <hi>(pulling
one out of his Pocket)</hi> may not be a Man within
these Sixty Years? Whether, if it were possible for
one Man to imitate another in all his Members,
Motions and Gestures, that Imitator should not, by
Equality of Organs, be susceptive of the other's
Thoughts and Inclination? Whether an Eternity
of Matter is disputable? Whether the Souls of
Men are Pre-existent, or Contemporary with the
Body? Whether it is not a great Absurdity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to a Vacuity that Quality of Yielding to a
Body, and that Space which are the Dependencies
of an Extent, which can only agree to a Substance?

               <p>—'TIS enough for Humanity,
that knows no better, to be
Noisie Querulous, and arraign the Justice of
<hi>Fate,</hi> and the wise dispensation of Providence,
who fits not the <hi>particular Chain of Causes</hi> to
the private humour of this or that Party; but
respects the universal Good at once: hence I
am satisfied, the <hi>despicable Post</hi> assign'd me, is
wisely dispos'd, and ought to be accepted
with gratitude, since 'tis inconsistent with the
goodness of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Good incompatible with a particular
one; whence it is also plain, that I may be
happy in my Station. But was I to chuse,
and knew not what Fate had ordain'd me,
I'd be an <hi>Emperor at least;</hi> How full of Charms
is it <hi>to imitate the Divine Original of Beings, to
see whole Kingdoms depend upon me, to be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
with eternal Heads of Nakedness; to have

the power of exalting one, and debasing another;
of rewarding Vertue, and punishing Vice; of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of Life and Death; in short, to be an
Earthly God.</hi> Now must I suffer Affronts and
Abuses, without the power of Revenge, to
stoop, and acknowledge my dependance to
almost every Being. Alas, what's the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that <hi>Providential Riddle,</hi> That Man is
the Lord of the world; That Beast, Fish and

us, and those things we are said to be Lords
of? <hi>Man disposes of Man as he doe's of a Beast,

'tis face to face; but this is only to your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
for there's no such a thing as distance
amongst <hi>Spirits;</hi> for they are as near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when the whole <hi>Coelum Empyreum</hi> is
betwixt 'em, as they are when both together,
and yet they are not like God, <hi>every where at
once, or omnipresent.</hi>

               <p>—This is strange Doctrine to
Mortals;—pray' how do <hi>Spiris move?</hi>
whether locally by a <hi>Medium,</hi> or in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
or in Time, or how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Unbody'd Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—None of all this—for
what is impartible, is not moveable; for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Humane Philosophy,</hi> (which holds in
this Case,) any thing that is moving, whilst it
is moving, is partly <hi>in termino a quo,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>in termino ad quem;</hi> which is inconsistent
with <hi>Impartibility.</hi> Nor can a Spirit move so,
as to pass through a <hi>Medium:</hi> As for Instance,
To go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61174:36"/>
without passing over the distance, or places
betwixt 'em: Now every thing that passes,
<hi>passes through a place equal to it self,</hi> (as suppose
through Air, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the place that the
Body is in, is equal to the Body which fills it.)
But the place equal to an Indivisible Spirit,
(speaking <hi>ad Humanum Captum)</hi> is a <hi>Point;</hi>
and therefore if an Angel or Spirit, by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
passes through a <hi>Medium,</hi> he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
pass through or number <hi>many Points in
termino ad quem;</hi> which is impossible. To
speak yet nearer the <hi>Common Apprehension</hi> of
Mortals, a Man may in his Mind think of
<hi>France,</hi> and then immediately of <hi>Syria,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thinking of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the <hi>Medium,</hi>
betwixt both: And this comes nearest the
<hi>Motion of Spirits;</hi> now whether this Motion
is effected in Time, or in an Instant. (As
thus, When God Almighty commissiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Angel to go and appear to <hi>Manoah,</hi>
whether in coming from Heaven he might
be a Day, an Hour, or a Minute; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was there in the same <hi>unsuccessive
Moment</hi> wherein he receiv'd the Commission.)
To this we answer in respect of Men, who
are ty'd up to the <hi>gross Rules of Time, Place,
Matter,</hi> &amp;c. There was a Flux of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Receipt of the Commission, and the
Execution of it: But in respect of the Nature
of Angels, the Receipt of their Commission,
the Execution of it, and a Thousand Years
after the Execution of it, were all included in
one <hi>Unsuccessive Now:</hi> The Reason of it
is this, If there were a Time for the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an Action, and another Time for the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61174:36"/>
Ending of it, then there wou'd be Succession,
and by consequence <hi>Partibility;</hi> but that's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
(as above) with the Nature of an
<hi>Indivisible Being,</hi> as an Angel or a Spirit are.</p>

               <p>But supposing <hi>Motion, Time,
Place,</hi> &amp;c. to be attributed to Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
in respect to Mankind, as really they are:
As it may be said, <hi>A Spirit is in such a Place
now, and was not two Hours since.</hi> Supposing
(I say) such a way of speaking, in <hi>reference to
Mankind,</hi> how is it feasible for <hi>a Spirit, a

(for so they are to some Mortals,) how a

it. As for Instance; <hi>A Fallen Angel</hi>

the ordinary Operation of her Animal
Powers, (as above,) that she falls into a <hi>Trance,</hi>
insensible of <hi>Burns, Cuts,</hi> &amp;c. Now this <hi>wicked

Now, this <hi>wicked Angel</hi> being present with the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Unbody'd Spirit.</speaker>
               <p>A great deal, Men think,
by means of the Senses. Suppose the <hi>Eye:</hi>
First, There must be an <hi>Union</hi> betwixt the
Sight, and the thing seen; for Vision is not
in <hi>Act,</hi> except the thing seen is after a certain
manner in the thing seeing; and this not by
an Assumption of the Substance, but of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of the thing seen, into the Eye. Now
this <hi>Visive Power</hi> having assum'd a <hi>Similitude</hi> of
the thing seen into the Eye, the <hi>Intellect abstracts
Universals from it;</hi> which Act is call'd the
<hi>Perception,</hi> and according to this Perception
we judge and act. But 'tis not so with Spirits,
they have <hi>no Perception from divisible or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Objects;</hi> for what by our Senses we
know of Material Objects, that they know
from the <hi>Ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>luviums</hi> of the Deity. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>God is the Cause of every Substance, both
as to its Matter and Form;</hi> therefore God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61174:38"/>
to his Essence, (which is the Cause of
all things) is the Similitude of all things.
Hence <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> when they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, do (as in a Glass) see and know all
Material and Immaterial Objects and Things
whatever, when he pleases to communicate a
Knowledge: And thus it is that <hi>Departed Souls
have Knowledge of things happening in this Life.</hi>

manner of their Perception, and the making
known this Perception, by directing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of it to one another, as Men do their

themselves internally, <hi>without Lip or Voice.</hi>

but an <hi>Eternal Din</hi> of one Tune, o'er and o'er.
There's better Musick, ten to one, every <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew-Fair.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—Pray, let me ask you one
Question: Is there any Musick better than
the <hi>Original</hi> of all Musick?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—No.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—Very well: Then since these <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Diastems,</hi> and these <hi>harmonious Motions,</hi> which
proceed from the different Positions and
Heighths of the Planets, and the <hi>Correspondent
Symmetry of the Heavens,</hi> are the <hi>first Original
of Musick,</hi> all other Harmony which the
lower World pretends to, are but Imitations
of this <hi>great Original.</hi> So that those little
tickling Fancies of <hi>Ionick, Dorick, Phrygian,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61174:39"/>
other Measures, are but a different way of
Trial to come the <hi>nearest ours;</hi> and if Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
cou'd find out the <hi>true Spherical Musick,</hi>
they wou'd never seek farther, nor alter it for
any other, because 'tis impossible to desire or
chuse an <hi>Imperfection, when Perfection stands by.</hi>
But 'tis no wonder the <hi>World below us</hi> think the
<hi>Musick of the Spheres</hi> a Fable, when one of our
own <hi>Order</hi> shou'd undervalue it at such a rate.
But perhaps you are of the same Opinion as
Mankind, and these are only Words of Course,
because you have a mind to be upon the
<hi>Ramble.</hi>

whether I hear any thing, or no.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you hear, but without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
which makes me believe, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to <hi>ours,</hi> but to the <hi>Animal Order,</hi> and
in that <hi>Order</hi> you are design'd to animate an
<hi>Ass,</hi> which, amongst all Creatures, <hi>never heeds
Musick.</hi> You, and all Mankind, must grant,
that the <hi>Planets move,</hi> and that <hi>Sound necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
proceeds from Motion,</hi> and that this Sound
must either be sweet or harsh: Now, if a fix'd
Observation of Numbers moderate the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it effects a <hi>Symphonous Harmony,</hi> conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to such a Motion; but if it be not <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Measures,</hi> there proceeds an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Noise. But in this <hi>admirable Structure of
the Heavens,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>setled Rules
and Proportions, curious Differences of Magnitude,
Celerity,</hi> and <hi>Local Distances,</hi> which are <hi>constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Because I must run through all things

always lasts three thousand years; 'tis an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
Decree, that all Spirits are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd
by such a Discipline, only here's the
difference; that Spirits are to actuate mostly
in those Creatures that are of the same Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
as they were; as for Instance: The
Justice of Fate assigns such as are <hi>Angry and
Malicious</hi> into Serpents, the <hi>Ravenous</hi> into
Wolves, the <hi>Fraudulent</hi> into Foxes, and so of
the rest; only here and there's a <hi>good Spirit,</hi>
whose actions being most rational, transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates
out of <hi>one Man into another,</hi> finishing
most of the <hi>three Thousand years in humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and as for other Creatures, the Fates
take care that they speedily die, that that part
of the Transmigration may be quickly over,
and reason good for if by chance they shou'd
be unjustly confin'd beyond the <hi>three Thousand
Years,</hi> there's no amends to be made, but some
preferment amongst the Officers of Fate,

my proper Residence,</hi> and am I, by a Virtual
Contact, confin'd more to it, than to any
other Being, or Place whatever? I am rather
of Opinion, that all this noise about <hi>Transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration</hi>
is no more than thus. That such as
are of an equal Temper, Judgment, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be said to be unanimous, or
acted by the same Spirit, especially if they
live in different Ages. I can't conceive it to
be any thing else, but, <hi>like Care, Motion, Study,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>of some dead Person appearing in some living
one;</hi> and thus you, if you acted <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
you were no more <hi>Euphorbus, Hermotinus,</hi> or
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> than as you had an Inclination to the
several Excellencies that appeared in those
Persons, and thus a Transmigration into Fishes,
Trees, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is nothing else but a study
of their Nature.</p>

               <speaker>Tr. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>You might have added, That 'tis a
Doctrine that has not been received in the
lower World these many Years; and that 'tis
also believ'd, that 'twas a politick Juggle to
make the Age Virtuous, by suggesting, that
if Persons liv'd ill Lives, they shou'd suffer
such and such dreadful Transmigrations after
Death; but you'll find to your Sorrow, when
you come to put off your first Body, that all
is matter of Fact, and no Politick Juggle.</p>

               <p>When it comes to't, I'll believe it,
but not before, since <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be the greatest Patron of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
did also teach, That <hi>the Substantive
Unity of one Number, is not the Unity of another,</hi>
and if so, there's no Transmigration of one
Animal into the Life of another different Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
but a continuance (as long as there is a
Being) under the Law of its own Nature, and
particular Species; <hi>Species is not coincident with
Species;</hi> and this is also imply'd by one of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>'s
Symbols, <hi>viz. We must not wear the
Image of God in a Seal-Ring;</hi> that is, as God
can't be resembled, or included in Corporeal
matter, so a Humane Spirit (which is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God) must not stoop so low as to
actuate meaner Nature than the Rational.</p>

               <p>Fourth Cannon. <hi>That the occasion of the
Universal Deluge, was the Tears of the Devil and
his Angels, who wept for grief to be routed and
cast out of Heaven:</hi> They had two Designs by
their Tears, for when they found they could
not get in again, they hang'd about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
and Battlements thereof, as Flies do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cieling of Houses, weeping as well to
case themselves as to be reveng'd of Mankind,
so finding themselves to be very many, they
wept a numerous Company of Clouds, which
were all that time in falling down upon the
Earth, as is betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah;</hi> but I'm
not so conceited and positive, as to believe
this the reason, if you can give me a better.
—But however I must beg the liberty to
be positive in my next Cannon, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <speaker>Fifth Cannon.</speaker>
               <p>—<hi>That the cause of Winds
flying backward and forward, is the breathing of
the World, just as Mankind sucks breath in and
out.</hi> To prove this (for I know you expect
no less than a Demonstration) I need not say
you must consider, (for you do,) That there
can be no Effect without a Cause, no Motion
without a Mover: The Opinions that pass
in this, and the lower World too, have not
been enough examin'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sun,
Moon, and Stars being Monstrous Bodies,
and continually upon the hurry 'tis suppos'd,
that they moving, drive the Winds, along
with 'em, and that the difference of their
Motions, causes different Winds, or an Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Air, this, and that way; which
is impossible, because then we shou'd have no
Westerly Winds, most of the Erratick Stars mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Westward, which hinder the Winds from
coming that way; besides, all Southern and
Nothern Winds wou'd be unnatural, but we
know that they are as common as Easterly
Winds. Nor wou'd the Rarification of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as the Philosophers in the lower World
Dream) be enough to supply such great Winds,
and Hurricanes, as sometimes happen, for
they only proceed immediately from the lungs
of the World, when it has catch'd cold, or is
dispos'd to Laugh or Whistle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which makes the
Air fly faster out. I might add here, instead
of putting it into another <hi>Cannon.</hi>—That all
Earthquakes proceed from the sighing of the
World when 'tis in a melancholy Humour, for
it raising up its Body (as Man does his Breast
when he sighs) and being brittle where it has
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61174:52"/>
the fewest Ribs (I mean Mines, Quarries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as vulgarly called) the Buildings, and Cities
standing in those places, tumble in into's
Bowels to secure themselves from a transport
into the World of the Moon.—
Well, Gentlemen, I hope 'tis your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that gives Consent unto these Truths,
and not an Amazement at their Novelty. In
Confidence whereof, I proceed to my</p>
               <p>Sixth Cannon, <hi>viz. That Stars are the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
of the World, at which all Astrologers suck,
and that all that don't love Astrology were put out
to Nurse, and wein'd with grosser Dyet.</hi>—
But I beg your Pardon (Gentlemen!) I turn'd
over a wrong Leaf; this is your <hi>own received
Principle,</hi> therefore no need to prove it, I
meant thus—<hi>That 'tis as possible for an
Ass to drink up the Moon, as to cure Wounds by
Sympathy.</hi>

               <p>Pray, Gentlemen, let me have fair

               <p>Very well. To proceed then. I am
to tell you that my Correspondence from the
other World is very good and creditable, and
'tis often found there, that the Man travels in
pains of Childbirth, when the VVoman her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61174:52"/>
self is Deliver'd without pain: That if some
sort of Leaves are rub'd (whilst growing) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Corn, VVart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Corn, or Wart
shall die as the Leaf withers away:—Thus
small ideal parts, or fancy'd Representatives
of what is real, have the same Sympathetick
Effect, that a true Cause wou'd have, when
you come into the other World, read Sir <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelm
Digby's</hi> Works in this kind. Now those
that can deny an Ass to have no Fancy, deny
themselves any: But to be short, and give
you an Instance that is matter of Fact. One
of my Correspondents <hi>(Ludov. vives)</hi> gave
me an account of a certain People that did
imprison an Ass for drinking up the Moon;
the manner was thus:—The Ass being
driven to the Water to drink, the Moon shin'd
very bright, and reflected in the water just
where the Ass drunk; the Ass fancy'd strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
pull'd hard to draw in the Moon, and it
had the effect accordingly, tho' some were so
silly as to believe the Moon being in danger,
slipt out of sight behind a Cloud. Hereupon
the Ass was brought to the Bar, to receive a
Sentence according to his Deserts; and as the
Senate were gravely debating the matter, one
starts up, a little wiser perhaps than the rest,
and made the short following Speech.—
Gentlemen, 'Tis my private Opinion, (and I
hope not unreasonably) that 'tis no trifling
business for our Town to loose its Moon; and
I know but of one way to recover it again,
<hi>viz.</hi> by giving the Ass a strong Vomit, to
weaken his Fancy, for 'tis that that keeps the
Moon a Prisoner in his Maw.—No,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61174:53"/>
says another, I think it much better that the
Ass be cut up, and the Moon taken out of him;
in short, they handled the Ass so severely,
that he had forgot his Supper, and the Moon
stole whole, and undigested again into its
own place against the next Night, but ever
after play'd at Bo-peep, when she saw the
Ass come near the Water.—Gentleman,
'tis all matter of Fact, and as great a truth as
my next Position.</p>

               <speaker>Seventh Cannon.</speaker>
               <p>That those Devils that were
furthest pursu'd by <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, <hi>viz.</hi>
as far as the middle Region of the Air, are all
Taylors, and cut out the Clouds into Shapes of Hogs,
Trees, Ships, Dromedaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on purpose to be
talk'd on and wondered at by the ignorant Country
People of the World below.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <p>To prove which, you may be pleas'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the Prince of Wicked Angels fell
by Pride in endeavouring to be like his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
and when he was excluded, and chased
out of Heaven, he cou'd not forget the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but wou'd yet be <hi>imitating,</hi> and make
the Representations of all Creatures in Clouds,
and Condens'd Bodies of Air, I might (if there
was occasion, to strengthen this Argument)
add, that he has also his Oracles, Miracles,
Sacrifices, Priests, in short above one half of
the World his true and faithful Servents, and
all this because the <hi>old Notion of Imitation</hi> was
so deeply rooted in his mind.—Now it
being prov'd, that the Prince of fallen Spirits,
does act so and so; it follows, that all the
subordinate Mob have an Itch to imitate
their Head, it being a great truth:
<q>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61174:53"/>Regis ad Exemplum totus Componitur Orbis.</q>
Subjects will be imitating their King, and
Children their Parents, let 'em act good or
bad. By Taylor, and cutting out Clouds, I
mean only Metaphorically a shaping of
Clouds, and I shall think none of you Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
if you call 'em Carpenters, or Statua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>That never any Spirit was sent into a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Body, to joyn with it as its proper half, or
as a convenient residence, but as into a Prison for
Debt, purely for Debt; and not (as is pretended)
for rambling, or other Extravagancies.</p>
               <p>To prove which, you need only to consult
the Records of our Honourable Court of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and you'll find the Decrees generally
run thus: <q>That having upon the humble
Suit of the Plantiff <hi>A,</hi> impartially weigh'd
and consider'd the Defendant <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>Charge,</hi>
wherein is proved, that besides bilking his
Lodging, he never paid for the cleansing
his Wings, nor whitening his Wand; be it
therefore <hi>Enacted</hi> by the Prerogative of this
Honourable Court of Spirits, That the said
<hi>B,</hi> be forthwith transported into the other
World, and be kept close Prisoner in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Body for Seventy two Years (or
some other Number, proportioned to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Debt.)</q>—And this is farther prov'd
by my Correspondents in the other World,
who tell me, they often get into the Ear to
listen if there be any subject of dissolution,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61174:54"/>
and sometimes mount up into the Eye, and
take a view of the Skies, their old Lodgings;
and when the Eye (that is to say, the Wicket
door, or rather the Grate of the Prison) is
clos'd up, 'tis more terrible to 'em, then <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
or double Irons</hi> to a Criminal;
and thus much for Incorpation Penalties.</p>

               <p>'Tis as easie a thing for
Ships to sail in the Clouds of the Air, as in the
Sea, and 'tis an Invention that will be found out
when Mankind shall discover the way into the
World of the Moon.</p>
               <p>This Cannon consists of two parts, <hi>viz.
Hypothetick and Prophetick,</hi> to prove the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.—
Clouds are form'd in the Air ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ordinarily, or extraordinarily; ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Exhalations of thin and moist Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
just as the steam of a boiling Caldron
ascends, which meeting together, and justling
in the air, by little and little are condens'd
into thick Clouds, or airy Rivers, which by
degrees empty themselves again into the Sea,
as all other Rivers do upon the Earth. Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
when several Winds meet together
(as 'tis frequent in some Seas) the equal strife
causes a whirling violent ascention of fighting
Particles, which form a Vacuum in the shape
of a leaden Pipe, or Pump as high as the
Clouds, but Nature abhorring a Vacuum, fills
that vast Pipe with Water, by way of <hi>Suction</hi>
or drawing up. So that presently there are
formed Clouds of many Millions of Tuns of
Water, which can easily enough bear up a Ship,
for water looses not its nature in being less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
is evident by a Ship swimming as well in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61174:54"/>
Twenty Fathom deep, as Twenty thousand.
Nor has it less power in the Air, than on the
Earth; for a <hi>Tub of Water</hi> upon the top of a
House, will bear up a Hat, Stick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
as the <hi>Well</hi> in the Ground, from whence
that water was taken. But though we have
prov'd, that Ships may sail in the Air, we
shan't promise prosperous Voyages, which
brings me to the Prophetick part of my <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
viz.</hi> That Mankind shall discover the
way into the <hi>World of the Moon, when they find
out the way of Sailing in the Air;</hi> I could prove
this also, but that it wou'd lessen the Credit
of Prophesies, which admit of no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but <hi>matter of fact:</hi> Therefore I shall
wave it, not desiring to be believed, till it be
fulfill'd.</p>

<q>Aio te Aeacidem Romanos vincere posse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No, no, the Case is plain; and I hope this
<hi>Honourable Convention</hi> will order it to be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
accordingly. And so I shall proceed to
take notice of another Vulgar Error amongst
us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>That the Soul of the World is not subject to the
Passions of Humane Spirits, or that it is not
sometimes Merry, Sad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I suppose, if I prove the contrary you'll look
so <hi>wishfully</hi> upon one another, that you'll
have an immediate Confirmation of it by the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61174:58"/>
                  <hi>World's Laughing</hi> at you: 'Tis a certain truth,
and if you will but <hi>peep out of the Wickets of
your Stars,</hi> and view the Face of the Elements,
you will just now see it look with a pair of
<hi>Blubber'd Eyes,</hi> the reason of it is this; Taking
a view of the Creation, it casually fixt one of
its Eyes upon the <hi>Gallick Territories,</hi> and seeing
so much Tyranny, Pride, Extortion, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it cou'd not refrain from <hi>Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
the Inhabitants of the World below us,
call it <hi>Raining,</hi> not believing that the frequent
showers of Tears that fall amongst 'em, are a
<hi>bewailing their Irregularities;</hi> and thus, when
it sees some good and vertuous Actions, it
looks with a <hi>pleasant Air,</hi> and smiles upon
'em, and that they call <hi>Sun-shine.</hi> The other
Night, the World had got the <hi>Highcough,</hi> which
is very often mistaken for <hi>Thunder.</hi>—We
are in almost a hundred Mistakes about the
<hi>Worlds Common Actions;</hi> when it <hi>Spits,</hi> 'tis er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously
suppos'd to be a <hi>Shooting of Stars;</hi>
when it turns its Head on one side, either in
a <hi>fit of Laughter,</hi> or by being asham'd at some
unhandsome Actions it sees, presently 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
there's an <hi>Eclipse of the Sun;</hi> and in
this Opinion, the World below us are deeply
rooted: Now since I am not stingy, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
in Communicating my Observations, I
wou'd have some of you <hi>Astrologick Souls</hi>
(when you come to have Bodies) to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Neighbours about that which they
call an <hi>Eclipse of the Sun,</hi> for 'tis laid down as
a <hi>Maxime</hi> amongst 'em, That the <hi>Sun being a
greater Body than the Moon,</hi> can never be <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
Eclipsed;</hi> which Error does so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61174:58"/>
the Harmonious Order, and make of
the Universe, that the World, as unable to
put up such Indignities, has been in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
sometimes to <hi>close both her Eyes</hi> at once,
and leave Mankind <hi>muffled up in a perpetual
Night;</hi> for you must believe, that if the Face
of the World be proportioned to its Body, it
must be <hi>pretty broad,</hi> at least some 100000
Miles.—So that the Eyes must stand a great
distance one from another; nay, the <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the lower World</hi> grant as much in effect
when they say the Sun is in an Orb vastly
higher than the Moon; now taking their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
for granted, the Sun may be totally E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed
according to their own Principles—
as in the Figure annext; for when the Face
of the world stands side-way to the Earth, so
that the Moon is betwixt the Earth and the
Sun, 'tis plain, the Moon does not only Eclipse
the whole Body of the Sun, but as far about
as the Circle B, the Body of the Sun, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
bigger than the Moon, extending no
farther than A.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Another Vulgar Error, wich I have met
with, is this.
<q>That there are no more Worlds habitable by Men,
than the Earth, Moon, Sun, and the rest of
the Planets, with a few fix'd Stars.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61174:59"/>Now this I know, by my own Experience,
to be a falshood, for coming home <hi>late one
Night</hi> by the Seven Stars, I <hi>peep'd</hi> into the least
amongst 'em (which you know is seldom vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the lower world) and I saw Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of <hi>Little Men and Women</hi> going to a Fair,
but they were no <hi>bigger than Rats;</hi> I cou'd
not forbear <hi>Philosophizing</hi> upon it, and at last
I satisfy'd my self with this Conclusion, that
all <hi>Stars were Worlds,</hi> and the People in 'em
were proportion'd according to the bigness of
'em, and I was confirm'd in my Opinion
when I consider'd that the Inhabitants of the
Earth were about <hi>two Yards high,</hi> that those in
the Moon were as high as the <hi>largest Steeples,</hi>
and that the People in the Sun wou'd make
nothing of stepping <hi>Seven Miles at a step</hi> in
their common walking, had that an ordinary
sucking Flea had a Trunk as big as an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant;</hi>
now Gentlemen, that you may be
satisfied as well as I, that the least Star is an
<hi>Habitable World,</hi> 'tis but taking a little more
notice of 'em in your Rambles.—</p>
               <p>Another Vulgar Error amongst us is,
<q>That there are some new Stars since the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or at least old ones mended, as that in
<hi>Cassopeia,</hi> that in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> and many
others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For First, (as introductive to what follows)
I shall prove that Stars don't <hi>borrow their Light
from the Sun,</hi> but have their own innate light,
as Fish Scales, Rotten Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the plausible pretences of <hi>Earthly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61174:60"/>
Philosophers;</hi> because, if they borrow'd their
Light from the Sun, or by Reflection, they
would not always have the same appearance,
since the World moves its face sometimes so,
that <hi>both its Eyes</hi> are hinder'd from looking
upon such and such Stars, and sometimes by
reason of the Interposition of one anhther;
but such and such Stars have always the <hi>same
Lustre,</hi> provided the Clouds don't interpose
or hinder the light from making a right
Judgment.—<hi>Secondly,</hi> They are not matter
<hi>solid and compact as the Earth is,</hi> for 'tis evident
to every bodies experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>motion</hi> wou'd
in time wear 'em away, but they are only
<hi>Globulous formations out of the first light,</hi> which
finisht the Circumrotation of Heaven and
Earth, e're the Sun, Moon, or themselves
were created; and if so, <hi>Light is not subject to
attrition</hi> or wearing away, no more than
Darkness, which in some sense is a <hi>quality ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a body:</hi> Hence no Stars grow old,
or wear away, and if so, no need either of
<hi>mending 'em, or making new ones,</hi> for a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
perfect number was at first created;
besides, if they should be mended, what
would have become of their <hi>Inhabitants the
same time?</hi> or where must they have dwelt
till their World had been <hi>new Rigg'd?</hi> Those
Stars talk'd on, in <hi>Cassopeia, Sagitarius, &amp;c.</hi>
were nothing else but Meteors or Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the <hi>bodies of other Planets,</hi> caus'd by
the Sun; and as the matter whereby they
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed ceased, they disappear'd; and the
truth of all this is well known by many of our
Society, who were at the same time upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61174:60"/>
the Ramble in those Quarters.—The next
vulgar Error I observe is this,
<q>That in a few Ages the People in the World
below us will teach the <hi>Rucks</hi> in <hi>Madacas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
to fly with 'em into the World in the
Moon, and steal some of those Inhabitants
to show 'em at <hi>Bartholomew Fair.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By what wild Notion this Opinion came to
be propogated I know not, but the Authors of
it do also tell us, that a <hi>Ruck is a Bird with wings
twelve foot long,</hi> and that they make no more
of sooping up a Horse and his Rider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than a
<hi>Kite does of a Mouse,</hi> so that they can easily
carry a Man any whither between their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
or in their Talons. But tho' I grant
this to be truth, yet the <hi>Voyage is too long to
undertake;</hi> for according to my last Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the distance between the <hi>Earth and the
Moon</hi> is one hundred seventy nine Thousand,
seven hundred and twelve Miles; so that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it possible for a man and his <hi>winged
Courser</hi> to fly half a year together, it would
be 980 miles a day, <hi>(too violent a motion
for breathing)</hi> before he cou'd get to the Moon,
which wou'd be a very hard Task without
Meat, Drink, or Sleep. And lastly, (for
I'll mention but one more at present) 'tis an
Erronious Opinion,
<q>That a Spirit can't carry away the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
at once, if he might be permitted to
do it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61174:61"/>If a Spirit can <hi>heave</hi> a Chair, a Stool, a
Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he can also remove the World.
The reason is, <hi>matter is not determinative upon
Spirits,</hi> first, not as to <hi>place,</hi> for if a Spirit
cannot be circumscrib'd, it follows that all
Places are the same to him, and that if a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
moves a Chair from its first Station, he can
also move it ten thousand Miles further, all
the labour being only <hi>willing such a motion.</hi>
Nor is it the Quality of <hi>matter</hi> that can hinder
this motion, all matter being the same to him;
we have daily instances of <hi>Spirits passing thro'
Glass, and the most continuous matter</hi> as easily as
through Air, which is a more extended <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
Nor is it <hi>Quantity</hi> that can hinder this
motion, for 'tis granted that a Spirit can as
easily <hi>move a man as a flea,</hi> and if so, he can
as easily <hi>run away with a Star as a man,</hi> but
this he is not permitted to do, since such a
motion would spoil the <hi>harmonious and regular
position of the Heavens:</hi> but to prove it possible
to remove <hi>Sun, Moon, Stars, Earth, Sea,</hi> nay,
and the whole <hi>Coelum Empyreum</hi> at once; I
shall offer,—That a Spirit moves not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by application of matter to the thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
(as when a man moves his Hatt off
his Head, he moves it with his hand, which
is another body) but by a <hi>vertual Contact</hi> or
Application of the Will, just as a man moves
his own Body, which is only by <hi>willing</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it; just so when a man moves his hand,
he moves it not by help of the other hand, but
by the <hi>immediate act of his will.</hi> Now the
Spirit in a man is limited by Incorporation,
and can move nothing but only its members,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61174:61"/>
or what it applys its members to; which also
being matter are <hi>confin'd to Proportions</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that other matter which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to, yet an <hi>unbodied Spirit</hi> being confin'd
to no particular Matter can <hi>will</hi> a motion to
any <hi>matter,</hi> which is effective upon matter, as
greater Powers command lesser. Nay, I
might yet further offer that a spirit might
more <hi>all the Universe at once</hi> (I mean the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Empyreum,</hi> and all the Globes within it)
without displacing the particular parts; as the
Wheels, Weights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a Clock, when the
whole Clock is mov'd away at once; for a
Clock will follow its <hi>regular motions</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> as
well as in <hi>England,</hi> so that <hi>(Gentlemen Spirits,)</hi>
if you have a mind to examine <hi>matter of fact,</hi>
there's no more to do than to make a tryal,
only I have this to tell you, that you cannot
tell whether you move the <hi>whole</hi> or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you <hi>carry all matter and place</hi> with you,
so that there will be left no place behind to
measure from, and if so, no distance, and
consequently no motion to be judg'd of; nor
can we who are within the Globe perceive it,
since we shall be always at the same distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
just as a fly wou'd be in a house if the
house were removed. This is all I have to
offer at present, by which I hope I may have
not only performed the Conditions of my

resembles the spirit of man, which is also more
particularly seated in the heart; this premis'd,
I further add, That the Sun wou'd expire if
there were not an Element of Air to oppose
and fight with; which I prove thus, <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are of the same nature as their Generals,</hi> and
a small fire clos'd up so that it can have no
Air to oppose it, immediately grows unactive
and expires. And thus, when a man ceases
to breath, the vital heat or spirit within having
nothing to sight with, grows idle, and dyes.
To which I shall yet add, as a resolution to
the Question, That the strife betwixt the
Sun and the Air thins and subtilizes the Sea,
and causes the <hi>flux</hi> and swelling of the Tides
as a small fire affects the bubling water that
is near it; and thus the strife betwixt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61174:63"/>
heat and the respiring Air in bodies, rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
and stirs up the blood to a pulsation, or
a <hi>diastole and systole,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>flux and
reflux</hi> of the Sea, and as the pulse is easier
discern'd in the Arms and other extream
parts, than in the main bulk of the body; So
Tides are most remarkable at the shores.
Thus Life is maintain'd by opposition, and
thus all <hi>compounded Existences</hi> are preserv'd by
unnatural Wars. One difficulty more is to
be resolv'd, and I've done, some Seas have
their Titles every two hours, some every four,
and some every six, which periods are caus'd
by the different humors of the Sea, as some
are more terren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more salt and sulphureous, some more thin

just come to Town, and
brought along with him an unbawk'd Fancy,
a strong Faith, and a deep Purse! Very
well,—'Tis no <hi>common Catch,</hi>—a <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

               <p>—To come off handsomly after
all, and manage the Concern so wisely, as
never to fail bringing the <hi>useful Discovery</hi> to
perfection; but for want of Two or Three
Hundred Pounds more, which will oblige
the <hi>Engagers</hi> either to resign their first Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
rather than come in deeper, or force
'em to the last shift of paying their Footing,
(which is, Breaking,) and commencing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector

a very fine Trade amongst soft Heirs, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous

<hi>Babes in Worldly Philosophy.</hi>—But to wave
the Thoughts of the <hi>Body,</hi> and return to our

               <speaker>2. Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—I am just come from thence,
and am willing to give you a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of every thing there? But pray what
are the most curious Remarks you have met
with in this long Ramble.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—In the Region of the Moon I
found some surprizing Novelties; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the manner of that Planet's Motion.—
The Moon is generally believ'd to perform
its Circuition by a Principle of Self-Motion,
which Nature at first communicated to it;
but 'tis an Errour; for the <hi>Moon</hi> is a <hi>Lifeless
inanimate Mass,</hi> and can no more move of it
self than a Pewter-Dish can; nor is it (as
some have concluded) bowl'd along by <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
amongst the rest of the Stars; for then a
swinging Gigantick Spirit wou'd sometimes
throw it out of its due Cariere, and make it
rob, or fall soul upon some of the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
No no, such Caprices in Nature are
not to be met with.—'Tis continually
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61174:69"/>
carry'd along by half a dozen Spirits in a large
Lanthorn, half of it transparent, and the
other half dark, and these half dozen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are reliev'd by another half dozen, once in
four and twenty hours: The reason of its
seeming <hi>Increase and Decrease,</hi> is nothing else
but the turning of the darker or brighter side
of its Lanthorn more or less <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
towards the <hi>Globe of the Earth.</hi> I can also
assure you, that there's not one Star in the
Heavens that moves of it self; but what are
carry'd along by Spirits (plain Spirits, not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences,
as some Philosophers dream; for
there's no such Beings.) There are many
strange Opinions amongst Mankind about the
Motion of the <hi>Heavenly Orbs:</hi> A Spirit that
left its Body in a Dream, just when I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world of the <hi>Moon,</hi> gave us some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Tenets about it; as, that the Elements
were divided into Spheres, like the <hi>Films of an
Onion,</hi> and that such and such Stars mov'd in
such and such <hi>Films.</hi> Some again held, That
Stars were put upon Strings like Beads, and
push'd on by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egions of <hi>Spirits.</hi> Some wou'd
have 'em half under and half over their <hi>Films,</hi>
and Chanels cut for 'em to roul along: Some
believe that the <hi>Film</hi> is transparent, and that
Stars are bowl'd along up em: Some, that
they hang under their <hi>Films,</hi> and that there's
a kind of a mucous Matter, which makes
'em stick like Flies with the feet upwards to
a Cieling: but some believe there's no such
things as <hi>Spheres, Films,</hi> or <hi>Divisions</hi> of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but that they hang in the Air upon
their own Centre, whirling about like Boys
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61174:70"/>
Tops at <hi>Shrovetide.</hi> Thus far the humane
Spirit discover'd the wild Opinions of his
Brethren.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—This is pleasant indeed; but I
believe I light on some Passages as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
You know that every Globe has its <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Aether,</hi> which moves along with it;
and that there are <hi>indefinite Spaces, Vacuums,</hi>
or <hi>Interstitiums</hi> betwixt the <hi>Planets,</hi> if not, the
vertiginous motion of one <hi>Aether</hi> would
justle with another. You are also satisfy'd,
that the Globes of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> have
either of 'em a Republick of Philosophical
Souls, that left their Bodies, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their old Notions.—It was my
chance to travel that way when there was a
publick Dispute betwixt some late deceased
<hi>Cartesians,</hi> and some <hi>Peripateticks;</hi> every Soul
was arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pe</hi> with <hi>Dilemaes, Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Objections,</hi> &amp;c But the Dispute about
Motion and innate <hi>Idea's,</hi> was manag'd so
warmly, that they forgot their Footing, which
was upon the extremity of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and
down they came sluttering into the <hi>indefinite
Space</hi> or <hi>Vacuum</hi> I was telling you of.—
Very well (says a <hi>Peripatetick Soul,) this
Fall is no Motion,</hi> because there's no <hi>Continuity
of Matter</hi> to measure by; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
you all to prove a possibility of getting
out again. A <hi>Carte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ian Soul</hi> fell a laughing at
such a Challenge, and told him, he ought to
get a new Body, and make Experiments;
and afterwards consider the Theory.—No, says the <hi>Peripatetick;</hi> it can't be done;
and therefore I'll not offer to budge till I see
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61174:70"/>
a Demonstration of a possibility, in <hi>Mood
and Figure.</hi> And as they were examining, a
certain <hi>Minor</hi> which was propos'd, comes a
Comet, and with a Brush of its Tail scowr'd
the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and dash'd the Disputants upon
the <hi>Vortex</hi> again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—And what became o'th' Cause
then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—It was put by till another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
by reason of a black deformed Spirit
that had had the Misfortune to leave its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for a worse Place, which came roaring
and howling into the midst of the <hi>Cartesian
Souls,</hi> crying out, Where's the Spirit of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi>
that pretended to prove a Deity by
Innate <hi>Ideas,</hi> when he shou'd have prov'd such
<hi>Idea</hi> to be the <hi>Idea</hi> of a real Being; 'twas the
weakness of this Argument that damn'd me:
Besides, I'm continually chous'd and hunted
about by a company of snearing Devils,
that stigmatize me with the scandalous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a <hi>Cartesian Spirit;</hi> pointing at me
with their <hi>sooty Paws,</hi> as I pass along; Do ye
see (says one) yonder Inhabitant of the
<hi>Cartesian World:</hi> See (says another) the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
that preaches of a subtle Matter which
forms the Liquidity of Bodies. Pray (says
a Third) will you go ask your <hi>Master</hi> what
he means by the Sun's <hi>forming a great Vertex of
sluid Matter for the Stars to swim in?</hi> And
whether the Sun is both Agent and Patient
in such a Formation? If not, of what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent
Matter he forms this <hi>fluid Matter?</hi>
Or, whether he pretends to an immediate
Creation of it out of nothing? with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61174:71"/>
sand more such puzzling Questions, which
doubles my damnation, to solve 'em.—
Now Mr. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> if you can keep up your
Credit, and mollifie my Plagues, do it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
—Don't trouble me yet, reply'd the
<hi>Philosophical Spirit,</hi> lest you spoil a new
Notion that I left unfinished upon my Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
O (says the <hi>Black Disciple)</hi> that my
Master shou'd study to damn People when
they are dead! I'll warrant you, 'tis to find
out the reason why <hi>Mercury</hi> is sometimes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the <hi>Earth</hi> than the <hi>Sun:</hi> But pray, by the
way, what's the Use of this, and a thousand
more such <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> if Vertue be the
proper Task of the Intellect, &amp; if the business
of a wise Man be not Talking, but living?
Thus the poor Spirit troop'd off again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Errand, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling his invisible Chains,

            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—This was a very strange Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
indeed, and puts me in mind of half a
dozen Philosophical Spirits, which were hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
together, and ty'd Muzzle to Muzzle in
the <hi>Bastile of Mercury,</hi> for pretending to find
out a way to appear visible to Mortals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the assumption of Aerial Bodies, or any
other Vehicle; as I pass'd by 'em, there was
one that had his Notion too setled to remove
it by such a Treatment—Courage (said
he) Comrades; I'll procure a speedy Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from this Cage, by appearing in
this posture to the Inhabitants of every Globe,
and making 'em send Ambassadors to our
Judges about us.—Say you so (says one
of 'em) I pray make a Demonstration to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61174:71"/>
us first how it may be done. Thus; (reply'd

not always confin'd to the ordinary Method

into the Eye, which necessarily supposes a

of <hi>separated Spirits,</hi> all <hi>Females;</hi> they
had been ridicul'd, and chas'd out of all the
Globes for their awkward <hi>Dresses,</hi> and
brought along with 'em the Fashons of Two

their Necks as big as Cart-wheels; some
<hi>Head Dresses</hi> as large as the Tail of a <hi>Comet;</hi>
some were in one Dress, and some in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
a few were rubbing and scowring the
outside of Heaven, to make it transparent,
that they might see to dress their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

some were pleas'd, some in a Passion:
some lik'd their own Mode the best, and some
prefer'd that of another; and some were
quarrelling with every particular Dress, and
made up a <hi>Iargon of all Dresses</hi> together: But
to see the different Figures, Postures, Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Complements, and Tittle-tattle amongst
'em, made me believe that they were some
Generation of Spirits which I had never
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61174:73"/>
heard of: Whereupon, I apply'd my self to
the <hi>Aristotelian Soul</hi> I told you of, to desire

but if I wou'd ask the Spirit behind

cou'd hear him say,—<hi>Poor</hi> Heraclitus,

they were most of them chas'd out of the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,</hi>
as I noted before; and coming near,
the Globe of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> there was a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Spirits about a Chalenge between
a Heathen and Christian <hi>Philosophick Soul,</hi>
concerning the <hi>Burning up of the World:</hi>
Here might Humanity if they'd had <hi>Eyes and
Prospective Glasses strong enough,</hi> have seen their
old <hi>Maxime</hi> confuted, which says, <hi>There's no
penetration of Bodies;</hi> for here were at least
ten Millons of Spirits got together all into one
Body to hear the Dispute; but there was such
a fluttering Hubbub, that the Orators were
fain to leave off a while, to see if the Noise
would cease; tho' in vain, for every little
Auditor wou'd pretend to dictate, and give his
Opinion: I cou'd hear one something louder
than the rest, crying out,—Alas, alas, if
the World is to be burnt up, and all the Stars
consum'd, what shall I do for a Lodging; I
shall ne'er away with the Converse of <hi>Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Spirits in the indefinite Space:</hi> Oh, says
another, for my Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> how gladly
wou'd I learn o'er again the Lesson of the
World's Eternity, that I might be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
this Litigious Spirit, that pleads for an
untenanting of the Stars. Another was for
Bantering; and said, the Universe wou'd
make a prodigal Burnt-Offering. Thus one
cries out one thing, and another another; so
that the whole Assembly began to vote it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to name such a Topick; and that there
shou'd be no more such Challenges for fear of
a Tumult. You know I was always a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61174:74"/>
hater of Tumults and Quarrels; so that
being in haste to get away, I made but one
flight to the World in <hi>Venus;</hi> where I light
upon a very high Mountain; but I had not
tarry'd long there, but the Mountain was
surrounded with Myriads of <hi>Female Spirits,</hi>
Arm'd <hi>Cap a-pe</hi> with immaterial Javelins,
Bows, Darts, and Colours of War; and one
amongst the rest, comes up to me, giving me
to understand in short, that I must either
quit that Globe, or prepare to encounter all
the Inhabitants; which were mostly <hi>Amazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and <hi>Stoicesses,</hi> and had a Charter from
the Secretary of <hi>Fate,</hi> to make that Globe
their <hi>Retreat,</hi> to secure 'em from the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of <hi>Male Spirits;</hi> and also, that they
had the Privilege to chastise all intruding
<hi>Male Spirits</hi> as they pleas'd, by a <hi>Court Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;</hi>
and therefore, believing me to be a
Traveller, and a Stranger to their Customs,
were so courteous, as to give me time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to dispose of my
self as I pleas'd.—I view'd
the soft Herald from Top to
Toe, and considering her Air
and Features, I remember
that in my last Search in the
Registry of <hi>Fate,</hi> I had seen
her Character, with this Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature
over against it.</p>
               <p>I had no need to ask Questions upon this
Reflexion, knowing the <hi>Riddle</hi> would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
in another Globe, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1691. and
so without any acknowledgment of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
or other complement, than in thought,
I stood off again; and in about two Seconds
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61174:74"/>
of a Minute, got to the <hi>Boundaries of the
World in</hi> Mars: There I was up to the Ears at
first dash, amongst <hi>Male-Spirits;</hi> (forgive the
Expression, I'm to be embody'd shortly,) and
found 'em generally calling Councels of War,
which put me upon the Curiosity of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Religion they were of; and I was
inform'd they were mostly <hi>Christian Spirits:</hi>
and upon asking what their General was? I
presently concluded, <hi>Nothing at all.</hi>—A
strange kind of Exression, <hi>Brother,</hi> is not it?
But 'tis not strange, when I add, That it was
farther told me, they were to fight against,
and destroy one another, for such mean In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
as (when examin'd,) are not worth
the exercising any Passion but <hi>Hate.</hi> Indeed
this amaz'd me above whatever I met with in
all my Rambles, altho' the next Encounter
was not altogether unworthy my Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
—'Twas thus:</p>
               <p>A little farther was a <hi>Nunnery of Spirits,</hi>
wherein a certain Fault had been committed;
but I dare not say what, for fear of prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the next time I travel that way, since
the Law was satisfy'd, in giving up the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
to the <hi>Mob of Spirits;</hi> which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her severely enough; and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
they hurry'd her to a certain <hi>Meeting of
Dissenting Spirits;</hi> and having pull'd the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resisting

use neither Chairs nor Pulpits in that Globe,)
one of the <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> mounts, and begins as

came near, to ask the meaning, up starts one

for not making my <hi>Honours</hi> before I ask'd
Questions; whereupon, I made a very <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

thinking 'em to be <hi>Spanish Souls;</hi> upon which,
one of 'em condescended to tell me, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

               <p>Nine hundred ninety nine Millions
of Millions,—Let me see again; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
my <hi>Calculation</hi> may be false.—Suppose
once more, that everry Man (computing one
Man with another,) is compos'd of a handful
of <hi>pure Earth,</hi> all the Particles of the other
Elements being separated from it, then it
follows, that just so many Handfuls of Earth
as the Globe contains in it, may be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Men; but no more, unless the <hi>God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
will make more <hi>Earthly Globes;</hi> for
when every Man rises at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and assumes his own particular hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Earth, if there shou'd be more <hi>Men</hi>
than <hi>Earth,</hi>—Ha,—Some Souls must go
without Bodies; which is very absurd.—
Nor is it very reasonable, that the Earth
shou'd not every Bit of it be made into Men,
that when they come to take every one their
own, there may be no Earth left; and then
'tis an easie thing for the <hi>last Fire</hi> to consume
the other Elements. No,—that won't
do neither;—for I'd forgot that Man is
made of all the Elements; and therefore
when all the Earth is spent in making Men,
the Elements must be spent likewise, that is,
the whole <hi>Earth, Air, Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> will
(when every one takes their own,) be equally
divided, and march up and down an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Indefinite Space,</hi> or <hi>Vacuum, in living
Glorify'd Humanity.</hi>—Very well,—now
I have it; There were at first 9999999999
Spirits, and there's just so many handful of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61174:77"/>
Dust in the Earth. Now if I cou'd tell how
many Spirits are yet unbody'd, 'tis but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the Remainder from the first Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and the difference is the Handfuls of
Earth that are yet to be made into Men; and
when I know this, I shall know how long it
will be before I shall be <hi>re-united</hi> again to my
<hi>Body,</hi> which I was separated from about 3000
<hi>Years since.</hi>—Methinks I long to renew the

is also pre-existent, and was created before
<hi>Adam</hi> had a Being; but I'll ask for no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,

            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Sp.</speaker>
               <p>—When Matter was created, 'twas
a great Store-house of all other Beings that
were to be created from it, all which lay
confusedly sleeping in their <hi>Chaos;</hi> but of this
<hi>Lump</hi> was <hi>Adam</hi> created; and if so, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was potentially in it before he had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Being. After his Creation, he was
maintain'd from the productions of Earth and
Water, by a destruction of, or more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
through a conversion of their Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his. Hence <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children were only a
Transmutation of other material Bodies, or
the Effect of Meat and Drink in new <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
which lay once in such and such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and before that in the material <hi>Chaos</hi> we
first spoke of. Now since the Mechanism
of Nature is order'd that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
(unless by its Author,) but only trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted
or chang'd into other Matter; as a Fire
that burns, part of it goes to Ashes, part into
Soot, part into Air, but yet is always some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
or in some thing; so that all the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Changes we see, are nothing else but a
conversion of one Element into another back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards, according to the adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and modifications of Agents and Patients;
This consider'd, it will plainly appear, that
that Body which I am just now going
into, was the last year part of it growing in
such a Crop of Corn, part of it in such an
Apple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tree, part of it in such a River, part
of it in such an Ox, Sheep, Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
only by a proper Revolution of Particles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
different <hi>Species,</hi> so adaptly disposited,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61174:80"/>
that Nature found the Composition to fit one
new distinct <hi>Species</hi> by it self; and according
to its Commission, or first Settled Chain of
Causes produc'd a humane Body, fit for the
Actuation and Conjunction of a Spirit. Hence
'tis manifest my Body was as soon in the
Bosom of its Causes as <hi>Adam</hi>'s, and the last
Body that shall be created, as soon as mine.
Nay, to go farther, since from Eternity the great
<hi>Creator</hi> did design to make a World, from
which my Body was to be produced, I might
say, that my Body was from all Eternity <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly</hi>
and <hi>potentially,</hi> tho' <hi>actually</hi> in time,;
which is the utmost that can be said of the
Pre existence of Spirits. And I defie every
Spirit in the Universe, to prove the least dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in Time betwixt the actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of the Existence of its Body, and
its self, or that the Potentiality of both is
not equal, to wit, eternal.</p>

               <p>This Argument wou'd hold, if it
cou'd be prov'd, <hi>That the Soul is not so clogg'd
and incapacitated in its Act of Reminiscence by
coming into the Body, but that it might easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
what has happen'd in its pre existent state,</hi>
For we have innumerable Instances of the
Soul's being more incapacitated in its Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
one time than another, in the same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and this by Fits, Distractions, Diseases,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which to me appears demonstrative,
that if the Indispositions of the Body, which
are only accidental, hinder a regular opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul; much more may the Body
it self, when first ty'd to, and made coessential
with it.</p>

               <p>We'll grant, much depends on the
Body, as to the Mode of Perception and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not so very much as is suppos'd; To
mention that leisure time of Dreams; When
perhaps the Body and Soul have the least
actual dependance one of another, we shall
find the habit of Reminiscence fresh at awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
again; but to shew for once, that the
Soul does not forget what it acts when sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Body, by reason of the Body's
indisposition. Consider the Cases of Trances,
Examinations of Witches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what think ye
of a Soul that has rambled out of the Body
for two or three days together, and when it
has return'd, and the Body reviv'd, it has
told of infallible Truths some hundred Miles
distance, where it self actually was: This we
have hundreds of creditable Instances to prove?
which consider'd, does fully (from the first
presuppos'd consequence of Reminiscence,)
destroy the Doctrine of <hi>Pre-existence.</hi>
