         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

ACCOUNT of a moſt Horrid and Barbarous
MURTHER and ROBBERY,</head>
            <head type="sub">Committed on the Body of Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> a Gentleman of Eight Hundred Pound a
Year, near <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> (who lately lived in <hi>Soho-ſquare</hi>) by his
own Tennant and Servant, and ſeven more Villains, cutting off his Head, putting
it into a <hi>Sack</hi>; and burying it with the Body in a Hop-Field, in his <hi>Scarlet Cloaths</hi>;
with the most strange, wonderful, and miraculous diſcovery of the ſame, on <hi>Tueſday</hi>
the 22d. of <hi>March,</hi> 1694. by the Apparition of the Gentlemans ſpirit to divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of good Quality in the Countrey; and of the Noiſe of Drums and Trumpets
beating Points of War on the very ſpot of Ground where the Murthered Captain was
buried; with the <hi>Murtherers</hi> Confeſſion, and divers others ſtrange Particulars.
Licenſed according to Order.</head>
            <p>WHAT Dreadful Remembrances have we, of the Judgments of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, ſhew'd againſt Murtherers in a moſt remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as divers of our Modern Chronicles do ſet forth, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to deter the baſeſt Perſon from the Commiſsion of ſo horrid
a Fact as Murther; yet it is daily ſeen how the Sin increaſes rather than abates:
for how many Inſtances have we of late of this Nature, both in City and Countrey,
and none will take warning till they are involv'd and inſnar'd in utter Ruine.</p>
            <p>For the Hainonſneſs of this Sin of Murther, I ſuppoſe none can be Ignorant,
that it is of the deepeſt Die, a moſt crying Sin. This we may ſee in the firſt Act
of this kind that ever was committed. <hi>Abel's Blood crieth from the Earth, and
God tells Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 10. And it is worth our Notice, what ſtrange, and even
miraculous Means it hath often pleaſed God to uſe for the diſcovery of this Sin; the
very brute Creatures have many times been made Inſtruments of it; nay, often the
extream Horrour of the Perſon's own Conſcience hath made him betray himſelf;
other times the Apparition of the Murdered Perſon, (as in the following Instance)
from whence its evident that it is not any cloſeneſs uſed in the acting of this Sin,
that can ſecure the <hi>Malefactor</hi> from the Vengeance of it.</p>
            <p>I forſee there are abundance of Men, in whoſe Hands this Paper may come (and
thoſe as they think themſelves, no mean Wit too) becauſe forſooth, they have not
been Eye-witneſses themſelves will dread many of the following Paſsages, in the
Diſcovery of the Murther, as Fabulous: All that I ſhall ſay to theſe Gentlemen is,
if they dare believe nothing but what they themſelves have ſeen; I am ſure they dare
not believe themſelves to be Rational Creatures, and at the ſame time avouch it.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſome men in the World ſo hardy and bold, as not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Apparitions, Damons, and Spectres, but the very Beeing of Spirits; Theſe I
look upon as Men poſseſsed with ſuch an incurable Madneſs, as no Hellebor is ſufficient
to quit them of. Others who belive they are, yet think them ſo confined to their
own apartments, that they may not inter-meddle with Humane affairs, at leaſt
not ſhew themſelves to Men: There is, no doubt, variety of Impostures in the
ſtairs of them, but to reject all ſuch Appearances as Fabulous, is too ſevere a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Credit of the best Hiſtorians, both Antient and Modern. <hi>But
to proceed to the Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Brown</hi> the unhappy Subject of this Narrative, was an honeſt, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and worthy Gentleman of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> near <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> had an Houſe in
<hi>Soho-Square,</hi> London, he was extreamly well beloved of the Gentlemen of the

being ſiſter to the preſent Lord C—The Captain had one of his Tenants
to wait upon him, when he went Abroad; while in the Countrey, a Fellow,
whom he put much Confidence, and who was indebted to him 50 <hi>l.</hi> for Rent,
for which he only took his Bond, ſaying often in the hearing of many, that he
would never touch him for it, till he ſaw him able. In the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Week laſt

fourſcore Pounds at a place about Ten Miles from home, communicated the ſame

to ſeven Countrey Labouring-fellow of the Neighbourhood, all as wicked as
himſelf; Theſe idle Perſons conſult and confederate together to Way lay the
Captain, at a place agreed on in the Road, as he is as to paſs Home, reſolving
there to Rob him of his Money and Life at the ſame time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it ſo happen'd,
that the Captain returning late in the Evening, and calling at a Friends Houſe, He
by their Perſwaſions, leſt his Money there for fear of a caſual Robbery, not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending

joyning with them) knokt him off his Horſe, cut his Skull, cut off his
Head, and put it into a Sack they had provided; after which they carryed him
to a Hop Ground juſt by, where digging a Hole, they threw him in, Cloaths
and all, and covered him with Earth having first <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Tenant-Servant went to the Captains Houſe impudently, like <hi>Solomon's.</hi>
Whore <hi>Wiping his Mouth, and ſaying he had done no ill.</hi> But the Captains Lady
ſeeing of him, asked him for his Maſter, who replyed, he thought he was come
Home the other Night: However great ſearch having been made after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

Apparition, in the plain Dreſs, Form and Shape of the Captain, appeared to
two Gentlewomen of the Captain's Acquaintance, as they lay in Bed; he drew
the Curtains, and looked on them with a ſmiling Countenance, and then walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Window, and opened the Caſement; the Gentlewomen ſaid, <hi>Lord <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Captain; what make you here, you're very merry, ſure you have been up a Drinking all
Night,</hi> but he retired without anſwering a Word; after which the Gentlewomen
calling the Servant-Maid, ſhe came up, to whom they demanded the Reaſon why
ſhe let the Captain up into their Room. But the Maid declared, that ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaw, nor heard him, and that the doors of the Houſe were ſhut.</p>
            <p>Some days after the Captain appear'd to an Acquaintance in the ſame Village,
an ancient Gentleman that was ſick of the Gout: Coming into the Houſe, the
Son of the Gentleman deſir'd the Captain not to make a Noiſe, for that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ill, and juſt in a ſlumber; the Captain went and looked on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then ſat down with the Son, who talked to the Captain, but he made
no reply, only ſmil'd, and then retir'd, or vaniſhed. At the time of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition,
the two Gentlewomen, nor this young Man, knew any thing of the
Captain's Murther, from <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> till laſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> was Seven-night, being
the 22d. of <hi>March,</hi> it was not known what was become of the Captain; but on
the <hi>Thurſday</hi> the ſaid two of the ſeven Rogues that aſſiſted the Captain's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in the Murthering of him, were with ſix other labouring Men, working in
the very ſame Hop-Garden where the Captain was buried; and on a ſudden
they heard the noiſe, or ſound of Drums and Trumpets; upon which, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Forces might be Marching by, they all run out to ſee them, but when
they came, could ſee nothing, only heard the noiſe, upon which, returning to
their Work, the noiſe encreaſed, and of a ſudden, one of the Murderers ſaid to
the other, <hi>Theſe Drums are for the diſcovery of Captain</hi> Brown's <hi>Murther;</hi> but
the other reply'd with a frowning look, <hi>Hold your Bawling you fool, you know
not what you ſay,</hi> but ſome other of the Company hearing of the Words, went
out, and acquainted the next Juſtice, who was the County Coroner, of what he
heard, who enjoyning them ſilence, and ordering a Guard near the place,
came and heard the like noiſe, and then ſaid to all the Fellows at work.
<hi>Certainly here muſt be ſome Murder or otber extraordinary hapened hereabouts, that we thus hear this noiſe, and ſee
nothing. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which he ordered all the Fellows to dig, and thrusting in his Cane at many places, puſhed at laſt in
the very ſpot that the Captain lay buried, where Digging, one of the Captain's Legs, and piece of the Scarlet Cloak
appearing, the two Fellows of the Company, that were two of the Captain's Murtherers, took their Heels and ran
for it, but were ſoon ſtopt, and committed to</hi> Shrewsbury <hi>Goal, where the Captain's Man was before, who as ſoon as
ever he ſaw two of his Companions come, and that his Captain's Body was found, made a large Confeſſion of the whole
Murther; upon which the other five were immediatly apprehended, and are all now in Goal, in order to receive their
