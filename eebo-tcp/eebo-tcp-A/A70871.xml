         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>That if Tithes and other maintenance by Glebes, Oblations, Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, formerly ſetled on our Miniſters, be either wilfully withheld, or ſubstracted from them by the people, in part or in whole, the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates may and ought by coercive Laws, Penalties to inforce the payment of them in due form and time, both by the Law of God, and Rules of Iuſtice, without any Injury or Oppreſſion to the people.</hi>

                     <p>3ly. Our Saviours own words recorded in the Goſpel, are direct in point. <hi>Luke 12. 57, 58, 59. Mat. 5. 25.

                     <p>1.

                     <p>2ly.

                     <p>4ly. That they reſolve, the exemption from Tithes though amounting but to a fourth part in every Pariſh, would prove a great prejudice to the King and all other Patrons in their Advowſons; to the Leſſors and Farmers of Tithes, to the incumbents and people; and that the moving of ſuch Novelties <hi>might occaſion great Troubles</hi>

Whither I refer the Reader for further ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Objection; and ſhall conclude of penal <hi>Laws</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth of Fates: <hi>Fata volentes ducunt, Nolentes trabunt:</hi> thoſe who will not willingly pay their Tiths muſt and ought to be compelled thereunto by penal Statutes:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1. That the payment of Tithes being not only<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> warranted but commanded in and by the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the conſtant practice of Chriſtians in all Ages, Churches, there neither is, nor can be the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>2ly. All that <hi>Conſcience</hi> can pretend againſt their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as <hi>Tithes,</hi> is only this <hi>Anabaptiſtical Deviſe,</hi> and <hi>loud Lye</hi> of <hi>Canne</hi> and others; <hi>That the payment of a preciſe Tenth part of mens increaſe to their Miniſters is Jewiſh or Antichristian,</hi> and ſo <hi>unlawfull:</hi> both which I have unanſwerably refelled. Therefore this can be no ground or Conſcience for any to detain them. But if any ſcrupulous Conſciences be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in this point, let them either pay their Miniſters the Moitie or 9. parts, or the 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of their

                     <p>3ly. Many of theſe very Objectors, pretending Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as <hi>Souldiers</hi> or <hi>Sequeſtrators,</hi> have made no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to enforce thouſands of Pariſhioners of late years throughout the Nation to pay their Miniſters Tithes to themſelves for pretended Arrears or ſequeſtred Goods, and exacted Monthly contributions out of Miniſters Tithes to pay the Army, without any ſcruple of Conſcience, levying them by diſtreſs and armed violence, when detained. If then they can enforce others thus to pay Tithes to themſelves, and thoſe to whom they were never due by any known Law of God or Man: With what Conſcience can they detain them from our Miniſters, to whom they are due by all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and human laws, or condemn the enforced payment of them from themſelves, who have ſo violently extorted them from others?</p>
                     <p>4ly.

                     <p>The 3d. Objection is, That <hi>Tithes are pure Alms;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> not to be enforced by any Law.

                     <p>I have anſwered this Objection elſewhere, and ſhall here<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> only declare, whence, I conceive, this Error (that <hi>Tithes are mere Alms</hi>) originally proceeded, to rectifie miſtakes of the meaning of ſome antient Authors, and clear two Texts of Scripture which ſome Scholars and ignorant People miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I conceive this Error ſprang originally from the miſunderſtanding of that Text of Deutr. 14. 28, 29. <hi>At the end of three years thou ſhalt bring forth all the Tith of thine encreaſe</hi> THE SAME YEAR, and ſhalt <hi>lay it up within thy Gates.

From which Texts ſome have conceived, That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paid Tithes only every third year. 2ly. That they paid them then not to the Levites only, but to the Stranger, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, Widows and Poor amongſt them, who had a right and ſhare in them as well as the Levites. 3ly. That theſe Texts uſe the phraſe not of <hi>paying</hi> Tithes, as a Debt or Duty, but of GIVING them as an Alms; and ſeeing they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thus to the Stranger, Fatherleſs, Widow at Alms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Levites likewiſe, here coupled with them. This doubtleſs was the true ground that <hi>Tithes were reputed mere Alms</hi> by ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not a <hi>Divine Right peculiar to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi>

Firſt take notice, That neither theſe, nor any other Texts in Scripture ſtile Tithes <hi>Almes,</hi> much leſſe <hi>pure Almes,</hi> which men may give or retain at their pleaſures. 2ly. That they expreſſely reſolve the contrarie that they are no Alms at all in the objected ſenſe, but a moſt certain poſitive commanded Debt and Dutie, no waies arbitrarie in the leaſt degree. For 1.

For, 1. <hi>They muſt</hi> bring all of it out of their Houſes as an hallowed thing. 2ly.

                     <p>For the 2d.

For no ſooner ſhall Tithes be abrogated, but every Landlord will raiſe the full annual value of them in his annual Rents, or Fines, and exact more for them from his poor Tenants, Farmers, Leſſees, than they might have compounded for with their Miniſters: and where then is their expected Gain, or Eaſe, wherewith they are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Impoſtors? As for the rich <hi>Landlords,</hi> they complain not of Tithes as a Burden, and need no exemption from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64081:47"/>
them: and as all predial Tithes now really iſſue out of their Inheritances charged with them in perpetuity, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abate, allow the full value of them to their Farmers and Tenants in their Fees and Rents, by way of Defalcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they being in truth the greateſt and moſt conſiderable Tithe-payers, not the poor Farmers, or under Tenants: So their Inheritances only will be much improved, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Tithes aboliſhing at leaſt one part in ten; whiles the poor Miniſters and Families ſhall be ſtarved, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants then more racked by the Landlords than by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now. And this is the Godly goodly Eaſe this Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Project will effect, if put into execution, by which none will be real Gainers, in their Temporal Eſtate, but thoſe who have Inheritances; and all loſers in their Spiritual Eſtate, by the loſſe or great diſcouragements of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Hebr. 13. 17.

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1. That this Objection no waies concerns Soldiers, Weavers, Tailors, Tradeſmen, Townſmen and other Mechanicks, who are the moſt and greateſt Sticklers and Petitioners againſt Tithes; but only Husbandmen and Countrey Gentlemen and Farmers living upon Tillage, very few of which (not one of a thouſand) ever yet petitioned againſt Tithes, as ſuch a grievous Oppreſſion (at leaſtwiſe as a Farmer) for the burdenſomneſs of Tithes, but only as an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> or other <hi>Sectary,</hi> out of hatred and oppoſition to our <hi>Miniſters Callings</hi> or <hi>Perſons.</hi> And till the Generality or Major part of the Gentry, Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Country Farmers in each County Petition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt their <hi>Predial Tithes</hi> as ſuch an intollerable <hi>Grievance,</hi> no Officers, Soldiers, Citizens, Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mechanicks, and buſie-bodies in other mens Callings and Grievances which concern them not, are no waies to be heard, countenanced or credited in this particular, by any Powers whatſoever in point of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or Prudence. 2ly. The payment of Tithes, never yet diſcouraged any Perſon, either in the Land of <hi>Canaan, England,</hi> or other Countreys, (at leaſt not any conſiderable number of men, or any that had either true Wiſdome, grace, honeſty, or love to God and the Miniſtrey) from any ſort of <hi>Tillage</hi> or <hi>improvement whatſoever out of which Tithes are paid,</hi> the gain by the good husbandry and improvement being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompenced in the nine Parts, over and above the <hi>Tithes.</hi> And therefore till the Objectors can make good
