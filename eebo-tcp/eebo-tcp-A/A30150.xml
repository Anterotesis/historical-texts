            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

should be the Soul of each one of you. House and

What are they to Salvation? to the Salvation of the
Soul? 2. Because I perceive that this, so great a thing,
and about which Persons should be so much concerned,
is neglected to amazement, and that by the most of

things that are at the End of a Christians race in this

whoever hath had but the knowledge and due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of them, have not stuck to run hazzards,
hazzards of every kind, that they might imbrace and
enjoy them. Yea, saith <hi>Faith,</hi> it must needs be so,

were, even, <hi>For the joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the Cross, and despised the shame, and is set down

of things, and so by consequence not such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
as can make the Cross and self denial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to them for the sake of Christ, and of the
things that are where he now sitteth at the Right-Hand
of God (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4.) Therefore our Lord
Jesus doth even at the beginning give to his followers
this instruction. And lest any of them should take
distaste at his Saying, he presenteth them with the
consideration of three things together: namely, The
<hi>Cross,</hi> the Loss of <hi>Life</hi> and the <hi>Soul;</hi> and then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth
with them for the same, saying, Here is the
<hi>Cross,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> and the <hi>Soul.</hi> 1. The <hi>Cross,</hi> and that
you must take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you come not to me, and abide not with me. Now

Cross come after me and so preserve your Souls from
perishing? or will you <hi>shun</hi> the Cross to save your

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
all at the stake: and if it be so, What will it profit
a Man, if by forsaking of me he should get the whole
World? <hi>For what shall it profit a Man, if he shall get
the whole World, and lose his own Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus laid the Soul in one ballance, and the
World in the other, and affirmed that the Soul out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the whole World, and is incomparably for value
and worth beyond it; in the next place, he descends
to a second question (which is that I have chosen at
this time for my Text) saying, <hi>Or what shall a Man
give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these Words we have first a supposition, and such
an one as standeth upon a double bottom.</p>
            <p>The Supposition is this, That the Soul is capable
of being lost, or thus, <hi>'tis possible for a Man to lose his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> The double bottom that this supposition is
grounded upon, is, 1. A Man's ignorance of the worth
of his Soul, and of the danger that it is in: And the
second is, for that Men commonly do set an higher
price upon present ease and enjoyments than they do
upon eternal Salvation. The last of these doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
follow upon the first; for if Men be ignorant of
the value and worth of their Souls, as by Christ in
the Verse before is implyed; what should hinder but
that Men should set an higher esteem upon that
with which their carnal desires are taken, then upon
that about which they are not concerned, and of
which they know not the worth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43327:5"/>
But again, As <hi>this</hi> by the Text is clearly supposed,
so there is also <hi>something</hi> implied: namely, <hi>That it is
impossible to possess some Men with the worth of their
Souls, until they are utterly and everlastingly lost. What
shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> That is
Men, when their Souls are lost, and shut down under
the Hatches in the Pits, and Hells, in endless perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and destruction: Then they will see the worth
of their Souls, then they will consider what they have
lost, and truly not till then. This is plain, not only
to sense, but by the natural scope of the words, <hi>What
shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Or what
would not those that are now for sin made to see
themselves lost, by the light of Hell Fire (for some
will never be convinced that they are lost, till with
rich <hi>Dives</hi> they see it in the light of Hell Flames:)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
say, what would not such, if they had it, <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 16. 22, 23.</note> give in
exchange for their immortal Souls, or to recover them
again from that place and torment?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The first is,</hi> That the loss of the Soul is the highest,
the greatest Loss; a Loss that can never be repaired or
made up. What shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?
<hi>that is, to recover or redeem his lost Soul to liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall observe two Truths in the Words.</p>
            <p>2. The second Truth is this, <hi>That how unconcerned
and careless soever some now be, about the Loss or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls: yet the day is coming</hi> (but it will
then be too late) <hi>when Men will be willing, had they
never so much, to give it all in exchange for their Souls.</hi>
For so the Question implies, <hi>what shall a Man give in
exchange for his Soul?</hi> What would he not give?
What would he not part with at that day; the day in
which he shall see himself damned, if he had it, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for his Soul?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43327:6"/>
The first Observation or truth drawn from the
words is cleared by the Text, <hi>what shall a Man give in
exchange for his Soul?</hi> That is, There is not any
thing, nor all the things under Heaven, were they
all in one Man's Hand, and all at his disposal, that
would go in exchange for the Soul, that would be of
value to fetch back one lost Soul, or that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
recover it from the confines of Hell. <note n="e" place="bottom">Psal. 49. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The
redemption of the Soul is precious, it ceaseth for ever.</hi>
And what saith the words before the Text but the
same; <hi>For what shall it profit a Man, if he shall gain
the whole World, and lose his own Soul?</hi> What shall
profit a Man that has lost his Soul? nothing at all,
though he hath by that Loss gained the whole World;
for all the World is not worth a Soul, not worth a
Soul in the Eye of God, and judgment of the Law.
And it is from this consideration that good <hi>Elihu</hi>
cautioneth <hi>Job</hi> to take heed, <hi>because there is wrath</hi>
(saith he) <hi>beware, lest he take thee away with his stroke:
when a great Ransom cannot deliver thee. Will he esteem
thy Riches? no not Gold, nor all the Forces of Strength,</hi>
Job 36. 18, 19. <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> What is there
more in the World, for Money answereth all things?
that is, <hi>all</hi> but Soul-concerns: it can neither be a
price for Souls while here, nor can that with all the
Forces of Strength recover one out of Hell Fire.</p>

               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o then, The first Truth drawn from the
Words stands firm; namely, <hi>That the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss of the Soul
is the highest, the greatest Loss, a Loss that can never
be repaired or made up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my discourse upon this subject, I shall observe
this method:</p>
            <p>I. I shall shew you what the Soul is.</p>
            <p>II. I shall shew you the greatness of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43327:6"/>
III. I shall shew you what it is to lose the Soul.</p>
            <p>IV. I shall shew you the cause for which Men lose
their Souls, and by this time the Greatness of the
Loss will be manifest.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>I shall shew you what the Soul is,</hi> both as to the
various names it goes under, as also by describing of
it by its powers and properties, though in all I shall
be but brief, for I intend no long discourse.</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Soul</hi> is often called the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man, or that,
in and by which things to either good or evil have
their rise: thus desires are of the Heart or Soul, yea
before desires, the first conception of good or ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lare
in the Soul, the Heart. The Heart understands,
wills, affects, reasons, judges, but these are the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the Soul; wherefore Heart and Soul, are
often taken for one and the same. <note n="f" place="bottom">Prov. 23. 26. Mat. 15. 19. 1 Pet. 3. 15. Ps. 26. 6.</note> 
               <hi>My Son, give me
thy Heart. Out of the Heart proceedeth evil thoughts,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is often called the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a
Man: because it not only giveth Being, but life to
all things and actions in, and done by him. Hence
Soul and Spirit are put together as to the same action.

not only with what kind of desires he desired
God, but with what principal matter his desires were
brought forth: It was with my Soul, saith he, to
wit, With my Spirit within me. So that of <hi>Mary,
My Soul,</hi> saith she, <hi>doth magnifie the Lord, and my
Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour:</hi> not, that Soul
and Spirit are in this place to be taken for two supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Powers in Man: but the same great Soul is

here put under two names or terms, to shew that it
was the principal part in <hi>Mary,</hi> to wit, her Soul that
magnified God, even that part that could <hi>spirit,</hi> and
put <hi>life</hi> into her whole self to do it. Indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Spirit</hi> is not taken so largely, but is confined to
some one power or faculty of the Soul; <note n="h" place="bottom">Joh 20. 3.</note>

               </gap>e to
understand other things, but many times by <hi>Spirit</hi>
we must understand the <hi>Soul,</hi> and also by <hi>Soul</hi> the
<hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Therefore by <hi>Soul</hi> we understand the Spiritual,
the best, and most noble part of Man, as distinct
from the Body, even <hi>that</hi> by which we understand,
imagine, reason, and discourse. And indeed (as I
shall further shew you presently) the Body is but a
poor empty Vessel, without this great Thing, called
the <hi>SOVL</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 26.</note> 
               <hi>The Body without the Spirit or Soul, is dead,</hi>
or nothing but a clod of dust (her Soul departed from
her, for she died.) It is therefore the chief and most
noble part of Man.</p>
            <p>4. The Soul is often called the Life of Man, not a
Life of the same Stamp and Nature of the Bruit: for
the Life of Man, that is, of the rational Creature, is
that, as he is such, wherein, consisteth and abideth
the Understanding, and Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore
then a Man dieth, or the Body ceaseth to act, or live
in the exercise of the thoughts, which formerly used
to be in him: When the Soul departeth, as I hinted
even now, her Soul departed from her, for she
died; and as another good Man saith, <note n="k" place="bottom">Ps. 146. 4.</note> 
               <hi>In that
very day their thoughts perish,</hi> &amp;c. The first Text is
more emphatical: <hi>Her Soul was in departing</hi> (for she
dyed.) There is a Soul of a Beast, a Bird, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43327:7"/>
Soul of a Man is another thing: it is his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Reason, and Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this
Soul, when it departs, he dies. Nor is this life,
when gone out of the Body annihilate, as is the Life
of a Beast; no, this in it self is immortal, and has yet
a Place and Being when gone out of the Body it
dwelt in; yea, as quick, as lively is it in its Senses,
if not far more abundant than when it was in the
Body; but I call it the Life, because so long as that
remains in the Body, the Body is not dead. And in
this sense it is to be taken where he saith, <hi>He that
loseth his life for my sake, shall save it unto life eternal:</hi>
And this is the Soul that is intended in the Text, and
not the Breath, as in some other places is meant. And
this is evident, because the Man has a Being, a sensible
Being, after he has lost the Soul; I mean not by the
Man, a Man in this World, nor yet in the Body or
in the Grave; but by Man we must understand ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Soul in Hell, or Body and Soul there after
the Judgment is over. And for this the Text also is
plain, for therein we are presented with a Man sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the damage that he has sustained by losing of
his Soul: <hi>VVhat shall a Man give in exchange for his
Soul?</hi> But,</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>whole Man</hi> goeth under this denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Man consisting of Body and Soul, is yet called
by that part of himself, that is most chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.
<note n="l" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 1.</note>

several other places, the whole Man is meant, and is

he saith, <note n="o" place="bottom">Ps. 35. 17.</note>

universally, but only to those in whose Eyes their
<hi>Souls,</hi> and the redemption thereof is precious. My
<hi>Darling,</hi> most Men do by their actions say of their
<hi>Soul,</hi> my drudge, my slave; nay, thou slave to the
Devil and Sin: for what sin, what lust, what sensual
and beastly lust is there in the World, that some do
not cause their <hi>Souls</hi> to bow before and yield unto?
But <hi>David</hi> here, as you see, calls it his <hi>Darling,</hi> or
his choice and most excellent thing; for indeed the
<hi>Soul</hi> is a choice thing in it self, and should, were all
wise, be every Man's darling or chief treasure. And
that it might be so with us, therefore our Lord Jesus
hath thus expressed the worth of the <hi>Soul,</hi> saying,

4. There is as also the <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Imagination,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of this great thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Soul;</hi> and a most
curious thing this <hi>Fancy is:</hi> It is that which presenteth
to the Man the <hi>idea, form</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> of that, or any of
those things wherewith a Man is frighted or taken,
pleased or displeased. And,</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>mind</hi> (another part of the Soul) is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which this <hi>Fancy</hi> presenteth its things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, because, without the <hi>mind</hi> nothing is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There is the <hi>memory</hi> too, another part of the
<hi>Soul;</hi> and that may be called the <hi>Register</hi> of the
<hi>Soul:</hi> for it is the <hi>memory</hi> that receiveth and keepeth
in remembrance what has passed, or has been done by
the Man, or attempted to be done unto him: And
in this part of the <hi>Soul,</hi> or from it will be fed the
Worm that dyeth not when Men are cast into Hell;
also from this Memory will flow that peace at the day
of Judgment, that <hi>Saints</hi> shall have in their service for
Christ in the World.</p>
            <p>7. There are the <hi>Affections too,</hi> which are as I may
call them, the Hands and Arms of the <hi>Soul;</hi> for they
are they that take hold of, receive and embrace what
is liked by the <hi>Soul:</hi> And it is a hard thing to make
the Soul of a Man cast from it what its <hi>affections</hi> cleave
to and have imbraced. Hence the <hi>Affections</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for, when the Apostle bids Men <note n="q" place="bottom">Col. 3.</note> 
               <hi>seek the things
above; set your Affections upon them,</hi> saith he: or as
you have it in another place, <hi>Lay hold of them;</hi> for the
Affections are as hands to the Soul, and they by which
it fasrneth upon things.</p>
            <p>8. There is the <hi>Will,</hi> which may be called the <hi>Foot</hi>
of the Soul, because by that the Soul, yea, the whole
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43327:9"/>
Man is carried, hither and thither, or else held back,
and kept from moving.</p>
            <p>These are the golden Things of the Soul; though
in carnal Men they are every one of them made use
of in the Service of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi> For the <hi>Vnbelieving</hi>
are throughout impure, as is manifest, because their
<note n="r" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> (two of the Master-pieces of
the Soul) are defiled: for if the most potent Parts of
the Soul are ingaged in <hi>their</hi> service, what think you,
do the more inferior do? But I say, so it is, the more
is the pity: nor can any help it, <hi>This work ceaseth
for ever,</hi> unless the great God who is over all, and
that can Souls, shall himself take upon him to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to recover it, and perswade it to
fall in love with another Master.</p>
            <p>But I say, What is Man, without this Soul, or
<note n="s" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 19. 20, 21.</note> wherein lieth his preeminence over a Beast?
no where that I know of. For both (as to Man's Body)
go to one place, only the Spirit or Soul of a Man
goes upward, to wit, to God that gave it, to be by
him disposed of with respect to things to come, as
they have been and have done in this life. But,</p>
            <p>2. I come in the next place <note n="t" place="bottom">Of the Senses of the Soul.</note> to describe the Soul
by its <hi>Senses,</hi> its <hi>spiritual Senses,</hi> for so I call them:
for as the Body hath Senses partaining to it, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
it can see, hear, smell, feel and taste, so can the Soul;
I call therefore these the Senses of the Soul, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Senses of the Body, and because the
Soul is the Seat of all spiritual Sense, where super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
things are known and enjoyed; not that the
Soul of a natural Man is spiritual in the Apostles
sense, for so none are, but those that are born from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43327:10"/>
above, nor <note n="u" place="bottom">Cor. 3. 1, 2. 3.</note> they so always neither. But to go
forward.</p>
            <p>1. Can the Body <hi>see?</hi> Hath it eyes? so hath the
Soul. <hi>The Eyes of the Vnderstanding</hi> 
               <note n="w" place="bottom">Eph. 1. 18. Of Sight.</note> 
               <hi>being enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
As then the Body can see Beasts, Trees, Men,
and all visible things, so the Soul can see God, Christ,
Angels, Heaven, Devils, Hell, and other things
that are invisible, nor is this property only peculiar
to the Souls that are illuminated by the Holy Ghost;
for the most carnal Soul in the World shall have a
time to see these things, but not to its comfort; but
not to its joy, but to its endless woe and misery, it
dying in that condition. <hi>Wherefore Sinner,</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="bottom">Job. 35. 14.</note> 
               <hi>say
not thou, I shall not see him, for Judgment is before
him, and he will make thee see him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Can the Body <hi>bear,</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="bottom">Of hearing.</note> hath it <hi>ears?</hi> so hath
the Soul (See <hi>Job</hi> 4. 12, 13.) It is the Soul, not the
Body, that hears the Language of things invisible.
'Tis the Soul that hears <hi>God</hi> when he speaks in and
by his Word and Spirit, and 'tis the Soul that hears
the <hi>Devil</hi> when he speaks by his illusions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
True, there is such an Union between the
Soul and the Body, that oft-times if not always, that
which is heard by the <hi>Ears</hi> of the Body, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
the Soul, and that which is heard by the Soul,
doth also influence the Body; but yet as to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
of Hearing, the Body hath one of his <hi>own</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from that of the Soul, and the Soul can hear
and regard even then when the Body doth not, nor
cannot. As in time of sleep, deep sleep and trances,
when the Body lyeth by as a thing that is useless. <hi>For
God peaks once,</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="bottom">Job. 33. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>yea twice, yet Man</hi> (as to his Body)
<hi>perceiveth it not. In a Dream, in a Vision of the Night,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43327:10"/>
when deep sleep falleth upon Men, in slumbrings upon
the Bed. Then openeth he the Ears of Men and sealeth
their instruction,</hi> &amp;c. this must be meant of the Ears
of the Soul, not of the Body; for that at this time,
is said to be in deep sleep; moreover, this hearing,
it is a Hearing of Dreams and the Visions of the
Night. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 26.</note> also tells us, <hi>That he had the
rare and blessed Visions of God in his sleep;</hi> and so doth
<hi>Daniel</hi> too, by the which they were <hi>greatly comforted
and refreshed:</hi> but that could not be, was not the
Soul also capable of hearing? <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. 10, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>I heard the Voice of his
words</hi> (said <hi>Daniel) and when I heard the Voice of his
words, I was in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward
the Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As the Soul can <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> so it can <note n="b" place="bottom">Of tasting.</note> 
               <hi>taste</hi>
and <hi>relish,</hi> even as really as doth the Palate belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Body. But then the thing so tasted must
be that which is suited to the Temper and Palate of
the Soul. The Souls taste lyeth not in, nor is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
about meats, the Meats that are for the Body.
Yet the Soul of a Saint can taste <note n="c" place="bottom">Heb. 6. 5. Ps. 19. 10. 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. Heb. 5. 12, 13, 14.</note> and relish God's
word, and doth oft-times find it <hi>sweeter</hi> than Honey,
<hi>nourishing</hi> as Milk, and <hi>strengthning</hi> like to strong
Meat. The Soul also of Sinners and of those that
are unsanctified, can taste and relish, though not the
Things now mentioned, yet things that agree with
their fleshly minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with their polluted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and vile affections. They can relish and taste
that which delighteth them; yea they can find Soul-delight
in an Ale-house, a Whore-house, a Play-house.
Ay, they find pleasure in the vilest things,
in the things most offensive to God, and that are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43327:11"/>
most destructive to themselves: This is evident to
sense, and is proved by the daily practice of Sinners.
Nor is the Word barren as to this; <hi>They feed on ashes,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Isa. 44. 20 c. 55. 2. Hos. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>they spend their Money for that which is not Bread,</hi>
yea, they eat and suck <hi>sweetness</hi> out of sin, <hi>They eat up
the Sin of my People as they eat Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. As the Soul can <hi>see, hear</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="bottom">Of Smelling.</note> and <hi>taste,</hi> so it can
<hi>smell,</hi> and bring refreshment to it self that way.
Hence the Church saith, <note n="f" place="bottom">Cant. 5. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Her Fingers dropped
with sweet smelling Myrrh:</hi> and again, she saith of
her beloved, <hi>That his Lips dropped sweet smelling Myrrh.</hi>
But how came the Church to understand this, but
because her Soul did smell that in it, that was to be
smelled in it, even in his word and gracious visits.
The poor World indeed cannot smell, or savour any
thing of the good and fragrant scent and sweet that
is in Christ: but to them that believe, <hi>His name</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="bottom">Cant. 1. 3.</note>
               <hi>is as an oyntment poured fourth, and therefore the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. As the Soul can see, taste, hear, and smell, <note n="h" place="bottom">Of feeling. Eph. 4. 18, 19. 1 Tim. 4. 2.</note>
so it hath the sense of <hi>feeling,</hi> as quick and as sensible
as the Body: He knows nothing that knows not
this; he whose Soul is past feeling, has his Conscience
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eared with an hot Iron. Nothing so sensible as the
Soul, nor <hi>feeleth</hi> so quickly the Love and Mercy,
or the Anger and Wrath of God. Ask the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, or the Man that is under the Convictions
of the Law, <hi>If he doth not feel?</hi> and he will quickly
tell you, That he faints and dyes away by reason of
God's hand and his wrath that lyeth upon him: read
the first eight Verses of the 38<hi>th. Psal.</hi> (if thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
nothing of what I have told thee by experience)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43327:11"/>
and there thou shalt hear the Complaints of one
whose Soul lay at present under the Burthen of guilt,
and that cryed out that without help from Heaven,
he could by no means bear the same. They also that
know what the Peace of God means, and what an
eternal weight there is in Glory, know well that the
Soul has <hi>the sense of feeling,</hi> as well as the sense of
seeing, hearing, tasting and smelling: but thus much
for the senses of the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I come in the next place to describe the
Soul, <hi>by the Passions of the Soul.</hi> The Passions of the
Soul, I reckon, are these and such like: to Wit,
Love, Hatred, Joy, Fear, Grief, Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Of the Passions of the Soul.</note> And
these Passions of the Soul are not therefore good,
nor therefore evil, because they are the Passions of
the Soul: but are made so by two things, to wit,
Principle and Object. The Principle I count that
from whence they flow, and the Object that upon
which they are pitched. To explain my self,</p>
            <p>1. For that of <hi>Love,</hi> This is a strong Passion, the
Holy Ghost saith, <note n="i" place="bottom">Of Love, Cant. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>'Tis strong as Death, and cruel as
the Grave.</hi> And it is then good, when it flows from
Faith, and pitches it self upon God in Christ as
the Object; and when it extendeth it self to all
that is good, whether it be the good Word, the
good Work of grace, or the good Men that have
it, and also to their good lives. But all <hi>Soul-love</hi>
floweth not from this principle, neither hath
<hi>these</hi> for its object. How many are there that <hi>make</hi>
the Object of their <hi>Love,</hi> the most vile of Men, the
most base of things, because it flows from vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and from the Lusts of the Flesh? God and
Christ, good Laws, and good Men, and their holy
lives, they cannot abide, because their love wanteth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43327:12"/>
a Principle that should sanctifie it in its first motion
and that should steer it to a goodly Object, but that
is the first.</p>
            <p>2. There is <note n="k" place="bottom">Of Hatred.</note> 
               <hi>Hatred,</hi> which I count another
<hi>Passion</hi> of the Soul: And this, as the other, is good
or evil, as the Principle from whence it flows, and the
Object of it are. <hi>Ye that</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="bottom">Ps. 97. 10.</note>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Root and Principle from whence their hatred flows

               </gap>
there it must of necessity swerve in the letting out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
this <hi>passion,</hi> because the Soul where grace is wanting
is not at liberty to act simply, but is byassed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

in the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43327:12"/>
And hence it is, that this Passion (which when
acted well, is a Vertue) is so abused and made to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
its force against that for which God never ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, nor gave it license to act.</p>
            <p>3. Another Passion of the Soul is <note n="n" place="bottom">Of Joy.</note> 
               <hi>joy,</hi> and when
the Soul rejoyceth not in iniquity, <hi>but rejoyceth in the</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Truth.</hi> This Joy is a very strong Passion, and will
carry a Man through a world of difficulties: 'tis a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that beareth up, that supporteth and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Man, let the Object of his joy be what it will.
'Tis this that maketh the Soul <hi>fat</hi> in goodness, if it
have its object accordingly, and that which makes
the Soul bold in wickedness, if it indeed doth rejoyce
in iniquity.</p>
            <p>4. Another passion of the Soul is <note n="p" place="bottom">Of Fear.</note> 
               <hi>Fear,</hi> natural
<hi>fear</hi> (for so you must understand me of all the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul, as they are considered simply, and
in their own nature.) And as it is with the other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
so it is with this, it is made good or evil in its
acts, as its principle and objects are; when this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Soul is good, then it springs from sense
of the greatness and goodness, and Majesty of God;
also God himself is the object of this fear; <hi>I will</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 18. Luk. 12. 5.</note>
               <hi>forewarn you</hi> (says Christ) <hi>whom ye shall fear, Fear
him that can destroy both Body and Soul in Hell, yea, I
say unto you, fear him:</hi> But in all Men this passion is
not regulated and governed by these Principles and
Objects; but is abused and turned through the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Satan, quite into another channel. It is <note n="r" place="bottom">Numb. 41. 9. 2 Kings 17. 38. 7.</note>
made to fear Men, to fear Idols, to fear Devils and
Witches, yea it is made to fear all the foolish, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
and apish Fables, that every old Woman or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43327:13"/>
Atheistical Fortune-teller, has the Face to drop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Soul. But fear is another passion of the
Soul.</p>
            <p>5. Another passion of the Soul is <hi>Grief,</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="bottom">Of Grief.</note> and it as
those aforenamed, acteth even according as it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.
When holiness, is lovely and beautiful to
the Soul, and when the Name of Christ is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than life, then will the Soul sit down and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
because Men keep not God's Law. <hi>I beheld</hi>
               <note n="t" place="bottom">Psal. 119. 158.</note> 
               <hi>the Transgressors and was grieved, because they kepe
not thy word:</hi> So Christ, he looked round about with
anger, <hi>Being grieved for the</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>hardness of their hearts.</hi>
But it is rarely seen that this <hi>passion</hi> of the Soul is
thus exercised. Almost every body has other thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for the spending of the heat of this passion upon:
Men are <hi>grieved</hi> that they thrive no more in the
World; <hi>grieved</hi> that they have no more carnal, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
and worldly honour; <hi>grieved</hi> that they are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
no more to range in the Lusts and Vanities of
this life: but all this is because the Soul is unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with God, sees no beauty in holiness, but is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
and, wrapt up in clouds and thick darkness.</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, There is <note n="w" place="bottom">Of Anger.</note> 
               <hi>Anger;</hi> which is another
passion of the Soul: And that as the rest, is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Should we see a Man familiar with the King, we
would even of our selves conclude he is one of the
Nobles of the Land; but this is not the Lot of every
Soul (some have fellowship with Devils, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a more base Original than those that

            </p>
            <p>4. <note n="w" place="bottom">The Soul, a Vessel for Grace.</note> The Souls of Men are such as God count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
worthy to be the <hi>Vessels to hold his Grace,</hi> the Graces
of the Spirit in. The Graces of the Spirit; what like
them, or where here are they to be found, save in
the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men only? of <note n="x" place="bottom">Ps. 51. 6. Ps. 45. 13.</note> his fulness have all we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43327:18"/>
received, and grace for grace; received, into what?
Into the <hi>hidden Parts,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> calls it. Hence the
King's Daughter is said to be <hi>all glorious within,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
adorned and beautified with the Graces of the
<hi>Spirit.</hi> For that which <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>the hidden part,</hi> is
the inmost part of the <hi>Soul;</hi> and it is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>hidden Part,</hi> because the <hi>Soul</hi> is invisible, nor
can any one living infallibly know what is in the <hi>Soul</hi>
but God himself. But I say, the <hi>Soul</hi> is the Vessel
into which this golden Oyl is poured, and that which
holds, and is accounted worthy to exercise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the same. Therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> is it which is
said to love God. <note n="y" place="bottom">Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Isa. 26. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Saw ye him whom my Soul loveth?</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> is that which exerciseth the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer, <hi>With my Soul have I desired thee in
the night, and with my Spirit within me will I seek thee
early.</hi> With the <hi>Soul</hi> also Men are said to believe,
and into the <hi>Soul</hi> God is said to put his Fear. This is
the Vessel into which the wise Virgins got Oyl, and
out of which their Lamps were supplied by the same.
But what a thing, what a great thing therefore is the
Soul, that, that above all things that God hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
should be the chosen Vessel to put his Grace in.
The Body is the Vessel for the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> is
the Vessel for the Grace of God. But,</p>
            <p>5. <note n="z" place="bottom">The Price of the Soul.</note> The Greatness of the <hi>Soul</hi> is manifest by the
<hi>Greatness of the Price</hi> that Christ paid for it to make
it an Heir of Glory; and <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 20. 1. Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> that was his procious
Blood. We do use to esteem of things according to
the Price that is given for them, especially when we
are convinced that the purchase has not been made
by the Estimation of a Fool. Now the Soul is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by a Price that the Son, the wisdom of God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43327:19"/>
thought fit to pay for the redemption thereof, what
a thing then is the Soul? Judge of the Soul by the
Price that is paid for it, and you must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
(unless you count the Blood that hath bought it,
an unholy thing) that it cannot but be of great worth
and value. Suppose a Prince, or some great Man,
should on a sudden descend from his Throne or Chair
of State to take up, that he might put in his bosome,
some thing that he had espyed, lying trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Feet of those that stand by; would you think
that he would do this for an old Horse-shooe, or for
so trivial a thing as a Pin or a Point? nay, would
you not even of your selves conclude, that, that thing
for which the Prince, so great a Man, should make
such a stoop, must needs be a thing of very great
worth? Why, this is the case of Christ and the
Soul: Christ is the Prince, his Throne was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and as he sat there, he espied the Souls of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
trampled under the Foot of the Law and Death,
for <hi>sin:</hi> now what doth he, but comes down from
his Throne, stoops down to the Earth, <note n="b" place="bottom">1. Cor. 8. 9.</note> and there
since he could not have the trodden-down Souls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
price, he lays down his Life and Blood for them.
But would he have done this for inconsiderable things?
no nor for the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Sinners</hi> neither, had he not
valued them higher than he valued Heaven and
Earth besides. This therefore is another thing by
which the Greatness of Soul is known.</p>
            <p>6. <note n="c" place="bottom">The Soul immortal. Luk. 12. 4. Mat. 10. 28.</note> The Soul is <hi>immortal,</hi> it will have a sensible

all his wrath and the vengeance that he will

Beings, yet to indure, yet to bear punishment.
If any thing could kill the <hi>Soul,</hi> it would be death,
but death cannot do it, neither first nor second, The
first cannot, for when <hi>Dives</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 16. 22, 23.</note> was slain as to his

second death cannot do it, because it is said, their
Worm never dies, but is always torturing them with
his gnawing; but that could not be, if time or lying

this also shews the <hi>Greatness of the Soul,</hi> that it is that
which has an endless life, and that will therefore
have a Being <hi>endlesly.</hi> O what a thing is the
<hi>Soul!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Soul</hi> then is <hi>immortal, though not eternal.</hi> That
is eternal that has neither beginning nor end; and
therefore eternal is properly applicable to none but
God; hence he is called <note n="f" place="bottom">Deut. 33. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the eternal God.</hi> Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
is that, which though it hath a Beginning, yet
hath no end, it cannot dye, nor cease to be; and this
is the state of the <hi>Soul.</hi> It cannot cease to have a
Being, when it is once created, I mean a living sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Being. For I mean by <hi>living,</hi> only such a Being
as distinguishes it from annihilation or uncapableness
of sense and feeling. Hence as the rich Man is after
death, said to <note n="g" place="bottom">Luke 16. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>lift up his Eyes in Hell;</hi> so the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is said, when he dyed, <hi>to be carried by the Angels
into Abraham's bosome.</hi> And both these sayings, must
have respect to the <hi>Souls</hi> of these Men; for as for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43327:20"/>
their Bodies, we know at present 'tis otherwise with
them. The Grave is their House, and so must be
till the Trumpet shall sound, and the Heavens pass
away like a <hi>Scroul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (I say) the Immortality of the <hi>Soul,</hi> shews
the Greatness of it, as the eternity of God, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
the greatness of God. It cannot be said of any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
but that he is immortal, and so it is, and ought
to be said of the <hi>Soul.</hi> This therefore shews the
Greatness of the <hi>Soul,</hi> in that it is as to abiding, so like
unto him.</p>
            <p>7. <note n="h" place="bottom">'Tis the Soul that acts the Body.</note> But a word or two more, and so to conclude
this Head. The <hi>Soul!</hi> why, it is the <hi>Soul</hi> that acteth
the Body in all those things (good or bad) that seem
good and reasonable, or amazingly wicked. True,
the Acts and Motions of the <hi>Soul,</hi> are only seen and
heard in and by the Members and Motions of the
Body, but the Body is but a poor Instrument, the
<hi>Soul</hi> is the great Agitator and Actor. <note n="i" place="bottom">Jam. 2 26.</note> 
               <hi>The Body
without the Spirit is dead.</hi> All those famous Arts and
Works, and Inventions of Works that are done by
Men, under Heaven, they are all the Inventions of
the <hi>Soul,</hi> and the Body as acting and labouring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
doth it but as a <hi>Tool</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="bottom">Eccl. 7. 9.</note> that the <hi>Soul</hi> maketh use
of, to bring his Invention unto maturity. How many
things have Men found out to the amzing of one
another, to the wonderment of one another, to the
begetting of endless Commendations of one another
in the World, while in the mean time the <hi>Soul,</hi> which
indeed is the true Inventor of all is over-look'd, not
regarded, but dragged up and down by every lust,
and prostrate, and made a slave to every silly and
beastly thing? O the <note n="l" place="bottom">Isa. 44. 20.</note> amazing darkness that hath
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43327:20"/>
covered the Face of the Hearts of the Children of Men,
that they cannot deliver their <hi>Soul,</hi> nor say, is there
not a lye in my Right-hand? though they are so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in all other matters. Take Man in Matters that
are abroad, and far from home, and he is the mirror
of all the Word: but take him at home, and put him
upon things that are near him, I mean that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the things that concern his <hi>Soul,</hi> and then
you will find him the greatest Fool that ever God
made. But this must not be applyed to the <hi>Soul</hi>
simply, as it is God's Creature, but to the <hi>Soul</hi> sinful, as
it has willingly apostatized from God, and so suffered
it self to be darkned, and that with such thick and
stupefying darkness, that it is bound up and cannot,
it hath a Napkin of <hi>sin</hi> bound so close before its
Eyes, that it is not able (of it self) to look to, and
after those things which should be its chiefest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
and without which it will be most miserable for
ever.</p>
            <p>8. Further, <note n="m" place="bottom">The Soul capable of having to do with invisibles.</note> as the <hi>Soul</hi> is thus curious about
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and about every excellent thing of
this Life. <hi>So</hi> it is capable of having to do with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibles;
with Angels good or bad; yea, with the
highest and supream Being, even with the holy God
of Heaven. I told you before, that God sought the
<hi>Soul</hi> of Man to have it for his Companion, and now I
tell you, that the <hi>Soul</hi> is capable of communion with
him (when the darkness that sin hath spread over its
face is removed.) The <hi>Soul</hi> is an intelligent Power, it
can be made to know, and understand depths, and
heights, and lengths, and breadths, in those high,
sublime and spiritual mysteries, that only God can
reveal and teach; yea, it is capable of diving unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably
into them. And herein is God the God of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43327:21"/>
glory much delighted and pleased, to wit, That he
hath made himself a Creature that is capable of
hearing, of knowing, and of understanding of his
mind, when opened and revealed to it. I think I
may say without offence to God or Man, That one
reason why God made the World, was that he might
manifest himself not only by, but to the works which
he made; but (I speak with reverence) how could
that be, if he did not also make some of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
capable of apprehending of him in those most
high Mysteries and Methods, in which he purposed
to reveal himself? but then, what are those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which he hath made (unto whom when these
things are shewn) that are able to take them in, and
understand them, and so to improve them to God's
glory as he hath ordained and purposed they should,
but Souls? for none else in the visible World are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of doing this but they. And hence it is, that
to them, and them only, he beginneth to reveal
himself in this World. And hence it is that they, and
they only are gathered up to <note n="n" place="bottom">Heb. 12. 23.</note> him, where he is
(for they are they that are called the spirits of just
Men made perfect) the Spirit of a Beast goeth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<note n="o" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 21. c. 12. 7.</note> to the Earth, it is the Spirit of a Man that
goes upward to God that gave it; for that, and that
only is capable of beholding and understanding the
glorious Visions of Heaven, as Christ said, <note n="p" place="bottom">John 17. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Father
I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me
where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast
given me; for thou lovedst me before the Foundation of
the World.</hi> And thus the greatness of the Soul is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
True, the <hi>Body</hi> is also gathered up into glory,
but not simply for its own sake, or because that is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43327:21"/>
capable of it self to know and understand the glories
of its Maker; but that has been a Companion with
the Soul in this World, has also been its House, its
Mantle, its Cabinet and Tabernacle here: It has also
been it, by which the Soul hath acted, in which it
hath wrought, and by which its excellent appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have been manifested. And it shall also there be
its copartner and sharer in its glory. Wherefore as
the Body here did partake of <hi>Soul</hi> Excellencies, and
was also conformed to its spiritual and regenerate
Principles; so it shall be hereafter a partaker of that
Glory with which the <hi>Soul</hi> shall be filled; and also
be made suitable by that glory, to become a partaker
and copartner with it of the eternal Excellencies
which Heaven will put upon it. In this World it is
a gracious <hi>Soul</hi> (I speak now of the Regenerate) and
in that World, it shall be a glorious one. In this
World the Body was conformable to the <hi>Soul</hi> as it was
gracious and in that World it shall be conformable to
itt, as its glorious: conformable, I say, by partaking of
that Glory, that then the <hi>Soul</hi> shall partake of; yea, it
shall also have an additional glory to adorn, and make
it yet the more capable of being serviceable to it, and
with it in its great acts before God in eternal glory.</p>
            <p>O, What great things are the Souls of the Sons
of Men!</p>
            <p>9. But again, as the Soul is thus capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="q" place="bottom">The Soul capable of diving into the Depths and Mysteries of Hell.</note> God in Glory, and of prying into these Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are in him: so it is capable with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sundity
to dive into the mysterious depths of Hell.
Hell is a place, and state utterly unknown to any in
this visible World, excepting the Souls of Men; nor
shall any for ever be capable of understanding the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43327:22"/>
Miseries thereof, save Souls and fallen Angels. Now
I think as the Joys of Heaven stand not only in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
or in beholding of Glory, but in a sensible
Enjoyment and unspeakable Pleasure, which these
<note n="r" place="bottom">Psal. 16. 11.</note> Glories will yield to the <hi>Soul:</hi> So the Torments
of Hell will not stand in the present lashes and
stroaks which by the Flames of eternal Fire God will
scourge the Ungodly with; but the Torments of
Hell stand much, if not in the greatest part of them,
in those deep thoughts and apprehensions, which Souls
in the next World will have of the Nature and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of <hi>Sin;</hi> of God, and of separation from him;
of the Eternity of those Miseries, and of the utter
Impossibility of their help, ease, or deliverance for
ever. O, damned Souls will have thoughts that
will clash with Glory, clash with Justice, clash with
Law, clash with it self, clash with Hell, and with
the everlastingness of Misery; but the Point, the
Edge, and the Poison of all these thoughts will still
be gauling, and dropping, and spuing out their stings
<hi>into the Sore,</hi> grieved, wounded, and fretted place,
which is the Conscience, though not the Conscience
only. For I may say of the Souls in <hi>Hell,</hi> that they
all over are but one wound, one sore. <hi>Miseries</hi> as
well as <hi>mercies,</hi> sharpen and make quick the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Behold <hi>Spira</hi> in his Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cain</hi>
in his Guilt, and <hi>Saul</hi> with the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and

in their fancies, <note n="s" place="bottom">Isa. 33. 14. Psal. 50. 3. Rev. 14. 10, Mark 9. 44, 46.</note> imaginations and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
though not about God, and Heaven and Glory;
yet about their Loss, their Misery, and their Woe,
and their Hells.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43327:22"/>
10. Nor doth their ability <note n="t" place="bottom">The Ability of the Soul to bear.</note> to bear (if it be
proper to say they bear, those dolors which there for
ever, they shall endure) a little demonstrate their
greatness. Everlasting burning, devouring fire, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
pains, gnawing worms, utter darkness and
the ireful words, face and strokes of divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Justice, will not, cannot, make this <hi>Soul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
as I said before: I think it is not so proper to
say, the <hi>Soul</hi> that is damned for <hi>Sin</hi> doth bear these
things, as to say it doth <hi>ever sink</hi> under them; and
therefore their place of torment is called <hi>the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Pit,</hi> because they are ever sinking, and shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come there where they will find any stay. Yet
they live under wrath, but yet only so as to be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it, as to smart and be in perpetual anguish by
reason of the intollerableness of their burthen. But
doth not their thus living, abiding, and retaining a
Being (or what you will call it) demonstrate the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and might of the <hi>Soul?</hi> Alas! Heaven and
Earth are short of this greatness, for these though
under less judgment by far, do fade and wax old <note n="u" place="bottom">Heb. 1.</note>
like a Moth-eaten Garment, and in their time will
vanish away to nothing.</p>
            <p>Also we see how quickly the <hi>Body,</hi> when the <hi>Soul</hi> is
under a fear of the rebukes of Justice; How soon I say,
it wastes, molders away, and crimbleth into the Grave;
but the <hi>Soul</hi> is yet strong and abides sensible to be
dealt withal for <hi>Sin,</hi> by everlasting burnings.</p>
            <p>11. The <hi>Soul</hi> by God's Ordinance <note n="w" place="bottom">Heb. 9. 27. The might of the Soul further shewn.</note> while this
world lasts, has a time appointed it to forsake and
leave the Body to be turned again to the Dust as it
was, and this separation is made by death: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43327:23"/>
the Body must cease for a time to have sense
or life, or motion; and a little thing brings it now
into this state: But in the next World the wicked
shall partake of none of this; for the <hi>Body</hi> and the
<hi>Soul</hi> being at the Resurrection rejoyned, this death
that once did rend them asunder, is for ever overcome
and extinct; so that these two which lived in <hi>Sin</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>must for ever be yoked together in Hell. Now there
the <hi>Soul</hi> being joyned to the <hi>Body,</hi> and death which
before did separate them, being utterly taken away;
the <hi>Soul</hi> retains not only its own being, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
the <hi>Body</hi> to be, and to suffer sensibly the Pains
of Hell without those decays that it uses to sustain.</p>
            <p>And the Reason why this death shall then be taken
away, is, because Justice in <note n="x" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 28.</note> its bestowing its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for transgressions, may not be interrupted: but
that Body and Soul as they lived <note n="y" place="bottom">Luk. 12. 5.</note> and acted in sin
together, might be destroyed for sin in Hell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Destroyed, I say, but with such a <note n="z" place="bottom">2 Thes. 1. 8, 9.</note> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
which though it is everlasting, will not
put a Period to their sensible suffering, the vengeance
of eternal Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> death therefore, though that also be the
Wages of <hi>Sin,</hi> would now, were it suffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
be an hindrance to the making known of the

would be so far undiscovered. 2. It would also hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

A single Man, a free Man, a rich Man, a poor Man,

speak after the manner of Men; but he that has lost
himself is not at his own dispose. He is as I may

his <hi>Soul self,</hi> his <hi>own self,</hi> his <hi>whole self by Sin,</hi> and
Wrath, and Hell hath found him: he is therefore
now no more at his own dispose, but at the dispose of
Justice, of Wrath and Hell. He is committed to

            <p>And herein will <hi>that</hi> state of the Damned be worse

               <note n="h" place="bottom">Job. 1. 7. ch. 2. 2.</note> they are not so bound

to tempt, to plot, to contrive and invent

though Satan knows that this at last will work for his

<hi>diversion</hi> to his trembling mind, and obtains through

himself withal; yea, and doth procure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
some small crumbs of minutes of forgetfulness of
his own present misery, and of the Judgment that is
yet to pass upon him; but this priviledge will then
be denied to him that has lost himself, there will be

do, is to sit down by the Loss; Do I say he can do
this? Oh! if that could be, it would be to such a
Mercy; I must therefore here correct my self, <note n="k" place="bottom">They cannot sit down by the Loss.</note>
               <hi>that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y cannot do,</hi> for to sit down by the Loss, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
a Patient enduring, but there will be no such
grace as patience in Hell with him that has lost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
here will also want a <hi>bottom</hi> for patience, to
wit, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God for a <hi>Providence</hi> of God,
though never so dismal, is a <hi>bottom</hi> for patience to
the afflicted: but Men go not to Hell by <hi>Providence,</hi>
but by <hi>Sin.</hi> Now <hi>Sin</hi> being the Cause other effects
are wrought; for they that go to Hell, and that there
miserably perish, shall never say it was God by his
providence that brought me hither, and so shall not
have that on which to lean and stay themselves.</p>
            <p>They shall justifie God, and lay the sault upon
themselves, concluding that it was sin with which
their <hi>Souls</hi> did voluntarily work; yea, which their
Souls did such in as sweet Milk, that is the
Cause of this their torment. Now this will work
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter another manner and will produce quite another
thing than patience, or a Patient enduring of their
torment; for their seeing that they are not only lost,
but have lost themselves, and that against the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means that of God was provided to prevent
that loss; yea, when they shall see what a base thing
<hi>Sin</hi> is, how that it is the very worst of things, and
that which also makes all things had; and that for
the sake of that they have lost themselves; this will
make them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ret, and gnash and gnaw with anger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
this will set all the Passions of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul</hi> save
love (for that I think will be stark dead) all in a Rage,
all in a self-tormenting Fire. You know there is
nothing that will sooner put a Man into, and manage
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43327:27"/>
his rage against himself, than will a full Conviction in
his Conscience, that by his own only folly, and that
against caution, and councel and reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th brought himself into extream distress
and misery. But how much more will it make this
fire burn, when he shall see all this is come upon
him for a Toy for a Bauble, for a thing that is worse
than nothing.</p>
            <p>Why this is the case with him that has lost himself
and therefore he cannot sit down by the Loss, cannot
be at quiet under the Sense of his Loss. For sharply
and wonderful piercingly, considering the Loss of
himself, and the Cause thereof which is <hi>Sin,</hi> he salls
to a tearing of himself in pieces with thoughts as hot
as the Coals of Juniper, and to a gnashing upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for this; also the divine Wisdom and Justice of
God helpeth on this self-tormenter in his self-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
work, by holding the Justice of the Law
against which he has offended, and the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such offence continually before his Face. For
if to an inlightned Man who is in the door of hope,
the sight of all past evil Practices will work in him
vexation of Spirit to see what fools we were, <note n="l" place="bottom">Eccl. 1. 14.</note> how
can it but be to them that go to Hell a vexation, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to understand the Report, the Report that God
did give them of Sin, of his Grace, of Hell, and of
everlasting Damnation; <note n="m" place="bottom">Isa. 28. 19.</note> and yet that they should
be such fools to go thither. But to pursue this head
no further I will come now to the next thing.</p>
            <p>2. As the Loss of the Soul <note n="n" place="bottom">The Loss of the Soul a double Loss.</note> is in the <hi>Nature</hi> of
the Loss, a Loss peculiar to it self. So the Loss of
the Soul is a <hi>double Loss;</hi> it is, I say, a Loss <hi>that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
double,</hi> lost both by Man and God; Man has lost it,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43327:28"/>
and by that Loss has lost himself, God has lost it, and
by that Loss it is cast away. And to make this a
little plainer unto you, I suppose it will be readily
granted that Men do lose their Souls, but now how
doth God lose it? The Soul is God's as well as Mans;
<note n="o" place="bottom">Jer. 38. 16. Ezek. 18. 4.</note> Mans because it is of themselves, God's because
it is his Creature; God has made us this Soul, and
hence it is that <hi>all Souls are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Loss of the Soul doth not only stand in
the Sin of Man, but in the Justice of God; hence
he says, <hi>What is a Man advantaged, if he gains the
whole World, and lose himself,</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="bottom">Luk. 9. 25.</note> 
               <hi>or be cast away.</hi> Now
this last clause [<hi>or be cast away</hi>] is not spoken to shew
what he that has lost his Soul has done (though a Man
may also be said to cast away himself) but to shew
what God will do to those that have lost themselves:
what God will <hi>add</hi> to that Loss. God will not cast
away a righteous Man, but God will cast away the
<note n="q" place="bottom">Job 8. 20. Mat. 13. 48.</note> wicked, such a wicked one as by the Text is under
our consideration. This then is that which God will
<hi>add,</hi> and so make the sad state of them that lose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
double. The Man for Sin has lost himself, and
God by Justice will cast him away: according to that
<note n="r" place="bottom">1. Sam. 25. 29.</note> of <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David, The Soul of my Lord,</hi> said she,
<hi>shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy
God, and the Souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling
out, as out of the midst of a Sling.</hi> So that here is
God's hand as well as Man's; <hi>Man</hi>'s by <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>God</hi>'s
by <hi>Justice. God shall cast them away;</hi> wherefore in
the Text above-mentioned, he doth not say, or <hi>cast
away himself,</hi> as meaning the act of the Man whose
Soul is lost, but, or <hi>be cast away,</hi> supposing a second
Person joyning with the Man himself in the making
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43327:28"/>
up of the greatness of the Loss of Soul: to wit,
God himself, who will verily cast away that Man
who has lost himself. God shall cast them away;
that is, exclude them his favour or protection, and
deliver them up to the due reward of their deed!
he shall shut them out of <hi>his</hi> Heaven, and deliver
them up to <hi>their</hi> Hell; he shall deny them a share in
his Glory, and shall leave them to <hi>their</hi> own shame;
he shall deny them a Portion in <hi>his</hi> Peace, and shall
deliver them up to the Torments of the Devil and
of <hi>their</hi> own guilty Consciences; he shall cast them
out of <hi>his</hi> affection, pity and compassion, and shall
leave them to the Flames that they by Sin have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and to the Worm or biting Cockatrice that <hi>they</hi>
themselves have hatched, nursed and nourished in
their bosoms. And this will make their loss double,
and so a Loss that is <hi>loss</hi> to the uttermost: a Loss
above every Loss. A Man may cast away himself, and
not be cast away of God; a Man may be cast away by
others, and not be cast away of God; yea, what way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a Man be cast away, if he be not cast away for Sin,
he is safe, he is yet sound, and in a sure hand: But
for a Man, so to lose himself as by that loss to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<hi>God</hi> to cast him away too, This is fearful.</p>
            <p>The casting away then, mentioned in <hi>Luke,</hi> is a
casting away by the Hand of <hi>God,</hi> by the revenging
Hand of <hi>God,</hi> and it supposeth two things.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>God</hi>'s abhorrence of such a Soul.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>God</hi>'s just repaying of it for its wickedness by
way of retaliation.</p>
            <p>1. It supposeth <hi>God</hi>'s abhorrence of the <hi>Soul:</hi> that
which we abhor that we cast from us, and put out of
our favour and respect with disdain, and a loathing
thereof: So when God teacheth <hi>Israel</hi> to loath and
abhor their Idols, he bids them <note n="s" place="bottom">Isa. 30. 22. Mat. 13. 48. Mat. 25. 41.</note> 
               <hi>to cast away their

very covering as a slinking and menstruous Cloth, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say unto it, get you hence. He shall gather the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vessels, and cast the bad away.</hi> Cast them out of
my presence: Well but whither must they go? the
Answer is into Hell, into utter darkness, into the
Fire that is prepared for the Devil and his Angels.
Wherefore to be cast away of God, it sheweth unto
us <hi>God</hi>'s abhorrence of such Souls, and how vile and
loathsome such are in his divine eyes. And the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of <hi>Abigail</hi>'s sling mentioned before, doth yet
further shew us the greatness of this abhorrence, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Souls of thine enemies,</hi> said she, <hi>God shall sling out as
out of the middle of a Sling.</hi> When a Man casts a
Stone away with a Sling, then he casteth it <hi>farthest</hi>
from him. For with a Sling he can cast a Stone far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by his hand; <hi>and he,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>shall
cast them away as with a Sling.</hi> But that is not all
neither, for it is not only said, That he shall sling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Souls, but that he shall sling them away as
<hi>out of the middle of a Sling.</hi> When a Stone is placed
to be cast away, <hi>just in the middle of a Sling,</hi> then doth
the <hi>Slinger</hi> cast it furthest <hi>of all.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> is the
<hi>Slinger, abhorrence</hi> is his Sling, the <hi>lost Soul</hi> is the
Stone, and it is placed in the very middle of the
Sling, and is from <hi>thence</hi> cast away: and therefore it
is said again, <hi>That such shall go into utter outer darkness,</hi>
that is, furthest off of all. This therefore shews us
how God <hi>abhors</hi> that Man that for sin has lost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
And well he may; for such an one has not only
polluted and defiled himself with Sin (and that is the
most offensive thing to <hi>God</hi> under Heaven) but he
has abused the handy Work of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Soul,</hi> as I
said before, is the Workmanship of <hi>God,</hi> yea, the
top-piece that he hath made in all the visible World,
also he made it for to be delighted with it, and to
admit it into communion with himself: now for Man

Command of <hi>God,</hi> and notwithstanding the <hi>Soul</hi> was

<hi>God</hi> whose Soul this is, to abhor, and to shew by all
means possible his abhorrence of such an one.</p>
            <p>2. As this casting of them away, supposeth <hi>God's
abhorrence of them: so it supposeth God's just repaying of
them for their wickedness by way of retaliation.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> all the time of the exercise of his long suffering

               </hi>
will do, partly as a retaliation as the former, and
partly by way of Revenge. 1. By way of Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>As he loved cursing, so let it come-unto him; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

he delighted not in blessing; so let it be far from him.</hi>
Again, <hi>As he cloathed himself with cursing</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 109. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>like as

and like Oyl into his Bones; let it be unto him as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Garment which covereth him, and for a Girdle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he is girded continually; Let this,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>be
the reward of mine Adversaries from the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
2. As this Curse comes by way of Retaliation, so it
cometh by way of Revenge. <hi>God</hi> will right the wrongs
that Sinners have done him, will repay vengeance
for the despite and reproach wherewith they have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43327:31"/>
affronted him, and will revenge the quarrel of his
Covenant. And the beginning of revenges are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
what <note n="c" place="bottom">Deut. 33. 41, 42.</note> then will the whole execution be,
when he shall come in flaming fire, taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on them that know not God, and that obey not
the Gospel of Jesus Christ? And therefore this Curse
is exeecuted in wrath, in jealousie, in anger, in fury;
yea, the <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Thes. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> Heavens and the Earth shall be burned
up with the fire of that jealousie in which the great
God will come, when he cometh to curse the Souls
of Sinners, and when he cometh to defie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
            <p>It is little thought of, but the manner of the
coming of God to judge the World, declares what
the Souls of impenitent Sinners must look for then.
It is common among Men, when we see the Form
of a Man's countenance changed, when we see Fire
sparkle out of his Eyes, when we read rage and fury in
every cast of his Face, even <note n="e" place="bottom">See Dan. 3. 19, 23.</note> before he says ought,
or doth ought either, to conclude that some fearful
thing is now to be done. Why, it is said of Christ
when he cometh to judgment, that the Heavens and
the Earth fly away (as not being able to endure his
looks) that his Angels are clad in <note n="f" place="bottom">Rev. 20. 11, 12. 2 Pet. 3. 7. 2 Thes. 1. 8, 9.</note> flaming fire, and
that the Elements melt with fervent heat, and all this
is that the Perdition of ungodly Men might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
from the presence of the Lord, in the heat
of his anger, from the glory of his power. Therefore
God will now be revenged, and so ease himself of his
Enemies, when he <note n="g" place="bottom">Ps. 68. 21.</note> shall cause Curses like Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
to fall as thick as Hail on the hairy Scalp of
of such a one as goeth on still in his Trespasses. But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43327:32"/>
4. As the Loss of the Soul is a Loss peculiar to it
self, a Loss double, and a Loss most fearful; <hi>so it is
a Loss everlasting.</hi> The Soul that is lost, is never to
be found again, never to be recovered again, never to
be redeemed again. It's banishment from God, is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
the fire in which it burns, and by which it must
be tormented is a Fire that is ever, everlasting Fire,
everlasting burnings, the Adder, the Snake, the Sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-worm,
dyeth not, nor is the Fire quenched; and this
is a fearful thing. A man may endure to touch the Fire
with a short touch and away, but to <hi>dwell</hi> with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burnings, that is fearful. Oh, then what is
dwelling with them, and in them for ever and ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

We use to say, light burdens far carried are heavy,
what then will it be to bear that burden, that guilt,
that the Law, and the justice and wrath of God will
lay upon the lost Soul for ever? Now tell the Stars,
now tell the drops of the Sea, and now tell the blades
of Grass that are spread upon the Face of all the Earth
if thou canst, and yet sooner may'st thou do this than
count the thousands of millions of thousands of years
that a damned Soul shall lye in Hell. Suppose every
Star that is now in the Firmament was to burn (by
himself one by one) a thousand years apiece; would
it not be a long while before the last of them was
burned out? and yet sooner might that be done, than
the damned Soul be at the end of punishment.</p>
            <p>There are three things couched under this last
head that will fill up the punishment of a Sinner.</p>
            <p>The first is that it is everlasting.</p>
            <p>The second is, that therefore it will be impossible
for the Souls in Hell ever to say, now we are got ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
way through our sorrows.</p>
            <p>The third is, and yet every moment they shall en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dure
eternal punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:43327:32"/>
The first I have touched upon already, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall not enlarge, only I would ask the wanton
or unthinking Sinner, whether twenty or thirty, or
forty years of the deceitful pleasures of sin, is so rich
a prize as that a man may well venture the ruines that
everlasting burnings will make upon his Soul, for the
obtaining of them, and living a few moments in them.
Sinner, consider this before I go any further, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou readest one line more. If thou hast a Soul,
it concerns thee; if there be a Hell it concerns thee;
and if there be a God that can, and will punish the
Soul for Sin everlastingly in Hell, it concerns thee:
Because,</p>
            <p>In the second place it will be impossible for the
damned Soul ever to say, <hi>I am now got half way through
my sorrows.</hi> That which has no end, has no middle.
Sinner, make a round Circle or Ring upon the
Ground, of what bigness thou wilt: this done, go
thy way upon that Circle or Ring, until thou comest
to the End thereof; but that, sayest thou, I can
never do, because it has no end: I Answer, But thou
mayest as soon do that, as wade half way through the
lake of Fire that is prepared for impenitent Souls.
Sinner, What wilt thou take to make a Mountain o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Sand that will reach as high as the Sun is at Noon?
I know thou wilt not be ingaged in such a Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is impossible thou shouldest ever perform it:
But I dare say, the task is greater when the Sinner has
let out himself to Sin, for a Servant, because the
wages is everlasting burnings. I know thou mayest
perform thy service, but the wages, the judgment,
the punishment is so endless, that thou, when thou
hast been in it more millions of years than can be
numbred, art not, nor never <hi>yet</hi> shall be able to say,
I am half way through it: And yet,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43327:33"/>
3. <hi>That Soul shall partake of (every moment) that
punishment that is eternal.</hi> Even as <hi>Sodom</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sin, and that God is offended therewith: then it will
give flattering promises to God that it will indeed put
it away, but yet it will prefix a time that shall be long
first, if it also then at all performs it, saying yet a little
sleep, yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of sin in
mine arms, till I am older, till I am richer, till I have had
more of the sweetness and the delights of sin. Thus,

            </p>
            <p>5. If God yet pursues, and will see whether this
promise of puting sin out of doors shall be fulfilled by
the Soul, why then it will be <hi>partial in God's Law,</hi> it
will put away some, and keep some; put away the
grossest and keep the finest; put away those that can
best be spared, and keep the most profitable for <note n="g" place="bottom">Mal. 2. 9.</note> a
help at a pinch.</p>
            <p>6. Yea, If all sin must be abandoned, or the Soul
shall have no rest, why then the Soul and Sin will
part (with such a parting as it is) even as <hi>Phaltiel</hi>
parted with <hi>David</hi>'s Wife, <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Sam. 3. 16. Ruth. 1. 14.</note> with an ill will and a

each other again, and no Body never the wiser: O
what courting will be betwixt Sin and the Soul; and
this is called <note n="i" place="bottom">Ezek. 8. 12.</note> doing of things in the dark.</p>
            <p>By all these and many more things that might be
instanced, it is manifest that sin has a friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
by the Soul, and that therefore the Soul
is guilty of damnation: For what do all these things
argue, but that God, his word, his ways and graces
are out of favour with the Soul, and that sin and Satan
are its only pleasant companions. But,

of the thoughts was evil, that is, such as
tended not to deaden or stifle, but such as tended to
animate and forward the <hi>motions</hi> or <hi>thoughts</hi> of sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
action; <hi>every imagination of the thoughts,</hi> that which
is here called a thought, is by <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi>
called a motion: now the imagination should and
would, had it been on God's side, so have conceived
of this motion of and to sins, as to have presented it
in all its features so ugly, so ill favoured and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
a thing to the Soul, that the Soul should
forthwith have let down the Sluce, and pulled up
the Draw bridge, put a stop with greatest defiance
to the <hi>motion</hi> now under consideration: but the <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
being defiled, it presently at the very first
view or noise of the <hi>motion</hi> of sin, so acted as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the bringing the said motion or thought into
act. So then, <hi>the thought of sin,</hi> or motion thereto, is
first of all entertained by the <hi>imagination</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> of
the Soul, and thence conveyed to the rest of the
Powers of the Soul to be condemned, if the <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
be good; but to be helped forward to the act,
if the <hi>imagination</hi> be evil. And thus the evil imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
helpeth the motion of, and to, sin towards
the act, even by dressing of it up in that guise and
habit that may best delude the Understanding Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Conscience: and that is done after this
manner; Suppose a <hi>motion</hi> of sin to commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to swear, to steal, to act covetously, or the

the imagination if evil presently dresseth up this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is the Sin drest up in the Profits and Honours that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that Sin, and so of Theft and the like; but if
the Motion be to swear, hector or the like, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

and so you may count of the rest of sinful <hi>Motions,</hi>
and thus being trimmed up like a <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Baby,
it is presented to all the rest of the Powers of the

               <hi>Wife:</hi> for the <hi>Imagination</hi> is such a forceable
Power, that if it putteth forth it self to dress up and

evil or good, the rest of the Faculties cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. Therefore when <hi>David:</hi> prayed for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> he said, <hi>I have seen with joy, thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee;</hi>

               <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Chron. 29. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>of the Thoughts of the Heart of thy People for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

as the <hi>Imagination</hi> was prepared, so would the Soul
be moved, whether by evil or good; therefore as to
this he prays that their <hi>imagination</hi> might be ingaged
always with apprehensions of the beauteousness of
the Temple, that they might always, as now, offer
willingly for its building.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43327:40"/>
But as I said, when the <hi>Imagination</hi> hath thus set
forth Sin to the rest of the Faculties of the Soul, they
are presently intangled and fall into a flame of love
thereto: this being done, it follows that a <hi>Purpose</hi> to
pursue this <hi>Motion,</hi> till it be brought unto act, is the
next thing that is resolved on. Thus <hi>Esau</hi> after he had
conceived of that profit that would accrue to him by
murthering of his Brother, fell the next way into a
Resolve to spill <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Blood. And <hi>Rebecca</hi> sent for
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and said unto him. <note n="o" place="bottom">Gen. 27. 42. Jer. 49. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Behold thy Brother</hi> Esau

thee.</hi> Nor is this purpose to do an evil without its
fruit, for he comforted himself in his evil <hi>purpose;
Esau</hi> as touching thee doth <hi>comfort himself;</hi> purposing

            <p>The Purpose therefore being concluded, in the

find out what means, methods, and ways will be
thought best to bring this purpose into practice, and
this motion to sin into action. <hi>Esau invented</hi> the <note n="p" place="bottom">Gen 27. 42. 2 Sam. 11. 13.</note>
Death of his Brother, when his Father was to be
carried to his Grave; <hi>David</hi> purposed to make <hi>Vriah</hi>
Father his Bastard-Child, by making of him drunk.
<hi>Amnon</hi> purposed to ravish <hi>Tamar,</hi> and the means that
he <hi>invented</hi> to do it, were by feigning himself sick.
<hi>Absalom</hi> purposed to kill <hi>Amnon,</hi> and invented to do it
<note n="q" place="bottom">Luke 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> at a Feast. <hi>Judas</hi> purposed to sell <hi>Christ,</hi> and
invented to betray him in the absence of the People.
The <hi>Jews</hi> purposed to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>invented</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Judge of a Blandation to send for him, <note n="r" place="bottom">Acts 23. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note>
that they might murther him as he went.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:43327:41"/>
Thus you see how sin is in the <hi>Motion</hi> of it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the Soul; First, it comes into the Fancy
or Imagination by which it is so presented to the
Soul, as to inflame it with desire to bring it into act,
so from this desire the Soul proceedeth to a purpose
of enjoying, and from a purpose of enjoying to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi>
how, or by what means it had best to attempt
the accomplishing of it.</p>
            <p>But further, When the <hi>Soul</hi> has thus far by its
wickedness pursued the Motion of Sin to bring it
into action: then to the last thing, to wit, to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
to take the opportunity, which by the <hi>Invention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
is judged most convenient, so to endeavours it goes
till it has finished Sin, and finished, in finishing of
that, its own fearful damnation. <hi>Then Lust when it</hi>
               <note n="s" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>hath conceived, bringeth forth sin, and sin when it
is finished bringeth forth death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who knows, but God and the Soul, how many
letts, hindrances, convictions, fears, frights, misgivings,
and thoughts of the Judgment of God all this while are
passing and repassing, turning and returning over the
Face of the Soul? How many times the Soul is made to
start, look back and tremble, while it is pursuing the
pleasure, profit, applause or preferment that Sin when
finished, promiseth to yield unto the Soul? for God
is such a lover of the Soul, that he seldom lets it go
on in Sin, but he cries to it by his word and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences;
<hi>Oh! do not this abominable thing that I hate;</hi>
especially at first, until it shall have hardened it self,
and so provoked him to give it up in Sin-revenging
Judgment to its own ways and doings, which is the
terriblest Judgment under Heaven: And this brings
me to the third Thing, the which I now will
speak to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:43327:41"/>
3. As the Soul receives, detains, entertains, and
willily worketh, to bring Sin from the motion into
act, so it abhorreth to be controuled and taken off of
this work; <hi>My Soul loathed them,</hi> says God, <note n="t" place="bottom">Zech. 11. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Soul also abhorred me:</hi> My Soul loathed them
because they were so <hi>bad,</hi> and their Souls abhorred
me, because I am so <hi>good.</hi> Sin then is the Cause of
the Loss of the Soul; because it hath set the Soul, or
rather, because the Soul of love to sin, hath set it
self against God. <hi>Wo unto their Souls, for they</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="bottom">Isa. 3. 9.</note>
               <hi>have rewarded evil unto themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may the better perceive that the <hi>Soul</hi>
through sin has set it self against God: I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and speak briefly to these two things:</p>
            <p>I. The Law.</p>
            <p>II. The Gospel.</p>
            <p>1. For the Law, God has given it for a Rule of
Life, either as written in their Natures, or as insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Holy Scriptures: I say, for a Rule of Life
to all the Children of Men, but what have Men done,
or how have they carried it to this Law of their
Creator, let us see, and that from the Mouth of
God himself.</p>
            <p>I. <note n="w" place="bottom">Jer. 6. 19. Ch. 9. 13, Ch. 16. 11. Ch. 44.</note> They have not hearkened unto my Law.</p>
            <p>II. They have forsaken my Law.</p>
            <p>III. They have forsaken me, and not kept my
Law.</p>
            <p>IV. They have not walked in my Law, nor in my
Statutes.</p>
            <p>V. <note n="x" place="bottom">Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngs of my Law, but they were counted as a
strange Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:43327:42"/>
Now whence should all this disobedience arise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not from the unreasonableness of the Commandment,
but from the Opposition that is lodged in the <hi>Soul</hi>
against God and the Enmity that it entertains against
goodness. Hence the Apostle speaks of the Enmity,
and says, That Men are enemies in their Minds, their
<note n="y" place="bottom">Col. 1. 21.</note> Souls, as is manifest, by wicked works.</p>
            <p>This, if Men went no further, must needs be
highly provoking to a just and holy God: yea, so
highly offensive is it, that to shew the heat of his
<note n="z" place="bottom">Rom. 2. 8, 9.</note> anger, he saith, <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and
anguish, upon every Soul of Man that doth evil</hi> (and this
is evil with a witness) <hi>of the Jew first, and also of
the Gentile, that doth evil,</hi> that breaketh the Law,
for that evil he is crying out against now. But,</p>
            <p>2. To speak of the Gospel, and of the Carriage
of sinful Souls towards God under that dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Gospel is a Revelation of a sovereign Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
provided by God through Christ, for the Health
and Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation of those that have made themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of wrath by the Breach of the Law of Works.
This is manifest by all the Scripture: But how doth
the Soul carry it towards God, when he offereth to
deal with it under and by this dispensation of grace?
Why, just as it carried it under the Law of Works,
they <hi>oppose,</hi> they <hi>contradict,</hi> they <hi>blaspheme,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that this Gospel be mentioned. What higher
<note n="a" place="bottom">Acts 13. 45. Chap. 18. 6. 2 Tim. 2. 25. 1 Thes. 2. 13, 14, 15.</note> affront or contempt can be offered to God and
what greater disdain can be shewn against the Gospel?
Yet all this the poor Soul to its own wrong offereth
against the way of its own salvation as it is said
in the Word of Truth, <note n="b" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 36.</note> 
               <hi>He that sinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43327:42"/>
me, wrongs his own Soul, all that hate me, love
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, The Soul despiseth not the Gospel in
that revelation of it only, but the great and chief
bringer thereof with the manner also of his bringing
of it.</p>
            <p>The Bringer, the great Bringer of the Gospel is
the good Lord Jesus Christ himself, he came and
preached Peace to them that the Law proclaimed
<note n="c" place="bottom">Eph. 2. 17.</note> War against; he came and preached Peace to them
that were far off, and to them that were nigh. And
it is worth your observation, to take notice how he
came, and that was and still is (as he is set forth in
the Word of the Gospel) to wit, First as making
peace himself to God for us, in and by the Blood of
his Cross, and then as bearing (as set out by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
the very Characters of his sufferings before our
faces in every tender of the Gospel of his grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. And to touch a little upon the Dress in which
by the Gospel Christ presenteth himself unto us,
while he offereth unto sinful Souls his peace, by the
Tenders thereof.</p>
            <p>1. <note n="d" place="bottom">Isa. 9. 6. Luke 2. 9. 10, 11, 12. 1 Cor. 15. 3. Gal. 3. 13. Rom 10. 4. Dan. 9. 24.</note> He is set forth as born for us, to save out
Souls.</p>
            <p>2. He is set forth before us, as bearing of our <hi>Sins</hi>
for us, and suffering God's Wrath for us.</p>
            <p>3. He is set forth before us, as fulfilling the Law
for us, and as bringing of everlasting righteousness
to us for our covering.</p>

1. He is set forth as sweating of Blood while he
<note n="e" place="bottom">Luk. 22. 24.</note> was in his Agony, wrestling with the Thoughts
of Death, which he was to suffer for our Sins, that
he might save the Soul.</p>
            <p>2. He is set forth as crying, weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Lashes of Justice, <note n="f" place="bottom">Heb. 3. 7.</note> that he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under, and was willing to bear for our <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. He is set forth as betrayed, apprehended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
spit on, scourged, buffeted, mocked, crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Thorns, crucified, pierced with Nails and a
Spear: To save the <hi>Soul</hi> from being betrayed by the
<hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Sin;</hi> to save it from being apprehended
by Justice, and condemned by the Law; to save it
from being spit on in a way of contempt by holiness.
To save it from being scourged with guilt of <hi>Sins</hi>

with ignominy and shame for ever. To save it from
dying the second Death. To save it from wounds
and grief for ever.</p>
            <p>Dost thou understand me, sinful Soul? He wrestled
with Justice, that thou mightest have rest; he wept
and mourned that thou mightest laugh and rejoyce; he
was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that thou mightest escape; he was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that thou mightest be justified; and was killed,
that thou mightest live; he wore a Crown of Thorns,
that thou mightest wear a Crown of Glory; and was
nailed to the Cross with his Arms wide open, to
shew with what freeness all his Merits shall be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the coming <hi>Soul,</hi> and how heartily he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it into his bosom.</p>

offereth the Benefit thereof unto thee freely; yea

he cometh unto thee in the Word of the Gospel, with

as fresh in his hands and his feet, and as with the
Blood still bubling out of his side, to pray thee <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.</note>
to accept of the Benefit, and to be reconciled to God
thereby. But that saith the sinful Soul to this? I
do not ask what he saith with his Lips, for he will
assuredly flatter <hi>God</hi> with his Mouth; But what doth
his actions and carriages declare as to his acceptance
of this incomparable benefit? <hi>For a wicked man</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43327:44"/>
think of him with thoughts that have a Tendency in
them to separate them and their Lusts asunder, and
to the making of them to imbrace him for their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the taking up of their Cross, to follow him.
All this Sinners speak out with loud voices, in that
they stop their ears and shut their eyes, as to him,
but open them wide, and hearken diligently to any
thing that pleaseth the Flesh, and that is a Nursery
to Sin. But,</p>
            <p>2. As they despise and reject, and do not regard
his Person, so they do not value the Grace that he
tendereth unto them by the Gospel; this is plain by
that indifferency of spirit that always attends them,
when at any time they hear thereof, or when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto them.</p>
            <p>I may safely say, That the most of Men who are
concerned in a Trade, will be more vigilant in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a Twelve-penny Customer, than they will
be with Christ, when he comes to make unto them
by the Gospel, a tender of the incomparable Grace
of God. Hence they are called fools, <note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. 17. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Because a price
is put into their hands to get wisdom, and they have no
heart unto it.</hi> And hence again it is, that that bitter
complaint is made, <note n="l" place="bottom">Psal. 81. 11.</note> 
               <hi>But my People would not hearken
to my voice, and Israel would none of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these things being found, as practised by the
<hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> must needs after a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
provoke; wherefore no marvel that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are bid to be astonished at this, and that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
shall seize upon the <hi>Soul</hi> for this.</p>
            <p>And indeed, The <hi>Soul</hi> that doth thus by practice
<note n="m" place="bottom">Jer. 2.</note> (though with his mouth (as who doth not?) he
shall shew much love) he doth interpretatively say
these things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43327:44"/>
1. That he loveth <hi>Sin</hi> better than <hi>Grace,</hi> and
darkness better than light, even as our Lord Jesus
Christ hath shewed. <hi>And this is the Condemnation that
light is come into the World, and Men love darkness more
than light</hi> (as is manifest) <hi>because their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They do also by their thus rejecting of Christ
and Grace, say, That for what the Law can do to
them, they value it not; they regard not its thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
threatnings, nor will they shrink when they
come to endure the Execution thereof; wherefore
God to deter them from such bold and desperate ways,
that do interpretatively fully declare that they
make such desperate conclusions, insinuates, that
the Burden of the Curse thereof is intolerable, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>3. Yea by their thus doing, they do as good as
say, That they will run the hazzard of a sentence of
death at the day of judgment, and that they will in
the mean time joyn Issue and stand a Tryal at that
day with the great and terrible God: What else
means their not hearkning to him, their despising of
his Son, and the rejecting of his grace: yea, I say
again, what else means their slighting of the Curse
of the Law, and their chusing to abide in their sins
till the day of death and judgment. And thus I have
shewed you the Causes of the Loss of the Soul:
And assuredly these things are no fables.</p>

observe, you shall see, that the Soul goeth first, or
before in punishment, not only by what has been said
already, in that the Soul is first made a partaker of
death, but in that God first deals with the Soul by
convictions, yea, and terrors, perhaps while the
Body is well; or in that he giveth up the Soul to
judicial hardness, and further blindness, while he
leaveth the Body to do his Office in the World: yea,
and also when the day of death, and dissolution is
come, the Body is spared while the Soul is tormented
in unutterable torment in Hell. And so I say, it
shall be spared, and the Clods of the Valley shall be
sweet unto it while the Soul mourneth in Hell for Sin:
'tis true, at the Day of Judgment because that is the
last and final Judgment of God on Men, then the Body
and Soul shall be re-united or joyned together again,
and shall then together partake of that recompence
for their wickedness which is meet. When I say,
The Body is spared, and the Soul tormented, I mean
not that the Body is not then at death made to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the wages of Sin: <hi>For</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="bottom">Rom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the wages of Sin is
death:</hi> But I mean the Body partakes then but of
temporal death, which as to sense and feeling, is
sometimes over presently, and then resteth in the
Grave, while the Soul is tormenting in Hell: yea, and
why is Death suffered to slay the Body? I dare say,
not chiefly for that the indignation of God most
burneth against the Body; but the Body being the
House for the Soul in this World, God even pulls
down this Body, that the Soul may be stript naked;
and being stript, may be carried to Prison, to the
Place where damned <hi>Souls</hi> are, there to suffer in the

            <p>2. Therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> must be the part most sorely
punished, because Justice must be distributed with

wilt thou be wroth with all the Congregation?</hi> He
pleads here for equity in God's distributing of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
yea, and so exact is God in the distribution
thereof, that he will not punish Heathens so as he
will punish Jews; wherefore he saith, <hi>of the Jew first</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>or chiefly, and also to the Gentile:</hi> yea, in Hell,
he has prepared several degrees of punishment for
the several sorts or degrees of offenders, <hi>And</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Luke 20. 47.</note> 
               <hi>some
shall receive greater damnation.</hi> And will it not be
unmeet for us to think, since God is so exact in all
his doings, that he will without his weights and
measures give to Soul and Body, as I may say, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
not severally, their punishments according to
the desert and merit of each?</p>
            <p>3. The punishment of the <hi>Soul</hi> in Hell must needs,
to be sure, as to degree, differ from the punishment
of the Body there: When I say <hi>differ,</hi> I mean must
needs be greater, whether the Body be punished
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43327:46"/>
with the same Fire, with the <hi>Soul,</hi> or Fire of another
nature. If it be punished with the same Fire, yet not
in the same way, for the Fire of Guilt with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of indignation and wrath, are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
felt, and apprehended by the <hi>Soul,</hi> and by the
Body, by vertue of its union with the <hi>Soul,</hi> and so
felt by the Body, if not only, yet I think mostly by
way of sympathy with the <hi>Soul</hi> (and the Cause we say,
is worse than the Disease) and if the wrath of God,
and the Apprehensions of it, as discharging it self
for sin, and the breach of the Law, be that with
which the <hi>Soul</hi> is punished, as sure it is; then the
Body is punished by the Effects, or by those Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that the <hi>Soul</hi> in its torments has upon the Body,
by vertue of that great oneness and union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
            <p>But if there be a punishment prepared for the
Body distinct in kind from that which is prepared for
the <hi>Soul,</hi> yet it must be a punishment inferior to that
which is prepared for the <hi>Soul</hi> (not that the <hi>Soul</hi> and
Body shall be severed, but being made of things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
their punishments will be by that which is
most suitable to each) I say, it must be inferior, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nothing can be so hot, so tormenting, so intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
unsupportable, as the quickest Apprehensions
of, and the immediate sinking under that Guilt and
Indignation that is proportionable to the Offence,
Should all the Wood and Brimstone, and cumbusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter on Earth be gathered together for the
tormenting of one Body, yet that cannot yield that
torment to that, which the sence of guilt and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hot application of the mighty indignation of God,
will do to the <hi>Soul:</hi> Yea, suppose the Fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Body is tormented in Hell, should be seven
times hotter than any of our Fire; yea, suppose it
again, to be seven times hotter than that which is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43327:47"/>
seven times hotter than ours, yet it must, suppose
it be but created fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be infinitely short (as to
tormenting operations) of the unspeakable wrath of
God, when in the heat thereof he applyeth it to, and
doth punish the <hi>Soul</hi> for sin in Hell therewith.</p>
            <p>So then whether the Body be tormented with the
same Fire wherewith the <hi>Soul</hi> is tormented, or
whether the Fire be of another kind, yet it is not
possible that it should bear the same punishment as
to degree, because, or for the causes that I have
shewed. Nor inded is it meet it should, because the
Body has not sinned so, so grievously as the <hi>Soul</hi> has
done, and <hi>God</hi> proportioneth the punishment suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Offence.</p>
            <p>4. With the <hi>Soul</hi> by its self, are the most quick
and suitable apprehensions of God and his wrath:
wherefore that must needs be made partaker of the
sorest punishment in Hell; 'tis the Soul that now is
most subtle at discerning, and it is the Soul that will
be so; then Conscience, Memory, Understanding
and Mind, these will be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat of torment, since
the Understanding will let Wrath immediately upon
these, from what it apprehends of that wrath; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will let in the Wrath of God immediately
upon these, from what it fearfully feels of that
wrath: the Memory will then as a Vessel receive and
retain up to the brim of this Wrath even as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
by the Understanding and Conscience, the
Cause of this Wrath, and considers of the durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it: So then the Soul is the seat and receiver
of Wrath, even as it was the receiver and seat of
Sin; here then is sin and wrath upon the Soul, the
Soul in the Body, and so Soul and Body tormented
in Hell-fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43327:47"/>
5. The Soul will be most tormented, because
strongest: the biggest Burden must lye upon the
strongest Part, especi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly since also it is made capable
of it by its sin. The Soul must bear its own punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a great part of the Bodies too, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
as so far as Apprehension goes, the Soul will
be quicker at that Work than the Body. The Body
will have its punishment to lye mostly in feeling,
but the Soul in feeling and apprehending both. True,
the Body by the help of the Soul will see too, but
the Soul will see yet abundantly further. And good
reason that the Soul should bear part of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Body, because it was through its allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that the Body yielded to help the <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>Sin;</hi>
the Devil presented <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> took it by the
Body, and now Devil and <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and all must
be lost, cast away, that is damned in Hell for <hi>Sin,</hi>
but the <hi>Soul</hi> must be the Burden-bearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you may say, doth not this give incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Sinners to give way to the Body to be in al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> its
members loose and vain, and wicked, as Instruments to
Sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> No, Forasmuch as the Body shall also
have his share in punishment: for though I have
said, the Soul shall have more punishment than the
Body; yet I have not said, That the Body shall at
all be eased by that; no, the Body will have its due:
and for the better making out of my Answer further,
consider of these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The Body will be the Vessel to hold a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<hi>Soul</hi> in, this will be something, therefore
Man, damned Man, is called <hi>a</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 9. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Vessel of Wrath;</hi>
a Vessel, and that in both Body and <hi>Soul.</hi> The
<hi>Soul</hi> receiveth Wrath into its self, and the Body
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43327:48"/>
holdeth that <hi>Soul</hi> that has thus received, and is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with this Wrath of God. Now the Body
being a Vessel to hold this <hi>Soul</hi> that is thus possessed
with the Wrath of God, must needs it self be afflicted
and tormented with that torment, because of its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Body: therefore the Holy Ghost saith,
<hi>His</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Job 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Flesh upon him shall have pain, and his Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him shall mourn:</hi> Both shall have their torment and
misery, for that both joyned hand in hand in sin, the
<hi>Soul</hi> to bring it to the Birth, and the Body to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
it into the World; therefore it saith again, with
reference to the Body, <hi>Let</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="bottom">Psal. 109. 17, 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>the Curse come into
his Bowels like Water, and like Oyl into his Bones.</hi> Let
it be to him as a Garment which covereth him, and
as a Girdle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Body then will be tormented
as well as the Soul, by being a Vessel to hold that
<hi>Soul</hi> in, that is now possessed and distressed with the
unspeakable wrath and indignation of the Almighty
God: and this will be a great deal if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
            <p>2. That the Body as a Body, will by reason of its
union with the <hi>Soul,</hi> be as sensible, and so as capable
in its kind, to receive correction and torment, as
ever, nay I think more; for if the quickness of the
<hi>Soul,</hi> giveth quickness of sense to the Body, as (in
some case, at least) I am apt to think it doth, then
forasmuch as the <hi>Soul</hi> will now be most quick, most
sharp in Apprehension, so the Body by reason of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and sympathy with the <hi>Soul,</hi> will be most quick,
and most sharp as to Sense. Indeed if the Body
should not receive and retain sense, yea, all its <hi>Senses,</hi>
by reason of its being a Vessel to hold the <hi>Soul,</hi> the
torment of the <hi>Soul</hi> could not, as torment, be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to the Body, no more than the Fire tormented

What think you? If a Man saw himself in Prison,

            <p>There are four things in the Words, that do prove

            <p>1. There is an intimation of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> in the
Man that has lost, and that after he has lost his Soul
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Hell; <hi>Or what shall a Man give in exchange for his
Soul?</hi> These words are by no means applicable to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that has no life or sense: for he that is dead ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our common acceptation of death, that is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eprived of life and sense, would not give two pence

               </gap> change his state: Therefore the words do intimate
that the Man is yet alive and sensible. Now were a
Man alive and sensible, though he was in none other
place than the Grave, there to be confined, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are at liberty, what would he give in exchange
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or his place, and to be rid of that for a better? but

               </gap>ow much more to be delivered from Hell, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
place and state of his <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There is in the Text, an intimation of a sense
of <hi>Torment; Or what shall a Man give in exchange for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> peace: And from the sense and feeling of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he would give, yea, what would he not give

               </gap>n exchange for his Soul?</p>
            <p>3. There is in the Text an intimation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerableness
of the Torment, because that it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
that the Man whose <hi>Soul</hi> is swallowed up
therewith, would give <hi>all,</hi> were his <hi>all</hi> never so great

            </p>
            <p>4. There is yet in the Text an intimation that
the Soul is sensible of the <hi>lastingness</hi> of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
or else the question rather argues a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary

the reason of this resolution of God, it flows from
a Determination in him to make all his sayings good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to verifie them on the Consciences of Sinners.
And since the incredulous World will not belie?

            <p>God is resolved, as I said, to have the Mastery,
and that not only in a way of Dominion and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in general, for that he has now; but he is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to master, that is, to break the Spirit of the
World, to make all Men cringe and crouch unto
him, even those that <hi>now</hi> say, <hi>There is no God;</hi> or if

creeping things of the Earth, they shall be afraid of
the Lord our God, and shall fear because of thee.</p>
            <p>For then they, will they, nill they, shall have to
do with God, though not with him as merciful, or
as one that may be intreated: yet with him as just,
<hi>and as devouring fire:</hi> yea, they shall see that Face, <note n="b" place="bottom">Heb. 12. <hi>last</hi> vers.</note>
and hear that Voice, from whom, and from which
the Heavens and the Earth will fly away and find no
place of stay. And by this appearance, and by such
words of his mouth as he then will speak to them,
they shall begin to tremble, and call for the Rocks
to fall upon them and cover them: For if these things
will happen at the Execution of inferior Judgments,
What will be done! what effects will the last, most
dreadful and eternal Judgment have upon Men's
Souls?</p>
            <p>Hence you find, that at the very first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Jesus Christ, the whole World begins to
mourn and lament, <hi>Every eye shall see him, and
they also that</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>pierced him, and all Kindreds of
the Earth shall wail because of him:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you also find them to stand at the Door and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43327:53"/>
knock, saying, <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 13. 25, 26. Matth. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us.</hi> Moreover
you find them also <hi>desiring,</hi> yea, also so humble i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
their desires, as to be content with the least degree of
Mercy, one drop, one drop upon the tip of ones Finger:
What stooping, what condescention, what humility
is here? <hi>All</hi> and every one of those passages declare
that the Hand of God is upon them, and that the
Almighty has got the Mastery of them, has conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, broke the Pride of their Power, and laid
them low, and made them cringe and crouch unto
him, bending the Knee, and craving of kindness.</p>
            <p>Thus then will God bow, and bend, and break
them; yea, make them bow, and bend, and break
before him. And hence also it is that they will
weep, and mourn, and gnash their Teeth, and cry,
and repent that ever they have been so foolish, so
wicked, so traiterous to their Souls, and such ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of their own eternal happiness, as to stand out
in the day of their visitation, in a way of rebellion
against the Lord.</p>
            <p>But here is their hard <hi>hap,</hi> their dismal lot and
portion; that all these things must be when <hi>'tis too
late.</hi> It is, and will be the lot, and hap of these to
<note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 25.</note> bow, bend and break <hi>too late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You read, They come weeping and mourning and
with tears, they knock and cry for mercy, but what
did tears avail? why nothing, for the door was shut.
He answered and said, <hi>I know you not whence you are:</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Luke 13. 26, 27, 28.</note> But they repeat and renew their suit, saying,
<hi>We have eat and drank in thy presence, and thou hast
taught in our streets.</hi> What now? Why, he returns
upon them his first answer the second time, saying, <hi>I
tell you, I know you not whence you are: depart from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43327:53"/>
me all ye workers of iniquity:</hi> Then he concludes,
<hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth, when you
shall see</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

out.</hi> They come weeping, and go weeping away.
They come to him weeping, for they saw that he
had conquered them, but they departed weeping,
for they saw that he would damn them: yet, as we
read in another place, they were very loth to go
from him by their reasoning and expostulating with
him, <hi>Lord when saw we thee an hungred, or thirsty, or
a stranger,</hi>

               <hi>or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did
not minister unto thee?</hi> But all would not do, here is
no place for change of mind, <hi>These shall go away into

And now what would a Man give in <hi>exchange for
his Soul?</hi> so that as I said before, all is <hi>too late,</hi> they
mourn <hi>too late,</hi> they repent <hi>too late,</hi> they pray <hi>too late,</hi>
and seek to make an exchange for their Soul <hi>too late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
Two or three things there may yet be gathered from
these Words; I mean as to the Desires of them that
have lost their Souls, to make for them an exchange:
<hi>What shall a Man give in exchange?</hi> What shall? what
would? yea, what would not a Man, if he had it,
give in exchange for his Soul?</p>
            <p>1. What would not a Man, I mean a Man in the
Condition, that is by the Text supposed, some Men
are, and will be in, give in exchange, <hi>to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man's Vertues instead of their own Vices? Let
me dye the death of the Righteous.</hi> Let my Soul be in

and squib, and deride at other Men's Vertues, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Day is coming when their minds will be changed,
and when they shall be made to count those that have
done those righteous actions and duties which they
have scoffed at, the only blessed Men. Yea, they
shall wish their Soul in the blessed Possession of those
Graces and Vertues that those whom they hated were
accompanied with; and would if they had it, give a
whole World for this change, but it will not now do,
it is <hi>now too late,</hi> what then shall a Man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for his Soul? and this is more than intimated
in that 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> named before: for yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

find by that Text, how loth they were, or will be,
to be counted for unrighteous People. <hi>Lord,</hi> say they,
<hi>when did we see thee an hungred, or a thirst, naked, or
sick, and did not minister unto thee.</hi> Now they are not
willing to be of the Number of the Wicked, though
heretofore the ways of the Righteous were an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to them: But alas! they are before a just
God, a just Judge, a Judge that will give every one
according to their ways; therefore, <hi>Woe to the Soul
of the Wicked now:</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="bottom">Isa. 3. 11.</note> It shall go ill with him, for
the reward of his hands shall be given him: thus
therefore he is lockt up as to this, he cannot now
change his vices for vertues, nor put himself or his
Soul in the stead of the Soul of the saved; so that it
still, and will for ever abide a question unresolved, <hi>Or
what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> I do
not doubt but that a Man's state may be such in this
World, that if he had it, he would give thousands
of Gold, to be as innocent and guiltless in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law of the Land, as is the state of
such, or such, heartily wishing that himself was
not that he that he is: how much more then will

            </p>
            <p>2. As they would for the Salvation of their Souls
be glad to change away their Vices for the Vertues,
their Sins for the good Deeds of others: so what
would they not give to change places now, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from where now they are, into Paradise, into
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom.</p>
            <p>But neither shall this be admitted, the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They then that have lost, or shall lose their Souls,
are bound to their place, as well as to their sins.
When <hi>Judas</hi> went to Hell, he went to his home, <note n="l" place="bottom">Acts 1. 25.</note>
to his own place; and when the Righteous go hence,
they also go home to their House, to their <note n="m" place="bottom">Mat. 25. 34.</note>

for them. Between Heaven and Hell, <hi>there is a</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="bottom">Luke 12. 32.</note>
               <hi>great gulf fixed;</hi> that is, a strong passage, there is
a great gulf fixed.</p>
            <p>What this gulf is, and how impossible, they that
shall lose their Souls will know to their woe; because
it is fixed there where it is, on purpose to keep them
in their tormenting place, so that they that would
pass from Hell to Heaven cannot. But I say, <hi>Would
they not change</hi> places? <hi>would they not have a more
comfortable House and Home for their Souls?</hi> Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Text supposes it, and the sixteenth of <hi>Luke</hi>
affirms it: Yea, and could they purchase for their
Soul a Habitation among the Righteous, would they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43327:55"/>
not? Yes, they would give all the World for such a
Change. <hi>What shall, what shall not a Man, if he had
it, if it would answer his design, give in exchange for
his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As the Damned would change their own Vices
for Vertues, and the Place where they are for that
into which they shall not come; so, <hi>What would they
give for a change of condition?</hi> Yea, if an absolute
change may not be obtained, yet what would they
give for the least degree of mitigation of that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which now they know will without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
be, and that for ever and ever. <hi>Tribulation,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">Rom. 2. 8, 9. 2 Thes. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>and anguish, indignation and wrath,</hi> the gnawing
Worm, and everlasting destruction from the Presence
of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be born but with great horror and grief, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
then if these poor Creatures would for ease for
their Souls be glad to change their Conditions;
Change! with whom? with an Angel, with a Saint,
Ay, with a Dog or a Toad; for they mourn not,
they weep not, nor do they bear indignation of
wrath, they are as if they had not been; only the
sinful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soul abides in its Sins, in the Place designed for
lost Soul, and in the Condition that Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
for Sin and Transgression hath decreed
them to abide for ever. And this brings me to the
Conclusion, which is, <hi>That seeing the ungodly do seek
good things too late:</hi> therefore notwithstanding their
seeking, they must still abide in their place, their
sins, and their torment: <hi>For what can a Man give in
exchange for his Soul?</hi> Therefore God saith, that they
there must still abide and dwell, no exchange can <note n="p" place="bottom">Isa. 50. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compare Ezek. 32. v. 25. and v. 27.</note>
be made, <hi>This shall they have of mine hand, they shall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43327:55"/>
lye down in sorrow;</hi> they shall lie down in it, they
shall make their Bed there, there they shall lie. And
this is the bitter Pill that they must swallow down at
last, for after all their tears, their sorrows, their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
their repentings, their wishings and wouldings,
and all their inventings, and desires to change their
state for a better; they <hi>must lie down in sorrow.</hi> The poor
condemned Man that is upon the Ladder or Scaffold,
has, if one knew them, many a long wish and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that he might come down again alive, or that his
condition was as one of the Spectators that are not
condemned, and brought thither to be executed as he:
how carefully also doth he look with his failing eyes,
to see if some comes not from the King with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for him, all the while endeavouring to fumble
away, as well as he can, and to prolong the <hi>minute</hi> of
his execution: but at last, when he has looked, when
he has wished, when he has desired, and done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he can, the blow with the Ax, or turn with the
Ladder, is his lot, so he goes off the Scaffold, so he
goes from among Men: And thus it will be with those
that we have under consideration, when all comes to
all, and they have said, and wished, and done what
they can, the Judgment must not be reversed, they
must <hi>lie down in sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They <hi>must,</hi> or shall lie down. Of old, when a
Man was to be chastized for his fault, he was to lie
down to receive his stripes: so here, saith the Lord,
they shall lie down, <hi>And it shall be if the wicked Man
be</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="bottom">Deut. 25. 2.</note> 
               <hi>worthy to be beaten, the Judge shall cause him to
lie down, and to be beaten before his Face.</hi> And this
lying down was to be his lot, after he had pleaded
for himself what he could, and the Judge shall cause
him to be beaten before his face, while he is present
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43327:56"/>
to behold the execution of judgment; and thus it
shall be at the End of the World: the wicked shall
lie down and shall be beaten with many stripes in the
presence of Christ, and <note n="r" place="bottom">2 Thess. 1. Rev. 14. 10.</note> in the presence of the holy
Angels. For there will be his presence not only at the
tryal as judge, but to see execution done, nay to do
it himself, by the pouring out like a River, his Wrath
as burning Brimstone upon the Soul of the lost and
cast-away Sinner.</p>
            <p>He shall lie down; These words imply, that at
last the damned Soul shall submit; for to lie down, is
an act that signifies submission, especially to lie dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with them to rend and tear themselves, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit

by concluding themselves in all the fault, and that
they have sufficiently merited this just damnation;
for it would seem strange to me, that just judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Men shall terminate in this issue, if God should
not justifie himself in the Conscience of all the
damned. But as here on Earth, so he will let them
know, that go to Hell, that he hath not done without

            <p>I come now to make some Use and Application of
the whole. And</p>
            <p>1. If the Soul be so excellent a thing, as we
have made it appear to be, and if the Loss thereof be
so great a Loss; then here you may see who they are
that are those extravagant ones, I mean those that
are such in the highest degree. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of a
great <hi>Waster,</hi> and saith also, that he that is slothful
in his business, <hi>is</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="bottom">Prov. 18. 9.</note>

had his eye upon, or who it was that he counted so

all the World to shew me one, that for wasting and

lusts and pleasures of this life will hazzard the Los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of his Soul. Many Men will be so profuse, and will
spend at that prodigal rate, that they will bring
a thousand pound a year to five hundred, and five
hundred to fifty, and some also will bring that fifty
to less than nine pence; but what is this to him that
shall never leave losing until he has lost his Soul? I
have heard of some who would throw away a Farm,
a good Estate upon the trundling of one single <hi>Bow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But what is this to the casting away the Soul? I say
what is this to the Loss of the Soul, and that for less
than the trundling of a <hi>Bowl.</hi> Nothing can for bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be compared to sin, it is the vile thing, it cannot
have a worse Name than its own: it is worse than the
vilest Man, than the vilest of Beasts: yea, sin is
worse than the Devil himself, for it is sin, and sin
only that hath made the Devils Devils: and yet for
this, for this vile, <hi>this</hi>

               <hi>abominable thing,</hi> some
Men, yea, most Men will venture the Loss of their
Soul: yea, they will mortgage, pawn, and set their
Souls to sale for it: Is not this a great Waster? doth
not this Man deserve to be ranked among the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
ones? What think you of him who when
he tempted the Wench to uncleanness, said to her,
<hi>If thou wilt venture thy Body, I'le venture my Soul?</hi>
was not here like to be a fine bargain think you? or
was not this Man like to be a gainer by so doing?
This is he that prizes sin at a higher rate than he doth
his immortal Soul; yea, this is he that esteems a
quarter of an hours pleasure, more than he fears
everlasting damnation: What shall I say? this Man
is minded to give more to be damned, than God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

here you may see who are the greatest Fools in the

               <hi>their Soul of good,</hi> even of
that good the which if they had it, would be <hi>a good
to them for ever.</hi> But I ask not concerning this, it
is not what provision thou hast made for this life,
but what for the life, and the World to come. <hi>Lord,
gather</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="bottom">Psal. 26. 9. Psal. 17. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>not my Soul with Sinners,</hi> said <hi>David;</hi> not
with Men of this World; Lord, not with them that
have their portion in this life, whose Belly thou
fillest with thy hid Treasures. Thus you see how
<hi>Solomon</hi> laments some, and how his Father prays to
be delivered from their lot, who have their portion
in this life, and that have not made provision <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s matter: What provision hast thou made for thy
Soul? And,</p>
            <p>1. What hast thou thought of thy Soul? what
ponderous thoughts hast thou had of the Greatness,
and of the immortality of thy Soul? This must be
the first enquiry; for he that hath not had his
thoughts truly exercised, ponderously exercised about
the Greatness and the immortality of his Soul, will
not be careful after an effectual manner, to make
provision for his Soul, for the Life and World to
come. The Soul is a Man's <hi>all,</hi> whether he knows
it or no, as I have already shewed you: now a Man
will be concerned about what he thinks is his <hi>all.</hi> We
read of the poor Servant that <note n="w" place="bottom">Deut. 24. 14, 15.</note>

                  </gap>is Wages,</hi> but it is because it is his <hi>all,</hi> his Treasure,
and that wherein his worldly worth lieth. Why thy
Soul is thy <hi>all,</hi> 'tis strange if thou dost not think so?
and more strange if thou dost think so, and yet hast
light, seldom, and trivial thoughts about it: These
two seem to be inconsistent, therefore let thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43327:63"/>
speaks; either thou hast very great and
weighty thoughts about the excellent Greatness of thy
Soul, or else thou dost not count that thy Soul is so
great a thing as it is; else thou dost not count it thy <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What Judgment hast thou made of the present
state of thy Soul (I speak now to the unconverted)
thy <hi>Soul</hi> is under sin, under the curse, and an object
of wrath, this is that sentence that by the word it
passed upon it, <hi>Wo</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="bottom">Isa. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to their Souls,</hi> saith God, <hi>for
they have rewarded evil to themselves;</hi> this is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of God: Well, but what judgment hast thou
passed upon it while thou livest in thy debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
is it not that which thy fellows have passed
on theirs before thee, saying, <hi>I shall</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="bottom">Deut. 29. 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>have
peace, tho' I walk in the imagination of my heart to add
drunkenness to thirst;</hi> if so, know thy judgment is
gross, thy <hi>Soul</hi> is miserable, and turn, or in little time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thine Eyes will behold all this.</p>
            <p>3. What care hast thou had of securing of thy
<hi>Soul,</hi> and that it might be delivered from the danger
that by sin it is brought into? If a Man has a Horse,
a Cow, or a Swine that is sick or in danger by reason
of this or that casualty, he will take care for his Beast,
that it may not perish, he will pull it out of the Ditch
on the Sabbath Day: but oh! that's the Day on which
many Men do put their Soul into the Ditch of <hi>Sin;</hi>
that is the day that they set apart to pursue wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in: But I say, what care hast thou taken to get
thy <hi>Soul</hi> out of this Ditch? a Ditch out of which thou
canst never get it without the aid of an omnipotent
Arm. In things pertaining to this life, when a Man
feels his own <hi>strength</hi> fail, he will implore the help
and aid of another; and no Man can by any means
deliver by his own arm his Soul from the power of
Hell (which thou also wilt confess if thou beest not a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43327:64"/>
very Brute) but what hast thou done with God for
help? hast thou cryed? hast thou cryed out? yea
dost thou s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yea, canst thou say, my <hi>Soul,</hi> my <hi>Soul</hi> waiteth upon

hunt thine own Soul to destroy it? The <note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 18.</note>

more holloo, and luer, and laugh, and sing, than when
they have delivered up their <hi>Soul,</hi> their Darling to
these Dogs; a thing that <hi>David</hi> trembled to think of,
when he cryed, <hi>Dogs have</hi>

               <hi>compassed me about; save
my darling, my Soul, from the Power of the Dog;</hi> thus
I say, he cryed, and yet <hi>these Dogs</hi> were but wicked
Men: But oh, how much is a Sin, a Lust, worse than
a Man to do us hurt; yea, worse than is a Dog, a
Lyon to hurt a Lamb!</p>
            <p>4. What are the signs and tokens that thou bearest
about thee concerning how it will go with thy Soul at
last? there are signs and tokens of a good, and signs
and tokens of a <note n="c" place="bottom">Phil. 1. 27, 28. Heb. 6. 9. Job 21. 29, 30. Isa. 3. 9.</note> had End that the Souls of Sinners

Soul, <hi>evident</hi> tokens of Salvation; and there are <hi>signs</hi>
of the Damnation of the Soul, <hi>evident</hi> signs of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi>
Now which of these hast thou? I cannot
stand here to shew thee which are which; but thy
Soul and its salvation lyeth before thee, <note n="d" place="bottom">The holy Bible.</note> and thou
hast the Book of Signs about these matters by thee;

up; <hi>Heaven</hi> into unspeakable and endless glory, or
<hi>Hell</hi> into unspeakable and endless torment. Yet,</p>
            <p>5. What are the pleasures and delights of thy
Soul now? are they things Divine, or things Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?
are they things Heavenly, or things Earthly?
are they things holy, or things unholy? for look

            <p>Wicked Men talk of Heaven, and say they hope

I say, what would they do there? why, just as they
do here, scatter their filthiness quite over the Face
of Heaven, and make it as vile as the Pit that the
Devils dwell in. Take holiness away out of Heaven,
and what is Heaven? I had rather be in Hell were there
none but holy ones there, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with wicked Men, God would quickly drive them out,
or forsake the place for their sakes; 'tis true they have
been Sinners, and none but Sinners that go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but they are washed; such were some of you,

and by the Spirit of our God. When the Maidens
were gathered together for the great King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi>
before they were brought to him into his Royal

               <hi>Months with Oyl of Myrrh, and Six Months
with sweet Odours and other things;</hi> and so came every
Maiden to the King. God also hath appointed, that
those that come into his Royal Presence, should first
go to the House of the Women, the Church, and
there receive of the Eunuchs things for purification,
things to <hi>make</hi>

               <hi>us meet to be partakers of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Saints in light:</hi> none can go from a state
of nature to glory, but <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5. 5. Rom. 9. 23.</note> by a state of grace; the
Lord gives grace and glory, hence he that goeth to
Heaven is said to be wrought for it, fitted, prepared
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 5. Again, Fifthly, Is it so? is the Soul such
an excellent thing, and is the Loss thereof so unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
great? Then this Doctrine commends those
for the wise ones, that above all business concern
themselves with the salvation of their Souls; those
that make all other matters but things by the bye,
and the salvation of their Soul, the one thing needful.
But, but few comparatively will be concerned with
this use, for where is he that doth this? <hi>Solomon</hi>
speaks of <note n="k" place="bottom">Eccl. 7. 28.</note> 
               <hi>one Man of a thousand:</hi> however some
there be, and blessed be God for some, but they
are they that are wise, yea wise in the Wisdom of
God:</p>
            <p>1. Because they reject what God hath rejected,
and that is sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:43327:65"/>
2. Because they esteem but little of that which
by the word is counted but of little esteem, and that
is the World.</p>
            <p>3. Because they chuse for a Portion that which
God commendeth unto us for that which is the most
excellent thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Himself, his Christ, his
Heaven, his Word, his Grace and Holiness: these
are the great and most excellent thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the things
that he hath chosen, that is truly wise for his Soul
(and all other wise Men are Fools in God's account,
and in the judgment of his word) and if it be so,
glory and bliss must needs be their portion, though
others shall miss thereof; <hi>The wise</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let me then incourage those that are of this mind
to be strong, and hold on their way, <hi>Soul</hi> thou hast

               <hi>is none like that, give it
me:</hi> Hold fast that thou hast, that no Man take thy
Crown. Oh! I admire this Wisdom, this is by the
direction of the Law-giver; this is by the teaching
of the blessed Spirit of God, not the Wisdom which
this World teacheth, nor the Wisdom which
the World, doth chuse, which comes to naught, surely
<note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 6.</note> thou hast seen something of the World to come,
and of the glory of it through faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surely God

they see, and thine Ears, for they hear.</p>
            <p>But who told thee that thy Soul was such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thing, as by thy practice thou declarest thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest
it to be? What, set more by thy Soul than by
all the World? What, cast a World behind thy back
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43327:66"/>
for the welfare of a Soul? is not this to play the Fool
in the account of Sinners, while Angels wonder at,
and rejoyce for thy wisdom.</p>
            <p>What a thing is this, that thy Soul and its welfare
should be more in thy esteem than all those glories
wherewith the Eyes of the World are dazled? surely
thou hast looked upon the Sun, and that makes Gold
look like a clod of Clay in thine Eye-sight.</p>
            <p>But who put the thoughts of the Excellencies of
the things that are Eternal? I say, who put the
thoughts of the Excellency of those things into thy
mind in this wanton Age, in an Age wherein the
thoughts of eternal Life, and the Salvation of the
Soul are with, and too many, like the <hi>Morrocco</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
and his Men, Men of strange Faces, in strange
Habits, with strange Gestures and Behaviours, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

            <p>But where hadst thou that heart that gives enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to these thoughts, these heavenly thoughts?
<hi>These</hi> thoughts are like the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
thence where they willingly would have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
how came they to thy House, to thy heart,
and to find entertainment in thy Soul? The Lord
keep them in every imagination of the thoughts of
thy heart for ever, and incline thine heart to seek
him more and more.</p>
            <p>And since the whole World have slighted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
and counted foolish the thoughts and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wherewith thy Soul is exercised; what strong
and mighty supporter is it upon, and with which
thou bearest up thy Spirit, and takest incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this thy folorn, unoccupied and singular way?
for so I dare say it is with the most; but certainly
it is something above thy self, and that is more
mighty to uphold thee than is the power, rage and
malice of all the World to cast thee down, or else thou

Glimpse thereof, do swallow up all the World that is here;
my heart also doth greatly desire to be exercised about the
thoughts of eternity, and I count my self never better than
when my poor heart is filled with them: as for the rage

I see so much of the sinful vileness of my nature, and feel

               <hi>Answ.</hi> This should because of humiliation, and
of self-abasement, but not of discouragement, for the

the Ladies as well as she that grinds at the
Mill, know what doth attend that Sex; and the
Gyants in grace, as well as the weak and shrubs, are
sensible of the same things, which thou layest in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy exercising of hope, or as matter of thy<note n="q" place="bottom">Psal. 77. 2.</note> discouragement; poor <hi>David</hi> says, his <hi>Soul</hi> refused
to be comforted upon this very account; and <hi>Paul</hi>
crys out under sense of this, <hi>O wretched Man that I

saying, <hi>Who</hi>

            <p>Again, This should drive us to faith in Christ,
for therefore are corruptions by divine permission,
still left in us to drive us to unbelief, but to faith, that
is, to look to the perfect righteousness of Christ

and faintness, as to my graces; my faith, my hope,
my love, and desires to these and all other Christian Duties
are weak: I am like the Man in the Dream, that would

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Weak graces are graces, weak graces
may grow stronger, but if the Iron be blunt,<note n="t" place="bottom">Eccl. 10. 10.</note> put to the more strength. 2. Christ seems to be

            <p>I come in the next place to a Use of <hi>Terror,</hi> and so
I shall conclude. Is it so? Is the Soul such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thing, and is the Loss thereof so unspeakably
great? Then this sheweth the sad state of those that
lose their Souls; we use to count those in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Condition, that by one only stroak, are stript
of their whole Estate; the Fire swept away all that
he had; or all that he had was in such a Ship, and
that Ship sunk into the bottom of the Sea; this is
sad news, this is heavy tidings, this is bewailed of
all, especially if such were great in the World, and
were brought by their loss from a high to a low, to
a very low Condition; but alas! what is this to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43327:68"/>
Loss about which we have been speaking all this
while? The Loss of an Estate may be repaired, or if
not, a Man may find Friends in his present deplorable
condition to his support, though not recovery: But
far will this be from him that shall lose his Soul. Ah!
he has lost his Soul, and can never be recovered again,
unless Hell-fire can comfort him; unless he can solace
himself in the fiery Indignation of God, terrors will
be upon him, anguish and sorrow will swallow him
up, because of present misery, slighted and set at

               </gap>ught by God and his Angels, he will also be in this
his miserable state, and this will add to sorrow, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and to his vexation of spirit, howling.</p>
            <p>To present you with Emblems of tormented Spirits,
or to draw before your eyes the Picture of Hell, are
things too light for so ponderous a Subject as this;
nor can any Man frame or invent words, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so deep and profound, sufficient to the Life to
set out the Torments of Hell. All those expressions
of Fire, Brimstone, the Lake of Fire, a fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
the bottomless Pit, and a hundred more to
boot, are all too short to set forth the Miseries of those
that shall be damned Souls: <hi>Who knows the Power</hi>
               <note n="y" place="bottom">Psal. 90. 11.</note>
               <hi>of God's Anger?</hi> none at all, and unless the Power
of that can be known, it must abide as unspeakable
as the Love of Christ which passeth knowledge.</p>
            <p>We hear it Thunder, we see it Lighten, yea, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses,
Comets and Blazing Stars, are all subject to
smite us with Terror; the thought of a Ghost, of
the appearing of a dead Wife, a dead Husband, or
the like, how terrible are these things! but alas,
what are these? meer Flea-bitings, nay not so bad,
when compared with the Torments of Hell. Guilt
and Despair, what are they, who understands them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43327:69"/>
unto perfection? the ireful looks of an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
what Mortal in the Land of the living can tell
us to the full, how dismal, and breaking to the Soul
of a Man it is, when it comes as from the Power of
Anger, and arises from the utmost Indignation? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
who knows of all the ways by which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
will inflict his just revenges upon the Souls of
damned Sinners? When <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up to the
third Heaven, he heard words that were unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and he that goes down to Hell, shall hear
groans that are unutterable. Hear, did I say? they
shall feel them, they shall feel them burst from their
wounded Spirits as Thunder-claps do from the
Clouds. Once I dreamed, that I saw two (whom I
knew) in Hell, and methought I saw a continual
dropping from Heaven, as of great drops of fire
lighting upon them to their sore distress. Oh! words
are wanting, thoughts are wanting, imagination and
fancy are poor things here: Hell is another kind of
place and state than any alive can think; and since
I am upon this subject, I will here treat a little of
<hi>Hell,</hi> as the Scriptures will give me leave, and the
rather, because I am upon a use of Terror. and<note n="z" place="bottom">Luke 16.</note>
because Hell is the place of Torment.</p>
            <p>1. Hell is said to be beneath, as Heaven is said to
be above, because as above signifieth the utmost<note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. 15. 24.</note>
joy, triumph, and felicity; so beneath is a term most
fit to describe the place of Hell by, because of the
utmost Opposition that is between these two, Hell
being the Place of the utmost Sorrow, Despair and
Misery, there are the Underlings ever trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Feet of God, they are beneath, below,
under.</p>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:43327:69"/>
2. Hell is said to be darkness, and Heaven is said<note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. 22. 13.</note>
to be light; light to shew the pleasureableness, and the
desirableness of Heaven; and darkness to shew the
dolesome and wearisomness of Hell; and how weary,
oh! how weary and wearisomly, as I may say, will
damned Souls turn themselves from side to side, from
place to place in Hell, while swallowed up in the
thickest Darkness, and griped with the burning
Thoughts of the endlesness of that most unutterable
Misery!</p>
            <p>3. Men are said to go up to Heaven, but they<note n="c" place="bottom">Ezek. 32. 17, 18, 19.</note>
are said to go down to Hell: up, because of exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and because they must abound in Beauty and
Glory that go to Heaven: down, because of those
sad dejections, that great deformity and vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
that sin hath brought them to, that go to
Hell.</p>

places in the Kingdom of Heaven, and also that
there are the Cells, or the Chambers of Death in
Hell. There are <hi>Mansions,</hi> or dwelling-places in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to shew that every one of them that go thither
might have his reward according to his work: and
that there is Hell, and the lowest Hell, and the
Chambers of death in Hell, to shew, there are places
and states in Hell too, for Sinners to be imprisoned<note n="h" place="bottom">Luke 20. 47.</note> in according to their faults; hence it is said of
some, These shall receive greater damnation, and of
others, That it shall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the Judgment than for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lowest Hell; how many Hells there are above
that, <note n="i" place="bottom">ch. 10. 12, 14.</note> or more tolerable tormenting places than
the most exquisite Torments there, God, and they
that are there know best, but degrees without doubt
there are: and the term [lowest] shews the utmost,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43327:70"/>
and most exquisite destress; so the Chambers of
death, the second death in Hell, for so I think the
Words should be understood, <hi>Her House is the way
(k) to Hell, going down to the Chambers of death:</hi> these
are the Chambers, that the Chambers in the Temple,
or that the dwelling-places in the House in Heaven
is opposed to, and this opposition shews, that as there
will be degrees of Glory in Heaven, so there will
of Torments in Hell; aud there is all reason for it,
since the Punishment must be inflicted by God, the
infinitely just. Why should a poor silly, ignorant
Man tho' damned, be punished with the same degree
of torment that he that has lived a thousand times
worse shall be punished with? It cannot be, Justice
will not admit it, Guilt and the Quality of the
Transgression will not admit it; yea, the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Fire
of Hell it self will not admit it; for if Hell-fire
can kindle upon nothing but Sin, and the Sinner
for the sake of it, and if Sin be as Oyl to that sire, as
the Holy Ghost seems to intimate, saying, <hi>Let it</hi>
               <note n="l" place="bottom">Prov. 7. 27.</note>
               <hi>come into his Bowels like Water, and like Oyl into his
Bones;</hi> then as the quantity of the Oyl is, so will the
fire burn, and so will the flaming Flame ascend, and
the smoak of their Torment for ever and ever. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a piece of Timber a little bedaubed with Oyl,
and another that hath been soaking in it many a year,
which of these two think you, would burn fiercest?
and whence would the flaming Flame ascend highest,
and make the most roaring noise? Suppose two Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
filled with Oyl, one containing the quantity of a
Pint, the other containing the quantity of a <hi>Hoggs-head,</hi>
and suppose that in one place they were both
set on fire, yet so that they might not intermix
<note n="m" place="bottom">Psal. 109. 17, 18.</note>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:43327:71"/>
flames; nay, though they did, yet all would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the most amazing, roaring flame would
be upon the biggest Vessel, and-would be the effect
of the greatest quantity of Oyl; so it will be with
the Wicked in Hell, the lowest-Hell is for the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Sinners, and theirs will be the greater Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the more intolerable Torment, though he
that has least of this Oyl of Sin in his Bones, and of
the kindlings of Hell fire upon him, will find he has
Hell enough, and will be weary enough thereof, for
still he must struggle with flames that are everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for Sin is such a thing that it can never be
burned out of the Soul and Body of a damned
Sinner.</p>
            <p>But again, having treated thus of Hell, we will
now speak a word or two of <hi>Sin,</hi> for that is it upon
which Hell-fire seizes, and so on the Soul by that.
<hi>Sin!</hi> it is the <hi>Sting</hi> of Hell, the Sting of Death is Sin:
by <hi>Death</hi> in this place, we must not understand that
which is natural, but that which is in Hell, the<note n="m" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note>
second death, even everlasting damnation, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
death the Saints die; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also many Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
without the least touch of a Sting from that;
but here is a Death that has a Sting to hurt, to twinge
and wound the Sinner with, even then when it has
the utmost Mastery of him. And this is the Death
that the saved are delivered from, not that which is
<note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 55. Eccl. 2: 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>natural,</hi> for that is the end of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but the <hi>second</hi> Death, the Death in Hell, for
that is the Portion of the Damned, and it is from
that that the Saints have a Promise of deliverance,<note n="o" place="bottom">Rev. 2. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43327:71"/>
Death:</hi> And again, <hi>Blessed and Holy is he that hath part
in the first Resurrection, on such the second Death hath no</hi>
               <note n="p" place="bottom">Chap. 20. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Power.</hi> It is this death then that hath the Chambers
to hold each damned Soul in, and Sin is the twining,
winding, biting, poysoning Sting of this Death, or
of these Chambers of Hell, for Sinners to be stricken,
stung, and pierced with. <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin.</hi>
Sin in the general of it is the Sting of Hell, for there
would be no such thing as Torment, even there, were
it not that <hi>Sin</hi> is there with <hi>Sinners:</hi> for as I have
hinted already, the Fire of Hell, the Indignation
and Wrath of God can fasten and kindle upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but for, or because of <hi>Sin;</hi> sin then as sin, is
the Sting, and the Hell of Hells, of the lowest and
upmost Hells. <hi>Sin</hi> I say, in the Nature of it, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as it is concluded both by God, and the Damned
to be a breach of his Holy Law, so it is the <hi>sting</hi> of
the second Death, which is the Worm of Hell. But
then, as <hi>Sin</hi> is such a <hi>Sting</hi> in it self, so it is heightned,
sharpned, and made more keen and sharp by those
Circumstances that, as concomitants attend it in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
act; for there is not a <hi>Sin</hi> at any time commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Man, but there is some circumstance or other
attends it, that makes it, when charged home by
God's Law, bigger and sharper, and more venom
and poysonous to the <hi>Soul,</hi> than if it could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
without them; and this is the <hi>Sting</hi> of the
Hornet, the great <hi>Sting.</hi> I sinned without a Cause, to
please a base Lust, to gratify the Devil; <hi>here is the
Sting:</hi> Again, I preferred <hi>Sin</hi> before Holiness, Death
before Life, <hi>Hell</hi> before <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> before
<hi>God,</hi> and Damnation before a Saviour; <hi>here is the
Sting:</hi> Again, I preferred moments before everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43327:72"/>
temporals before eternals, to be racked and
always slaying, before the Life that is blessed and
endless; <hi>here is the Sting:</hi> Also this I did against
light, against Convictions, against Conscience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
perswasion of Friends, Ministers, and the
godly Lives which I beheld in others; <hi>here is the
Sting:</hi> Also this I did against warnings, forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yea, though I saw others fall before my face
by the mighty Hand of God for committing of the
same; <hi>here is the Sting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners, would I could perswade you to hear me
out; A Man cannot commit a Sin, but by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of it, he doth by some circumstance or other,<note n="q" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> sharpen the Sting of Hell, and that to pierce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
through and through, and through with many
sorrows; Also the Sting of Hell to some will be, that
the Damnation of others stand upon their score; for
that by imitating of them, by being deluded by them,
perswaded by them, drawn in by them, they perish
in Hell for ever, and hence it is, <hi>That these principal
Sinners must dye all these deaths in themselves, that those
damned ones, that they have drawn into Hell, are also
to bear in their own Souls for ever.</hi> And this God
threatned to the Prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> that capital <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
because by his pride, power, practice and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he cast down others into the Pit, therefore saith

Deaths of the Vncircumcised by the Hand of Strangers,
for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.</hi> Ah! this will
