         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>PRejudice over rules and ſways
a World of People; and there
is no queſtion but this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will meet with a great deal.
There are ſome perhaps may cenſure it
with an <hi>Infandum Regina jubes—</hi>
Bigots to ſomething, but they know
not what; nor is it in their Nature
to examine the Reaſons of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy.
For after the exacteſt Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
that can be made, there is nothing
to be met with in the following Sheets,
not wreſted by Tyrannical <hi>Innuendo's,</hi>
that can give the leaſt Offence; unleſs
good Latin made good <hi>Engliſh</hi> be a
<pb facs="tcp:60630:3"/>
Crime. Here are no diſcuſſions, which
of the Contending Parties were in the
Right; no Juſtifications of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous,
nor Concluſions from Succeſs.
Here are only bare Matters of Fact,
abſtracted from the Domeſtick Broils,
and Civil Diſſentions of thoſe Times.
It only appears from hence, that a
Certain Party of People, having by
Victory obtained the Supream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdom, took the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Methods of Prudence and Policy
to ſtrengthen themſelves abroad, by
Leagues and Amities with Foreign
Princes. Whatever they had done
at home, they paid to all the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Monarchs and Potentates, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which became 'em: yet were
they not ſo puſillanimouſly forward
neither to court Forreign Friendſhip,
or to conclude any Treaties but to
the Advantage of the Nation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe Maxims which they
profeſſed; and how ſevere ſoever they
were to thoſe they believed their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
within dors, both the one and
<pb facs="tcp:60630:3"/>
the other were moſt careful, not to
ſuffer the Merchants to be abuſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
if either Force or Interceſſion
could prevail. Then, for the Honour
of thoſe People, who had in thoſe
times ſucceſſively Vſurp'd the Supream
Authority of the Nation, nothing more
plainly diſcovers it then the different
Style of the enſuing Letters: for
Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> is not to be thought to
have Written his own Senſe, but
what was dictated to him by his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
The Language of the Long
Parliament was more Imperious and
downright; <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Vein more full
of Cants; and where he concluded with
Threats, he began with Godly Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations.
In the laſt place, to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Truth of thoſe Tranſactions
to which theſe following Letters have
Relation, would be a Soleciſm which
Ignorance it ſelf would be aſhamed to
own. The Dates, the Subſcriptions,
Superſcriptions, render every thing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.
So that were it only for
their Character of Truth which muſt
<pb facs="tcp:60630:4"/>
be allow'd 'em, that alone is ſufficient
to recommend 'em to Poſterity: at
leaſt to thoſe who may be ambitious to
be the Engliſh <hi>Thuanus</hi>'s of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages, to whom the Verity of theſe
Letters will be a uſeful Clue, ſo far
as it reaches, to guide them through
the Labyrinth of forgotten ſtory. <hi>Hony

Vogue and Eſteem among the Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Reading part of Mankind. The
moſt Eminent in this way of Hiſtory were
among the Ancients, <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Diogenes
Laertius</hi> of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> the firſt wrote the
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:60630:5"/>

of conſiderable Note, the Great

Pen; <hi>viz.</hi> The Noble Philoſopher
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> and the moſt politely Learned Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo
of his Age, his Country-man, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Periesk.</hi> And pitty it is the Perſon
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:60630:5"/>
whoſe memory we have here undertaken
to perpetuate by recounting the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Tranſactions of his Life, (though
his Works ſufficiently recommend him to
the World) finds not a well-informed Pen
able to ſet him forth, equal with the beſt
of thoſe here mentioned; for doubtleſs
had his Fame been as much ſpread through
<hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Thuanus</hi>'s time as now it is, and
hath been for ſeveral Years, he had juſtly
merited from that Great Hiſtorian, an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
not inferiour to the higheſt, by him
given to all the Learned and Ingenious
that liv'd within the compaſs of his Hiſtory.
For we may ſafely and juſtly affirm, that
take him in all reſpects, for Acumen of
Wit, Quickneſs of Apprehenſion, Sagacity
of Judgement, Depth of Argument, and
Elegancy of Style, as well in <hi>Latin</hi> as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
as well in Verſe as Proſe, he is ſcarce
to be parallel'd by any the beſt of Writers
our Nation hath in any Age brought forth.
He was Born in <hi>London,</hi> in a Houſe in
<hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> the Leaſe whereof, as I take it,
but for certain it was a Houſe in <hi>Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
became in time part of his Eſtate
in the Year of our Lord, 1606. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>John Milton,</hi> an Honeſt, Worthy, and
Subſtantial Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> by Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Scrivener, to which Profeſſion he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60630:6"/>
betook himſelf, by the advice and
aſſiſtance of an intimate Friend of his,
Eminent in that Calling, upon his being
caſt out by his Father, a bigotted <hi>Roman
Catholick,</hi> for embracing, when Young,
the Proteſtant Faith, and abjuring the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Tenets; for he is ſaid to have been
Deſcended of an Ancient Family of the
<hi>Miltons,</hi> of <hi>Milton,</hi> near <hi>Abington</hi> in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi>
where they had been a long time
ſeated, as appears by the Monuments ſtill
to be ſeen in <hi>Milton</hi>-Church, till one of the
Family having taken the wrong ſide, in
the Conteſts between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi>
and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> was ſequeſtred of all his
Eſtate, but what he held by his Wife.
However, certain it is, that this Vocation
he followed for many Years, at his ſaid
Houſe in <hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> with ſucceſs ſuitable
to his Induſtry, and prudent conduct of
his Affairs; yet did he not ſo far quit his
own Generous and Ingenious Inclinations,
as to make himſelf wholly a Slave to the
World; for he ſometimes found vacant
hours to the Study (which he made his
recreation) of the Noble Science of Muſick,
in which he advanc'd to that perfection,
that as I have been told, and as I take
it, by our Author himſelf, he Compoſed an
<hi>In Nomine</hi> of Forty Parts: for which he
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:60630:6"/>
was rewarded with a Gold Medal and
Chain by a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Prince, to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it. However, this is a truth not to
be denied, that for ſeveral Songs of his
Compoſition, after the way of theſe times,
three or four of which are ſtill to be ſeen
in Old <hi>Wilby</hi>'s ſet of Ayres, beſides ſome
Compoſitions of his in <hi>Ravenſcrofs</hi> Pſalms,
he gained the Reputation of a conſiderable
Maſter in this moſt charming of all the
Liberal Sciences: Yet all this while, he
managed his Grand Affair of this World
with ſuch Prudence and Diligence, that
by the aſſiſtance of Divine Providence
favouring his honeſt endeavours, he gained a
Competent Eſtate, whereby he was enabled
to make a handſom Proviſion both for
the Education and Maintenance of his
Children; for three he had, and no more,
all by one Wife, <hi>Sarah,</hi> of the Family of
the <hi>Caſtons,</hi> derived originally from <hi>Wales.</hi>
A Woman of Incomparable Vertue and
Goodneſs; <hi>John</hi> the Eldeſt, the Subject
of our preſent Work. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and an
onely Daughter <hi>Ann; Chriſtopher</hi> being prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
deſigned for the Study of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law of <hi>England,</hi> was Entered Young a
Student of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> of which Houſe
he lived to be an Ancient Bencher, and
keeping cloſe to that Study and Profeſſion
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:60630:7"/>
all his Life-time, except in the time of the
Civil Wars of <hi>England;</hi> when being a
great favourer and aſſertor of the King's
Cauſe, and Obnoxious to the Parliament's
ſide, by acting to his utmoſt power againſt
them, ſo long as he kept his Station at
<hi>Reading;</hi> and after that Town was taken
by the Parliament Forces, being forced to
quit his Houſe there, he ſteer'd his courſe
according to the Motion of the King's Army.</p>
            <p>But when the War was ended with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
and Succeſs to the Parliament Party,
by the Valour of General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and
the Craft and Conduct of <hi>Cromwell;</hi> and
his compoſition made by the help of his
Brother's Intereſt, with the then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power; he betook himſelf again to
his former Study and Profeſſion, following
Chamber-Practice every Term, yet came
to no Advancement in the World in a long
time, except ſome ſmall Employ in the
Town of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> where (and near it)
he lived all the latter time of his Life.
For he was a perſon of a modeſt quiet
temper, preferring Juſtice and Vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Worldly Pleaſure or Grandeur:
but in the beginning of the Reign of K.
<hi>James</hi> the II. for his known Integrity
and Ability in the Law, he was by ſome
Perſons of Quality recommended to the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:60630:7"/>
King, and at a Call of Serjeants received
the Coif, and the ſame day was Sworn one
of the Barons of the Exchequer, and ſoon
after made one of the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pleas; but his Years and Indiſpoſition
not well brooking the Fatigue of publick
Imployment, he continued not long in
either of theſe Stations, but having his
<hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> retired to a Country Life, his
Study and Devotion. <hi>Ann,</hi> the onely
Daughter of the ſaid <hi>John Milton</hi> the Elder,
had a conſiderable Dowry given her by her
Father, in Marriage with <hi>Edward Philips,</hi>
(the Son of <hi>Edward Philips</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,)</hi>
who coming up Young to Town, was
bred up in the Crown-Office in Chancery,
and at length came to be Secondary of the

            <p>But to haſten back to our matter in hand;
<hi>John</hi> our Author, who was deſtin'd to be
the Ornament and Glory of his Countrey,
was ſent, together with his Brother, to
<hi>Paul</hi>'s School, whereof Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> the Elder
was then Chief Maſter; where he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the firſt Rudiments of Learning,
and advanced therein with that admirable
Succeſs, not more by the Diſcipline of the
School and good Inſtructions of his Maſters,
(for that he had another Maſter poſſibly
at his Father's houſe, appears by the Fourth
Elegy of his Latin Poems written in his
18th year, to <hi>Thomas Young</hi> Paſtor of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company of Merchants at <hi>Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
wherein he owns and ſtiles him his
Maſter) than by his own happy Genius,
prompt Wit and Apprehenſion, and inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
Induſtry; for he generally ſate up
half the Night, as well in voluntary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of his own choice, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
perfecting of his School-Exerciſes: So
that at the Age of 15 he was full ripe for
Academick Learning, and accordingly was
ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
where in <hi>Chriſt's College,</hi> under the Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a very Eminent Learned man,
whoſe Name I cannot call to mind, he
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:60630:8"/>
Studied Seven years, and took his Degree
of Maſter of Arts; and for the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wit and Reading he had ſhown in his
Performances to attain his Degree, (ſome
whereof ſpoken at a Vacation-Exerciſe in
his 19th. year of Age, are to be yet ſeen in
his Miſcellaneous Poems) he was lov'd
and admir'd by the whole Univerſity, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by the Fellows and moſt Ingenious
Perſons of his Houſe. Among the reſt
there was a Young Gentleman, one
Mr. <hi>King,</hi> with whom, for his great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Parts he had contracted a particular
Friendſhip and Intimacy; whoſe death
(for he was drown'd on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas in his
paſſage from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to <hi>Ireland)</hi> he bewails
in that moſt excellent Monody in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Poems) Intituled <hi>Lycidas.</hi> Never
was the loſs of Friend ſo Elegantly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and among the reſt of his Juvenile
Poems, ſome he wrote at the Age of 15,
which contain a Poetical Genius ſcarce to
be parallel'd by any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writer. Soon
after he had taken his Maſter's Degree, he
thought fit to leave the Univerſity: Not
upon any diſguſt or diſcontent for want of
Preferment, as ſome Ill-willers have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
nor upon any cauſe whatſoever forc'd
to flie, as his Detractors maliciouſly feign;
but from which aſperſion he ſufficiently
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:60630:9"/>
clears himſelf in his Second Anſwer to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Morus,</hi> the Author of a Book call'd,
<hi>Clamor Regii Sanguinis ad Caelum,</hi> the chief
of his Calumniators; in which he plainly
makes it out, that after his leaving the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
to the no ſmall trouble of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Collegiates,
who in general regretted
his Abſence, he for the ſpace of Five years
lived for the moſt part with his Father and
Mother at their houſe at <hi>Horton</hi> near <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
in <hi>Barkſhire;</hi> whither his Father,
having got an Eſtate to his content, and
left off all buſineſs, was retir'd from the
Cares and Fatigues of the world. After
the ſaid term of Five years, his Mother
then dying, he was willing to add to his
acquired Learning the obſervation of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Cuſtoms, Manners, and Inſtitutions;
and thereupon took a reſolution to Travel,
more eſpecially deſigning for <hi>Italy;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
with his Father's Conſent and
Aſſiſtance, he put himſelf into an Equipage
ſuitable to ſuch a Deſign; and ſo intending
to go by the way of <hi>France,</hi> he ſet out for
<hi>Paris</hi> accompanied onely with one Man,
who attended him through all his Travels;
for his Prudence was his Guide, and his
Learning his Introduction and Preſentation
to Perſons of moſt Eminent Quality. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he had alſo a moſt Civil and Obliging
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:60630:9"/>
Letter of Direction and Advice from
Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi> then Provoſt of <hi>Eaton,</hi>
and formerly Reſident Embaſſador from
King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt to the State of <hi>Venice;</hi>
which Letter is to be ſeen in the Firſt Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Miſcellaneous Poems. At <hi>Paris</hi>
being Recommended by the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry</hi>
and other Perſons of Quality, he went
firſt to wait upon my Lord <hi>Scudamore,</hi> then
Embaſſador in <hi>France</hi> from King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt. My Lord receiv'd him with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Civility; and underſtanding he had a
deſire to make a Viſit to the great <hi>Hugo
Grotius,</hi> he ſent ſeveral of his Attendants to
wait upon him, and to preſent him in his
Name to that Renowned Doctor and
Stateſman, who was at that time Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
from <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to the
<hi>French</hi> King. <hi>Grotius</hi> took the Viſit kindly,
and gave him Entertainment ſuitable to his
Worth, and the high Commendations he
had heard of him. After a few days, not
intending to make the uſual Tour of <hi>France,</hi>
he took his leave of my Lord, who at his
departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> gave him Letters to
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants reſiding in any part
through which he was to Travel, in which
they were requeſted to ſhew him all the
Kindneſs, and do him all the Good Offices
that lay in their Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:60630:10"/>
From <hi>Paris</hi> he haſtened on his Journey
to <hi>Nicaea,</hi> where he took Shipping, and in
a ſhort ſpace arrived at <hi>Genoa;</hi> from whence
he went to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> thence to <hi>Piſa,</hi> and ſo
to <hi>Florence:</hi> In this City he met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
charming Objects, which Invited him
to ſtay a longer time then he intended;
the pleaſant Scituation of the Place, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of the Structures, the exact Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Civility of the Inhabitants,
the more Polite and Refined ſort of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
there, than elſewhere. During the
time of his ſtay here, which was about
Two Months, he Viſited all the private
Academies of the City, which are Places
eſtabliſh'd for the improvement of Wit and
Learning, and maintained a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and perpetual Friendſhip among
Gentlemen fitly qualified for ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution:
and ſuch ſort of Academies there
are in all or moſt of the moſt noted Cities
in <hi>Italy.</hi> Viſiting theſe Places, he was ſoon
taken notice of by the moſt Learned and
Ingenious of the Nobility, and the Grand
Wits of <hi>Florence,</hi> who careſs'd him with
all the Honours and Civilities imaginable,
particularly <hi>Jacobo Gaddi, Carolo Dati, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
Francini, Freſcobaldo, Cultelino, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matthei</hi>
and <hi>Clementillo:</hi> Whereof <hi>Gaddi</hi> hath
a large Elegant <hi>Italian Canzonet</hi> in his Praiſe:
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:60630:10"/>
               <hi>Dati,</hi> a Latin Epiſtle; both Printed before
his Latin Poems, together with a Latin
Diſtich of the Marqueſs of <hi>Villa,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Selvaggi,</hi> and a Latin <hi>Tetraſtick</hi> of
<hi>Giovanni Salſilli</hi> a <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Florence</hi> he took his Journey to
<hi>Siena,</hi> from thence to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he
was detain'd much about the ſame time he
had been at <hi>Florence;</hi> as well by his deſire
of ſeeing all the Rarities and Antiquities of
that moſt Glorious and Renowned City,
as by the Converſation of <hi>Lucas Holſtenius,</hi>
and other Learned and Ingenious men;
who highly valued his Acquaintance, and
treated him with all poſſible Reſpect.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Rome</hi> he Travelled to <hi>Naples,</hi> where
he was introduced by a certain Hermite,
who accompanied him in his Journey from
<hi>Rome</hi> thither, into the Knowledge of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni
Baptiſta Manſo,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Villa,</hi> a
<hi>Neapolitan</hi> by Birth, a Perſon of high Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Vertue, and Honour, to whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Italian</hi> Poet, <hi>Torquato Taſſo,</hi> Wrote
his Treatiſe <hi>de Amicitia;</hi> and moreover
mentions him with great Honour in that
Illuſtrious Poem of his, Intituled, <hi>Gieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emme
Liberata:</hi> This Noble Marqueſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with extraordinary Reſpect and
Civility, and went with him himſelf to
give him a ſight of all that was of Note
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:60630:11"/>
and Remark in the City, particularly the
Viceroys Palace, and was often in Perſon
to Viſit him at his Lodging. Moreover,
this Noble Marqueſs honoured him ſo far,
as to make a Latin Diſtich in his Praiſe, as
hath been already mentiontd; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſs pithy then ſhort, though already
in Print, it will not be unworth the while
here to repeat.</p>
            <l>Vt Mens, Forma, Decor, Facies, ſi<note n="*" place="bottom">This word relates to his being a Proteſtant not a <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick.</note> Pietas,
ſic,</l>
            <l>Non Anglus Verum Hercle Angelus ipſe
foret.</l>
            <p>In return of this Honour, and in gratitude
for the many Favours and Civilities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, he preſented him at his
departure with a large Latin Eclogue, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<hi>Manſus,</hi> afterward's Publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Latin Poems. The Marqueſs at
his taking leave of him gave him this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
That he would have done him
many more Offices of Kindneſs and Civility,
but was therefore rendered incapable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he had been over-liberal in his ſpeech
againſt the Religion of the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:60630:11"/>
He had entertain'd ſome thoughts of
paſſing over into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> but was
diverted by the News he receiv'd from
<hi>England,</hi> that Affairs there were tending
towards a Civil War; thinking it a thing
unworthy in him to be taking his Pleaſure in
Foreign Parts, while his Countreymen at
home were Fighting for their Liberty: But
firſt reſolv'd to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> once more; and
though the Merchants gave him a caution
that the Jeſuits were hatching deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, in caſe he ſhould return thither,
by reaſon of the freedom he took in all his
diſcourſes of Religion; nevertheleſs he
ventured to proſecute his Reſolution, and
to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond time he went, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with himſelf not induſtriouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to fall into any Diſcourſe about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but, being ask'd, not to deny or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to conceal his own Sentiments;
Two Months he ſtaid at <hi>Rome;</hi> and in all that
time never flinch'd, but was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Orthodox Faith againſt all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers;
and ſo well he ſucceeded therein, that
Good Providence guarding him, he went
ſafe from <hi>Rome</hi> back to <hi>Florence,</hi> where his
return to his Friends of that City was
welcomed with as much Joy and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as had it been to his Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in his own Countrey, he could not
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:60630:12"/>
have come a more joyful and welcome
Gueſt. Here, having ſtaid as long as at his
ſtrfi coming, excepting an excurſion of a few
days to <hi>Luca,</hi> croſſing the <hi>Apennine,</hi> and
paſſing through <hi>Bononia</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Venice,</hi> where when he had ſpent a
Month's time in viewing of that Stately
City, and Shipp'd up a Parcel of curious and
rare Books which he had pick'd up in his
Travels; particularly a Cheſt or two of
choice Muſick-books of the beſt Maſters
flouriſhing about that time in <hi>Italy,</hi> namely,
<hi>Luca Marenzo, Monte Verde, Horatio Vecchi,
Cifa,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Venoſa</hi> and ſeveral others,
he took his courſe through <hi>Verona, Milan,</hi>
and the <hi>Poenine Alps,</hi> and ſo by the Lake
<hi>Leman</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he ſtaid for
ſome time, and had daily converſe
with the moſt Learned <hi>Giovanni Deodati,</hi>
Theology-Profeſſor in that City, and ſo
returning through <hi>France,</hi> by the ſame way
he had paſſed it going to <hi>Italy,</hi> he, after
a Peregrination of one compleat Year and
about Three Months, arrived ſafe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
about the time of the Kings making
his ſecond Expedition againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>
Soon after his return, and viſits paid to
his Father and other Friends, he took him
a Lodging in S. <hi>Brides</hi> Church-yard, at
the Houſe of one <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a Taylor, where
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:60630:12"/>
he firſt undertook the Education and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of his Siſter's two Sons, the
Younger whereof had been wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Charge and Care. And here
by the way, I judge it not impertinent
to mention the many Authors both of
the Latin and Greek, which through his
excellent judgment and way of Teaching,
far above the Pedantry of common pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Schools (where ſuch Authors are
ſcarce ever heard of) were run over within
no greater compaſs of time, then from
Ten to Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age.
Of the Latin the four Grand Authors, <hi>De
Re Ruſtica, Cato, Varro, Columella,</hi> and
<hi>Palladius; Cornelius Celſus,</hi> an Ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
of the <hi>Romans;</hi> a great part of <hi>Pliny's</hi>
Natural Hiſtory, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> his Architecture,
<hi>Frontinus</hi> his Stratagems, with the two
Egregious Poets, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> and <hi>Manilius.</hi>
Of the Greek; <hi>Heſiod,</hi> a Poet equal with
<hi>Homer; Aratus</hi> his <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and <hi>Dioſemeia,
Dionyſius Afer de ſitu Orbis, Oppian's Cyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticks
&amp; Halieuticks. Quintus Calaber</hi> his
Poem of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, continued from
<hi>Homer; Apollonius, Rhodius</hi> his Argonuticks,
and in Proſe, <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Placita Philoſophorum
&amp;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Geminus</hi>'s Aſtronomy;
<hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyri Inſtitutio &amp; Anabaſis, Aelians
Tacticks,</hi> and <hi>Polyaenus</hi> his Warlike Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems;
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:60630:13"/>
thus by teaching he in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
increaſed his own knowledge, having
the reading of all theſe Authors as it were
by Proxy; and all this might poſſibly have
conduced to the preſerving of his Eye-ſight,
had he not, moreover, been perpetually
buſied in his own Laborious Undertakings
of the Book or Pen. Nor did the time thus
Studiouſly imployed in conquering the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, hinder the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the chief Oriental Languages, <hi>viz.</hi>
The <hi>Hebrew, Caldee</hi> and <hi>Syriac,</hi> ſo far as
to go through the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or Five Books
of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> to make a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the <hi>Targum</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe,
and to underſtand ſeveral Chapters
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the <hi>Syriac</hi> Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an Introduction into ſeveral Arts and
Sciences, by Reading <hi>Vrſtiſius</hi> his Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
<hi>Riffs</hi> Geometry, <hi>Petiſcus</hi> his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry,
<hi>Joannes de Sacro Boſco de Sphaera;</hi>
and into the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Tongues,
by reading in <hi>Italian, Giovan Villani's</hi>
Hiſtory of the Tranſactions between ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
petty States of <hi>Italy;</hi> and in <hi>French</hi>
a great part of <hi>Pierre Davity,</hi> the famous
Geographer of <hi>France</hi> in his time. The
<hi>Sunday</hi>'s work was for the moſt part the
Reading each day a Chapter of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Teſtament, and hearing his Learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:60630:13"/>
upon the ſame, (and how this
ſavoured of Atheiſm in him, I leave to
the courteous Backbiter to judge). The
next work after this, was the writing
from his own dictation, ſome part, from
time to time, of a Tractate which he
thought fit to collect from the ableſt of
Divines, who had written of that Subject;
<hi>Ameſius, Wollebius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> A perfect
Syſtem of Divinity, of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Now perſons ſo far Manuducted
into the higheſt paths of Literature both
Divine and Human, had they received
his documents with the ſame Acuteneſs of
Wit and Apprehenſion, the ſame Induſtry,
Alacrity, and Thirſt after Knowledge, as
the Inſtructer was indued with, what
Prodigies of Wit and Learning might they
have proved! the Scholars might in ſome
degree have come near to the equalling of
the Maſter, or at leaſt have in ſome ſort
made good what he ſeems to predict in
the cloſe of an Elegy he made in the
Seventeenth Year of his Age, upon the
Death of one of his Siſter's Children (a
Daughter) who died in her Infancy.</p>

            <l>This if thou do, he will an Offspring give,</l>
            <l>That to the Worlds laſt end, ſhall make thy Name to live.</l>
            <p>But to return to the Thread of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
he made no long ſtay in his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in St. <hi>Brides</hi> Church-yard; neceſſity
of having a place to diſpoſe his Books in,
and other Goods fit for the furniſhing of
a good handſome Houſe, haſtning him to
take one; and accordingly a pretty Garden-Houſe
he took in <hi>Alderſgate</hi>-Street, at the
end of an Entry; and therefore the fitter
for his turn, by the reaſon of the Privacy,
beſides that there are few Streets in <hi>London</hi>
more free from Noiſe then that.</p>
            <p>Here firſt it was that his Academick
Erudition was put in practice, and
Vigorouſly proceeded, he himſelf giving
an Example to thoſe under him, (for it
was not long after his taking this Houſe,
e're his Elder Nephew was put to Board
with him alſo) of hard Study, and ſpare
Diet; only this advantage he had, that once
in three Weeks or a Month, he would
drop into the Society of ſome Young Sparks
of his Acquaintance, the chief whereof
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:60630:14"/>
were Mr. <hi>Alphry,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Miller,</hi> two
Gentlemen of <hi>Gray</hi>'s-Inn, the <hi>Beau</hi>'s of
thoſe Times, but nothing near ſo bad as thoſe
now-a-days; with theſe Gentlemen he
would ſo far make bold with his Body, as
now and then to keep a Gawdy day.</p>
            <p>In this Houſe he continued ſeveral Years,
in the one or two firſt whereof, he ſet
out ſeveral Treatiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi>
that againſt <hi>Prelatical Epiſcopacy;</hi>
The <hi>Reaſon of Church-Government;</hi> The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Smectimnuus,</hi> at leaſt the greateſt
part of them, but as I take it, all; and
ſome time after, one Sheet of Education,
which he Dedicated to Mr. <hi>Samuel Hartlib,</hi>
he that wrote ſo much of Husbandry; this
Sheet is Printed at the end of the Second
Edition of his Poems; and laſtly, <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagitica.</hi>
During the time alſo of his
continuance in this Houſe, there fell out
ſeveral Occaſions of the Increaſing of
his Family. His Father, who till the taking
of <hi>Reading</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Forces,
had lived with his other Son at his Houſe
there, was upon that Son's diſſettlement ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to betake himſelf to this his
Eldeſt Son, with whom he lived for ſome
Years, even to his Dying Day. In the
next place he had an Addition of ſome
Scholars; to which may be added, his
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:60630:15"/>
entring into Matrimony; but he had his
Wife's company ſo ſmall a time, that he may
well be ſaid to have become a ſingle man
again ſoon after. About <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> it
was, or a little after, that he took a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into the Country; no body about
him certainly knowing the Reaſon, or
that it was any more than a Journey of
Recreation: after a Month's ſtay, home he
returns a Married-man, that went out a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor;
his Wife being <hi>Mary</hi> the Eldeſt
Daughter of Mr. <hi>Richard Powell,</hi> then a
Juſtice of Peace, of <hi>Forreſthil,</hi> near <hi>Shotover</hi>
in <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> ſome few of her neareſt
Relations accompanying the Bride to her
new Habitation; which by reaſon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nor any body elſe were yet come, was
able to receive them; where the Feaſting
held for ſome days in Celebration of the
Nuptials, and for entertainment of the
Bride's Friends. At length they took their
leave, and returning to <hi>Forreſthill,</hi> left the
Siſter behind; probably not much to her
ſatisfaction; as appeared by the Sequel;
by that time ſhe had for a Month or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
led a Philoſophical Life, (after having
been uſed to a great Houſe, and much
Company and Joviality) Her Friends,
poſſibly incited by her own deſire, made
earneſt ſuit by Letter, to have her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:60630:15"/>
the remaining part of the Summer,
which was granted, on condition of her
return at the time appointed, <hi>Michalemas,</hi>
or thereabout: In the mean time came
his Father, and ſome of the foremention'd
Diſciples. And now the Studies went on
with ſo much the more Vigour, as there
were more Hands and Heads employ'd;
the Old Gentleman living wholly retired
to his Reſt and Devotion, without the leaſt
trouble imaginable: Our Author, now as
it were a ſingle man again, made it his
chief diverſion now and then in an Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to viſit the Lady <hi>Margaret Lee,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the—<hi>Lee,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marlborough,</hi>
Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of the Privy Councel to King <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt. This Lady being a Woman of
great Wit and Ingenuity, had a particular
Honour for him, and took much delight
in his Company, as likewiſe her Husband
Captain <hi>Hobſon,</hi> a very Accompliſh'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman;
and what Eſteem he at the ſame
time had for Her, appears by a Sonnet he
made in praiſe of her, to be ſeen among
his other Sonnets in his Extant Poems. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalemas</hi>
being come, and no news of his
Wife's return, he ſent for her by Letter,
and receiving no anſwer, ſent ſeveral other
Letters, which were alſo unanſwered; ſo
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:60630:16"/>
that at laſt he diſpatch'd down a Foot-Meſſenger
with a Letter, deſiring her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
but the Meſſenger came back not
only without an anſwer, at leaſt a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
one, but to the beſt of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
reported that he was diſmiſſed
with ſome ſort of Contempt; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
in all probability, was grounded
upon no other Cauſe but this, namely,
That the Family being generally addicted
to the Cavalier Party, as they called it,
and ſome of them poſſibly ingaged in the
King's Service, who by this time had his
Head Quarters at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was in ſome
Proſpect of Succeſs, they began to repent
them of having Matched the Eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Family to a Perſon ſo contrary
to them in Opinion; and thought it would
be a blot in their Eſcutcheon, when ever
that Court ſhould come to Flouriſh again;
however, it ſo incenſed our Author, that
he thought it would be diſhonourable
ever to receive her again, after ſuch a
repulſe; ſo that he forthwith prepared to
Fortify himſelf with Arguments for ſuch
a Reſolution, and accordingly wrote two
Treatiſes, by which he undertook to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
That it was againſt Reaſon (and the
enjoynment of it not proveable by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
for any Married Couple diſagreeable
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:60630:16"/>
in Humour and Temper, or having an
averſion to each, to be forc'd to live yok'd
together all their Days. The firſt was,
His Doctrine and Diſcipline of Divorce;
of which there was Printed a Second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with ſome Additions. The other
in proſecution of the firſt, was ſtyled, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trachordon.</hi>
Then the better to confirm
his own Opinion, by the atteſtation of
others, he ſet out a Piece called the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> a Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
being a Tranſlation, out of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Divine, of ſome part of his Works,
exactly agreeing with him in Sentiment.
Laſtly, he wrote in anſwer to a Pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Clerk, who would needs give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Honour of Writing againſt ſo
great a Man, His Colaſterion or Rod of
Correction for a Sawcy Impertinent. Not
very long after the ſetting forth of theſe
Treatiſes, having application made to him
by ſeveral Gentlemen of his acquaintance,
for the Education of their Sons, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
haply the Progreſs he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
by his firſt undertakings of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he laid out for a larger Houſe, and
ſoon found it out; but in the interim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he removed, there fell out a paſſage,
which though it altered not the whole
Courſe he was going to Steer, yet it put a
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:60630:17"/>
ſtop or rather an end to a grand Affair,
which was more than probably thought
to be then in agitation: It was indeed a
deſign of Marrying one of Dr. <hi>Davis</hi>'s
Daughters, a very Handſome and Witty
Gentlewoman, but averſe as it is ſaid to
this Motion; however, the Intelligence
hereof, and the then declining State of
the King's Cauſe, and conſequently of the
Circumſtances of Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi>'s Family,
cauſed them to ſet all Engines on Work,
to reſtore the late Married Woman to
the Station wherein they a little before
had planted her; at laſt this device was
pitch'd upon. There dwelt in the Lane
of St. <hi>Martins-L-Grand,</hi> which was hard by,
a Relation of our Author's, one <hi>Blackborough,</hi>
whom it was known he often viſited, and
upon this occaſion the viſits were the
more narrowly obſerv'd, and poſſibly
there might be a Combination between
both Parties; the Friends on both ſides
concentring in the ſame action though on
different behalfs. One time above the
reſt, he making his uſual viſit, the Wife
was ready in another Room, and on a
ſudden he was ſurpriſed to ſee one whom
he thought to have never ſeen more,
making Submiſſion and begging Pardon on
her Knees before him; he might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:60630:17"/>
at firſt make ſome ſhew of averſion and
rejection; but partly his own generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
more inclinable to Reconciliation
than to perſeverance in Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and partly the ſtrong interceſſion
of Friends on both ſides, ſoon brought
him to an Act of Oblivion, and a firm
League of Peace for the future; and it was
at length concluded, That ſhe ſhould remain
at a Friend's houſe, till ſuch time as he was
ſettled in his New houſe at <hi>Barbican,</hi> and all
things for her reception in order; the
place agreed on for her preſent abode, was
the Widow <hi>Webber</hi>'s houſe in St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s
Church-yard, whoſe Second Daughter had
been Married to the other Brother many
years before; the firſt fruits of her return
to her Husband was a brave Girl, born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a year after; though, whether by ill
Conſtitution, or want of Care, ſhe grew
more and more decrepit. But it was not
only by Children that ſhe increas'd the
number of the Family, for in no very long
time after her coming, ſhe had a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
of her Kindred with her in the Houſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> her Father and Mother, and ſeveral of
her Brothers and Siſters, which were in all
pretty Numerous; who upon his Father's
Sickning and Dying ſoon after went away.
And now the Houſe look'd again like a
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:60630:18"/>
Houſe of the Muſes only, tho the acceſſion
of Scholars was not great. Poſſibly his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
thus far in the Education of Youth
may have been the occaſion of ſome of his
Adverſaries calling him Paedagogue and
Schoolmaſter: Whereas it is well known he
never ſet up for a Publick School to teach
all the young Fry of a Pariſh, but only was
willing to impart his Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to Relations, and the Sons of ſome
Gentlemen that were his intimate Friends;
beſides, that neither his Converſe, nor his
Writings, nor his manner of Teaching ever
ſavour'd in the leaſt any thing of Pedantry;
and probably he might have ſome proſpect
of putting in Practice his Academical Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
according to the Model laid down
in his Sheet of Education. The Progreſs
of which deſign was afterwards diverted
by a Series of Alteration in the Affairs of
State; for I am much miſtaken, if
there were not about this time a deſign in
Agitation of making him Adjutant-General
in Sir <hi>William Waller's</hi> Army; but the new
modelling of the Army ſoon following,
prov'd an obſtruction to that deſign; and
Sir <hi>William,</hi> his Commiſſion being laid
down, began, as the common ſaying is,
to turn <hi>Cat in Pan.</hi> It was not long after the
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:60630:18"/>
March of <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Comwel</hi> through the
City of <hi>London</hi> with the whole Army, to
quell the Inſurrections <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Maſſy,</hi>
now Malecontents alſo, were endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to raiſe in the City againſt the Armies
proceedings, ere he left his great Houſe in
<hi>Barbican,</hi> and betook himſelf to a ſmaller in
<hi>High Holbourn,</hi> among thoſe that open
backward into <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields, here he
liv'd a private and quiet Life, ſtill proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Studies and curious Search into
Knowledge, the grand Affair perpetually
of his Life; till ſuch time as the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now at an end, with compleat Victory
to the Parliament's ſide, as the Parliament
then ſtood purg'd of all it's Diſſenting
Members, and the King after ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with the Army, <hi>re Infecta,</hi> brought to
his Tryal; the form of Government being
now chang'd into a Free State, he was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
oblig'd to Write a Treatiſe, call'd the
<hi>Tenure of Kings and Magiſtrates.</hi> After which
his thoughts were bent upon retiring again
to his own private Studies, and falling upon
ſuch Subjects as his proper Genius
prompted him to Write of, among which
was the Hiſtory of our own Nation from
the Beginning till the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt,
wherein he had made ſome progreſs. When
for this his laſt Treatiſe, reviving the fame
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:60630:19"/>
of other things he had formerly Publiſhed,
being more and more taken notice of for
his excellency of Stile, and depth of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was courted into the Service of
this new Commonwealth, and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with (for he never hunted after Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
nor affected the Tintamar and
Hurry of Publick buſineſs) to take upon
him the Office of <hi>Latin</hi> Secretary to the
Counſel of State for all their Letters to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes and States; for they ſtuck to
this Noble and Generous Reſolution, not to
write to any, or receive Anſwers from
them, but in a Language moſt proper to
maintain a Correſpondence among the
Learned of all Nations in this part of the
World; ſcorning to carry on their Affairs
in the Wheedling Liſping Jargon of
the Cringing <hi>French,</hi> eſpecially having a
Miniſter of State able to cope with the
ableſt any Prince or State could imploy for
the Latin Tongue; and ſo well he acquitted
himſelf in this ſtation, that he gain'd from
abroad both Reputation to himſelf, and
Credit to the State that Employed him;
and it was well the buſineſs of his Office
came not very faſt vpon him, for he was
ſcarce well warm in his Secretaryſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other Work flow'd in upon him, which
took him up for ſome conſiderable time. In
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:60630:19"/>
the firſt place there came out a Book ſaid
to have been written by the King, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
a little before his Death, Entituled,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>The Royal Image;</hi>
a Book highly cryed up for it's ſmooth
Style, and pathetical Compoſure; wherefore
to obviate the impreſſion it was like to
make among the <hi>Many,</hi> he was obliged to
Write an Anſwer, which he Entituled
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Image-Breaker;</hi> and upon
the heels of that, out comes in Publick the
great Kill-cow of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> with his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſio
Regis contra Populum Anglicanum;</hi> a
Man ſo Famous and cryed up for his <hi>Plinian
Exercitations,</hi> and other Pieces of reputed
Learning, that there could no where have
been found a Champion that durſt lift up
the Pen againſt ſo formidable an Adverſary,
had not our little <hi>Engliſh David</hi> had the
Courage to undertake this great <hi>French Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi>
to whom he gave ſuch a hit in the
Forehead, that he preſently ſtaggered, and
ſoon after fell; for immediately upon the
coming out of the Anſwer. Entituled,
<hi>Defenſio Populi Anglicani, contra Claudium Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymum,</hi>
&amp;c. he that till then had been Chief
Miniſter and Superintendant in the Court
of the Learned <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
dwindled in eſteem to that degree, that
he at laſt vouchſafed to ſpeak to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:60630:20"/>
Servant. In ſhort, he was diſmiſs'd with
ſo cold and ſlighting an Adieu, that after a
faint dying Reply, he was glad to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to Death, the remedy of Evils, and
ender of Controverſies: And now I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
our Author had ſome breathing ſpace;
but it was not long; for though <hi>Salmaſius</hi>
was departed, he left ſome ſtings behind,
new Enemies ſtarted up, Barkers, though
no great Biters; who the firſt Aſſertor of
<hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Cauſe was, is not certainly
known, but variouſly conjectur'd at, ſome
ſuppoſing it to be one <hi>Janus</hi> a Lawyer of
<hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> ſome Dr. <hi>Bramhal,</hi> made by King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second after his Reſtauration
Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Author was, the Book was
thought fit to be taken into correction,
and our Author not thinking it worth his
own undertaking, to the diſturbing the
progreſs of whatever more choſen work
he had then in hands, committed this task
to the youngeſt of his Nephews, but with
ſuch exact Emendations before it went to
the Preſs, that it might have very well
have paſſed for his, but that he was willing
the perſon that took the pains to prepare it
for his Examination and Poliſhment, ſhould
have the Name and Credit of being the
Author; ſo that it came forth under this
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:60630:20"/>
Title, <hi>Joannis Philippi Angli Defenſio pro
Populo Anglicano contra,</hi> &amp;c. during the
Writing and Publiſhing of this Book, he
lodg'd at one <hi>Thomſon</hi>'s next door to the
<hi>Bull-head</hi> Tavern at <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> opening
into the <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> which ſeems to have
have been only a Lodging taken, till his
deſigned Apartment in <hi>Scotland-Yard</hi> was
prepared for him; for hither he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the foreſaid place; and here
his third Child, a Son was born, which
through the ill uſage, or bad Conſtitution
of an ill choſen Nurſe, died an Infant;
from this Apartment, whether he thought
it it not healthy, or otherwiſe convenient
for his uſe, or whatever elſe was the reaſon,
he ſoon after took a pretty Garden-houſe
in <hi>Petty-France</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> next door to
the Lord <hi>Scudamore</hi>'s and opening into
St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park; here he remain'd no leſs
than Eight years, namely, from the year
1652, till within a few weeks of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the 2d's. Reſtoration. In this
Houſe his firſt Wife dying in Childbed, he
Married a Second, who after a Year's time
died in Childbed alſo; this his Second
Marriage was about Two or Three years
after his being wholly depriv'd of Sight,
which was jusſt going, about the time of his
Anſwering <hi>Salmaſius;</hi> whereupon his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:60630:21"/>
gladly take occaſion of imputing his
blindneſs as a Judgment upon him for his
Anſwering the King's Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas it
is moſt certainly known, that his Sight,
what with his continual Study, his being
ſubject to the Head-ake, and his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
tampering with Phyſick to preſerve it,
had been decaying for above a dozen years
before, and the ſight of one for a long time
clearly loſt. Here he wrote, by his <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis,</hi>
his Two Anſwers to <hi>Alexander
More;</hi> who upon the laſt Anſwer quitted
the field. So that being now quiet from
State-Adverſaries and publick Conteſts, he
had leiſure again for his own Studies and
private Deſigns; which were his foreſaid
<hi>Hiſtory of</hi> England, and a New <hi>Theſaurus
Linguae Latinae,</hi> according to the manner of
<hi>Stephanus;</hi> a work he had been long ſince
Collecting from his own Reading, and ſtill
went on with it at times, even very near
to his dying day; but the Papers after his
death were ſo diſcompoſed and deficient,
that it could not be made fit for the Preſs;
However, what there was of it, was made
uſe of for another Dictionary. But the
Heighth of his Noble Fancy and Invention
began now to be ſeriouſly and mainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in a Subject worthy of ſuch a Muſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> A Heroick Poem, Entituled, <hi>Paradiſe Loſt;</hi>
               <pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:60630:21"/>
the Nobleſt in the general Eſteem of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Judicious Perſons, of any yet written
by any either Ancient or Modern: This
Subject was firſt deſigned a Tragedy, and
in the Fourth Book of the Poem there
are Ten Verſes, which ſeveral Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Poem was begun, were ſhewn
to me, and ſome others, as deſigned for
the very beginning of the ſaid Tragedy.
The Verſes are theſe;</p>
            <l>O Thou that with ſurpaſſing Glory
Crown'd!</l>
            <l>Look'ſt from thy ſole Dominion, like the
God</l>
            <l>Of this New World; at whoſe ſight all
the Stars</l>
            <l>Hide their diminiſh'd Heads; to thee I
call,</l>
            <l>But with no friendly Voice; and add thy
Name,</l>
            <l>O Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy Beams</l>
            <l>That bring to my remembrance, from what
State</l>
            <l>I fell; how Glorious once above thy
Sphere;</l>
            <l>Till Pride and worſe Ambition threw me
down,</l>
            <l>Warring in Heaven, againſt Heaven's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
King.</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:60630:22"/>
There is another very remarkable Paſſage
in the Compoſure of this Poem, which I
have a particular occaſion to remember;
for whereas I had the peruſal of it from
the very beginning; for ſome years as I
went from time to time to Viſit him, in a
Parcel of Ten, Twenty, or Thirty Verſes
at a Time, which being Written by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hand came next, might poſſibly want
Correction as to the Orthography and
Pointing; having as the Summer came on,
not been ſhewed any for a conſiderable
while, and deſiring the reaſon thereof,
was anſwered, That his Vein never happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow'd, but from the <hi>Autumnal Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi>
to the <hi>Vernal,</hi> and that whatever he
attempted was never to his ſatisfaction,
though he courted his fancy never ſo much;
ſo that in all the years he was about this
Poem, he may be ſaid to have ſpent but
half his time therein. It was but a little
before the King's Reſtoration that he
Wrote and Publiſhed his Book in <hi>Defence
of a Commonwealth;</hi> ſo undaunted he was
in declaring his true Sentiments to the
world; and not long before, his Power of
the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs;</hi>
and <hi>his Treatiſe againſt Hirelings,</hi> juſt upon the
King's coming over; having a little before
been ſequeſtred from his Office of <hi>Latin</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:60630:22"/>
and the Salary thereunto belonging,
he was forc'd to leave his Houſe alſo, in <hi>Petty
France,</hi> where all the time of his abode
there, which was eight years, as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
he was frequently viſited by
perſons of Quality, particularly my Lady
<hi>Ranala,</hi> whoſe Son for ſome time he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed;
all Learned Foreigners of Note,
who could not part out of this City,
without giving a viſit to a perſon ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
and laſtly, by particular Friends that
had a high eſteem for him, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Andrew Marvel,</hi> young <hi>Laurence</hi> (the Son
of him that was Preſident of <hi>Oliver's</hi>
Council) to whom there is a Sonnet among
the reſt, in his Printed Poems; Mr. <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
Needham,</hi> the Writer of <hi>Politicus;</hi> but
above all, Mr. <hi>Cyriak Skinner</hi> whom he
honoured with two Sonnets, one long
ſince publick among his Poems; the
other but newly Printed. His next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
was, by the advice of thoſe that
wiſht him well, and had a concern for his
preſervation, into a place of retirement
and abſcondence, till ſuch time as the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of affairs for the future ſhould inſtruct
him what farther courſe to take; it was a
Friend's Houſe in <hi>Bartholomew-Cloſe,</hi> where
he liv'd till the Act of Oblivion came forth;
which it pleaſed God, prov'd as favourable
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:60630:23"/>
to him as could be hop'd or expected,
through the interceſſion of ſome that ſtood
his Friends both in Council and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
particularly in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvel,</hi> a Member for
<hi>Hull,</hi> acted vigorouſly in his behalf, and
made a conſiderable party for him; ſo that,
together with <hi>John Goodwin</hi> of <hi>Coleman-Street,</hi>
he was only ſo far excepted as not to
bear any Office in the Commonwealth.
Soon after appearing again in publick, he
took a Houſe in <hi>Holborn</hi> near <hi>Red Lyon
Fields,</hi> where he ſtayed not long before
his Pardon having paſs'd the Seal, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to <hi>Jewin Street;</hi> there he liv'd when
he married his 3d. Wife, recommended to
him by his old Friend Dr. <hi>Paget</hi> in <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſtreet;</hi>
but he ſtay'd not long after
his new Marriage, ere he remov'd to a
Houſe in the <hi>Artillery</hi>-walk leading to
<hi>Bunhill Fields.</hi> And this was his laſt Stage
in this World, but it was of many years
continuance, more perhaps than he had had
in any other place beſides. Here he finiſht
his noble Poem, and publiſht it in the year
1666. the firſt Edition was Printed in
Quarto by one <hi>Simons</hi> a Printer in <hi>Alderſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-Street,</hi>
the other in a large Octavo, by
<hi>Starky</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> amended, enlarg'd,
and differently diſpos'd as to the Number
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:60630:23"/>
of Books, by his own Hand, that is by his
own appointment; the laſt ſet forth many
years ſince his death in a large Folio with
Cuts added by <hi>Jacob Tonſon.</hi> Here it was
alſo that he finiſht and publiſht his Hiſtory
of our Nation till the Conqueſt, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
ſo far as he went, ſome Paſſages on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted, which being thought too
ſharp againſt the Clergy, could not paſs the
Hand of the Licencer, were in the Hands
of the late Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi> while he liv'd;
where at preſent is uncertain. It cannot
certainly be concluded when he wrote his
excellent Tragedy entitled <hi>Samſon Agoniſtes,</hi>
but ſure enough it is that it came forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
his publication of <hi>Paradice loſt,</hi> together
with his other Poem call'd <hi>Paradice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd</hi>
which doubtleſs was begun and
finiſht and Printed after the other was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht,
and that in a wonderful ſhort ſpace
conſidering the ſublimeneſs of it; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is generally cenſur'd to be much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he could not hear
with patience any ſuch thing when related
to him; poſſibly the Subject may not afford
ſuch variety of Invention, but it is thought by
the moſt judicious to be little or nothing
inferiour to the other for ſtile and decorum.
The ſaid Earl of <hi>Angleſy</hi> whom he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Copy of the unlicens'd Papers of
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:60630:24"/>
his Hiſtory, came often here to viſit him,
as very much coveting his ſociety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe;
as likewiſe others of the Nobility,
and many perſons of eminent quality; nor
were the viſits of Foreigners ever more
frequent than in this place, almoſt to his
dying day. His Treatiſe of true Religion,
Hereſy, Schiſm and Toleration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was
doubtleſs the laſt thing of his writing that
was publiſht before his Death. He had, as
I remember, prepared for the Preſs an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to ſome little ſcribing Quack in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who had written a Scurrilons Libel
againſt him, but whether by the diſſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Friends, as thinking him a Fellow
not worth his notice, or for what other
cauſe I know not, this Anſwer was never
publiſht. He died in the year 1673. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the latter end of the Summer, and
had a very decent interment according to
his Quality, in the Church of St. <hi>Giles
Cripplegate,</hi> being attended from his Houſe
to the Church by ſeveral Gentlemen then
in Town, his principal wellwi-ſhers and
admirers He had three Daughters who
ſurviv'd him many years (and a Son) all
by his firſt Wife (of whom ſufficient men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been made.) <hi>Anne</hi> his Eldeſt as
aboveſaid, and <hi>Mary</hi> his Second, who were
both born at his Houſe in <hi>Barbican;</hi> and
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:60630:24"/>
               <hi>Debora</hi> the youngeſt, who is yet living, born
at his Houſe in <hi>Petty-France;</hi> between whom
and his Second Daughter, the Son, named
<hi>John,</hi> was born as above-mention'd, at his
Apartment in <hi>Scotland Yard.</hi> By his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife, <hi>Catharine</hi> the Daughter of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Woodcock</hi> of <hi>Hackney,</hi> he had only one
Daughter, of which the Mother the firſt
year after her Marriage died in Child bed,
and the Child alſo within a Month after.
By his Third Wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter
of one Mr. <hi>Minſhal</hi> of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> (and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
to Dr. <hi>Paget)</hi> who ſurviv'd him,
and is ſaid to be yet living, he never had
any Child; and thoſe he had by the Firſt
he made ſerviceable to him in that very
particular in which he moſt wanted their
Service, and ſupplied his want of Eye-ſight
by their Eyes and Tongue; for though he
had daily about him one or other to Read
to him, ſome perſons of Man's Eſtate,
who of their own accord greedily catch'd
at the opportunity of being his Readers,
that they might as well reap the benefit
of what they Read to him, as oblige him
by the benefit of their reading; others of
younger years ſent by their Parents to the
ſame end, yet excuſing only the Eldeſt
Daughter by reaſon of her bodily Infirmity,
and difficult utterance of Speech, (which
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:60630:25"/>
to ſay truth I doubt was the Principal
cauſe of excuſing her) the other two were
Condemn'd to the performance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and exactly pronouncing of all the
Languages of what ever Book he ſhould
at one time or other think fit to peruſe.
<hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> (and I think the <hi>Syriac)</hi>
the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Italian, Spaniſh</hi>
and <hi>French.</hi> All which ſorts of Books to
be confined to Read, without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one word, muſt needs be a Tryal of
Patience, almoſt beyond endurance; yet
it was endured by both for a long time,
yet the irkſomeneſs of this imployment
could not be always concealed, but broke
out more and more into expreſſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs;
ſo that at length they were all
(even the Eldeſt alſo) ſent out to learn
ſome Curious and Ingenious ſorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
that are proper for Women to
learn, particularly Imbroideries in Gold or
Silver. It had been happy indeed if the
Daughters of ſuch a Perſon had been made
in ſome meaſure Inheritrixes of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Learning; but ſince Fate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
decreed, the greateſt Honour that can
be aſcribed to this now living (and ſo
would have been to the others had they
lived) is to be Daughter to a man of his
extraordinary Character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:60630:25"/>
He is ſaid to have dyed worth <hi>1500 l.</hi>
in Money (a conſiderable Eſtate, all
things conſidered) beſides Houſhold
Goods; for he ſuſtained ſuch loſſes as
might well have broke any perſon leſs fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

then <hi>2000 l.</hi> which he had put for
Security and improvement into the Exciſe
Office, but neglecting to recal it in time,
could never after get it out, with all the
Power and Intereſt he had in the Great
ones of thoſe Times; beſides another great
Sum, by miſmanagement and for want of
good advice.</p>
            <p>Thus I have reduced into form and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what ever I have been able to rally
up, either from the recollection of my
own memory, of things tranſacted while
I was with him, or the information of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
equally converſant afterwards, or
from his own mouth by frequent viſits to
the laſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with two material paſſages,
which though they relate not immediately to our
Author, or his own particular concerns; yet in
regard they hapned during his publick employ,
and conſequently fell moſt eſpecially under his
cogniſance; it will not be amiſs here to ſubjoin
them The firſt was this,</p>
            <p>Before the War broke forth between the States
of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſent
over Three Embaſſadours in order to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation;
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:60630:26"/>
but they returning <hi>re infecta,</hi> the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſent away a <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> to offer Peace
upon much milder terms, or at leaſt to gain
more time</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> could not make ſuch
haſte, but that the Parliament had procured a
Copy of their Inſtructions in <hi>Holland,</hi> which were
delivered by our Author to his Kinſman that was
then with him, to Tranſlate for the Council to
view, before the ſaid <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> had taken
Shipping for <hi>England;</hi> an Anſwer to all he
had in Charge lay ready for him, before he made
his publick entry into <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place there came a perſon with a
very ſumptuous train, pretending himſelf an
Agent from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> then in Arms
againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazarine:</hi> The Parliament miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting
him, ſet their Inſtrument ſo buſily at work,
that in Four or Five Days they had procured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
from <hi>Paris,</hi> that he was a Spy from
K. <hi>Charles;</hi> whereupon the very next Morning
our Author's Kinſman was ſent to him, with an
Order of Councel commanding him to depart the
Kingdom within Three Days, or expect the
Puniſhment of a Spy.</p>
            <p>By theſe two remarkable paſſages, we may
clearly diſcover the Induſtry and good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>Here is a Catalogue added of every

               <p>FOR how long a ſeries of paſt
Years, and for what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Reaſons the Friendſhip
enter'd into by our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
with your moſt Noble City
has continu'd to this day, we both
willingly acknowledge, together
with your ſelves; nor is it a thing
diſpleaſing to us, frequently alſo to
call to our remembrance. But as to
what we underſtand, by your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
dated the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60630:32"/>
ſome of our People deal not with
that Fidelity and Probity, as they
were wont to do in their Trading
and Commerce among ye; we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
referr'd it to the conſideration
of certain Perſons well skill'd in
thoſe matters, to the end they might
make a more ſtrict enquiry into the
Frauds of the Clothiers and other
Artificers of the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
And we farther promiſe, to
take ſuch effectual care, as to make
you ſenſible of our unalterable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
to preſerve ſincerity and
juſtice among our ſelves, as alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to neglect any good Offices of
our kindneſs that may redound to
the welfare of your Commonwealth.
On the other hand, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
likewiſe which we not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
but which Equity it ſelf, and
all the Laws of God and Man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of your ſelves, That you will
not only conſerve inviolable to the
Merchants of our Nation their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
but by your Authority and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60630:32"/>
Power defend and protect their
Lives and Eſtates, as it becomes your
City to do. Which as we moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſir'd in our former Letters,
ſo upon the repeated Complaints of
our Merchants that are daily made
before us, we now more earneſtly
ſollicite and requeſt it: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
That their ſafety, and all
that they have in the world, is again
in great jeopardy among ye. For
although they acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to have reap'd ſome Benefit for
a ſhort time of our former Letters
ſent you, and to have had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
from the Injuries of a ſort of
Profligate People; yet ſince the
coming of the ſame <hi>Coc—m</hi> to your
City (of whom we complain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
who pretends to be honour'd
with a ſort of Embaſſy from—
the Son of the lately deceas'd King,
they have been aſſaulted with all
manner of ill Language, Threats
and naked Swords of Ruffians and
Homicides, and have wanted your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60630:33"/>
Protection and Defence;
inſomuch, that when Two or Three
of the Merchants, together with the
Preſident of the Society, were
hurry'd away by ſurprize Aboard a
certain Privateer, and that the reſt
implor'd your Aid, yet they could
not obtain any Aſſiſtance from you,
till the Merchants themſelves were
forc'd to embody their own ſtrength,
and reſcue from the hands of Pyrates
the Perſons Seiz'd on in that River,
of which your City is the Miſtreſs,
not without extream hazard of their
Lives. Nay, when they had fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
brought 'em home again, and
as it were by Force of Arms reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
'em from an Ignominious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and carry'd the Pyrates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into Cuſtody; we are inform'd
that <hi>Coc—m</hi> was ſo audacious, as to
demand the Releaſe of the Pyrates,
and that the Merchants might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
Priſoners into his hands. We
therefore again, and again, beſeech and
adjure ye, if it be your intention that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60630:33"/>
Contracts and Leagues, and the very
ancient Commerce between both
Nations ſhould be preſerv'd, the
thing which you deſire, That our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may be able to aſiure themſelves
of ſome certain and firm ſupport and
reliance upon your Word, your
Prudence and Authority; that you
would lend 'em a favourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
concerning theſe matters; and
that you would inflict deſerved Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
as well upon <hi>Coc—m,</hi> and
the reſt of his Accomplices in that
wicked act, as upon thoſe who lately
aſſaulted the Preacher, hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd,
or command 'em to depart
your Territories; nor that you
would believe that expell'd and
exil'd <hi>Tarquins</hi> are to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Friendſhip, and the Wealth,
and Power of our Republick. For
if you do not carefully provide to the
contrary, but that the Enemies of
our Republick ſhall preſume to think
lawful the committing of any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
againſt us in your City, how
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60630:34"/>
unſafe, how ignominious the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our People there will be,
do you conſider with your ſelves.
Theſe things we recommend to your
Prudence and Equity, your ſelves to
the Protection of Heaven.</p>

               <p>YOUR conſpicuous Favour in
the doubtful condition of our
Affairs, is now the reaſon, that after
Victory and proſperous Succeſs, we
can no longer queſtion your good
will and friendly inclination towards
us. As for our parts, the War being
almoſt now determin'd, and our
Enemies every where vanquiſh'd,
we have deem'd nothing more juſt,
or more conducing to the firm Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Republick, then
that they who by our means (the
Almighty being always our Captain
and Conductor) have either reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60630:34"/>
their Liberty, or obtain'd their
Lives and Fortunes, after the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ravages of a Civil War, of our
free Gift and Grace, ſhould teſtifie
and pay in exchange to their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
Allegiance and Duty in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner, if need requir'd. More
eſpecially, when ſo many Turbulent
and Exaſperated Perſons, more then
once receiv'd into Protection, will
make no end, either at home or
abroad, of acting Perfidiouſly, and
raiſing new Diſturbances. To that
purpoſe we took care to enjoin a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
form of an Oath, by which all
who held any Office in the Common-wealth,
or being fortify'd with the
Protection of the Law, enjoy'd both
Safety, Eaſe, and all other Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of Life, ſhould bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Obedience in words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd.
This we alſo thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be ſent to all Colonies abroad,
or where-ever elſe our People reſided
for the convenience of Trade; to the
end that the Fidelity of thoſe over
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60630:35"/>
whom we are ſet, might be
prov'd and known to us, as it is but
reaſonable and neceſſary. Which
makes us wonder ſo much the more
at what our Merchants write from
your City, that they are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to execute our Commands by
ſome or other of your <hi>Order</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Certainly what the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
United Provinces of the Low
Countries, moſt jealous of their
Power and their Intereſts, never
thought any way belonging to their
inſpection, namely whether the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Foreigners ſwore Fidelity and
Allegiance to their Magiſtrates at
home, either in theſe or thoſe Words,
how that ſhould come to be ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
and troubleſome to your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we muſt plainly acknowledge that
we do not underſtand. But this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the private inclinations
or fears of ſome, whom certain Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond
<hi>Scots,</hi> expell'd their Countrey,
are ſaid to have enforc'd by Menaces,
on purpoſe to deter our Merchants
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60630:35"/>
from Swearing Fidelity to us, we
impute not to your City. Moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
therefore we intreat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
ye (for it is not now the intereſt
of Trade, but the honour of the
Republick it ſelf that lies at ſtake)
not to ſuffer any one among ye, who
can have no reaſon to concern himſelf
in this Affair, to interpoſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
whatever it be, with that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
which we challenge over our
own Subjects, not by the judgment
and opinion of Foreigners, but by
the Laws of our Country; for who
would not take it amiſs, if we ſhould
forbid your <hi>Hamburghers,</hi> reſiding
here, to Swear Fidelity to you that
are their Magiſtrates at Home?

Written and declar'd in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

as it is but reaſon, if credit might be

Calumnies of Looſe and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

thoſe perſons more amicably inclin'd,
who now abroad have the worſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents

what we juſtifie our ſelves to have
juſtly and ſtrenuouſly perform'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

purſuance of our Rights, and for
recovery of the native Liberty of
<hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> certainly it is not the
work of Human force or wit to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the perverſe and obſtinate
Opinions of People wickedly inclin'd
concerning what we have done.
But after all, in reference to what is
common to us with all Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and more for the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
on both ſides, we are willing
to let the world know, that there is
nothing which we more ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60630:38"/>

However, we foreſee that all our

that there needs nothing
further to be ſaid on a thing of ſo
great importance, wherein (as your

concern'd, that unleſs Juſtice be done
upon ſuch notorious Offenders, all
the foundations of Humane Society,
all the ways of preſerving Friendſhip
among Nations, of neceſſity muſt be
overturn'd and aboliſh'd. Nor can
we apprehend by any argument
drawn from Religion, that the Blood
of the Innocent, ſhed by a propenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
malicious Murder, is not to be
aveng'd. The Parlament therefore
once more moſt urgently preſſes, and

ſatifaction be given 'em effectually,

of a ſudden in a Veſſel to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

<hi>Flanders,</hi> by the treachery of one
<hi>Walſh,</hi> who has endeavour'd all the
ways imaginable, in contempt of
Law both Human and Divine, to
conſtrain a Wealthy Virgin to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
even by terrifying her with
Menaces of preſent Death. We
deeming it proper to apply ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60630:43"/>
ſpeedy remedy to ſo enormous and
unheard-of a piece of Villany, gave
order to ſome Perſons to treat with
the Governours of <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Oſtend</hi>
(for the Unfortunate Captive was
ſaid to be landed in one of thoſe two
places) about reſcuing the <hi>Free-born</hi>
Lady out of the Hands of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher.
Who, both out of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Humanity and Love of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
lent their aſſiſting aid to the
young Virgin in ſervitude, and by
down-right Robbery rifl'd from her
Habitation: So that to avoid the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of her Imperious Maſters, ſhe
was as it were depoſited in a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
and committed to the charge
of the Governeſs of the Society.
Wherefore the ſame <hi>Walſh</hi> to get

commenc'd a Suit againſt her in the

<hi>Ypre,</hi> pretending a Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between him and her. Now
in regard that both the <hi>Raviſher</hi> and

our Countrey, as by the Witneſſes

Which Complaints of theirs being

either not at all to have reach'd

we deem'd it convenient to ſend the

Nor do we queſtion but that
your Majeſty, as well out of your
love of Juſtice, as for the ſake of
that Commerce no leſs gainful to
your Subjects then our People, will
command your Governors to deſiſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60630:55"/>
from thoſe unjuſt Oppreſſions of our

may obtain ſpeedy Juſtice, and due Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

all manner of Injury and Vexation.
And this they believe they ſhall for

of a Judge Conſervator, who may

great Advantages to both Nations,

put the ſaid <hi>John Dickins,</hi> and thoſe

ſolicite the Seizure of their Goods

All which things, and whatever elſe

                  <hi>27 May
6</hi> of <hi>June 1652.</hi> as alſo upon that which
your Excellency at your Audience
the 6/16 of this Month deliver'd to the
Council, return this Anſwer to both
thoſe Papers. That the Parlament,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> was always very deſirous of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the firm Friendſhip and good
Peace ſetled at preſent between this
Republick and his Royal Majeſty
of <hi>Spain,</hi> from the time that firſt your
Excellency ſignify'd the tendency of
his Majeſty's Inclinations that way,
and was always ready to ratify and
confirm the ſame to the Benefit and
Advantage of both Nations. And
this, the Councel of State in the
Name, and by Command of the
Parlament, in their Papers oftimes
made known to your Excellency;
and particularly, according to your
Excellency's deſire, made choice of
Commiſſioners to attend and receive
from your Excellency ſuch Propoſals
as might conduce to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
At which meeting. inſtead of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60630:64"/>
making ſuch Propoſals, it ſeem'd
good to your Excellency onely to
propound ſome general Matters, as
it were previous to a future Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
concerning which it ſeem'd to
the Council that the Parlament had
in former Papers fully made known
their Sentiments. Nevertheleſs,
for more ample and accumulative ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and to remove all ſcruples
from your Excellency concerning
thoſe matters which they at that
time propos'd, the Council in that
Paper, dated <hi>31 March,
10 April,</hi> declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ready to come to a Conference
with your Excellency concerning
thoſe things which you had in charge
from his Royal Majeſty, as well in
reference to the priſtin Amity, as to
any farther Negotiation; as alſo
touching ſuch matters as ſhould be
exhibited by us, in the name of this
Republick; and when we came to
ſuch particulars as were to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and the nature of the thing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60630:65"/>
requir'd, then to give convenient
Anſwers. To which it ſeem'd good
to your Excellency to make no Reply,
nor to proceed any farther in that
Affair for almoſt Two Months.
About that time the Council receiv'd
from your Excellency your firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
dated <hi>27 May, 6 June,</hi> wherein you onely
made this Propoſal, That the Articles
of Peace and League between the
Late <hi>King Charles</hi> and your Maſter,
dated the 6/16. of <hi>Novemb. 1630.</hi> might
be review'd, and that the ſeveral
Heads of it might be either enlarg'd
or left out according to the preſent
condition of times and things, and
the late <hi>Alteration of Government.</hi>
Which being no more then what we
our ſelves briefly and clearly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
in our foreſaid Paper of the
<hi>31 March, 10 April,</hi> the Council expected that
ſome particular Articles would have
bin Propounded out of that League,
with thoſe Amplifications and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of which you made mention;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60630:65"/>
ſince otherwiſe it is impoſſible for us
to return any other Anſwer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this matter then what we have
already given. And whereas your
Excellency in your laſt Paper ſeems
to charge us with delay, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
therefore took a ſecond review
of your foreſaid Paper of the
27 of <hi>May,</hi> 6 of <hi>June,</hi> and of what was therein
Propounded, and are ſtill of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That they have fully ſatisfy'd
your Excellency in that former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to which they can only farther
add, That ſo ſoon as your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſhall be pleas'd, either out of the

other manner, to frame ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as ſhall be accommodated to

Extraordinary from the King of
Danemark and Norway, deliver'd

to the Anſwer which the Council
gave to their Fourteen Demands.</head>
               <p>TO the end that ſatisfaction
may be given to the foreſaid
Lords Embaſſadors in reference to
the Anſwer of the Council to the
Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eigth and
Ninth Article, the Council conſents
that this following Clauſe ſhall be
added at the end of their Anſwers:
That is to ſay, Beſides ſuch Colonies,
Iſlands, Ports and Places under the
Dominion of either Party, to which
it is by Law provided that no body
ſhall reſort upon the account of
Trade or Commerce, unleſs upon
ſpecial leave firſt obtain'd of that
Party to which that Colony, Iſland,
Port or Places belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60630:67"/>
The Receiving of any perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Ship that ſhall be driven in
by ſtreſs of Weather into the Rivers,
Ports or Bays belonging to either
Party, ſhall not render that Veſſel
lyable to any Trouble or Search, by
the Anſwer of the Council to the
Eleventh Article, as the foreſaid
Lords Embaſſadors in their Reply
ſeem to have underſtood, unleſs it
be where ſuch a Receiving ſhall be
againſt the Laws, Statutes, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of that Place where the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
put in; wherein it ſeems to the
Council, That there is nothing of
ſeverity ordain'd, but what equally
conduces to the ſecurity of both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks.</p>
               <p>As to the proving the Property of
ſuch Ships and Goods as ſhall be caſt
aſhore by Shipwrack, the Council
deems it neceſſary that an Oath be
Adminiſtred in thoſe Courts which
are already, or ſhall hereafter be
conſtituted, where the Claimers
may be ſeverally heard, and every
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60630:67"/>
Body's Right be determin'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd;
which cannot be ſo clearly
and diſtinctly done by Written Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates,
whence many ſcruples and
doubts may ariſe, and many frauds
and deceits creep into that ſort of
proof, which it concerns both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to prevent. The Council alſo
deems it juſt, that a certain time be
prefix'd, before which time who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
does not prove himſelf the
lawful Owner of the ſaid Goods,
ſhall be excluded, to avoid Suits. But
as to the manner of putting Periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Goods to Sale that are caſt
A ſhore by Shipwrack, the Council
thinks it meet to propoſe the way of
ſelling by Inch of Candle, as being
the moſt probable means to procure
the true value of the Goods for the
beſt Advantage of the Proprietors.
Nevertheleſs, if the foreſaid Lords
Embaſſadours ſhall propoſe any other
method already found out which
may more properly conduce to this
end, the Council will be no hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60630:68"/>
but that what is juſt may be
put in practice. Neither is it to be
underſtood, that the conſideration of
this matter ſhall put any ſtop to the
Treaty.</p>
               <p>As to the Puniſhment of thoſe that
ſhall violate the propounded Treaty,
the Council has made that Addition
which is mention'd in their Anſwer
to the Fourteenth Article for the
greater force and efficacy of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and thereby to render the
League it ſelf more firm and laſting.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt Clauſe of the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Article, we think it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to give our Aſſent to thoſe
Leagues and Alliances, of which
mention is made in the foreſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
and which are only generally
propounded, before it be more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent to us what they are.
But when your Excellencies ſhall be

               <p>As to the Sixth Article concerning

equally appertaining to the benefit of

us to Peace, with a Pious and
Affectionate intent, as we are fully

ought to be of great weight with

of all things is chiefly to be deſir'd,
as alſo for the great Authority which
is to be allow'd your Lordſhips above

both at home and abroad, and have
approv'd your ſelves the beſt example

not a bare Peace, but a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly

what Provocations to War they
afterwards gave us, how they fell
upon us in our own Roads in the

for Peace and Alliance, little
dreaming any ſuch Violence, you
will abundantly underſtand by our
Declaration ſet forth upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and ſent you together with
theſe our Letters. But as for our
parts, we are wholly intent upon
this, by God's aſſiſtance, though

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60630:83"/>
Niel, John Godal,</hi> and the Society of
Merchants of <hi>Foy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that a
certain Ship of theirs, call'd the <hi>Ann</hi>
of <hi>Foy,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship by them fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out, and laden with their own
Goods, in her return home to the
Port of <hi>Foy</hi> about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, was
unjuſtly and without any cauſe ſet
upon and taken by a certain Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer
of <hi>Oſtend, Eraſmus Bruer</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and the Seamen unworthily
and barbarouſly us'd; The Council
of State wrote to the Marquis of
<hi>Leda</hi> concerning it (a copy of which
Letter we alſo ſend enclos'd to your
Excellency) and expected from him,
that without delay Orders would
have bin given for the doing of
Juſtice in this matter. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
after all this, the foreſaid <hi>Noel.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the ſaid Company make
further heavy complaint, that altho
our Letters were deliver'd to the
Marqueſs, and that thoſe Merchants
from that time forward betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>Bruges</hi> to the Court there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60630:84"/>
held for Maritime Cauſes, and there
aſſerted and prov'd their Right and
the Verity of their Cauſe, yet that
Juſtice was deni'd 'em; and that
they were ſo hardly dealt with, that
though the Cauſe had bin ripe for
Tryal above three Months, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
they could obtain no Sentence
from that Court, but that their Ship
and Goods are ſtill detain'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the great Expences
they have bin at in Proſecuting their
Claim. Now your Excellency well
knows it to be contrary to the Law
of Nations, of Traffick, and that
Friendſhip which is at preſent ſettl'd
betwen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi>
that any <hi>Oſtender</hi> ſhould take any
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, if bound for <hi>England</hi>
with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was Inhumanly and Barbarouſly
done to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen by that
Commander deſerves a rigorous Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
The Council therefore
recommends the whole matter to
your Excellency, and makes it their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60630:84"/>
requeſt that you would Write into
<hi>Flanders</hi> concerning it, and take ſuch
ſpeedy care, that this buſineſs may

may be done in ſuch a manner, that
the foreſaid Ship, together with the

the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſuſtain'd and bin out
of purſe, by reaſon of that Illegal
Seizure, may be reſtor'd and made

by a Freebooter of <hi>Oſtend,

alſo further related, that the <hi>Oſtenders,</hi>
when the Ship was in their Power,
us'd the Seamen too inhumanly, by
ſetting lighted Match to their Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and plunging the Maſter of the

which I wrote back with the ſame

requires, if as I communicate my
grateful Tydings to reciprocal Joy,
ſo when contrary Accidents fall out,
that I ſhould lay open the ſence and
grief of my Mind to your Majeſty,
as my deareſt Friend. For my part
this is my Opinion of my ſelf, That I
am now advanc'd to this degree in
the Commonwealth, to the end I
ſhould conſult in the firſt place, and
as much as in me lies, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

mutual Slaughters of the <hi>Bremeners</hi>

that being both our Friends,
they ſhould ſo deſpitefully Combat
one againſt another, and with ſo
much danger to the Intereſts of the
Proteſtants; and that the Peace of
<hi>Munſter,</hi> which it was thought
would have prov'd an Aſylum and
Safeguard to all the Proteſtants,
ſhould be the occaſion of ſuch an
unfortunate War, that now the
Arms of the <hi>Swedes</hi> are turn'd upon
thoſe whom but a little before,
among the reſt, they moſt ſtoutly
defended for Religions ſake; and
that this ſhould be done more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Hearing therefore that a Truce for

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60630:95"/>

both Parties, and that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in a moſt firm Peace, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Accommodation on both

may any ways conduce, I moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

Direct and Govern all your Counſels

deſires.</p>

Whom he has not only conſtrain'd
by a moſt ſevere Edict as many as

has fall'n upon 'em with his Army,
put ſeveral moſt Cruelly to the

Tormented to Death, and driven the

there to be conſum'd with Cold and
Hunger, expoſing their Houſes to
the Fury, and their Goods to the
Plunder of his Executioners. Theſe
things as they have already bin rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Pious ſorrow and compaſſionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
we as little doubt. For
that the Proteſtant Name and Cauſe,
although they differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

Now there is no body can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

driven from their Houſes together
with their Wives and Children, to

Theſe things with what commotion
of Mind you heard related, what a
fellow-feeling of the Calamities of
Brethren pierc'd your breaſts, we
readily conjecture from the depth of
our own Sorrow, which certainly
is moſt Heavy and Afflictive.
For being engag'd together by the
ſame tye of Religion, no wonder
we ſhould be ſo deeply mov'd with
the ſame Affections upon the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and undeſerved Sufferings of our
Brethren. Beſides, that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
Piety and Charity toward
the Orthodox, where-ever overborn
and oppreſs'd, has bin frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
in the moſt urging ſtreights
and calamities of the Churches. For
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60630:104"/>
my own part, unleſs my thoughts
deceive me, there is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I ſhould deſire more willingly to

Charity toward Brethren of the
ſame Religion afflicted and wrong'd
in their quiet Enjoyments; as being
one that would be accounted always
ready to prefer the Peace and Safety
of the Churches before my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Intereſts. So far therefore as
hitherto lay in our power, we have
Written to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> even
almoſt to Supplication, beſeeching
him that he would admit into his
breaſt more placid thoughts and
kinder effects of his Favour toward
his moſt Innocent Subjects and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants;
that he would reſtore the
Miſerable to their Habitations and
Eſtates, and grant 'em their priſtin
freedom in the Exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Moreover we Wrote to the
chiefeſt Princes and Magiſtrates of
the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom we thought
moſt nearly concern'd in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60630:105"/>
that they would lend us their
Aſſiſtance to intreat and pacifie the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in their behalf. And
we make no doubt now but you have
done the ſame, and perhaps much
more. For this ſo dangerous a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
and lately renew'd ſeverity
of utmoſt Cruelty toward the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
if the Authors of it meet
with proſperous Succeſs, to what
apparent dangers it reduces our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
we need not admoniſh your
Prudence. On the other ſide, if the
Duke ſhall once but permit himſelf
to be atton'd and won by our united
Applications, not onely our Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Brethren, but we our ſelves ſhall
reap the noble and abounding Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
and Reward of this laborious
Undertaking. But if he ſtill perſiſt

And far leſs reaſon have we

engag'd 'em in thoſe inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Butcheries without the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

how diſpleaſing they were to your

interpos'd with ſo much Fidelity and
Humanity, all the high Veneration
paid you in that Court, your near

hopes, That that Prince would in
ſome meaſure have condeſcended to
the good Pleaſure and Interceſſions
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60630:108"/>
of your Majeſty. But finding not
any thing obtain'd either by your

foreign from our duty, to ſend this

fully to lay before him, how deeply
ſenſible we are of ſuch exaſperated
Cruelties inflicted upon the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors

we have reaſon to hope a ſucceſs of

proſperous, if your Majeſty would
vouchſafe to employ your Authority
and Aſſiſtance once again with ſo
much the more urgent importunity;
and as you have undertaken for

after a dreadful Slaughter of ſome
numbers, how he has expos'd the
reſt to the hardſhips of thoſe deſert
Mountains, Stript to their Skins, and
barr'd from all relief, we believe
your Majeſty has long ſince heard,
and doubt not but that your Majeſty
is touch'd with a real commiſeration
of their Sufferings, as becomes ſo
puiſſant a Defender and Prince of
the Reformed Faith. For indeed
the Inſtitutions of Chriſtian Religion
require, that whatever Miſchiefs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60630:111"/>
and Miſeries any part of us undergo,
it ſhould behove us all to be deeply
ſenſible of the ſame: Nor does any
man better then your Majeſty fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
if we may be thought able to
give a right conjecture of your Piety
and Prudence, what dangers the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
and example of this fact portend
to our ſelves in particular, and to the
whole Proteſtant name in general.
We have written the more willingly
to your ſelf, to the end we might
aſſure your Majeſty, that the ſame
ſorrow which we hope you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
for the Calamity of our moſt
Innocent Brethren, the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the ſame judgment you have

ſent our Letters to the Duke of

beſought him to ſpare
thoſe miſerable People that implore
his mercy, and that he would no

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60630:111"/>
the reſt of the Reformed Princes
would vouchſafe to do, as we are

there is ſome hope that the Anger of
the moſt Serene Duke may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwag'd,
and that his Indignation
will relent upon the Interceſſion and

Princes. Or if he perſiſt in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60630:112"/>

<hi>England,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed to be
diſtributed among ſuch as ſhall be
judg'd to be moſt in preſent need

regard we are not ignorant how

not making any doubt but you

Laded a Ship of theirs, call'd the

by the Admiral and Vice-Admiral

us, that our People who were then

in the leaſt, were not willing to
make any Defence againſt your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's

who faithfully engag'd to diſmiſs our

to the Maritime Laws, and produc'd

find that the Merchants aforeſaid, ſent
their Agent into <hi>France</hi> to demand
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60630:115"/>
Reſtitution of the ſaid Ship and

Citizens of this Republick, by
a Petition preſented to us, in their
own and the Name of ſeveral other
Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> have made a
complaint, That whereas about the
Month of <hi>March</hi> in the year 1653.
they Freighted a certain Ship of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derburgh,</hi>
call'd the <hi>Saviour, Nicolas
Weinskinks</hi> Maſter, with Woollen
Cloth, and other Commodities to
the Value of above Three thouſand
Pound, with Orders to the Maſter,
That he ſhould Sail directly up the
<hi>Baltick</hi> for <hi>Dantzick,</hi> paying the uſual
Tribute at <hi>Elſenore,</hi> to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60630:119"/>
in particulor they gave him
Money; nevertheleſs that the ſaid
Maſter, Perfidiouſly and contrary
to the Orders of the ſaid Merchants,
ſlipping by <hi>Elſenore</hi> without paying
the uſual Duty, thought to have
proceeded in his Voyage, but that
the Ship for this reaſon was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
Seiz'd and detain'd with all her
Lading. After due conſideration of
which Complaints, we Wrote in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Merchants to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Embaſſador reſiding at <hi>London,</hi>
who promis'd, as they ſay, that as
ſoon as he return'd to your Majeſty,
he would take care that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
ſhould be taken into conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
But he being ſent to Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
your Majeſty's Affairs in other
Countries, the Merchants attended
upon him in vain, both before and
after his departure, ſo that they were
forc'd to ſend their Agent to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Right and Claim at <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,</hi>
and demand Reſtitution of
the Ship and Goods; but all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60630:120"/>
they reap'd by it, was onely to
add more expences to their former
damages, and a great deal of labour
and pains thrown away; the Goods
being condemn'd, to Confiſcation,
and ſtill detain'd: Whereas by the
Law of <hi>Danemark,</hi> as they ſet forth
in their Petition, the Maſter is to be
Puniſh'd for his Offence, and the
Ship is to be Condemn'd but not the
Goods. And they look upon this
misfortune to lye the more heavy
upon 'em, in regard the Duty which
is to be paid at <hi>Elſenore,</hi> as they tell
us, is but very ſmall. Wherefore
ſeeing our Merchants ſeem to have
given no cauſe of Proſcription, and
for that the Maſter confeſs'd before
his death, that this damage befel
them onely through his neglect; and
the Father of the Maſter deceas'd,
by his Petition to your Majeſty, as
we are given to underſtand, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the blame upon his Son, has
acquitted the Merchants, we could
not but believe the detaining of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60630:120"/>
ſaid Ship and Goods to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt;
and therefore we are confident,
that ſo ſoon as your Majeſty ſhall be
rightly inform'd of the whole matter,
you will not only diſapprove of theſe
Oppreſſions of your Miniſters, but
give command that they be call'd to
an account, that the Goods be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to the Owners or their Factors,
and Reparation made 'em for the
Loſſes they have ſuſtain'd. All
which we moſt earneſtly requeſt of
your Majeſty, as being no more
then what is ſo juſt and conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to reaſon, that a more equitable
demand or more legal ſatisfaction
cannot well be made, conſidering the
Juſtice of our Merchants Cauſe,

before us, That a certain Ship of

her Voyage from the Coaſt of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile</hi>
to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was ſet upon by a

<hi>Red-Lyon,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Lambert
Bartelſon,</hi> but upon this condition,
which the Writing Sign'd by <hi>Lambert</hi>
himſelf teſtifies, That the Ship and
whatſoever Goods belong'd to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd at <hi>Fluſhing:</hi>
where when the Veſſel arriv'd, the
Ship indeed with what peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the Seamen was reſtor'd,
but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Goods
were detain'd and put forthwith to
Sale: For the Merchants who had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60630:122"/>
receiv'd the Damage, when they
had ſu'd for their Goods in the Court
of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> after great Expences
for Five years together, loſt their
Suit, by the pronouncing of a moſt
unjuſt Sentence againſt 'em by thoſe
Judges, of which ſome being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
in the Privateer, were both
Judges and Adverſaries, and no leſs
Criminal altogether. So that now
they have no other hopes but
onely in your Equity and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Faith, to which at laſt
they fly for Succour; and which
they believ'd they ſhould find the
more inclinable to do 'em Juſtice,
if aſſiſted by our Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And men are ſurely to be
pardon'd, if afraid of all things in
ſo great a ſtruggle for their Eſtates,
they rather call to mind what
they have reaſon to fear from
your Authority and high Power,
then what they have to hope
well of their Cauſe, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſincere and upright Judges:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60630:123"/>
Though for our parts we make
no queſtion, but that induc'd by

Judgment which is Juſt and Equal
and truly becoming your ſelves.
God preſerve both you and your

1647. renew'd in 1649. and by ſome
other Decrees in favour of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament
of <hi>England,</hi> as they find it

Veſſel or Goods taken from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
in the time of that War, ſhould
be carri'd into any of your Majeſty's
Ports to be there put to Sale, they
preſently ſent their Factor <hi>Hugh

the Town; more eſpecially finding
them in the Place for the moſt part
untouch'd, and neither Exchang'd

made Anſwer, That the King had
beſtow'd that Government upon
him of his free Gift for Service done
the King in his Wars, and therefore
he would take care to make the beſt
of the Reward of his Labour. So
that having little to hope from an

Jop</hi> Maſter, Laden at <hi>Tenariff</hi> with
Three hundre'd Pipes of rich Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

in her Voyage between <hi>Palma</hi>
and that Iſland, upon the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of
<hi>November</hi> in the year 1655. was
taken by Four-<hi>French</hi> Veſſels, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ships of Burthen, but fitted and
mann'd like Privateers, under the
Command of <hi>Giles de la Roche</hi> their
Admiral, and carri'd with all her
Freight, and the greateſt part of the
Seamen to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> whither
he pretended to be bound (Fourteen
excepted, who were put aſhore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt of <hi>Guiney)</hi> which the
ſaid <hi>Giles</hi> affirm'd he did with that
Intent, that none of 'em might
eſcape from ſo Remote and Barbarous
a Countrey to do him any harm by
their Teſtimony. For he confeſs'd
he had neither any Commiſſion to
take the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, neither had
he taken any, as he might have done
before, well knowing there was a
firm Peace at that time between the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60630:130"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> and our Republick: But in
regard he had deſign'd to revittle in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> from whence he was driven
by contrary Winds, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to ſupply his neceſſities with
what he found in that Veſſel; and
believ'd the Owners of his Ships
would ſatisfie the Merchants for their
Loſs. Now the Loſs of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
amounts to Sixteen Thouſand
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds, as will eaſily be
made appear by Witneſſes upon Oath.
But if it ſhall be Lawful upon ſuch

violate the moſt Religious Acts of

for their particular benefits,
certainly the ſanctity of Leagnes

               <p>WE make no doubt, but that

in contracting Foreign Alliances,
ever ſway'd us beyond thoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending

that we accounted any thing more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
then to Unite the Minds of all
the Friends and Protectors of the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and of all others, who
at leaſt were not their Enemies.
Whence it comes to paſs, that we
are touch'd with ſo much the more
grief of Mind, to hear that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes and Cities, whom it
ſo much behoves to live in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

begin to be ſo jealous of each other,
and ſo ill diſpos'd to mutual Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60630:133"/>
more eſpecially, that your
Lordſhips and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
then whom the Orthodox Faith has
not more Magnanimous and Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Defenders, nor our Republick
Confederates more ſtrictly conjoyn'd

that there ſhould appear ſome

and growing diſcord between

progreſs this alienation of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
has made, we proteſt our
ſelves to be altogether ignorant.
However, we cannot but conceive
an extraordinary trouble of mind for
theſe beginnings of the leaſt diſſention
ariſen among Brethren, which infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
muſt greatly endanger the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant

their confidence, and rais'd their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that they made no ſcruple by
their Embaſſador reſiding in your
Territories, boldly to obtrude their
Counſels upon your Lordſhips, and
that in reference to the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of your Republick; preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
partly with Threats of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War, to terrifie, and partly
with a falſe proſpect of Advantage
to ſollicit your Lordſhips to forſake
your Ancient and moſt Faithful
Friends the <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi>
and enter into a ſtrict Confederacy
with your old Enemy, and once your
domineering Tyrant, now ſeemingly
atton'd, but what is moſt to be fear'd,
only at preſent treacherouſly fawning
to advance his own Deſigns. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he, who of an inveterate Enemy,
lays hold of ſo ſlight an occaſion of
a ſudden to become your Counſellor,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60630:134"/>
what is it that he would not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſtop, if once he could but ſee with
his eyes, what now he onely rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates

that is to ſay, Diviſion and a Civil

their Enemies both with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Money: That the

                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60630:134"/>
which was cruelly put in execution
the laſt year: That the Proteſtants
under the Juriſdiction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

having much ado to keep Poſſeſſion
of their Native Homes: That the
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> whom God, as we

ſtout Defender of the Orthodox
Faith, is at preſent waging with all
the Force of his Kingdom a doubtful
and bloody War with the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

That your own Provinces

expos'd to the Cruelty and Fury of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60630:135"/>
unſanctifi'd Enemies? Theſe cares
not ſlightly ſeize us; and we hope
your Sentiments to be the ſame; and
that out of your continu'd Zeal for
the common Cauſe of the Proteſtants,
and to the end the preſent Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Brethren profeſſing the ſame
Faith, the ſame Hope of Eternity,
may be preſerv'd inviolable, your

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60630:135"/>
We hope, moreover, that God

of ſmall moment to this Republick,

has laid no mean obligation upon us,
nor ſlightly ti'd us to acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We readily perceiv'd it by
your Letters of the 25th. of <hi>June</hi> laſt,
as alſo by thoſe which we receiv'd
from our Agent <hi>Philip Meadows,</hi> ſent
into <hi>Portugal</hi> to conclude the Peace

of which we moſt joyfully receiv'd the

have no cauſe to repent either of your

conſidering the great hopes we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60630:139"/>

Advantage to both Nations, and not
a little Inconvenient to our Enemies.
The onely Accident that fell out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

was that unhallow'd Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany
nefariouſly attempted upon the

then the vileſt of moſt openly detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Aſſaſſinates. Nor can we doubt
in the leaſt of your King's Severity
and Juſtice in the Puniſhment of a
Crime ſo horrid, nor of your Care
and Sedulity to ſee that there be no
remiſsneſs of Proſecution; as being
a perſon bearing due veneration to
the Laws of God, and Sanctity

cannot but rejoyce at your proſperous
Succeſſes, and the daily Tidings of
your Victories, yet on the other ſide
we cannot but be as deeply afflicted
to meet with one thing that diſturbs

the bad News, intermix'd with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
welcome Tydings, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Friendſhip between your Majeſty

looks with a dubious Aſpect,
and that the miſchief is exaſperated
to that heighth, eſpecially in the
<hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, as ſeems to bode an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
rupture. We confeſs our
ſelves ignorant of the Cauſes; but
we too eaſily foreſee that the Events,
which God avert, will be fatal to the
Intereſts of the Proteſtants. And
therefore, as well in reſpect to that
moſt ſtrict Alliance between us and
your Majeſty, as out of that Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Love to the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by which we all of us ought
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60630:141"/>
chiefly to be ſwai'd, we thought it
our duty, as we have moſt earneſtly
exhorted the States of the <hi>Vnited
Provinces</hi> to Peace and Moderation,
ſo now to perſwade your Majeſty to
the ſame. The Proteſtants have
Enemies every where enow and to
ſpare, inflam'd with inexorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
they never were known to
have conſpir'd more perniciouſly to
our deſtruction, witneſs the Valleys
of <hi>Piemont,</hi> ſtill reaking with the
Blood and Slaughter of the Miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
witneſs <hi>Auſtria,</hi> lately tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil'd
with the Emperor's Edicts
and Proſcriptions; witneſs <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
But to what purpoſe is it in
many words to call back the bitter
lamentations and remembrance of ſo
many Calamities? Who ſo ignorant,
as not to know that the Counſels of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,</hi>
for theſe Two years have fill'd
all theſe Places with Conflagrations,
Slaughter, and Vexation of the
<hi>Orthodox.</hi> If to theſe miſchiefs
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60630:141"/>
there ſhould happen an acceſs of
Diſſention among Proteſtant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
more eſpecially between
Two Potent States, upon whoſe
Courage, Wealth and Fortitude, ſo
far as human Strength may be reli'd
upon, the Support and Hopes of all
the Reformed Churches depend, of
neceſſity the Proteſtant Religion
muſt be in great jeopardy, if not
upon the brink of deſtruction. On
the other ſide, if the whole Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Name would but obſerve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Peace among themſelves with
that ſame Brotherly Union as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
their Profeſſion, there would
be no occaſion to fear what all the
Artifices or Puiſſance of our Enemies
could do to hurt us, which our fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Concord and Harmony alone
would eaſily repel and fruſtrate.
And therefore we moſt earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and beſeech your Majeſty to
harbour in your Mind propitious
thoughts of Peace, and inclinations
ready bent to repair the breaches of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60630:142"/>
your Priſtin Friendſhip with the

<hi>Dieppe</hi> was Legally taken before the
League, manifeſtly appears by the
Sentence of the Judges of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
Court. Part of the Lading,
that is to ſay, Four thouſand Hides,
<hi>Robert Brown,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>London</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60630:144"/>
fairly bought of thoſe who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with the Sale, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
teſtify. The ſame Merchant,
after the Peace was confirm'd, carri'd
to <hi>Dieppe</hi> about Two hundred of the
ſame Hides, and there having Sold
'em to a Currier, thought to have
receiv'd his Money, but found it
Stopt and Attach'd in the hands of
his Factor; and a Suit being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd
againſt him, he could obtain
no favour in that Court. Wherefore,
we thought it proper to requeſt your

may be referr'd to your Council,
that ſo the ſaid Money may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd

aſſurance of Treaties to be a thing of

being a Veſſel of Four hunder'd

that the ſaid Ship was taken from

The Commiſſioners by the League

at Seven thouſand of our Pounds, or
twice as many <hi>Milreys</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi>

to us. Which Loſs falling ſo heavy
upon the foreſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> and being
conſtrain'd to make a voyage to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
for the Recovery of his Eſtate,
he humbly beſought us that we
would grant him our Letters to your

We therefore, although we Wrote

of your Court pronounc'd in

Widow; and the Eſtates of their

excepted, being adjudg'd to them by
vertue of that Sentence; nevertheleſs,
to this very day they could never
reap any benefit of their Pains
and Expences in obtaining the ſaid
Judgment, notwithſtanding their
own declar'd Right, and Letters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Written by King <hi>Charles</hi> in
their behalf; for that the great
Power and Wealth of <hi>Albertvan
Eyzen,</hi> one of your Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and with whom the greateſt
part of the Goods was depoſited,
was an Oppoſition too Potent for
them to ſurmount, whilſt he ſtrove
all that in him lay that the Goods
might not be reſtor'd to the Heirs.
Thus diſappointed and tir'd out with

dated the 14th of <hi>May,</hi> of the laſt

and <hi>William Waterford,</hi> Merchant,
had by their Petition ſet forth, That a
certain Veſſel, call'd the <hi>Jonas,</hi> freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Goods upon their Accompt,
and bound for <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> then under the
Juriſdiction of the <hi>French,</hi> was taken
at the very Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60630:149"/>
a Sea-Rover, pretending a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Son of the late King
<hi>Charles:</hi> Which being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your Edicts, and the Decrees of
your Council, That no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship
taken by the Enemies of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ſhould be admitted into any of
your Ports, and there put to ſale, they
demanded Reſtitution of the ſaid Ship
and Goods from M. <hi>Leſtrade,</hi> then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Town, who return'd
'em an anſwer no way becoming a
Perſon of his Quality, or who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Obedience to his Sovereign;
That the Government was conferr'd
upon him for his good Service in the
Wars, and therefore he would make
his beſt advantage of it, that is to ſay,
by right or wrong; for that he ſeem'd
to drive at: As if he had receiv'd
that Government of your Majeſties
free gift, to authorize him in the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
your Confederates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
your Edicts, ſet forth in their
favour. For what the King of <hi>France</hi>
forbids his Subjects any way to have a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60630:149"/>
hand in, that the King's Governor has
not only ſuffer'd to be committed in
your Ports, but he himſelf becomes
the Pirate, ſeizes the Prey, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avouches the Fact. With this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
therefore the Merchants depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
altogether baffl'd and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and this we ſignifi'd by our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to your Majeſty the laſt year with
little better ſucceſs; for as yet we
have receiv'd no Reply to thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Of which we are apt to believe
the reaſon was, becauſe the Governor
was with the Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but
now he reſides at <hi>Paris,</hi> or rather flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
unpuniſh'd about the City, and at
Court enrich'd with the Spoils of our
Merchants. Once more therefore, We
make it our Requeſt to your Majeſty,
which it is your Majeſty's Intereſt in
the firſt place to take care of, That no
perſon whatever may dare to juſtify
the wrongs done to your Majeſty's

your Royal Edicts. Nor can this
Cauſe be properly referr'd to the

Common Controverſies on both

when we had perus'd, the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of your Majeſty's Good-will
towards us, and the Importance of
the Matter concerning which you
write, affected us to that degree, that
we deſign'd forthwith to ſend to your
Majeſty ſome perſon, who being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with ample Inſtructions from
us, might more at large declare to
your Majeſty our Counſels in that
Affair. And tho we have ſtill the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60630:151"/>
ſame Reſolutions, yet hitherto we
have not been at leiſure to think of a
Perſon proper to be entruſted with
thoſe Commands, which the weight
of the matter requires; tho in a ſhort
time we hope to be more at liberty.
In the mean while, we thought it
not convenient any longer to delay
the letting your Majeſty underſtand,
that the preſent Condition of Affairs
in <hi>Europe</hi> has employ'd the greateſt
part of our Care and Thoughts; while
for ſome years, to our great grief,
we have beheld the Proteſtant Princes
and Supream Magiſtrates of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Republicks, (whom it rather
behoves, as being engag'd by the
common Tye of Religion and Safety,
to combine and ſtudy all the ways
imaginable conducing to mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
more and more at weakning
variance among themſelves, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of each other's Actions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
putting their Friends in fear,
their Enemies in hope, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of Affairs bodes rather Enmity
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60630:151"/>
and Diſcord, then a firm agreement
of mind to defend and aſſiſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And this ſollicitude has fix'd
it ſelf ſo much the deeper in our
thoughts, in regard there ſeems to
appear ſome ſparkles of jealouſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your Majeſty and the King of
<hi>Sweden;</hi> at leaſt, that there is not
that conjunction of Affections, which
our Love and Good-will in general
toward the Orthodox Religion ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
requires; your Majeſty,
perhaps, ſuſpecting that the Trade
of your Dominions will be prejudic'd
by the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and on the
other ſide, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being
jealous, that by your means the War,
which he now wages, is made more
difficult, and that you oppoſe him in
his contracting thoſe Alliances which
he ſeeks. 'Tis not unknown to your
Majeſty, ſo eminent for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Wiſdom, how great the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is that threatens the Proteſtant
Religion, ſhould ſuch Suſpicions long
continue between two ſuch Potent
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60630:152"/>
Monarchs; more eſpecially, which
God avert, if any ſymptom of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility
ſhould break forth. However
it be, for our parts, as we have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
exhorted the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
and the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi>
to Peace, and moderate Counſels
(and are beyond expreſſion glad to
behold Peace and Concord renew'd
between them; for that the Heads of
that League are tranſmitted to
us by their Lordſhips, the States-General)
ſo we thought it our duty,
and chiefly becoming our Friendſhip,
not to conceal from your Majeſty
what our Sentiments are concerning
theſe matters, (more eſpecially being
ſo affectionately invited ſo to do by
your Majeſty's moſt Friendly Letters;
which we look upon, and embrace,
as a moſt ſingular Teſtimony of your
Good-will toward us) but to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes, how great a neceſſity
Divine Providence has impos'd upon
us all, that profeſs the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to ſtudy Peace among our
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60630:152"/>
ſelves, and that chiefly at this time,
when our moſt embittered Enemies
ſeem to have on every ſide conſpir'd
our deſtruction. There's no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of calling to remembrance the
Valleys of <hi>Piemont</hi> ſtill beſmear'd
with the Blood and Slaughter of the
miſerable Inhabitants; nor <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
tormented at the ſame time with the
Emperor's Decrees and Proſcriptions;
nor the impetuous Onſets of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
upon the Proteſtant <hi>Switzers.</hi>
Who can be ignorant, that the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Machinations of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
for ſome years laſt paſt, have
fill'd all theſe places with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
and blended havock of Fire and
Sword? To which unfortunate Pile
of Miſeries, if once the Reformed
Brethren ſhould come to add their
own Diſſentions among themſelves,
and more eſpecially two ſuch Potent
Monarchs, the chiefeſt part of our
ſtrength, and among whom ſo large
a Proviſion of the Proteſtants Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60630:153"/>
up againſt Times of Danger, moſt
certainly the Intereſts of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
muſt go to ruine, and ſuffer a
total and irrecoverable Eclipſe. On
the other ſide, If Peace continue firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fix'd between two ſuch powerful
Neighbours, and the reſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Princes; if we would but
make it our main ſtudy to abide in
Brotherly Concord, there would be
no cauſe, by God's aſſiſtance, to fear
neither the force nor ſubtilty of our
Enemies; all whoſe Endeavours, and
laborious Toils, our Union alone
would be able to diſſipate and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
Nor do we queſtion, but that

Conduct, but chiefly by Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the greateſt part of our People
both well know, and are ſenſible of,
in a deep tranquility of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
The ſame Peace we have
wiſh'd to the Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi>
whoſe Diſſentions have been too
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60630:154"/>
ſharp, and of too too long endurance;
and by our Agent <hi>Dury,</hi> for many

whatever might conduce on our

perſevere in the ſame Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and wiſh the ſame Fraternal
Charity one among another, to thoſe
Churches. But how difficult a task
it is to ſettle peace among thoſe Sons
of Peace, as they give out themſelves
to be, to our extream grief, we more
then abundantly underſtand. For
that the Reformed, and thoſe of the
<hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, ſhould cement
together in a Communion of one
Church, is hardly ever to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
'Tis impoſſible by force to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
either from defending their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether in private Diſputes, or
by publick Writings. For Force can
never conſiſt with Eccleſiaſtical Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.
This only were to be wiſh'd,
that they who differ, would ſuffer
themſelves to be entreated, that they
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60630:155"/>
would diſagree more civilly and with
more moderation; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Diſputes, Love one another;
not imbitter'd againſt each other as
Enemies, but as Brethren, diſſenting
onely in Trifles, though in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Faith moſt cordially
agreeing. With inculcating and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
theſe things, we ſhall never
be wearied; beyond that, there is
nothing allow'd to human Force or
Counſels: God will accompliſh his
own work in his own time. In the

have left behind ye a noble teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

an eternal Monument becoming the

in your Territories: Now we are no

give us no leſs obliging Teſtimonies
of your Juſtice and Equity, as well
out of your own Good nature, as at
our requeſt. For we are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
That one <hi>John Johnſon,</hi> a
<hi>Scotchman,</hi> and Maſter of a certain
Ship of yours, having faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
his Duty for 7 years together
in the Service of your Highneſs,
as to your Highneſs is well known,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60630:156"/>
at length deliver'd the ſaid Ship,
call'd the <hi>Whale,</hi> in the Mouth of the
River, according as the Cuſtome is,
to one of your Pilots, by him to be
carried ſafe into Harbour. But it ſo
fell out, that the Pilot being ignorant
of his Duty, though frequently Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Admoniſh'd by the ſaid <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
as he has prov'd by ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
the ſaid Ship ran aground and
ſplit to pieces, not through any fault
of the Maſter, but through the want
of Skill, or Obſtinacy of the Pilot.
Which being ſo, we make it our
earneſt requeſt to your Highneſs,
That neither the ſaid Shipwrack may
be imputed to the foremention'd
<hi>Johnſon,</hi> the Maſter, nor that he may
upon that account be depriv'd of the
Wages due to him; by the onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment

Highneſs; Which we could not do
without ſome mention of your great
Vertues, and demonſtration of our
own Good will and Affection. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
That we may not ſeem
too ſuperficially to have glided over
your tranſcending deſervings of the
Proteſtant Intereſts; we thought it
proper to reſume the ſame ſubject,
and pay our Reſpect and Veneration,
not more willingly, or with a greater
fervency of Mind, but ſomewhat
more at large, to your Highneſs.
And truly moſt deſervedly, when
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60630:165"/>
daily Information reaches our ears,
That your Faith and Conſcience, by
all manner of Artifices Tempted and
Aſſail'd, by all manner of Arts and
Devices Solicited, yet cannot be
ſhaken, or by any Violence be rent
from your Friendſhip and Alliance
with a moſt Magnanimous Prince and
your Confederate: And this, when
the Affairs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to that condition, that in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to their Alliance, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that your Highneſs rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
the common Cauſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, then your own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
And when your Highneſs
is almoſt ſurrounded and beſieg'd by
Enemies, either privately lurking,
or almoſt at your Gates; yet ſuch is
your Conſtancy and Reſolution of
Mind, ſuch your Conduct and Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
becoming a great General, that
the burthen and maſſy bulk of the
whole Affair, and the event of this
important War, ſeems to reſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon your ſole determination.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60630:165"/>
Wherefore your Highneſs has no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to queſtion but that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon our Friendſhip and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Affection; who ſhould think our
ſelves worthy to be forſaken of all
men's Good word, ſhould we ſeem
careleſs in the leaſt of your unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd
Fidelity, your Conſtancy, and
the reſt of your applauded Vertues,
or ſhould we pay leſs reſpect to your
Highneſs upon the common ſcore of
Religion. As to thoſe matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the moſt Accompliſh'd
<hi>John Frederic Schlever,</hi> your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
and Agent here reſiding, if
hitherto we could not return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſuch as we deſir'd to do, though
with all aſſiduity and diligence la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
by your Agent; we intreat
your Highneſs to impute it to the
preſent condition of our Affairs, and
to be aſſur'd, that there is nothing
which we account more ſacred, or
more earneſtly deſire, then to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
and aſſiſting to your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
ſo bound up with the Cauſe of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60630:166"/>
Religion. In the mean time we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
the God of Mercy and Power,
that ſo ſignal a Proweſs and Fortitude
may never languiſh or be oppreſs'd,
nor be depriv'd the Fruit and due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of all your Pious Undertakings.

               <p>SO numerous are the Tydings

there is nothing wherein we have
more frequent occaſion to employ our
Pens, then in Congratulating your <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renities</hi>
for ſome ſignal Victory. For
this ſo recently obtain'd, we give
ye Joy, as being not onely moſt
Auſpicious and Seaſonable to your
Republick, but which is more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
ſo greatly tending to the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of all the Chriſtians groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Servitude. More
particularly we recommend to your
<hi>Serenity</hi> and the <hi>Senate Thomas Galily,</hi>
formerly Maſter of the Ship call'd
the <hi>Relief,</hi> who for theſe Five years
together has bin a Slave; tho this be
not the firſt time we have interceded
in his behalf; yet now we do it the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60630:168"/>
more freely, as in a time of more
then ordinary Exultation. He, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd your Commands to
ſerve your Republick with his Ship,
and Engaging alone with ſeveral of
the Enemies Gallies, Sunk ſome, and
made a great havock among the reſt;
but at length his Ship being Burnt,
the Brave Commander, and ſo well
deſerving of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick,
was taken, and ever ſince for Five
years together, has endur'd a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Bondage under the Barbarians.
To redeem himſelf he had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall;
for whatſoever he had,
that he makes out, was owing to him
by your Highneſs and the Senate,
upon the account either of his Ship,
his Goods, or for his Wages. Now
in regard he may not want Relief,
and for that the Enemy refuſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
him upon any other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then by exchange of ſome other
perſon of equal value and reputation
to himſelf, we moſt earneſtly intreat
your Highneſs and the moſt Serene
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60630:168"/>
Senate, and the Afflicted Old man,
Father of the ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> full of
Grief and Tears, which not a little
mov'd us, by our Interceſſion begs,
That in regard ſo many proſperous
Combats have made ye Maſters of ſo
many <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Priſoners, you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
ſome one of their Number,
whom the Enemy will accept for ſo
ſtout a Seaman taken in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
our Countreyman, and the
onely Son of a moſt ſorrowful Father.
Laſtly, That whatſoever is due to
him from the Republick, upon the
ſcore of Wages, or upon any other
account, you will take care to ſee it
paid to his Father, or to whom he
ſhall appoint to receive it. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of our firſt requeſt, or rather
of your Equity was this, that the
whole matter was examin'd, and
upon an exact ſtating of the accounts
the Debt was agreed; but perhaps
by reaſon of more important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
intervening, no payment enſu'd
upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now the condition of the

worth your while to deſire his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
that he may ſpeedily be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the noyſome Stench of

no leſs in Juſtice, Moderation

you will ſee done, of your

               <p>BY your Majeſty's Letters, dated
the 21ſt. Of <hi>February</hi> from your
Camp in <hi>Seland,</hi> we found many
reaſons to be affected with no ſmall
joy, as well for our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as in regard of the whole
Chriſtian Republick in general. In
the firſt place, becauſe the King of
<hi>Danemark,</hi> being become an Enemy,
not induc'd thereto, as we are apt to
believe, by his own Inclinations or
Intereſts, but deluded by the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our common Adverſaries, is
reduc'd to that condition by your ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
irruption into the very heart of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60630:173"/>
his Kingdom, with very little blood
ſhed on either ſide, that what was
really true, he will at length be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that Peace would have bin
more beneficial to him, then the War
which he has enter'd into againſt
your Majeſty. Then again, when he
ſhall conſider with himſelf, that he
cannot obtain it by any more ſpeedy
means, then by making uſe of our
Aſſiſtance long ſince offer'd him to
procure a Reconciliation, in regard
your Majeſty ſo readily intreated by
the Letters onely, deliver'd by our
Agent, by ſuch an eaſy conceſſion of
Peace, moſt clearly made it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
how highly you eſteem'd the
Interceſſion of our Friendſhip, he
will certainly apply himſelf to us;
and then our Interpoſition in ſo Pious
a work, will chiefly require, that
we ſhould be the ſole Reconciler and
almoſt Author of that Peace, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to the Intereſts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;
which, as we hope, will
ſuddenly be accompliſh'd. For when
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60630:174"/>
the Enemies of Religion ſhall deſpair
of breaking your United Forces by
any other means then ſetting both
your Majeſties at variance, then their
own fears will overtake 'em, leſt this
unexpected Conjunction, which we
ardently deſire, of your Arms and

of them that were the Kindlers of the
War. In the mean time, moſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous

Joſeph,</hi> on the other ſide,

               <p>YOUR Majeſty may call to

when the renewing the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

leſs auſpiciouſly concluded, as the
many Advantages from thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewing
to both Nations, and the

the Common Enemy, ſufficiently
teſtify, thoſe dreadful Butcheries
befel the <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> and that we

mind and compaſſion, their Cauſe
on all ſides forſaken and afflicted, to
your Commiſeration and Protection.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60630:176"/>
Nor do we believe, that your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
of your ſelf, was wanting in a
Duty ſo pious, that we may not ſay,
beſeeming Common humanity, as far
as your Authority, and the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
due to your Perſon, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
we are, that neither our ſelves,
nor many other Princes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were wanting in our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
by the Interpoſition of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies,
Letters, aud Intreaties. After
a moſt bloody Butchery of both
Sexes, and all Ages, at length Peace
was granted, or rather a certain Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Hoſtility cover'd over with
the name of Peace. The Conditions
of Peace were agreed in your Town
of <hi>Pignerol;</hi> ſevere and hard; but
ſuch, as thoſe miſerable and indigent
Creatures, after they had ſuffer'd all
that could be endur'd that was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive

been glad of, had they been but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
as hard and unjuſt as they
were. But by falſe Conſtructions,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60630:176"/>
and various Evaſions, the Aſſurances
of all theſe Articles are eluded and
violated: Many are thruſt out from
their ancient Abodes; many are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the Exerciſe of their Religion;
new Tributes are exacted; a new
Citadel is impos'd upon them; from
whence the Soldiers frequently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Excurſions, either plunder or
murther all they meet. Add to all this,
That new Levies are privately prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
againſt 'em; and all that embrace
the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to depart by a prefix'd day; ſo that
all things ſeem to threaten the utter

Wretches, whom the former Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaker

ſuffer; nor to permit ſuch liberty of
Rage and Fury uncontroul'd, we will
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60630:177"/>
not ſay, in any Prince, (for certainly
ſuch barbarous Severity could never
enter the breaſt of any Prince, much
leſs ſo tender in years, nor into the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
thoughts of his Mother) but in
thoſe ſanctifi'd Cut-throats, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
themſelves to be the Servants
and Diſciples of our Saviour Chriſt,
who came into this World to ſave
Sinners, abuſe his meek and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Name and Precepts to the moſt
cruel ſlaughter of the Innocent. Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
you that are able, in your towr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Station worthy to be able, reſcue
ſo many Suppliants proſtrate at your
feet, from the hands of Ruffians,
who lately drunk with Blood, again
thirſt after it, and think it their ſafeſt
way to throw the Odium of their
Cruelty upon Princes. But as for
you, great Prince, ſuffer not, while
you reign, your Titles, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of your Kingdom, to be conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with this ſame Heaven-offending
Scandal, nor the peaceful
Goſpel of Chriſt to be defil'd with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60630:177"/>
ſuch abominable Cruelty. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that they ſubmitted themſelves to

<hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> purſu'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
<hi>Savoyard</hi> o're the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
There is alſo an Inſtrument of that
Submiſſion regiſter'd among the
Publick Acts of your Kingdom,
wherein it is excepted and provided
among other things, That from that
time forward the <hi>Piemontois</hi> ſhould
not be deliver'd over into the Power
of any Ruler, but upon the ſame
Conditions upon which your Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Grandfather receiv'd them into
his Protection. This Protection of
your Grandfather, theſe Suppliants
now implore from you as Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.
'Tis your Majeſty's part, to
whom thoſe People now belong, to
give 'em that protection which they
have choſen, by ſome exchange of
Habitation, if they deſire it, and it
may be done: Or if that be a Labour
too difficult, at leaſt to ſuccour 'em
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60630:178"/>
with your Patronage, your Commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and your admittance into San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.
And there are ſome Reaſons
of State to encourage your Majeſty
not to refuſe the <hi>Piemontois</hi> a ſafe
<hi>Aſylum</hi> in your Kingdom: But I am
unwilling that you, ſo great King,
ſhould be induc'd to the defence and
ſuccour of the miſerable by any other
Arguments then thoſe of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor's
pledg'd Faith, your own Piety,
Royal Benignity and Magnanimity.
Thus the Immaculate and intire Glory
of a moſt Egregious Act will be your
own, and you will find the Father of
Mercy, and his Son, <hi>King Chriſt,</hi> whoſe
Name and Doctrine you have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
from nefarious Inhumanity, ſo
much the more favourable and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

The God of Mercy and Power infuſe
into your Majeſty's Heart a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for the ſake of their Religion, by
reaſon of the Felneſs of the Cruelties,
we almoſt tremble to remember, and
thought it ſuperfluous to put you in

forth, and make it out, that all the
Conditions of the ſaid Peace are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and were rather a Snare then a

Which Violation continu'd from the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60630:179"/>
Concluſion of the Peace to this very

every day then other: unleſs they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

their Religion, the ſame Calamities,

Heads, which three years ſince, made
ſuch a dreadful havock of them, their
Wives and Children; and which, if
it muſt be undergone once more, will
certainly prove the utter extirpation
of their whole Race. What ſhall
ſuch miſerable Creatures do? in
whoſe behalf no Interceſſion will
avail, to whom no breathing time is
allow'd, nor any certain place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.
They have to do with Wild
Beaſts, or Furies rather, upon whom
the remembrance of their former

we can reap no benefit or ſign of it, in your

toward us ought to be moſt clearly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood: Rather, That we ſhould
find the Minds of your Subjects daily more
averſe and hoſtile in their demeanor toward
us. For how unkindly our Fleet was lately
treated at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> how little accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with neceſſary Supplies, in what a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
manner twice conſtrain'd to depart the
Harbour, we are ſufficiently given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
as well from undoubted Witneſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place, as from our Admiral himſelf,
to whoſe Relation we cannot but give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
when we have thought him worthy to
Command our Fleet. Upon his firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
in <hi>January,</hi> after he had caus'd our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be deliver'd to your Highneſs, and
all Offices of Civility had paſs'd between
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60630:185"/>
our People and yours; when he deſir'd the
Accommodation of <hi>Porto Ferraro;</hi> anſwer
was made, it could not be granted, leaſt
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that is to ſay, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſhould be Offended. And yet what is
there which a Prince in Friendſhip more
frequently allows to his Confederate, then
free entrance into his Ports and Harbours?
Or what is there that we can expect from
a Friendſhip of this nature, more ready to
do us unkindneſs then befriend us, or aid
us with the ſmalleſt Aſſiſtance, for fear of
provoking the diſpleaſure of our Enemies.
At firſt indeed, <hi>Prattick</hi> was allow'd, tho
onely to Two or Three of our Seamen out
of every Ship, who had the Favour to go
aſhoar. But ſoon after, it being nois'd in
the Town, That our Ships had taken a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel Laden with Corn for <hi>Spain,</hi>
that little <hi>Prattick</hi> we had was Prohibited;
<hi>Longland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul, was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to go aboard the Fleet; The liberty
of taking in Freſh water, which is ever
free to all that are not open Enemies, was
not ſuffer'd, but under Armed Guards, at
a ſevere rate; and our Merchants which
reſide in the Town, to the vaſt emolument
of your People, were forbid to Viſit their
Countreymen, or Aſſiſt 'em in the leaſt.
Upon his laſt arrival, toward the latter
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60630:185"/>
end of <hi>March,</hi> no body was ſuffer'd to come
Aſhoar. The fifth day after, when our
Admiral had taken a ſmall <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Veſſel
which fell into our hands by chance, above
Two hunder'd great ſhot were made at our
Fleet from the Town, though without any
damage to us. Which was an argument,
that what provok'd your Governors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe, as if the Rights of your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
had bin violated, was done out at Sea,
at a great diſtance from your Town or the
Juriſdiction of the Caſtle. Preſently our
Long-boats ſent to take in Freſh water,
were aſſail'd in the Port, and one taken and
detain'd; which being redemanded, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was made, That neither the Skiff nor
the Seamen ſhould be reſtor'd, unleſs the
<hi>Neapolitan</hi> Veſſel were diſmis'd; tho certain
it is, that ſhe was taken in the open Sea,
where it was lawful to Seize her. So that
ours, after many Inconveniences ſuffer'd,
were forc'd at length to ſet Sail, and leave
behind 'em the Proviſion, for which they
had paid ready Money. Theſe things, if
they were not done by your Highneſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

were not, we deſire you would make it
appear by the Puniſhment of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,

Merchants in <hi>Tamira,</hi> to the end that
after they had ſold 'em, they might give him

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60630:189"/>
preſently look'd upon the Goods as their

this Fraud of theirs with a Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Engliſb</hi> Goods that ſoon after enſu'd.
So that he was forc'd the laſt year, in the

demand his Goods, but all in vain. For
that the ſaid <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> could by no

the ſaid Goods, or to come to any Account;
and which is more to be admir'd, juſtifi'd
