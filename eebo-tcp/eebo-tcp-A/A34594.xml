            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> have received yours dated at <hi>London</hi> the 24. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> old ſtile; in which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an account of the preſent Action at <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and alſo of what hath paſt ſince the time of <hi>his Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> his laying ſiege to that Place.</p>
            <p>Your Commands therein I am very ready to comply with, though not ſo well able to undertake ſuch a Taſk as are Others here of your acquaintance, who have better information than I have: beſides I know I ſhall run the hazard of being cenſured by Some, who are not onely ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but malitiously unjuſt in their reports of the <hi>Actions</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> endeavouring to rob them of that honour they fo dearly bought; yet ſuch as thoſe are I value not, being aſſured that his <hi>Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> and Others who have been Eye-witneſſes of their <hi>brave Actions,</hi> will rather confirm and countenance the truths I ſhall ſpeak of them, then depreſs them:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101244:2"/>
I will therefore give <hi>your Hon<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> ſuch a brief accompt as hath been writt me by ſeverall Perſons of Worth, Some of them ſealing the truth thereof with their blouds, many of them being ſince dead of their wounds.</p>
            <p>I will not give <hi>your Hon<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> the trouble of deſcribing the Citie of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> and the fortifications thereof, becauſe that alone might fill up this ſheet, and many more: I ſhall onely name the 7. detached <hi>Baſtions</hi> which are the Out-works of the Town; the firſt is <hi>Le Roy,</hi> then <hi>La Reine, le Dolphin, Monmouth, Condé, Turin,</hi> and <hi>Crequi:</hi> they of this Garriſon of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> were reported to be at the beginning of the Siege 4500 <hi>Foot, 2000 Horſe, 500 Dragooners,</hi> beſide <hi>Granadiers,</hi> and Others belonging to the Train of <hi>Artillery:</hi> the Governour of <hi>Maſtricht</hi> is <hi>Marshal Le Eſtrade,</hi> at this time employed at the Congreſs in <hi>Nimwegen</hi> as one of the <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> from the <hi>French King;</hi> In his place is now Governour <hi>Don Calvo</hi> a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> born, a Man of great Valour and as grand Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as doth appear by his brave defence of the Place.</p>
            <p>On the latter end of <hi>Iune,</hi> his <hi>Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> with ſeveral detached Regiments out of the Armie in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with other Regiments out of the <hi>Boſs, Bergen op zoom,</hi> and other Garriſons marched for <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> where they met with a <hi>Camp volant</hi> under the Conduct of the <hi>Prince of Oſſenbrugh,</hi> amongſt which were ſome Troops from the <hi>Duke of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and other <hi>Allies,</hi> all which forces, being modeſtly counted, were 24000 or 26000 Men.</p>
            <p>Upon the Firſt of <hi>Iuly</hi> his <hi>Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held a grand <hi>Council of Warr,</hi> ſet down before <hi>Maſtricht:</hi> where He gave out orders for making the Lines of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation and Communication about the Town, at the ſame time poſting every Regiment, and Battaillon where they ſhould encamp; the next thing done, was his <hi>Highneſſes</hi> proclaiming the <hi>States</hi> Order or <hi>Placate</hi> for a free Leaguer, that is, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101244:2"/>
neither Buyer nor Seller was to pay any tax or exciſe; this cauſed Proviſions to be very cheap, and great plenty of all things needfull for the Leaguer. The next day following came to the Leaguer many thouſand <hi>Bores</hi> from all parts to work in the <hi>Trenches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Day the three <hi>English Colonels,</hi> Colonel <hi>Fenwick,</hi> Col. <hi>Widdrington,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Aſtley</hi> made a Requeſt unto his <hi>Highneſs, the Prince of Orange,</hi> therein deſiring that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be encamp'd together, and that they might be commanded on ſervice alone; that, in caſe they did well, they might have the honour due to them, and on the contrary, if ill, that then they might bear their ſhame; but they were not willing to bear the faults of others; this Requeſt of theirs was granted by his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> with all imaginable Kindneſs, and as an honour and Eſteem his <hi>Highneſs</hi> had for the <hi>Nation,</hi> they were poſted next his <hi>Highneſſes</hi> own <hi>Guards</hi> on the <hi>Boſs-port-ſide,</hi> giving the chief Command of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> unto the Valiant <hi>Col. Fenwick</hi> as being eldeſt Colonel: The 3. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to be 2500 Men on their March to <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> beſide 150 or thereabouts which came to the Regiments from the <hi>Boſs</hi> and other Places, ſo that the 3. Regiments were effective Men 2600, beſide ſome Volunteers and Reformed Officers. Now were all hands at work in making the Lines of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation and Communication: The <hi>Garriſon</hi> at the ſame time was not idle, who fell out in Parties, defending their people who were grazing their Cattel under the works of the Town: Here began the ſport between the <hi>Garriſon</hi> and the <hi>Leaguer;</hi> for both ſides ſent out their Skirmishers a pickeering; the next day his <hi>Highneſs</hi> planted ſome Field-pieces, which played upon thoſe that were grazing their Cattel under the works; at the ſame time the Enemies in the Town plaid their Cannon on the Skirmishers from the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer, ſo that it reſembled a ſmall Battel, for that there were <hi>Foot</hi> and <hi>Horſe</hi> from both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101244:3"/>
Parties ſighting, and the Cannon playing on each other at the ſame time: In this days Action <hi>Major Archer</hi> Major to <hi>Col. Fenwick</hi> a Man of great knowledge in fortification and of a clear Courage pickeering againſt the Enemie, boldly adventuring to view the Works of the Town, and to discover the Enemies poſture, was ſhot through and through the body with a brace of bullets, yet brought off with him a <hi>French-Man</hi> priſoner, ſome ſay, 2. <hi>French-Men:</hi> The next day the <hi>French</hi> begun to be quiet, having loſt in this days Action ſeverall Men, and being much gall'd by the Field-pieces; ſo that they came out no more with their Cattel to graze, but kept cloſe in their Works, and for 2. days were very ſtill, ſhooting their Cannon very ſeldom on the <hi>Princes Leaguer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I am to let you know of a great misfortune which hindred the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> in his deſigns againſt the Town, occaſioned by the want of Water in the River <hi>Maſe,</hi> for all the great Cannon that were to be battering Cannon againſt the Town, and the greateſt part of the Train of Artillerie were all ſtopt upon the River for many days for want of Water to carry up the ſhips or boats; this gave the <hi>French</hi> occaſion to make a Ball in the Town for the Ladies, and to ſay that the <hi>States</hi> Cannon were in the Lumber. On the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of this Moneth the Guns and Train of Artillerie arrived at the Leaguer, and the ſame day <hi>his Highneſs</hi> ordered 4. Batteries to be made, one of 14 Guns, and one of 8, one of 6, and one of 4. the next day being the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>his Highneſs</hi> commanded the opening of the Trenches, that is, to break ground for the making of an approach to the Enemies Works; and the Honour of this was given to the <hi>Rhine-Grave,</hi> who took with him <hi>Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Lee, Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Macullicot</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Volunteers, and with the <hi>Princes Guards,</hi> began to break ground: the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments ſuccouring the Guards, who made ſo bold, and ſo proſperous advance, that they lodged themſelvs that night ſo near the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101244:3"/>
               <hi>Dolphin-Baſtion,</hi> that the ſmall ſhott from the <hi>Enemies</hi> works kill'd many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the great ſhott fell in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Quarter</hi> ſo faſt, that that night <hi>Cap: Sabin,</hi> ſleeping in <hi>Major Downings</hi> Tent, had his head beaten off with a Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullet; and a Sutlers Wife, drawing beer, had both her legs shot off; and becauſe one of the Cannon bullets came into <hi>Col. Fenwicks</hi> Kitchin where his <hi>French</hi> Cook was dreſſing ſupper, the <hi>Monſieur</hi> preſently left his Coockery, and haſtned to the <hi>Hague,</hi> declaring that his bargain was with <hi>Col. Fenwick,</hi> not to come near the Cannon-ſhot.</p>
            <p>At this time his <hi>Highneſs the Prince of Orange</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Miracle, adventuring himſelf in places of the greateſt dangers, and, as a mark of Honour, that night received a ſhot, which pierced his cloaths on the Arm, but entred not his ſkin; and at this time the Valiant <hi>Rhine-Grave</hi> received alſo a wound.</p>
            <p>On the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. it was reſolved, that the <hi>English</hi> ſhould have the honour to attacque the <hi>Dolphin-Baſtion,</hi> and thereupon his <hi>Highneſs</hi> came to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and encouraged them, giving to each Company an Ox and 2 Sheep.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhould ſay ſomthing as to the Gallantry &amp; Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of our <hi>Nation:</hi> but, becauſe I am an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I ſhall forbear; and onely relate the matter of fact, as it was performed upon their going on to do ſervice: All things being prepared, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drawn out, The firſt that adventured on the Baſtion were 2. Serjeants named <hi>Powel</hi> &amp; <hi>Pinder,</hi> 2. bold <hi>Britains;</hi> Theſe two with their Halbards at the head of the ſnap-hanſes fought hand to hand with the <hi>French</hi> upon the mounting of the <hi>Baſtion;</hi> at laſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> puſht ſo hard, that the <hi>French</hi> ran, and the <hi>English</hi> were poſſeſſed of the <hi>Baſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I am to deſcribe unto you the Nature and form of the <hi>Baſtion:</hi> This <hi>Dolphin Baſtion</hi> is pointed from the Town,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101244:4"/>
and the broad ſide of the Baſtion next the Town had onely a thin wall, on purpoſe ſo made, that the Town might on all occaſions beat down that wall, and lay the Baſtion open to the Town, that thereby their Cannon might ſhoot into the Baſtion; and thus it fell out, for as ſoon as Our <hi>Nation</hi> was in the Baſtion, they ſhowred ſhott on that Wall, and preſently made a breach, that the <hi>English</hi> ſtood open to their guns: whereas the Ingeneers that were with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have taken care to have raiſed Works on that ſide, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have been hid from the ſhott: All theſe misfortunes or miscarriages in thoſe that had the Command of the Ingeneers, did not daunt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for they ſtood their Ground, and kept poſſeſſion for an hour and a quarter; all this while no relief came, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were grown very weary and fatigated: In the mean time an <hi>Engliſh Colonell</hi> prayed that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be relieved by <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Trenches; to which was replyed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done bravely, and that the Guards ſhould reliev them; and accordingly the Princes Granadeers of the Guards began to enter the Baſtion, and were all in the Baſtion, and the <hi>English</hi> commanded out: The <hi>French,</hi> ſeeing the Red-Coats marching out, ſallied out with foot and horſe, and attacqued the Baſtion, and made a great ſlaughter amongſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and alſo amongſt the <hi>English</hi> who were in great disorder marching out, not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reaſon of the <hi>Dutches</hi> coming to reliev them, and not <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as was expected: and to contribute to this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, at this very time there hapned fire to be in the powder of one of the <hi>Prince of Oranges</hi> batteries not farr from this Baſtion, which gave a terrible blow, in which were burnt and blown up 70 or 80 people, which accident ſtruk a Panick ſear in Some, that that was a Mine that ſprung by the French, &amp; that the next would be a Mine where they were: this made them retreat in diſorder, leaving the Baſtion in poſſeſſion of the French.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101244:4"/>
The next day the Princes Guards with other Regiments were commanded to attack this Baſtion, who received ſuch a repulse that they loſt their labour, and 3. Captains of the Guards and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Officers.</p>
            <p>At this time the nights were dark, and therefore the Governour of Maſtricht cauſed Lamps of pitch and tar to be hung round the Walls and Palliſadoes of the Town, that thereby they might diſcover the Enemy if they drew near the works, ſhooting all the whole night their great Guns, and ſhowring ſmall ſhott out of the <hi>Counterſcharp,</hi> ſo that many of the Princes Leaguer were every night ſhot by chain-Shott; and theſe were anſwered by the <hi>Princes</hi> Batteries which were many, who continued ſhooting day and night, onely giving time for the cooling their guns. The next day, being the 4.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ordered to attack the <hi>Baſtion</hi> retaken by the <hi>French,</hi> as you have heard: A Copy of which Diſpoſition for the <hi>Attacque</hi> thereof, I here recite, word for word, as near as I can tranſlate it, from the Princes Orders.</p>

            <p>Theſe Detachments being made, <hi>Capt. Barnwell,</hi> Eldeſt Capt. to <hi>Col. Fenwicks</hi> Regiment, who commanded then as Major in the place of <hi>Major Archer</hi> (who before was shot through and through with a brace of bullets) had the Honour to command in chief this Dispoſition.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot omit ſaying ſomthing of this brave <hi>Capt. Barnwell,</hi> who without doubt behaved himſelf to a miracle, who marched out on the head of his men with a white Feather in his hat, encouraging his men, and telling them, that they were to remember they were <hi>English men,</hi> and that their Enemies were <hi>French,</hi> who never yet could make <hi>Englishmen</hi> run; and then with a shout, <hi>Fall on brave Boys,</hi> he mounted the <hi>Baſtion,</hi> where they fought hand to hand, at the head of the Trenches, with in a little half quarter of an hour, the <hi>French</hi> gave way, <hi>Capt. Barnwell</hi> ran up to the Officer that commanded the <hi>Switſers,</hi> crying out to his men, <hi>they run, they run,</hi> and then bravely kil'd the <hi>Swits-Officer;</hi> at the ſame time <hi>Capt. Barnwell</hi> received ſeverall shotts, beſides other wounds of which he died, ſealing this Victory and poſſeſſion of the Baſtion with his Life: thus Being poſſeſt of the Baſtion, the next <hi>English Officer</hi> that was commanded on the Baſtion was <hi>Capt. Phil. Savage,</hi> a man of known courage, who marched in with his men without much trouble, and being there ſome time, he got the Ingeniers Servant to help him to find the Mine or Mines of this Baſtion; the which <hi>Capt. Savage</hi> found, and there with a Lanthorn and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101244:6"/>
an <hi>Ingenier,</hi> he went round the whole Baſtion, but could not find any door of Communication from the Town, therefore they thought themſelvs ſafe: in the mean time the <hi>English,</hi> having ſet their Centries, began to remove the dead bodies, which lay so thick in the Baſtion, that they could not walk, or ſtirr up and down therein: whilſt the <hi>English</hi> were buſy about this work, The <hi>French</hi> took their opportunity of ſeeing one of the Centries either asleep or off from his poſt; &amp; thereupon They firſt ſprang a Mine, and then entred the <hi>Baſtion,</hi> armed with back, breaſt, and head-pieces, and Sithes in their hands, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>tué tué:</hi> then Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Widdrington,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cra<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Middelton</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hales,</hi> Captains in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Col. <hi>Collier,</hi> with 2. other Captains of Col. <hi>Kilpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks'</hi> Regiment of <hi>Scots,</hi> coming in to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>English</hi> in the Baſtion, were all blown up, and wounded, the <hi>French</hi> then springing a great Mine in the middle of the Baſtion, which was terrible to ſee and hear; for the whole Baſtion, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eed to be one flame; A very dreadfull ſight and noise! when the bodies and pieces of men fell down in to the Baſtion, ſome without heads ſome without legs and arms, others their flesh burnt on their legs and other parts: At this time was kild Capt. <hi>Crane,</hi> &amp; Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> shot in the breaſt, and out at the shoulder, and his leg broke with a plank of wood; Capt. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi> Capt. <hi>Widderington,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hales</hi> and others ſticking in the ground in ſeveral poſtures, Some buried in Earth up to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, Others to the shoulders, all wounded and burnt, yet alive.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>French</hi> got the poſſeſſion of the Baſtion, for a ſmall time, cutting and killing the <hi>English</hi> they found alive; whereupon Capt. <hi>Savage</hi> ſpeaking <hi>French,</hi> called out to an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and paſſed a Complement on the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that they were the brave <hi>French,</hi> and therefore would not kill them after they had demanded Quarter, telling the <hi>French Officer</hi> that He and the Others there were Capt. and therefore prayed a Safe-guard from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101244:6"/>
being kild by the <hi>French</hi> Souldjers; to which the Officier replyed that the would take care of them preſently; ſo ſent a Serjeant with a Centrie or two to preſerve them from being kild outright, but firſt they puld of their Corslets, and took off their rings, and what they could come at that was not in the earth buried: but this ſafety laſted but a ſmall time; for ſo ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> ſaw fresh forces coming out of the Approaches to relieve the Baſtion, they <hi>(the French)</hi> fell a cutting the Priſoners again, and crying out <hi>tuè, tué tout;</hi> but the relief came on ſo faſt out of the Approaches, that the <hi>French</hi> quitted the Baſtion: Now, the Baſtion being again poſſeſſed, the Ingeniers and Pioniers having placed their baskets, and thrown up ſome earth to hide them from the Guns of the Town, which before laid ſo open, that on the walls of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcherp they might look into the Baſtion, and fire into it as they pleaſed; Now, I ſay, was it time to dig out the Captains and Others which were alive; though ſome of them died immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they were ſtirr'd: But Capt. <hi>Savage</hi> who had eleven wounds, Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Widdrington,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hales,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Middleton,</hi> though very much burnt and wounded, are alive, and in a fair way of being fit for ſervice within a little time: But Capt. <hi>Crane,</hi> and 3 <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers, with 5 <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers are dead of their wounds.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to ſay ſomthing of the gallantry and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> who, though an Enemy, yet ought to have the honour he merits as his due; which was this, namely, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the very words written me by a Sober &amp; Valiant <hi>English</hi> Officer, who was in this Action, That <q>He shall never forget how he ſaw a Captain of the <hi>French</hi> jump through the flames to get into the Baſtion; which Officer He found afterwards dead juſt without the breach, as he conceived, ſtifled with the flame; for it was there where the fire was ſo violently flaming out of the Mine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Baſtion was recovered, though with great difficulty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101244:7"/>
loſs of many men, much occaſioned by the neglect of Some who promiſed that the Sally port of the Baſtion should be broken down, that the <hi>English</hi> might retreat into the Approches upon all occaſions, and alſo relieve the Baſtion without expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs under the Enemies Guns, by going round about, or elſe climbing over the works: which cauſed great complaint.</p>
            <p>The next day, the <hi>English</hi> being at their quarters, the 3 <hi>English</hi> Colonels ordered great care to be taken for the ſick and wounded; and then took a vieuw of what number of men they had able to be commanded on duty, the which appeared to be but 300. in each Regiment: yet the <hi>English</hi> relieved the Approaches conſtantly every time it came to their turns, not being abſent from Action when occaſion required: beſides that Several of the <hi>English</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers went conſtantly on ſervice with the <hi>Rhijn-Grave,</hi> as did Capt. <hi>Lee</hi> and Capt. <hi>Mackullicott,</hi> the one of them being kill'd and the other deſperately wounded in companie and ſervice with the <hi>Rhijne-Grave:</hi> the former whereof <hi>viz.</hi> Capt. <hi>Lee</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that degree, that had he lived he would have had great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in the ſervice of the <hi>States.</hi> Now becauſe I have named the brave Actions of Some of the Officers of Our Nation, you may expect I should ſpeak ſomthing of Every one of them killd and wounded; but truly that is a thing impoſſible to do in this Letter; That being ſubject enough for a far larger Diſcourſe and to fill a Volumn: Beſides that my Letters from them in the Leaguer give me ordinarily but an account of ſuch a Captain or ſuch an Officer kill'd or wounded; a Liſt whereof I shall ſet down at the end of this Letter, which will appear to be a prodigious number out of ſuch a handfull of <hi>English</hi> and 2. <hi>Scottish</hi> Regiments.</p>
            <p>And now, ſith All Gazets and Courants are full of the brave Actions of <hi>his Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> the <hi>Rhyn-Grave,</hi> Lord of <hi>Owerkerk,</hi> Grave <hi>Solms,</hi> &amp; Others, Give me leave to ſay ſomwhat of them; which yet will fall very short
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101244:7"/>
of what they merit from the beſt of pens: As to <hi>his Highneſs,</hi> He hath ſo behaved himſelf, like a Prince of his quality and command, that he hath out-don a wonder, ventured and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured ſo in the Batteries and Approaches, and hath been ſo many nights on horsback till the next day following at 9. a clock, that many wondered how <hi>his Highneſs</hi> could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endure ſuch a fatigue. And The <hi>Rhyn-Grave</hi> doth not deserv less praise, who hath received to this day 5 wounds, and each at severall times, and <hi>Grave Solms</hi> and the <hi>Heer Owerkerk</hi> have don very well, the latter of which did a brave and unparaleld action at the head of a party of the Life Guard, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out againſt the <hi>French</hi> Horſe, that over powred a partie of the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer, which the <hi>French</hi> ſallyed out upon: And I ought not to forget Valiant Col. <hi>Colliers</hi> who as Adjutant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and alſo Colonel of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment hath don very bravely in every place where he commanded.</p>
            <p>And now I have been ſpeaking of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I muſt alſo ſay ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Forces Quartered on the other ſide of the <hi>Mase</hi> on the <hi>Wyck</hi> ſide, under the Command of the wise and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Prince of Oſsenbrugh,</hi> who finding that the <hi>French</hi> made little ſallies out on that ſide of the Town, deviſed how he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the <hi>French</hi> to ſallie out; his <hi>Highness</hi> therefore ordered the making of a falſe work before the <hi>Wyck,</hi> as if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to lodge ſome foot there, and at the ſame time orderd a partie of Horse and foot to lie in Ambuſcado; the <hi>French</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were making this work, reſolved to ſally out with a party, and to fall on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that were making this work, the which they did that night following, beating the <hi>Dutch</hi> out of the Work; the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeemed to run away from the <hi>French,</hi> but ſo ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> were in the Work, the partie that lay in the Ambush appeared and got between the work and the Town, fell upon the <hi>French,</hi> and of 300 Foot and 50 Horſe there did not get 30 into <hi>Maſtricht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101244:8"/>
This night the <hi>Grave of Horn</hi> made a brave and bold attempt on the Enemies Counterſcarp; ſo did the <hi>Rhine-Grave</hi> the ſame, and that night poſſeſſed themſelvs in 3 places upon the Counterſcarp: here the <hi>Rhine-Grave</hi> received his deadly wound which diſabled him to mount the Approaches anymore.</p>
            <p>The next thing undertaken was the attacking of the <hi>Horn-work,</hi> that laid at the end of the <hi>Rhine-Graves</hi> Approach, but by a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that happened in ſpringing of one of our Mines, that Attach failed; beſide, that night the <hi>French</hi> bent all their force of the Town on that ſide where that <hi>Horn-work</hi> lay; yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> bravely adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and went to the Palliſadoes that night, killing above 400 <hi>Switſers,</hi> beſide <hi>French:</hi> upon which as Some the next day reported in the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer, the Governour <hi>Don Calvo</hi> removed moſt of his baggage, and much of his ſtores into the <hi>Wyck,</hi> which lies on the other ſide the <hi>Maſe,</hi> reſolving to flie thither if he could not keep <hi>Maſtricht;</hi> and hat the had cauſed falſe works to be made in ſeveral places of the Town, where he thought the <hi>Dutch</hi> might attempt to ſtorm, and alſo had made a falſe wall where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had batterd the wall, in which ſaid works he had made ſeverall devices of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works with Granadoes, Stinkpots, and other devices to ſet on fire, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> attempted a ſtorm; and that he had 2 days before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Placate that if any one of the <hi>Burgers</hi> or any elſe whoſoever should speak of rendring the town, they should immediately be broke on the Wheel, and that the Women ſhould be put into a Church together in the middle of the Town; and that he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſeveral half Moons, and other Works in the Town; and that he gave a piſtol head to every one that plaid the Granadoes when they ſallyed out, and to every one that went out upon parties 30 ſtyvers in ſilver.</p>
            <p>At this time was taken a Spy who came out of the Town, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deſert it, which Spy had in his pocket 2. Musket-bullets in which were 2 Letters in Characters, one to the Governour of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and theother to the Governour of <hi>Charle-Roy,</hi> the ſubſtance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101244:8"/>
of which Letters was, that, if relief did not come in few days, he could not hold the Place, for he had loſt many men and thoſe left were ſo ſatigated that he could ſcarce get the Men, on Duty.</p>
            <p>The next day there came ſome <hi>French</hi> Officers with <hi>Orange</hi> ſcarfs about their middle, who by that means paſſed the Leaguer, and being near the Town threw away their ſcarfs, and flouriſhed their white hankerchiefs; which were the men that brought them the good news of relief.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhine-Grave</hi> being thus diſabled by his laſt Wound to do any longer duty, the charge and command of the <hi>Rhine-Graves</hi> poſt and Approaches was given to <hi>Lovignie:</hi> this misfortune of the <hi>Rijn-Grave</hi> gave the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> great trouble, for his <hi>Highneſs</hi> impoſed much truſt on the <hi>Rijn-Grave:</hi> therefore his <hi>Highneſs</hi> now was on ſtrict watch, night and day adventuring his perſon in the Trenches, in all capacities, and did ſomtimes that which a private Soldjer did: and it is a great Providence he eſcaped, for many have been killd and wounded by his ſide; and as I have ſaid before, He hath been on hors-back, from 5 in the afternoon untill 9 the next day, ſeveral times contenting himſelf with a piece of bread and cheeſe in his hand on horsback: I ſhall ſay no more of him, leaſt you think I flatter him. I ſhall now tell you, that at this time came news that <hi>Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Schombergh, Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. deHumieres</hi> and <hi>Crequi</hi> were on a march for the relieving of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht;</hi> this cauſed <hi>His Highneſs the Prince of Orange,</hi> to make a ſmall journey to <hi>Grave Waldeck,</hi> who lay then about 10. hours from <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> thereby to adviſe what was fit to be don at this juncture of time, it was then reſolved to detach out of the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer all the horſe that could be ſpared, to reenforce the Army under the command of <hi>Grave Waldeck:</hi> At this time the <hi>Spanjard,</hi> who is allways grave in all he take<hi>s</hi> in hand, marched his pace up towards <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> not at all doubting but that he ſhould ſo advantagiously poſt himſelf, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not at all be able to force a paſſage into <hi>Maſtricht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101244:9"/>
And here I am to tell you that his <hi>Highness the Prince of Orange</hi> met with a grand diſappointment from the <hi>Bishop of Munſter</hi> and Some other Allies, who promiſed (and upon good grounds they had ſo to do) that they would furnish in the Leaguer at <hi>Maſtricht</hi> a very conſiderable body of foot, beſide horſe; which had they been there, according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for ought I know, <hi>Maſtricht</hi> had been now in the hands oft he <hi>States.</hi> Now was the Prince buſy in putting himſelf in a poſture to receive the <hi>French;</hi> the Town at the ſame time, making ſeverall ſallies, though did little hurt. On the 26th. of this moneth being <hi>St. Lewis day,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> in the Town fired the whole day, much more then ever before, both for joy of the relief they were aſſured off, as alſo for the honour of their <hi>Patron S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Lewis.</hi>

            <p>Now it is time to tell you what is becom of our <hi>English</hi> Regiments, who at this day had not left, as duty-men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300; all the reſt kill'd and wounded; yet this handfull never miſt duty, when it came to their turn. Now grow's the Alarm hot of the <hi>French</hi> approach; and <hi>his Highness</hi> therefore reſolvs to put himſelf in poſture, of defence; and thereupon diſpatched Orders to march out the horſe to Joyn with <hi>Count Waldeck,</hi> and on the 27th day he gave out orders for drawing oft the Cannons from off the Batteries and works, with all ſuch of the Artillery belonging to the Siege; the which was moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously don, and the ſame put into boats and ſecured: The next day being the 28th. his <hi>Highness</hi> by advice of Councel thought good to raiſe the Siege, and to make all the force he could in order to give battel to the <hi>French,</hi> if they did not decline it; as the <hi>French</hi> have don all this year in <hi>Flanders:</hi> by this time the Alarm grew hot in the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer, that the <hi>French were come,</hi> that the <hi>French were come: this</hi> cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome little confuſion amongſt ſome Troops then on the advance guard of the Town, who in deſpite of their Officers,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101244:9"/>
would not ſtay for the neceſſary Orders, but ran out of the Works. At this time the <hi>Oſſenbrughs</hi> and <hi>Lunenburghs</hi> forces, which laid on the other ſide of the <hi>Maſe,</hi> not judging themſelvs ſtrong enough to oppoſe or ſtand the shock of the <hi>French,</hi> marched all over the <hi>Maſe,</hi> and joyned themſelvs to the <hi>Princes</hi> Leaguer: At this very time the <hi>English</hi> had the honour of being on the Rear-Guard in the Approaches, who ſtaid the very laſt of all the Leaguer, notwithſtanding they were diſcouraged by Some not 3. pikes length from them, that shew'd a baſe Example; and they at the laſt marched out fighting their way through, and looſing men; for the <hi>French</hi> perceiving that Some made more then ordinary haſte out of their Trenches, drew their great guns upon their Works, and fired like mad on our Men, and ſallyed out both horſe and foot, poſſeſſing themſelvs of the <hi>Princes</hi> works, burning and killing all they could meet with: and had not Col. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and Lt. Col. <hi>Salsbury</hi> haſtned out of the houſe they lay in to be cured, as they did, the <hi>French</hi> had, within one quarter of an hour, taken them all priſoners. By this you ſee that as the <hi>English</hi> had at the beginning of the Siege the honour to be on the advance-poſt of danger, ſo now at the laſt they had as much honour in marching the laſt of all out of the Approaches.</p>
            <p>The Siege being now raiſed, and the <hi>Prince</hi> and his Forces being drawn up in Battalia, I have no more to ſay of the Siege: Onely once again to mind you, that much of this is fallen out through the neglect of thoſe who deceived <hi>his Highneſs the Prince of Orange</hi> in not ſending their Troops to his <hi>Highneſses</hi> Leaguer, as was agreed.</p>
            <p>It remains, That I give you an account of what Officers were kill'd &amp; wounded in this Siege: which you will find in this following Liſt.</p>

            <p>Beſides all theſe, There were 21. Gent<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. Voluntiers kill'd; among whom was <hi>Mr. Wiſeman:</hi> Alſo two Kinſmen of Lt. Col. <hi>Salsbury,</hi> who behaved themſelvs to a wonder. And whilſt I mention them, I cannot forget the <hi>L<hi rend="sub">t</hi>. Colonel</hi> himſelf, whoſe untainted valour and bravery of Spirit did here moſt eminently show it ſelf, he shunning no dangers, but miraculously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring &amp; overcoming many perils in the Trenches, and in all the Approaches moſt faithfully ſeconding the truly Hon<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Col. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> whoſe undaunted courage and prudent Conduct in this Affair exceed my praiſe.</p>
            <p>Alſo 15. more <hi>Gent<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. Voluntiers wounded:</hi> among whom is Capt. <hi>Gerart Bary</hi> whoſe leg is shot off: and divers others are ſadly diſmembred.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Number &amp; Names of the Officers I find ſet down in my Letters: peradventure I have in this Collection miſt Some, which I hope will be excuſed: The Liſt is large enough already out of ſuch a Number as Our Nation were at firſt upon this ſervice.</p>
            <p>There is One thing more that I muſt beg leave to obſerve to you, as a piece of honour and Generoſity in Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, and that is concerning the 4 <hi>Irish</hi> Officers, who, notwithſtanding their great ſufferings, and unjuſt perſecution upon that falſe accuſation made againſt them, yet generouſly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101244:11"/>
upon their own expence attended this ſervice at <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> where you find Capt. <hi>Patrick Lee</hi> kill'd in the ſervice, and Capt. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullicott</hi> dangerously wounded: for which I quaeſtion not but that <hi>his Highness</hi> the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> will reward thoſe of them that shall be left alive, not onely for their now ſervice, but for their great ſufferings: for certainly there is nothing more brings bleſſing on a Land and government, then the relieving the oppreſſed, and giving right judgement on the behalf of the Innocent againſt false accuſations.</p>
            <p>Thus have I faithfully given you an account of ſuch paſſages and matters of fact as I have found written me in my ſeverall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching this Siege of <hi>Maſtricht.</hi> In this <hi>Brief Narrative</hi> I have perhaps omitted the Relation of the brave Actions of Some Others of Our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotsh</hi> Officers; for Others indeed there were that ventured as farr for marks of honour as thoſe that are killd and wounded; and it may be I have not enumerated all thoſe who were kill'd and wounded; I am alſo ſenſible that I have not ſpoken enough in reference to the character which is due to Col. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> for his Conduct in this affair, it requiring a ſtile above what my pen can reach: In all theſe I hope I shall be excuſed, when it shall be conſider'd that I intended not this as a large Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all the paſſages there; but onely to give ſome ſmall part of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to your <hi>Hon<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>.</hi> deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as a ſingle Letter is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble off: The defect and brevity whereof I had yet thought to have made out by giving your <hi>Honr.</hi> a more exact Account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs in this Countrey; which falls under ſeverall Conſiderations: as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the dangerous growth of the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea,</hi> touching which your <hi>Hon<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> may take notice what a great number of Ships and Galleys have been built by the <hi>French</hi> ſince the year 1660.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great probabilitie of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands</hi> ſalling into the hands of the <hi>French</hi> in the enſuing year; They hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101244:11"/>
now gotten into their poſſeſſion thoſe Conſiderable Paſſes, <hi>Condé, Bouchain</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> have now onely <hi>Yperen</hi> and <hi>Cambray</hi> to win, and then all the Other Towns fall into their hands of courſe: Now 'tis worth the Conſideration, what Neighbours the <hi>French</hi> are likely to prove, when poſſeſt of the ports of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A word alſo might here be inſerted touching that which indeed requires the moſt ſerious thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> but—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Pleaſe to conſider with what grand difficulties <hi>This State</hi> in particular is now engaged: never did people more ſtrive to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a Caſe that required ſo many eyes and hands at work, than do they; and all to preſerve that Golden Liberty which coſt ſo dear. Your <hi>Hon<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> cannot chuſe but ſympathize &amp; be affected with their Condition, or, at leaſt, commend their Induſtry, that out of a Countrey not ſo big as <hi>Yorkshire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> do show ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: not onely maintaining an Army of 100000. Men, and 4. Fleets at Sea, one in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> one in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> one in the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> and one on their own Coaſt: but alſo daily paying to their Allies manyvaſt ſumms of money; (and how well they are ſerved by Some of them, wiſe men may judge by the conſequence) Beſides all which, did you but ſee what charge they have been at this year in driving out an unwelcome Gueſt, (the Water) which had overflowed half their Countrey, and ſhould behold what Bridges, Walls, &amp; other Structures they are now build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Common good, you could not chuſe but have a great ſenſe of their Condition, and exceedingly commend their indefatigable endeavours: And therewithall heartily wiſh with me, that They may not in any wiſe be neceſſitated to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious Peace with the <hi>King of France;</hi> but that <hi>Our King,</hi> upon whoſe Mediation ſo much depends, may be by Our good God ſo directed, that He may herein be helpfull, and ſo procure that great honour and bleſſing to be the Peacemaker, and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101244:12"/>
for ſtopping of that great Effuſion of Chriſtian bloud; ſo as withall, the Conſequence of a forced peace to this people may not likewiſe be of ill conſequence to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr.</hi> As to that part of your Letter wherein you deſire to know the Reaſons why Lt. Col. <hi>Salsbury,</hi> Major <hi>Downing,</hi> Cornet <hi>Grahme</hi> and Some Others have wholly or in part quitted the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I muſt beg your pardon; rather reſerring you, for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to the Perſons themſelvs, who deſign to be in <hi>England</hi> within a little time: Yet I cannot omit ſaying thus much for all thoſe Gentlemen, that it is not upon the leſt account of any thing that might tend to blemiſh them; they being all of good Eſteem in the Army both for valour and Experience: The Former of which hath ſerved as an Officer in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ever ſince the Taking of <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> where among the <hi>English</hi> He got great honour when but a young Officer.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Laſt Queſtion in your Letter,</hi> wherein you deſire ſatisfaction concerning ſome Reports in <hi>England</hi> made againſt <hi>the States</hi> for ill uſage, and injuſtices done to ſeverall Gentlemen that came over to ſerve <hi>the States:</hi> Give me leave to ſay ſome few words in their juſtification: The very ſame things you write me out of <hi>England</hi> I have met with here: I have had ſeverall Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have cur'ſd and ſworn againſt the <hi>State</hi> for injuſtice don them, yet upon my attendance with thoſe Gentlemen on the <hi>Heer Beaumont</hi> and Others they have complain'd off, I have found my Countreymen in the wrong; nay, I have found that the <hi>State</hi> have done much more to encourage <hi>Our Nation</hi> than to Others: I have known that the <hi>State</hi> have given the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſull Ordinances for the whole Winter, when Some of the Captains have had but 15 20 or 25 men in their Companies, which ſhould have been above 70. At the ſame time <hi>the Prince of Orange</hi> procured them coats and Arms for their Men without paying one ſtyver: (a favour not don to any elſe) and when all this hath been done to encourage them to get their Companies compleat againſt the Muſter, they have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101244:12"/>
faild, to a great ſcandall. Theſe may be ſome of thoſe that complain of being turn'd out, occaſioned by their own neglect, when they have had 6 or 8 months time to compleat: And Some of Theſe yet ſo unjuſt as not to pay thoſe handfulls of Men they had, which made the poor Creatures run away, being half-ſtarved: When, I remember, Some of Thoſe good Officers asked the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> leave, that they might hang Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that ran away, to make Examples to the reſt: But <hi>the Prince</hi> anſwered ſhort, that he would not have it lie onhis Conſcience to hang poor men that run away to get bread to preſerve Life. Yet, know there are Some that have cauſe to complain of being put out at <hi>the Bril</hi> upon the then Reducements: To which I shall nevertheleſs anſwer, That it was impoſſible but Some muſt be left out, becauſe there was Tag, Rag, and Long-tail that got Commiſſions at <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>Dutch Ambaſſadors,</hi> haſtening over, Some with 10 Men, others with more or leſs; the Number of the Pretenders being 105. Some expecting to be Captains, and Some to have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Commands: as I knew One that had 6. Commiſſions to diſpoſe of as he pleaſed: This was the grand fault, in giving out ſo many Commiſſions, and to many that were not able to perform their Capitulations: At laſt this 105 were reduced to 36. in 3. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments, and 12 Companies in a <hi>Scotſh</hi> Regiment: So that, Take 48 Companies out of 105. then there remain 57 Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. But Every one of thoſe Cashiered Captains had their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation-moneys paid them, and Every Captain 100 Duckatoons as <hi>Danch-gelt,</hi> or Gratuity-money for their good will to the <hi>State:</hi> And this was done to All, except Some few at this time under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration given them upon the juſtice of their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But I know, There is yet a Complaint behind, and that is, that the beſt Men were turned out, and the Worst through favour, or ſome worſe thing, kept in: To wich I referr you to the Names of Thoſe who ſtand Officers in the Liſt; by which you will find Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sons of great merit and long Experienced Soldiers in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101244:13"/>
Beſides that Severall of thoſe Officers left out at <hi>the Bril,</hi> are ſince taken into the Regiments, as I could name ſeverall. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I never yet could meet with Any one who ſerved well, and kept to the Capitulation, but that <hi>the States</hi> paid very punctually.</p>
            <p>Some reall Complaints I have indeed met with touching the misfortune of thoſe Worthy Gentilmen the <hi>Iriſh Officers</hi> falſly accuſed: but that, I queſtion not, will be ſatisfyed in time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis impoſſible but there will be ſome complaints amongſt Soldiers; as may fall out even in <hi>England,</hi> where the Pay is the moſt and the beſt in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of my Letter, I received this further Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, That, ſeeing <hi>Our Engliſh Regiments</hi> are now become ſo very thin, <hi>His Highneſs</hi> hath ordered them into Garriſon. The <hi>Dutch Regiments</hi> have alſo loſt abundance of Men, yet <hi>the Prince,</hi> who is now with his Army at a place called <hi>Bergaworm,</hi> was, for his part and thoſe with him, in readineſs enough to have fought the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I give <hi>Your Hon<hi rend="sub">r</hi>.</hi> no further trouble; onely entreat your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did interpretation of theſe Lines from him, who ſubſcribes himſelf</p>
