            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

heard them. Neither like our churliſh <hi>Nabals,</hi> (who refuſe to releeue the diſtreſſed) denied he their requeſts, for <hi>he cleanſed them. Thus the eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, his eares are open vnto their cry, and he deliuereth them out of their diſtreſſe</hi>

be entreated, and ready to heare, and grant ſuch requeſts as are made <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith<note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 14. 15.</note>.<label type="milestone">

            <p>Here then may they iuſtly be checked, who, as if the Lord was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, will rather runne to any other then vnto him in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Heere is comfort for poore Chriſtians: worldlings are vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the times are hard, and the prices of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als high; but yet the Lord is bountifull, and open-handed: As his plenty is not abated, ſo his goodneſſe is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, and he is now as heretofore, eaſie to be entreated. In the ſiege of Samaria, when the famine was ſo great, as mothers made their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25222:9"/>
children their meate, one of them cryed vnto the king of Iſrael, ſaying; <hi>Helpe my Lord, O King; And he ſaid, If the Lord doe not helpe thee, whence ſhall I helpe thee</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Kin. 6. 26. 27.</note>? But whoſoeuer cryeth vnto the king of heauen, and ſaith, <hi>Helpe my Lord O King,</hi> he will ſay, If no man ſuccoureth thee, yet will I helpe thee; He will not ſuffer the ſoules of the righteous (that cry vnto him) to famiſh<note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 10. 3</note> but will ſatisfie them in the daies of dearth, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 37. 19</note>; according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25222:10"/>
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.) hee will not forſake them, neuer faile them, nor withholde any good thing from them<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>3. But laſtly, although the eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, yet his face is againſt them that doe euill<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 16.</note> He ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth (indeede) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them that feare him, but as for vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and imprudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hee will not in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour be found of them, nor to their benefite heare them: When theſe ſpreade foorth their hands, he will hide his eyes from them;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25222:10"/>
when they make many praiers, hee will not heare<note n="f" place="margin">Eſa. 1. 15.</note>. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, hee will neither heare the praiers of them that turne their eares from the poore, when they cry; nor of thoſe that liſten not to the word when it is preached: <hi>Who ſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his eares at the cry of the poore, hee alſo ſhall cry himſelfe, but ſhall not be heard</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Reu. 3. 16</note>, and caſt them cleane from him.</p>

them: Nor be weary of well-doing, till the day of our dying. Wee muſt not change our good courſes for worſer, till we exchange this life for a better.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Iobs</hi> conſtant reſolution: <hi>Till I dye, I will not remooue my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity from mee. My righteouſneſſe I hold faſt, and will not let it goe. My heart ſhall not reproach mee, ſo long as I liue,</hi> Iob 27. 5, 6. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>I haue enclined mine heart to performe thy ſtatutes alway, euen vnto the end.</hi> Pſal. 119. 112. <hi>Aſa his</hi>

            <p>I conclude all with the prayer of Saint <hi>Iude: Now vnto him that is able to keepe you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſſe before the preſence of his glory with exceeding ioy: To the onely wiſe God our Sauiour, bee glory and maieſtie, dominion and power, now and euer, Amen.</hi>
