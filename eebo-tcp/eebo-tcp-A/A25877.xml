         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>How ſay'ſt thou <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> art thou Guilty of this High Treaſon whereof thou ſtandeſt indicted and haſt been now arraigned, or Not Guilty?</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do deſire, if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, to be heard a few words.</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> the matter that hath been here read unto you is a plain matter, and it hath been read to you in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that you may underſtand it. 'Tis an Indictment of High Treaſon; now you muſt know, that no Plea can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to it, but either Guilty or Not Guilty as to the Fact; if you can aſſign any matter in Law, do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Will you pleaſe to ſpare me, that I may be heard a few words. I have been kept cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> ever ſince I was taken: I was all along unacquainted with what was charged upon me. I knew not what was ſworn againſt me, nor the perſons that did ſwear it againſt me, and therefore I am wholly ignorant of the matter. I do humbly deſire, I may have a Copy of the Indictment, and a Copy of the Jury that is to paſs upon me, and that I may have Councel aſſigned me, to adviſe me, whether I have not ſomething in Law pleadable in Bar of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are the things you ask, you would have a Copy of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you would have Councel aſſigned to you, to adviſe you in matter of Law, and a Copy of the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>One word more my Lord, I deſire to know upon what Statute I am indicted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you for that, Is it not <hi>contra formam Statut.</hi> with an abbreviation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cl. of C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>That refers to all manner of Statutes that have any Relation to the thing in the Indictment that is High Treaſon. For it may be meant <hi>contra formam Statut.</hi> which are all the ſeveral Statutes that are in force concerning High Treaſon. Now for thoſe things that you demand, you cannot have them by Law. No man can have a Copy of the Indictment by Law; for Councel you cannot have it, unleſs matter of Law ariſes, and that muſt be propounded by you; and then if it be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debatable, the Court will aſſign you Councel, but it muſt be upon a matter fit to be argued: for I muſt tell you, a defence in Caſe of High Treaſon ought not to be made by Artificial Cavils, but by plain Fact. If you propoſe any matter of Law, the Court will conſider of it, and aſſign you Councel if it be reaſonable. For a Copy of the Jury, that you can't have neither, for there is no ſuch thing as yet; there is no Iſſue joyned whereupon ſuch a Jury ſhould be impannelled. When you have pleaded to Iſſue, then we muſt award the Sheriff to impannel a Jury to try that Iſſue. So as to what you ſay as to want of preparation for your Tryal, we cannot enquire what Notice you have had; and yet if you had never ſo little time, there is no cauſe why you ſhould not plead, though you were but juſt now taken and brought to the Bar to anſwer it, and never heard of any thing of it before. So that I think you ought to plead preſently.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am wholly ignorant of the Law, I may ruine my ſelf by miſtaking the Law; I deſire Councel, not to delay my Tryal, but only to adviſe me whether there is not ſomething in Law proper for me to plead to this Indictment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57458:5"/>
and thoſe things I alledged were not at all to delay the Tryal, but only that I may not be wanting to my ſelf in what I may by Law have.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you, Councel cannot be aſſigned you, till the Court be poſſeſſed of ſome matter to grant it upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I had ſome Papers my Lord, that were taken from me, which I deſire may be reſtored to me. I only plead, that I may have my Birth right, and that which the Law gives me; If I may have Juſtice, I deſire no more. Thoſe Papers were taken from me in the Houſe over the way ſince I was brought from the Priſon; they were Papers that concerned my defence; ſome directions and inſtructions how to manage my ſelf in that defence. If you pleaſe to let me have thoſe Papers, I will not take up much of your time; I deſire to have but Common Juſtice, and that which is my right by Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>That which you demand, Juſtice, you ſhall have by the Grace of God to the beſt of our skill, without any partiality in the World. But you muſt truſt the Publick Juſtice of the Kingdom. We are to be of Councel for you, ſo far as to ſee that all things proceed fairly on all ſides. And when things come before us that are fit for you to have Councel upon, you ſhall have Councel aſſigned you; for we are tender of the Life of a Man, as well as of the Life of the King, and of the Publick Juſtice of the Kingdom. But this is no reaſon why you ſhould not now plead. For the Papers you ſpeak of, we will take an Examination of them afterwards. If they were Papers that are neceſſary for your defence upon your Tryal, in Gods Name you muſt have them reſtored to you, but we know not which way you came by them, nor what they are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>They were taken from me juſt now under the pretence of bringing them to your Lordſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>How comes any body to give you Papers? No body can ſolicit for any one that is under an Accuſation of High Treaſon, unleſs he be aſſigned ſo to do by the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>God have mercy upon any man that is ſo accuſed then; for 'tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to make his defence, if he cannot be at Liberty to look after it himſelf, nor any of his friends permitted to do it for him.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord, I know not but there may be ſomething in Law for me to plead to this Indictment, which I ſhall loſe the benefit of if I plead. I humbly conceive, you are to be my Councel, and as you are Judges, are to proceed according to the Law. You are upon your Oaths to do me right according to the Law.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>

               <p>I know not how you came by them.

I told him, I did not underſtand till he were aſſigned by the Court, that any could juſtifie Solliciting for a man that is accuſed of High Treaſon, nor could any be of Councel till they were aſſigned: for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt Treaſon ought to be by plain matters of Proof and Fact, and not by Artificial Cavils. But if you will propoſe any thing of ſubſtance as a matter in Law which the Court ſhall think fit to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, propoſe it, and then we will aſſign you Councel.</p>

               <p>Look you for that now, you cited the Opinion of the Judges of the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> My Brothers two of them that are here who are Judges in that Court, ſay, they know nothing of any ſuch matter: but I muſt tell you, you have Liberty by Law to challenge 35. by your ſight peremptorily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing Cauſe. They are bound to look upon you when they come to be ſworn, and if you have any juſt Cauſe, you may except againſt as many more as you will. But now we that proceed upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Gaol-delivery, are to proceed with expedition; there are no particular men deſigned for a Jury that I know of.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>That is upon the Iſſue of Not Guilty upon your Tryal. If there be not matter of fact, or words proved that are Treaſon in this place, you will have the advantage of it upon your Tryal.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I know not, my Lord, but that the Indictment does mention ſomething of Treaſon, and ſomething of Miſdemeanour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>That which is Miſdemeanour, won't amount to a proof of the Treaſon upon the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               <p>If they prove no Treaſon againſt you here, but only Miſdemeanour, I do not underſtand that the Jury can find you Guilty of that Miſdemeanour, for 'tis another Crime, and there is another ſort of proceedings for it. In Miſdemeanour, there are no peremptory Challenges; in Miſdemeanour Councel is to be allowed for the Priſoner, but not in Treaſon.</p>

               <p>Judgment of High Treaſon. For if a Perſon ſtand mute, and will not Plead to an Indictment of High Treaſon, the common Judgment of Preſſing to Death muſt not paſs upon him, but an Attainder of High Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Well if it be ſo, I cannot help it. I thank God I am Innocent of any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or any ſuch thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why don't you Plead, Not Guilty then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I do not refuſe to Plead, I am willing to Plead with all my Heart, if I may have my Right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>If you do not Plead, you do refuſe to Plead.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, let me have my Papers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray give the Court an Account, where had you thoſe Papers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, we will not enter into any Examination of that matter now Mr. Attorney; he can have no uſe of Papers to ſee whether he ſhould Plead Guilty or Not Guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Jef.</speaker>
               <p>We know nothing of thoſe Papers, we deſire he may anſwer to the Queſtion ſhortly whether he be guilty or Not Guilty, if not, we pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips judgment.</p>

               <p>I had them not all from one Perſon, they were received from my own

hands ſome of them in the Tower, and being brought back to me they were taken from me to day, let me have but one of them: the Paper of Inſtructions in point of Law that I may know what is my right, I would not throw away my Life, if I have any thing that is my right that can preſerve it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You are to give a plain Anſwer, whether you are Guilty or Not Guilty, now for that you have no uſe of Papers: For you can beſt tell whether you be guilty or not. If you can propoſe any matter of Law that you can have to plead, do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>If I have any Plea, that I may Plead beſides Not Guilty, I deſire I may have my Papers to conſider of it, and that I may have Counſel aſſigned me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If you have any ſuch Plea, tell us the Matter and the Subſtance of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know what really are matters of Law, if I had thoſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in my Papers, I could give you a direct Anſwer preſently.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ought not to have any advice to decline your Tryal: When you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe matter of Law your ſelf, you may have advice upon it. But you ought not to have advice to decline your Tryal before-hand.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney, pray let me have a Copy of the Indictment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Apply your ſelf to the Court for it, we muſt receive our Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You have had the Opinion of the Court you can't have it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Levinz.</speaker>
               <p>You have been told nothing can be received from you, but a Plea of Guilty or not Guilty, and the Court have given you their Opinion, and that you cannot have a Copy of the Indictment, nor Counſel aſſigned you, till you offer ſomething for them to be aſſigned upon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>And that was it which was done in the King's Bench in the Caſe of <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> which I ſuppoſe you meant when you ſpake of the Judges Opinions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing was done there till he himſelf aſſigned the matter in Law that he would Plead, and then Counſel was aſſigned him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Colledge was in the Court at that time, and can tell what was done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If you deſire the Indictment read over again Diſtinctly that you may have.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, with all my heart.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Pray let me hear it again my Lord if you pleaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Read it over again to him, and read it Diſtinctly.</p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>Cl.</hi> of <hi>Cr.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Thou art indicted by the name of <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi> late of <hi>Oxon</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxon</hi> Carpenter, as a falſe Traytor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I have obſerved one thing already, my Lord, I pray I may have Pen and Ink.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay give him Pen and Ink, let him make what Obſervations he can.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>This Indictment, If I underſtand it, ſays, there was a Plot and Conſpiracy by me and others, now I know when my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi> was tryed they did proceed to prove, firſt, that there was ſuch a Plot, and then that my Lord was Guilty of it; firſt, that there was ſuch a Conſpiracy by the Papiſts, is it not requiſite they ſhould, firſt, prove ſuch a Plot and Conſpiracy there was, before they go to prove me Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When you have pleaded the next thing is to try you, and to give the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but what way the Kings Councel will take to mannage your Tryal, that we can't tell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>But they are not to be directed by you Mr. Colledge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>It was ſo done I ſay in my <hi>Lord Stafford</hi>'s Caſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Your Lordſhips are my Counſel as well as my Judges, and I do deſire if I have any right to plead any other matter, you will be pleaſed to declare it to me,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57458:7"/>
for I am ignorant in the Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>

               <p>Is it your Lordſhips Opinion, that I have no Plea in Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Have you no Plea in Law?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He would have our Judgment, whether there be any or no.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>You your ſelf know beſt, we know nothing you have to Plead.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I know nothing of the Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then Plead Not Guilty, that is a ready Plea.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>You have heard our Opinion over and over again. You have as much Counſel as is allowed in theſe Caſes, for every man is beſt Judge of his own Caſe, what to Plead, whether Guilty or Not Guilty; you have had as fair Play as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man had.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> has ſaid, he knows of no Plea in Law he has, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is none, for <hi>de non Apparentibus, &amp; non Exiſtentibus,</hi> the Reaſon is the ſame.</p>

               <p>In matter of Fact, there is no Plea but Not Guilty.</p>

               <p>The Court are Judges in matter of Law, and they are my Counſel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>And the Court have all of them declared they know of nothing in Law that you have to Plead.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Is not Counſel to be allowed to one under my Circumſtances?</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If you have any thing for Counſel to be aſſigned upon, you ſhall have them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>If I am Ignorant of that, and cannot Propoſe it, ſhall I not have the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Counſel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>No, we have told you the Law Plainly, and that which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Practiſe in like Caſes, and you muſt be contented with the ſame Meaſure.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then rely upon the fact and plead Not Guilty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>But if I have a right to any point in Law let me have it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>You have a right if you will propoſe any matter of Law, but we cannot propoſe it for you</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Colledge, no man ought to propoſe your Plea for you, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia juris non excuſat.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>You have heard the Opinion of the Court, you have a right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any other Plea that you can your ſelf, but you have no right to ask Counſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have pleaded.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</speaker>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> have ſuch a thing as a Solicitor, I ſhall crave leave to put that Solicitor in mind of the Caſe of one that was indicted of High Treaſon for Soliciting for one that was accuſed of High-Treaſon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>We ſhall talk of that by and by?</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>The ſame methods are uſed in your Caſe, as are in all Caſes of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as far as my knowledge reacheth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>If I have a right to the Law I muſt not loſe it for my own Ignorance of the Law, but if you deny me both my Counſel and my Papers, you take away the means of my coming to that right, and make me uncapable of making my defence.</p>

               <p>This is the Perſon, (pointing to a Perſon by him) that had the Papers. Be pleaſed to command him, that I may have them again; He ſaid he had Order to take them from me, and bring them to your Lordſhip.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it has not been uſual for us, that are of the Kings Counſel, to enter into Dialogues with Priſoners at the Bar. The firſt thing that is to be done in ſuch Caſes, is for the Priſoner to Plead Guilty, or Not Guilty, or to offer ſomething to the Court that may be a matter in Law fit to be debated; and this we pray may be done in this Caſe, and that the Priſoner may Plead preſently, or elſe we deſire your Judgment.</p>

               <p>You go in a Circle, and run round from one thing to another, and will receive no Anſwer. We have told you our Opinion, and we muſt tell you, that tho you hold long Diſcourſes, yet you will be Judged loſt and mute if you Plead not a Legal Plea. Therefore you muſt Plead Guilty, or Not Guilty, or offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be a Plea in Law, and then you ſhall have the Aſſiſtance of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but you muſt have none till then.</p>

               <p>Whether they are Material or not Material, If we ſhould judge them not Material for his defence, yet it will look like an hard point upon the Priſoner, and to deliver them into an hand that they may be carried away or ſtifled, in Caſe there were a Crime in the delivering of them that would not do well on the other ſide: Therefore I would have theſe Papers put into ſome ſafe hands, that what may be for the Priſoners uſe he may not want, and yet they may not be taken away, if there be occaſion to uſe them upon another Account.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>But if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I deſire you would enter into the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Matter; for I have an Account from <hi>London</hi> by a ſpecial Meſſenger that there are ſeveral Perſons that go up and down to procure Witneſſes againſt the Kings Evidence, making it a publick Cauſe; and here my Lord, another Paper which is a Liſt of men as Witneſſes picked up together againſt the King's Witneſſes.</p>

               <p>Look you Brother, we will have nothing of heat till the Tryal be over, when that is over if there be any thing that requires our Examination it will be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us to enter into the Conſideration of it. But in the mean while what hurt is there, If the Papers be put into ſome truſty hands, that the Priſoner may make the beſt uſe of them he can, and yet they remain ready to be produced upon occaſion, if a man be ſpeaking for his Life tho he ſpeak that which is not material, or nothing to the purpoſe that will be no harm to permit that.</p>

               <p>If people are permitted to go up and down and ask Counſel of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and bring it in Papers to the Priſoner, 'tis the ſame thing as if Counſel came to him. Here is a buſie Solicitor and he gets advice from Counſel and then he delivers it to the Priſoner, 'tis the firſt of the kind certainly that ever was allowed; and if this be not to aſſign him Counſel, I know not what is.</p>

               <p>Indeed I will not Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> becauſe you have broken it with me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, when I gave you Leave to go to the Priſon, I did not think you would have

               <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaid it not, meaning by it the Court, for I declare I abhor that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to be ſo interpreted, that I reflected upon the Court.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe I have been threatned ſince I came to Town, tho I have not ſpoke one Word in any publick Company ſince I came.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems you will reflect here in the Face of the Court, and in the Face of the Country, upon the Government, upon the Juſtice of the Kingdom.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>No my Lord, I have told you what I meant by it; I neither reflected upon the Court, nor upon the Government, nor upon the Juſtice of the Kingdom.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>One of them is a Speech, and a moſt ſeditious libellous Speech, to ſpit Venom upon the Government in the Face of the Country. We cannot tell who made it, but it ſeems to be beyond your Capacity: And therefore we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into it, but we do not think fit to let you have the uſe of that Paper.</p>

               <p>For that which contains the Names of the Witneſſes, that you have again: For the other matters, the Inſtructions in point of Law, if they had been written in the firſt Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in your own Name, that we might believe it was your Writing, it would have been ſomething; but when it is written in the ſecond Perſon, you ſhould do ſo and ſo; by which, it appears to be written by another Perſon; it is an ill Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to permit ſuch things; that were to give you Counſel in an indirect Way, which the Law gives you not directly.</p>

               <p>Some of thoſe things I took out of the Books my ſelf. And if you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take away all my Helps, I cannot help it, I know not that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> wrote one of thoſe Papers.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen that are Sworn, this is an Indictment againſt <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, for an Endeavour to raiſe a Rebellion within this Kingdom wherein he is accuſed, and the Jury find that he as a falſe Traitor againſt the Kings Majeſty, contrary to the duty or his Allegiance, on the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the 33<hi>d.</hi> year of the Kings Reign, at <hi>Oxon</hi> here did tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly Conſpire, and Compaſs the Death of the King, and the Subverſion of the Government, and to raiſe a Rebellion in the Kingdom, and to ſlaughter his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects, to put the King to Death, to Levy War againſt him, and to deprive him of his Royal State and Government, and to alter the Government at his own Will and Pleaſure, and to accompliſh this, he did at <hi>Oxon</hi> here prepare Arms for the carrying on the War, and excited one <hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> and others, to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the accompliſhment of this Deſign, and did declare his purpoſe was to Seize the Kings Perſon at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and that he was one of thoſe that was to do it; and to bring the ſaid <hi>Turbervile</hi> and other Subjects to his purpoſe, did Falſly, Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and Trayterouſly declare in their Hearing, that there was no good to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the King, that he minded nothing but the Deſtruction of his People, and Arbitrary Government, and to introduce Popery. And this is laid to be againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, againſt the Kings Peace, and againſt the form of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in thoſe Caſes made and provided. The Priſoner you hear upon his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath pleaded Not Guilty, which Iſſue you are to try, and if the Evidence for the King, which are ready to be produced, prove that which is laid to his Charge, you are to find it accordingly.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. The Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted of a very high Crime, no leſs then High Treaſon, and that too of the deepeſt Dye; it is for an Endeavour to deſtroy the King, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government, to raiſe a Rebellion amongſt the Kings Subjects. And Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, thoſe Inſtances that we ſhall give you, and produce our Evidence to for the Proof of that, are theſe. He laid his Deſign to Seize the King at <hi>Oxon</hi>; and he did not want his Accomplices to do it, but they were not Men, Gentlemen, that were Proteſtants, but Men that were Rebels in the late War, they were men of ſuch a Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that he aſſociated himſelf with, and theſe were the Perſons that were to aſſiſt in this Attempt. In order to this he had prepared Arms in an extraordinary manner, Arms of a great Value, for one of his Condition, who is by Trade a Joyner; for if a true Eſtimate were taken of the Value of the Arms, I believe they were worth twice his whole Eſtate; he prepared a good Horſe, extraordinary Piſtols, a Carbine, a Coat of Maile, an Head Piece, and ſo being armed Cap a-Pee, with that Deſign he came hither to <hi>Oxon.</hi> And you will judge whether theſe be fit Tools for a Joyner.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, theſe were the Particulars I was opening to you, in what manner he was armed, and how accoutred he came hither. We ſhall likewiſe ſhew you that he made it his Buſineſs to perſwade others to undertake the Deſign, and joyn with him, and as if open War were already Declared; he gave out a Sign which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57458:11"/>
was a blew Ribbon, a wrought Ribbon with Letters in it, and this was the mark and Sign, they were to know one another by. This was given out by him frequently; and that it may not ſeem an extraordinary thing, Gentlemen, tho indeed it was a wild attempt, yet you will ceaſe to wonder when you have heard of the Exploit of <hi>Venner</hi> who with a few men raiſed ſuch a Commotion, ſoon after the Kings coming in, and the ſeveral Exploits that have of late in <hi>Scotland</hi> been carried on, by a few diſcontented Perſons. So that men of the like Principles, as we ſhall give you an Account of this Gentlemans Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples what they were, may well be thought to ingage in ſuch an Extraordinary Exploit. And we ſhall prove what the incouragment was he was to have; for he boaſted of himſelf, that he ſhould be in a little time a Collonel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>A Collonel, a great preferment for a Joyner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Yes it was ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>We ſhall ſhew to you that this was not a ſudden unpre-meditated thing; for we ſhall prove that he had entertained the horrideſt Malice againſt the King, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Subject entertained againſt his Soveraign: For we ſhall give this Evidence, and his Front will not oppoſe it, that he had made it his common Diſcourſe in Coffee-Houſes, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Houſes, (and I believe I could bring you 40 and 40 Witneſſes to it) to defame the King and murder him in his Reputation, and was one of the Complices with <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> who lately was Executed for that venemous Libel: We ſhall prove that he juſtified it, and maintained it to be as true as the Goſpel. We ſhall give Evidence that he carried on the ſame Deſign, with that Arch-Traytor who was a Papiſt; and I believe if this Gentleman were Examined throughly he would be found to be one of the ſame Stamp, and acted by the ſame Principle; for I think that no Proteſtant Subject would attempt ſuch things as we ſhall prove to you. I believe Gentlemen you have frequently heard, as none of us but have, that the King hath been traduced as a deſigner of Arbitrary Government, and his Reputation blaſted Maliciouſly, and falſly, as an introducer of Popery: Whence comes all this generally, but out of the Popiſh Quiver, who make it their buſineſs to ſet the Kings good Subjects at variance amongſt themſelves; and againſt their Prince, by Styling the King a Papiſt as this Perſon hath done, nay, he hath been ſo impudent as to report that the King was in the Plot againſt his own Life. We ſhall prove to you, how here and at other places he hath frequently done this; to go further, we ſhall produce to you the Evidence that he drew the Kings Picture, and expoſed him in all the reproachful Characters imaginable, and that the Picture might be the better underſtood, he adds a Ballad to it: And that he may not have the Confidence to ſay this is not true, we ſhall produce to you a whole Bundle of theſe Papers, among thoſe which his Son made a Diſcovery of, when they were ſent to his Uncle to be hid, and we ſhall prove him to be the Author of them; and yet that this man ſhould have the Confidence to ſay he is a good Subject and a good Proteſtant, when by all ways imaginable he goes about to ruin the Government, and defame the King! And Gentlemen when we have given you this Account by Witneſſes, for I would have you believe me in nothing, but according as I prove it, you will not wonder then that he ſhould ſay his Life is in danger, (for ſo it is indeed?) And if any man ever was Guilty of High-Treaſon, ſure he is, and being Guilty of the greateſt Treaſon, he deſerves the ſevereſt Puniſhment.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have been I think acquainted with Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> 2 years or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. I have been ſeveral times in Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> Company, and truly ſomtimes he hath been mightily bent againſt Popery; he hath at ſomtimes uttered himſelf, becauſe the King did not proſecute the Papiſts according as he thought ſufficiently, that the King was a Papiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was as deep in the Plot as any Papiſt of them all, that he had an hand in Sr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury Godfry's</hi> Death. This Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> I appeal to your ſelf, whether you have not ſaid it: And in this Town of <hi>Oxford</hi> you have ſeveral times told me that nothing was to be expected from him, he would do nothing.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> did tell me that there was nothing to be expected from the King, but the introduceing of Popery and Arbitrary Government, this I believe Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> will acknowledge to be True.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale.</speaker>
               <p>It was his Common word concerning the King. And at other times ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the King did not do thoſe things that were fair, he hath given mighty great words againſt him: He hath told me that there was no truſt to be put in him; for it was the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we muſt truſt to, and we muſt look to Arm our ſelves, and that he would Arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and be here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and he told me here in the Town, accordingly when I came out of the Country, and he ſaid that he had ſeveral ſtout men that would ſtand by him in it. Their Intention was as he ſaid for the rooting out of Popery, by which name he alway termed the Church that is now Eſtabliſhed by Law, as to be of the ſame nature the Papiſts were. This I believe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> will acknowledge.</p>

               <p>And at a time when he had Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> at his Houſe, he told me that as for Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> he had much a do with him, and he had been at a great Charge to keep him in order, that he was forced to neglect his own buſineſs to look after him; for if he had not done ſo, the Rogue as he ſaid had a mind to fling all upon the Proteſtants that is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſenters, for he does not Count the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be ſo; that he had much a doe to keep him in order; for he had ſaid he had drawn Papers to that Purpoſe, but thoſe Papers are ſecured, for where they are I can't tell.</p>

               <p>I had a Warrant to ſeize Mr. <hi>Spur,</hi> and his Brother-in-Law Mr. <hi>Colledge.</hi> So I went down to ſeize Mr. <hi>Spur,</hi> and ſearch his Houſe for ſuch Papers as I ſhould find. I could not find them in the Houſe; but I enquired of him, after I had ſearched, and could not find them where they were; becauſe I ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>'s when we firſt ſearched; he denyed them a pretty while, but at laſt he told me they were in the Hay-mow in the Barn. When I came there, he was balling, and told me, his Wife, <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Siſter had taken them down, and carried them into a Room where I had ſearched before, but could not find them; and the man was angry then, ſo we run after his Wife, and found her with all theſe Papers in a Bag.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We were intimately acquainted. The firſt time I heard Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> diſcourſing any thing of this nature, that is, concerning Treaſon, or any ſuch thing, was once at a Coffee-houſe by <hi>Temple-Bar</hi>; there I met <hi>Colledge,</hi> and he told me he was invited to Dinner, and he likewiſe invited me to it. I asked him, who provided the Dinner, he told me it was one Alderman <hi>Wilcox,</hi> I told him I was a ſtranger, and did not care for going; he told me, I ſhould be very welcome there; and at laſt prevailed upon me to go: And as I was going along, I asked him what the Alderman was; he told me, he was a man that was as true as ſteel, and a man that would endeavour to root out Popery: ſaid I, That may be done eaſily, if you can but prevail with the King to paſs the Bill againſt the D. of <hi>York.</hi> No, no, ſaid he, you are miſtaken, for <hi>Rowley</hi> is as great a Papiſt as the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is, (<hi>now he called the King</hi> Rowley) and every way as dangerous to the Proteſtant Intereſt, as is too apparent by his Arbitrary ruling. This was the Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Coffee-Houſe and the Tavern where we went to dine. When we came in, I asked <hi>Colledge</hi> again, whether the Alderman was there; he ſaid he was not there at that time: I asked him, the ſecond time, what kind of man he was; he ſaid, he was one that lived in his Country-houſe, and gave freely to ſeveral People to buy Arms and Ammunition. And I asked him to what purpoſe? and he ſaid, it was, to bring the King to ſubmiſſion to his People; adding thereto, That he wondred <hi>Old Rowley</hi> did not conſider how eaſily his Fathers Head came to the Block, which he doubted not would be the end of <hi>Rowley</hi> at the laſt. After this Diſcourſe, the Alderman came in; we dined, and every one went his own way about his own Buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> then told me, if I would go with him to his own Houſe, I ſhould ſee how he was prepared with Arms and Proviſion. Soon after I met with him, and he deſired me to go along and dine with him; and I did ſo, and there he did ſhew me his Piſtols, his Blunderbuſs, his great Sword; and he ſhewed me his Armour, Back and Breaſt; and he ſhewed me his Head-piece, which, if I am not miſtaken, was covered over with Chamlet, it was a very fine, thing; and, ſaid he, Theſe are the things which will deſtroy the pittiful Guards of <hi>Rowley,</hi> that are kept up contrary to Law and Juſtice, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and Popery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What did I ſay, Sir, about my Armour?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Thus you ſaid; It was to deſtroy <hi>Rowley</hi>'s Guards, (thoſe were your words) that were kept up contrary to Law and Juſtice, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and Popery. After I had dined with him, I parted with him. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament was to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I met him again; and we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of ſeveral things, what preparations the City were making, how they were provided with Powder and Bullets, and for his part he would go down to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for he expected a little ſport there, upon the Diviſions that were like to be between the King and Parliament. Then ſaid I to him, Why, what is the matter there? Why, ſaid he, we expect that the King will ſeize upon ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and we are as ready as he. And, ſays he, for my part, I will be there, and be one that ſhall ſeize Him if he ſecure any of the Members, (and I believe he did go down); ſays he, you know how the City is provided: I told him, No, not ſo well as he; but he told me all was very well. After he came up again, I met him another time, and he told me, He went down in expectation of ſome ſport; but <hi>Old Rowley</hi> was afraid, like his Grand-father <hi>Jamy,</hi> and ſo ran away like to beſhit himſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>He ſaid nothing of that, but before, he ſaid, He would be one of them ſhould ſeize him, if he ſeized any of the Members. After this he told me, that <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi> and he had had a quarrel at the Parliament-Door of the Houſe of Lords at <hi>Oxford</hi>; that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had called him Rogue; and, ſaid he, <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> made my Noſe bleed; but before long, I hope to ſee a great deal more Blood ſhed for the Cauſe. After this again, when there was a diſcourſe of diſarming the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57458:17"/>
that my Lord <hi>Feverſham</hi> was to come to do it, he told me, he was well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and if <hi>Feverſham,</hi> or any man, nay <hi>Rowley</hi> himſelf ſhould attempt any ſuch thing, he would be the death of him, before any man ſhould ſeize upon his Arms.</p>

               <p>He told me, the Parliament were agreed to ſecure the King, and that in order to it, all Parliament-men came very well Armed, and accompanied with Arms and Men; and he told me of a great Man that had notice from all the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> how well they came armed.</p>

               <p>By the Ditch ſide, by your own Houſe; I have two or three to prove it, we were an hour or two diſcourſing together about this Buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What Buſineſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>He tells you of two Diſcourſes, one before you went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and one after you came from thence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>He does ſay, that I diſcourſed him about our coming down hither to <hi>Oxford,</hi> That the Parliament would ſecure the King, and that I would be one of them that ſhould ſeize him, and this was at the time when we dined with Alder. <hi>Wilcox.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch J.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo, he ſays after that time, and before you went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he had ſuch a diſcourſe with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, ſo it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>And does he ſpeak of another time when I ſhewed him the Back, Breaſt, and Arms?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>But he ſaid, I diſcourſed then, that the City was provided with Arms, and that the Parliament were reſolved to bring the King to ſubmiſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>When I was in the Houſe with him, he then ſaid Mr. <hi>Wilcox</hi> gave Mony to provide Arms: I asked for what? he ſaid, it was to bring the King to ſubmiſſion to his People; and then he added, he admired that <hi>Rowley</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how eaſily his Fathers Head came to the Block; and he doubted not but that would be the end of him too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>He ſpake of ſeveral times you know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I do not know one word of it, nor can diſtinguiſh the times: But, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the laſt diſcourſe you ſay about <hi>Oxford</hi> buſineſs, was by the Ditch ſide.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jefferies.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The diſcourſe about bringing the King to ſubmiſſion, was in the way as you went to dinner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The laſt diſcourſe when you returned from <hi>Oxford,</hi> was by the Ditch ſide; but both before and after you ſpake to me at that place about this deſign of bringing the King to ſubmiſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>You ſaid it was at <hi>Wilcox</hi>'s at Dinner.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jefferies.</hi>

               <p>Nay, Sir <hi>George,</hi> you took him not right.</p>

               <p>He is the falſeſt Man that ever ſpoke with a tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Attor. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Swear <hi>Bryan Haynes.</hi> (<hi>Which was done.</hi>) Tell my Lord, and the Jury, whether you know this Gentleman, what converſe you have had with him, and what diſcourſe he hath had with you. Apply your ſelf to Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> Buſineſs only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>I ſuppoſe he will not deny but that he knows me very well; I have been acquainted with him ever ſince <hi>March</hi> laſt, before the ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi> My Lord, there was a Warrant againſt me for High-Treaſon; and I made my application to Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and deſired him to go to a certain Perſon of Honour in <hi>England,</hi> and ask his advice, Whether I might ſuperſede the Warrant by putting in Bayl, and carry the <hi>Superſedeas</hi> in my Pocket: Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> told me he would go to this Perſon of Honour, for he would do nothing of his own head; and he bid me come to him the next day. My Lord, I came to Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> the very next day, and I met him at his Houſe, and I asked him what was the reſult, and what advice he had from that Perſon of Quality; he bid me be of good chear, that the Parliament would be, and fit at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſoon; that I ſhould not value the King a pin, for, ſaid he, the King is in a worſe condition than you or I; for you ſhall ſee, ſaid he, he ſhall be called to an account for all his Actions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jefferies.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>The King; for all the World may ſee, ſays he, that he does reſolve to bring in Arbitrary Power, and Popery: And, ſaid he, unleſs he will let the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſit at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſince he hath called them together, and put the People to charges
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57458:18"/>
in chuſing of them, and them in coming down, we will ſeize him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and bring him to the Block, as we did the Logger-head his Father. The Parliament ſhall ſit at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and adjuſt the Grievances of the Subject, and of the Nation. And you ſhall ſee, ſaid he, that no King of his Race ſhall ever reign in <hi>England</hi> after him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>Where was this he ſaid ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>At his own Houſe I met him; and he and I did walk all along from his own Houſe, over the Bridge that is againſt <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and ſo went all along till we came to the Hercules-Pillars, and we had ſome diſcourſe there; we went up one pair of ſtairs and called for ſome Beef; and all this diſcourſe was in that very place of the Hercules Pillars.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Holloway.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Do you know any thing of any Arms he had, and for what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, ſaid I to Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> how can this be done, 'tis a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. You pretend, you ſay, to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> that he is a fine Prince, and ſtands up for the Proteſtant Intereſt: Alas, ſaid he, we make an Idol of him to adumbrate our Actions, for fear we ſhould be diſcovered. Do you think the wiſe People of <hi>England</hi> ſhall ever make a Baſtard upon Record King of <hi>England</hi>; No, ſaid he, for tho' we praiſe his Actions, yet we cannot endure him, becauſe he is againſt his own Father. But, ſaid he, further, unleſs the King do expel from his Council the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> cunning <hi>Lory Hide</hi>; the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> that great turn coat Rogue, that was before ſo much againſt the Papiſts, a Raſcal, we ſhall ſee him hang'd, and all the <hi>Tory</hi> Counſellors; except the King do it, we will make <hi>England</hi> too hot for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Who did I ſay this to? to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, how could this be poſſible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you knew my condition; and I intimated to you at that time, That I was as much for Treaſon and Villany as you: But then ſaid I to him, how can this be done? Here you have neither Officers, nor Men of Experience, nor Men of Knowledg; nor you have no Ammunition, Sea-port Towns, nor Ships. And beſides, the King, ſaid I, hath a great Party in the Land, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> likewiſe; and for all the Men of Eſtates, and the Ancient Gentlemen, they will not be diſturbed, and to quit their Eaſe for a Civil War. Oh, ſays he, you are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for we have in the City 1500 Barrels of Powder, and we have 100000 Men ready at an hours warning; and we have ordered every thing in a due method a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi>; and you ſhall ſee <hi>England</hi> the moſt glorious Nation in the World, when we have cut oft that beaſtly fellow <hi>Rowley</hi>; and ſpeaking of the King, he ſaid, he came of the Race of Buggerers, for his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, King <hi>James,</hi> buggered the old Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>; and he called him <hi>Captain,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>King,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Rowley.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jefferies.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>This was pure Proteſtant diſcourſe upon my word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haynes.</speaker>
               <p>Then he railed at Judg <hi>Pemberton</hi>; and, ſaid he, let him try <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> if he dare; I ſhall ſee him go to <hi>Tyburn</hi> for it, I hope, a Turn-coat Rogue. He was for the Plot whilſt he was <hi>puiſne</hi> Judge, but now he is Chief Juſtice, he is the greateſt Rogue in the World. He is like one of the Pentioners in the long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So one day I went along with Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> and he ſent a Man to me, and deſired me to come to the Hog in Armor; thither we came, and met him, and went to his Lodgings, and there we dined. Then they made ſome Perſons of Honour believe, that I was a Perſon ſo and ſo qualified, and was brim full of the Plot; and he would put me upon charging the King with the firing of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the murder of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and, ſaid he, ſuch and ſuch Lords ſhall live and die by you; and beſides, ſaid he, you need not fear <hi>England</hi> ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe your Cauſe. But, ſaid I, the Law is like a Spiders Web, that catches the little Flies, but the great Flies run through the Net, and make their eſcape; ſo 'tis with theſe Lords, they put you and me on the danger of acting; and when they get off by intereſt, a Jury of 12 Men will hang us by the Neck, and ſo I ſhould periſh, whilſt others triumphed, and only be a Martyr for the Phanaticks. So in diſcourſe we were talking of the Libel of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>; The Devil take me, ſaid he, every individual word is as true as God is in Heaven, and, ſaid he, if you do not joyn with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in his Evidence, and charge the King home, you are the baſeſt fellow in the World, for he makes you ſlaves and beggars, and would make all the World ſo; and 'tis a kind of charity to charge him home, that we may be rid of ſuch a Tyrant.</p>

               <p>But, my Lord further, after he came from <hi>Oxon.</hi> I met him, and ſaid I, Where are now all your Cracks and Brags? now you ſee the King hath made a Fool of you; now you know not what you would have done. Sayes he, What would you have us do? We have not done with him yet: for, ſaid he, no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, no man living did know whether he would Diſſolve the Parliament that day. I was that very nick of time at the <hi>Lobby</hi> of the Lords Houſe, and there was a man came in with a Gown under his Arm, and every one looked upon him to be a Taylor, and no body did ſuſpect, no not his intimateſt Friends, except it were <hi>Fitz Girald,</hi> that he would Diſſolve the Parliament that day; but preſently he puts on his Robes, and ſends away for the Houſe of Commons; and when he had Diſſolved them, before ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Houſe could get down, he took Coach and went away, otherwiſe the Parliament had been too hard, for him; for there was never a Parliament-Man but had divers armed men to wait on him, and I had my Blunderbuſs and my man to wait upon me. But well, ſaid he, there is a God above will rule all.</p>

               <p>When the Parliament ſat in <hi>Oxon,</hi> about the middle of the week, I can't be poſitive in the day, but I think it was in the middle of the Week I dined with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> Captain <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Don Lewes</hi> Clerk of <hi>Derby-Houſe</hi> at the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Inn.</hi> After Dinner <hi>Don Lewes</hi> went out about ſome buſineſs, and Captain <hi>Brown</hi> went to ſleep; Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and I fell talking of the Times, and I was obſerving, I thought the Parliament was not a long lived Parliament.

               <p>When the Parliament ſat at <hi>Oxon</hi> about the middle of the Week, I cannot be poſitive to a day; I believe it was either <hi>Wedneſday</hi> or <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> I Dined with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> Capt. <hi>Browne,</hi> and <hi>Don Lewes,</hi> who was formerly Clerk of <hi>Derby</hi> Houſe. <hi>Don Lewes</hi> after Dinner went out, and Capt. <hi>Browne</hi> laid him down on the Bed, and Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and I fell a talking of the Times, and I told him, I thought this Parliament would be no Long-Lived Parliament. Upon which <hi>Colledge</hi> told me the King and all his Family were Papiſts, and there was no good to be expected from him. Then I replyed, The King would perhaps Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Parliament, or uſe ſome Stratagem to bring them to his Terms. Said Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> again, I would he would begin; but if he do not, we will ſecure him till he comes to thoſe Terms we would have from him; for here are ſeveral Brave Fellows, and many more are coming down that will joyn with it.</p>

Said I, I wonder how you have the Impudence to juſtify their Proceedings that raiſed the Rebelion againſt the King, and cut off his head. Said he, They did nothing but what they had juſt Cauſe for, and the Parliament that ſate laſt at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was of their Opinion, and ſo you would have ſeen it.</p>

               <p>My Lord, The firſt time that I heard any thing of Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> was, there was ſome Company looking upon a Picture, for I knew him not, nor never had any word of diſcourſe with him in my life any more then ſeeing him in a publick Coffee-houſe. But there was a Picture looking on by 7 or 8 or 10 Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I believe more or leſs, and I coming and crowding in my head amongſt the reſt, looked upon this Picture. After the Crowd was over, Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> takes a Picture out of his Pocket, and ſaid he, I will give you one of them if you will. So he gives me a Picture; which Picture if I could ſee, I could tell what it was; it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Mac a Top,</hi> and there were ſeveral Figures in it.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Then the Picture was ſhewed him.</hi>)</p>
               <p>This is one of the ſame that I had of him, and I had not had it long in my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, but meeting with Juſtice <hi>Warcupp,</hi> I ſhewed it him, who bid me give it him, and ſo I did. The next thing that I did ſee Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> do, was in the Coffee-houſe, not the ſame day, but another time. I ſaw him bring in a parcel of blew Ribband which was wrought, and theſe words eight times wrought in it, twice wrought in every Quarter of a Yard, <hi>No Popery, No Slavery.</hi> I ſaw him ſell to a Member of Parliament, as I took him to be, a yard of that Ribband for 2 s. and truly I was thinking he would ask me to buy ſome too, and I ſaw that Gentleman (I took him to be a Parliament man) take this Ribband and tye it upon his Sword. As to the other thing I have to ſay of Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>; That very day the Parliament was Diſſolved, he had been in a Quarrel, as he told me, with Mr. <hi>Fitz Girald</hi>; and I was ſtanding in the Schoole-houſe Yard, and he comes directly to me without my ſpeaking to him or any thing; but he comes and tells me Mr. <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> had ſpit in his face, and, ſaid he, I ſpit in his face again; ſo we went to Loggerheads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I think that was the word, or fifty Cuffs. So, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> your Noſe bleeds; he takes his handkerchief out of his Pocket and wipes his Noſe, and ſaid, I have loſt the firſt blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be long before more be loſt.</p>

               <p>In the Schoole-houſe Yard at <hi>Oxon.</hi> I never diſcourſed with him afterwards till I met him at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Fleet-Street</hi> one <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon, and I remember Captain <hi>Creſcett</hi> was along with me. And when he came up to me, How now, ſaid I, honeſt Joyner? Sayes he, You call me honeſt Joyner, ſome call me Rogue and Raſcal, and I have been beating ſome of them. So that I believe they will be aware of it. So I told Captain <hi>Creſcett</hi> I never met this man but he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a Quarrel.</p>

But I declare to you upon the whole memory of the truth, the words were as I ſpoke them at firſt, and no Parliament named or mentioned. And, my Lord, moreover, I will tell you, When I did tell this ſtory, becauſe Mr. <hi>Creſcett</hi> that is here is able to tell you whether I did not relate the words within half an hour, or a little time after. Now I never had a prejudice againſt you in my days, nor other Concern, but having told Mr. Juſtice <hi>Warcupp</hi> this Story, I am brought hither to teſtifie it.</p>

The Seizing the Perſon of the King, is in Law a Compaſſing and Intending his Death; and ſo it hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in ſeveral Caſes, as in 1 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and my Lord <hi>Greys</hi> Caſe, and ſeveral other Caſes; and ſo you may fully apprehend what the Charge is, and may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words in the Indictment, That if you are not ſatisfied with the general words of Compaſſing the King's Death, you may know, that the Seizing his Perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have heard this Evidence that is againſt me, and I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Lordſhip to reſolve me ſome Queſtions upon it. I think the Indictment is for Treaſonable Practices, for a Conſpiracy; now I deſire your Lordſhip will be pleaſed that I may know from you and the Court, whether in all this Evidence given in proof againſt me, a Conſpiracy is proved; or if any thing appears beſides what they ſay I ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>For a Conſpiracy in you, If the Witneſſes ſpeak Truth, there is a plain proof, and of the degrees of it: Firſt of all, By your publiſhing Libels and Pictures to make the King Odious and Contemptible in the Eyes of the People, and that you ſhould be the Author of ſome of thoſe Pictures, and they were found in your Cuſtody.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>

               <speaker>L. Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> Swears, That at <hi>Oxford</hi> here, you ſhew'd him the Picture, you ſung the Song here, and expounded it at my Lord <hi>Lovelace's,</hi> and a great many of them are found in your Cuſtody. Then that you prepared Armes, that you ſhew'd <hi>Smith</hi> the Arms in your Houſe, and having thoſe Arms, you ſaid, You would go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and if there ſhould be a diſturbance there, you would ſecure the King. And you did come to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where you hear what is ſaid; for I Obſerve, <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> ſpeak of what was done at <hi>Oxford. John Smith</hi> and <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> ſpeak of what you ſaid at <hi>London</hi> before you went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and after you came from <hi>Oxford.</hi> Now I ſay, If theſe Witneſſes ſpeak true, 'tis a ſtrong Evidence againſt you, both upon the Statute of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and that of this King too. For my Brother <hi>Holloway</hi> told you true, That whereas the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Death of the King is High Treaſon, by the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> ſo a Seizing of the King, and an endeavor to do that, is a conſtructive Intention of the Death of the King; for Kings are never Priſoners, but in order to their Death. And therefore it hath been held in all times, that by the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> that was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but then the Statute of this King, in the 13 Year of his Reign, is more ſtrong; for there it ſays, If any man ſhall by any words or malitious ſpeaking ſhew the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his Heart, that he hath any ſuch Intention, that is Treaſon too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Foundation of this Indictment is ſaid to be laid here in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as I ſuppoſe; pray, my Lord, here is only Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that Swear againſt me for what I ſhould ſay in <hi>Oxon</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the reſt ſpeak to things ſaid and done at <hi>London.</hi> Now, my Lord, I deſire to know, whether they have proved any Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Practices, Conſpiracy or Deſign in me againſt the Government, I would feign know that, whether there be matter here to ground an Indictment upon; for the one ſays in one place, the other in the other, which may be diſtinct matters, and none of them Swear Facts againſt me, but only Words.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>That I ſhall make this Anſwer to, I had only a Caſe of Piſtols and a Sword, which every Footman and Horſeman had, that came from <hi>London,</hi> I think. But further my Lord, I would ask your Lordſhip, whether there ought not to be two Witneſſes diſtinct, to Swear words at one and the ſame time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſtice Jones.</speaker>
               <p>No, No, the Reſolution of the Judges in my Lord <hi>Stafford's</hi> Caſe, is contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, It hath been often Reſolved, That if there be one Witneſs that proves one Fact which is an Evidence of Treaſon, and another proves another Fact, that is an Evidence of the ſame Treaſon, tho' they be but ſingle Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to ſeveral Facts, yet they are two Witneſſes to an Indictment of Treaſon; that hath been often publickly Reſolved, particularly in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by my Brother. And I'le tell you my Opinion further, If there be one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that proves here what you ſaid at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and another that proves what was ſaid in <hi>London,</hi> if they be in order to the ſame Treaſon, it is ſufficient; for if you do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to commit ſuch a Treaſon in <hi>London,</hi> and you come with ſuch an Imagination in your Heart to <hi>Oxford</hi> to compleat this Treaſon, tho' your deſign was not firſt formed there, I think 'tis enough to maintain an Indictment of Treaſon, and they are two good Witneſſes, tho' but one ſpeak to what was done at <hi>Oxford</hi>; but I muſt tell you, in your Caſe, there are two full Witneſſes to that which was done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> beſides Sir <hi>William Jennings.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>The Parliament was Diſſolved before that which Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> ſpeaks of, therefore you could not ſay it was to defend the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did ſay that I ſpake ſuch and ſuch words in the Barber's Shop in the <hi>Angel Inne</hi>; there I was indeed at the time that he does ſpeak of, and the Barber was by, I do think, indeed it were convenient to have him here; but I knew not where he would charge me, or what it was he would charge me with, becauſe I never ſaid any thing in my Life that was like Treaſon.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
               <p>No, complicated with the Fact, which was the Overt-Act, the coming to <hi>Oxon.</hi> with Piſtols to make one if there had been any diſturbance, and to Seize the King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Then, my Lord, I would ask you, Whether any Act of Treaſon done at <hi>London,</hi> ſhall be given in Evidence to prove the Treaſon for which I am now Indicted, and which was given in Evidence before the Grand Jury, upon which the Tryal was there grounded.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Lord Ch. Just.</speaker>
               <p>Any Act of Treaſon that is of the ſame kind. And I'le tell you, That was Reſolved in Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Caſe; thoſe that gave you that Paper underſtand it. But I ſpeak now to your Capacity, and to ſatisfie your Queſtion. He was Indicted for Levying Warr againſt the King, he Conſpired in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the War was Levyed in another County; the Conſpiracy upon the Tryal was proved in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Warr in another place, and yet it was held ſufficient to maintain the Indictment in the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

And then there are two other Witneſſes, <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Bryan Haynes,</hi> they do not tell you of any thing done at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but they tell you what you ſaid in their hearing of what you had done in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and ſo I think if the Witneſſes are to be believed, there is a very full proof againſt you.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I do not queſtion but to prove this one of the Helliſheſt Conſpiracy that ever was upon the face of the Earth, and theſe the moſt notorious wicked men, an abſolute deſign to deſtroy all the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> that have had the Courage to oppoſe the Popiſh Plot. In which no man of my condition hath done more then I have done. I was bred a Proteſtant, and continued ſo hitherto, and by the grace of God I will dye ſo. If that they had known of theſe words that I ſhould ſpeak, and ſuch a Deſign that I ſhould have before the Parliament ſat at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and be with me in <hi>Oxon</hi> when the Parliament ſat, if they had been good Subjects, they ought to have had me apprehended. <hi>Turbervile</hi> came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times indeed, and dined with me. I did not bid him go out of Doors, nor invited him thither; he was a man I had no diſreſpect for, Nay he was a man I valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking he had done the Nation ſervice againſt the Papiſts, that this man ſhould hear me ſpeak ſuch words againſt his Majeſty, who was then in this Town, and know of ſuch a dangerous Deſign to attempt the ſeizing his Perſon, or that I ſhould Diſcover a great Party that were ready to do it, I think there is ſcarce any man of reaſon, but will ſay, if this were really done and ſpoken by me, neither of them would or ought to have concealed it but diſcover it, none of them has ever charged me with any ſuch thing, they have been in my Company ſince. I never had any Correſpondence with any of them but <hi>Dugdale,</hi> then pray conſider how improbable it is, that I ſhould talk of ſuch things to Papiſts, Prieſts, and <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men, who have broke their faith, with their own Party, that faith which they gave under the penalty of Damnation, Men that have been concerned in Plots and Treaſons, to murder and cut the Throats of Proteſtants, that I ſhould be ſuch a Madman to truſt theſe People, when I could receive no manner of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from them, nor could give any Truſt to them, they having before broke their Faith; eſpecially, conſidering I could lay no ſuch Oaths and Obligations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, who was a Proteſtant; then 'tis the greateſt Non-ſenſe, to believe that I would ſay theſe things before Perſons whom I could never hope would conceal my Treaſons, having diſcovered their own. If they ſpeak Truth concerning the general Popiſh Plot, that could be no Obligation upon me, to truſt them with another; and they cannot ſay, that they ever obliged me in any one reſpect. My Lord, I thank God I have had ſome Acquaintance in the World, and have been concerned with ſome perſons of Honour, Noblemen, and Parliament men, that I know are as good Subjects as any his Majeſty has; theſe never found me a Fool, nor a Raſcal, ſo great a Knave, as to have any ſuch Thoughts in my Heart, nor ſo great a mad-man, or ſo fooliſh, as to go to diſcover them to Papiſts, Prieſts, and <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men, to men of their Condition, that were ready to ſtarve for Bread. As for <hi>Haynes</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> that run ſo faſt through all their Evidence, the firſt time that ever I ſet my Eyes on <hi>Haynes,</hi> was in the Coffee-houſe that he ſpeaks of; <hi>Macnamarra</hi> comes in, and deſires me to go out with him, and I ſhould hear the greateſt Diſcovery of a piece of Villany againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life, that ever I heard in my Life. This Captain <hi>Brown</hi> who is now dead, a man that I had not known but a Month before, (for I think it was in <hi>March</hi> laſt when this was) could teſtifie for me; for, I came to him, Captain, ſaid I, here is a Diſcovery of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be made to me, of a Deſign to take away my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Life. <hi>Macnamarra</hi> asks me to go to the <hi>Hercules Pillars,</hi> I went along with him, and took Captain <hi>Brown</hi> with us. Afterwards he fell ſick in <hi>April,</hi> and is now dead, ſo I loſſed a main Evidence in the Caſe. He was the only man that was by at the time; God knows my Heart, I ſpeak nothing but the Truth, I took him with me, <hi>Haynes</hi> began to diſcover to us, that <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> had employed him to fetch
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57458:23"/>
over <hi>Macnamarra,</hi> and if he would come in, and Swear againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which was his Deſign, it would not be long e're his Head were taken off, and he ſaid, He had given in a Paper of High Treaſon agaiſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> I asked what it was, he told me, That my Lord ſhould tell <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> that he had a Deſign to bring this Kingdom to a Common Wealth, and to rout out the Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi> This he ſaid, <hi>Fitz Girald</hi> had given in in a Paper, under his own hand; and I think he ſaid, He had Sworn it, and ſent <hi>Haynes</hi> to fetch <hi>Macnamarra</hi> to Swear againſt my Lord the ſame things too. I writ down all the heads of the diſcourſe which Captain <hi>Brown</hi> heard as well as I, after he had ſaid it, he deſired us to conceal it, Sir ſaid I, You are a ſtranger to me, and theſe are great and ſtrange things that you do tell us, <hi>Macnamarra</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> and others were there, which (if they were honeſt men) they would come and Teſtifie. I thought them honeſt men, and that they had none of thoſe wicked Deſigns in their Hearts, that now I find they have. So ſays <hi>Haynes, I do not know this man,</hi> meaning me; <hi>Macnamarra</hi> told him, <hi>I was an honeſt man, he might lay his Life in my hands.</hi> After he had ſpoken all this, he deſired us to conceal it; Said he, <hi>I will not only diſcover this, but a great deal more of their Rogeries that I know very well</hi>; Said I to him again, <hi>I will not conceal it, nor do you no wrong, for if this be true, my Lord of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>ſhall know it to night; for where there is a deſign to take away a Peer of the Realm, I will not conceal it; but if it be falſe, and you have ſaid more then comes to your ſhare, Recant it again, and we will take no notice of it, only ſay you are a Knave for ſpeaking of it; he Swore Dam him it was all true, that, and a great deal more, which he ſaid he knew, about Seizing and Deſtroying the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at</hi> Oxon, <hi>about an Army in the</hi> North <hi>that was to be Raiſed about the time of the Sitting of the Parliament at</hi> Oxon, <hi>of a</hi> French <hi>Army that was to Land in</hi> Ireland <hi>at the ſame time, that the Duke of</hi> York <hi>was to be at the Head of them, and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, to deſtroy all the Proteſtants.</hi> Upon this, I was Reſolved, if I lived, to come along with the Parliament, and if there was any ſuch Deſign, I was Reſolved to Live and Die with them, but I had no more then Common Arms, a Sword and a Caſe of Piſtols, my Cap was a Velvet Cap, and nothing elſe. My Lord, I had the Honor to be ſent for, when the Parliament Sat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Seſſions in <hi>October,</hi> it was an Honourable occaſion, and I thank thoſe worthy Gentlemen that ſent me for the Honor of it, there I begun to be popular as to my Name, for from that time they began to call me the Proteſtant Joyner, becauſe the Parliament had intruſted me. My Lord <hi>Crey</hi> was pleaſed to ſend his Footman for me to the <hi>Crown Tavern</hi> behind the <hi>Exchange,</hi> where there were ſeveral worthy Lords, Peers of the Realm, and One Hundred of the Commons, that had Dined there that Day, it was the Day before they Sat; after they had Dined I came to them, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told me, They had heard a good Report of me, that I was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that underſtood Building, and they did Confide in me to ſearch under the Parliament Houſe; they did not really know of any Deſign, but they would not be ſecure, there might be ſome Tricks play'd them by the Papiſts, tho' we are not afraid of them, ſaid the Duke, yet we think fit to employ you to ſearch under the Houſes, and thereabouts, whether you can find any ſuch Practices. So accordingly my Lord, I did go, my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> was one of the Honourable Lords, and my Lord <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> that went with me, and ſome of the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons; and thoſe worthy Proteſtant Lords were pleaſed to thank me for my Service, and did believe I was Active and Zealous to find out and diſcover the bottome of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, ſo far as it came legally in my way to do it. My Lord, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was a great kindneſs from them to me, and I had upon all occaſions Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of it; and this very man who now Swears Treaſons againſt me (which God Almighty knows is all falſe) did Swear in his Affidavit before Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> the Recorder of <hi>London</hi> (I did never ſee the Affidavit, indeed I was over night at Sir <hi>George Treby</hi>'s, but he was not then at leiſure, but he drew it up next day, and Swore it) that there was a Deſign to deſtroy the Parliament at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and there was not only his Oath for it, but it was the general belief, that ſome Evil was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them. All men had cauſe to fear and to ſuſpect, the Papiſts did bear them no great good Will; and making uſe of their own Obſervations, they were generally Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Piſtol, or a Sword, for themſelves, in caſe they ſhould be Attack'd by the Papiſts. In order to this, I did come down with my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> my Lord of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57458:24"/>
                  <hi>Clare,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Pagett,</hi> thoſe four worthy Proteſtant Lords; and it was two days after the Parliament was ſat, that we came, and I went out of Town again with my Lord <hi>Lovelace,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>; and I am ſure, they were all in ſo great a Fear that <hi>London</hi> ſhould be ſurprized and ſeized on by the Papiſts, but there was no mortal man that ever heard of the Kings being ſeiſed, or thought of it, till theſe men come and tell me, that I had ſuch a Deſign, and came hither with that purpoſe; but my Lord, I declare as God is my Judge, I would not have it thought I ſpeak it to ſave my Life, were it as certainly a Truth, as 'tis moſt wickedly a Falſhood, that I had had a deſign to ſeize the King, I know not of one man upon the Face of the Earth, that was to ſtand by me, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man, or other perſons whatſoever; And how it is poſſible for me to attempt that, being a ſingle Perſon, with only a Sword and a Caſe of Piſtols, let any man judge. And I do declare, I know of no Conſpiracy nor Deſign, againſt the King or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I never ſpoke one of the Treaſonable Words in my Life, that is laid againſt me, nor had ever any Thoughts of any ſuch thing. God that is my Eternal Judge, knows, that what I ſpeak is true.</p>

               <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> will you call your Witneſſes, for I muſt tell the Jury as I did at your requeſt, concerning Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> that as nothing he ſaid, ſo nothing you ſay is to be believed upon your own Allegation; for then no man would ever be guilty, if his own Purgation by words were to be believed.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I thank God, I know my own Innocency, and hope to prove it. I have a Soul that muſt live to Eternity, either in Joy or Miſery, I act according to thoſe principles, and I hope I have ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of my own ſalvation when I dye, I would not call God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a Lye, to ſave 1000 lives. My Lord, this is a villanous Conſpiracy againſt me, and if it take place againſt me, it may go a great way, God knows how far, This is the 17<hi>th</hi> or 18<hi>th</hi> Sham Plot the Papiſts have made againſt the Proteſtants, to get over their own; but I hope my Lord God Almighty will never ſuffer it. If they can make me a Traytor, they will try it upon others, and ſo hope to ſham off their own Treaſons; but I ſay, I hope God Almighty will never ſuffer it. My Lord, I think the firſt Witneſs that ſwore againſt me was Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>; and I muſt call my Witneſſes as I have them here, I know no perſon of them hardly, and this that is done for my defence was done abroad. My Lord, I have been kept cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and none of them ſuffered to come to me, whilſt the Popiſh Lords have had the Liberty and Priviledg to talk with their friends. Here are Witneſſes I hope will prove that theſe are Suborned men, for <hi>Macnamarra</hi> did tell me preſently after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broke up at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and whiſpered it to me in the Coffee-houſe, Said he, there is a Deſign laid to make us retract our Evidence, and go over to <hi>Fitz Girald.</hi> Said I, I ſuppoſe they have been at that ſport a great while. Ah, ſaid he, they make large offers. Said I, by whom? Said he, Colonel <hi>Warcupp</hi> hath been at me, and he tells me—</p>

               <p>Another time he came to ſpeak with my Tenant Mrs. <hi>Scot,</hi> who is now gone into <hi>Ireland</hi>; when he came to the houſe, he asked me, is Mrs. <hi>Scot</hi> within? Yes, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> ſhe is above; and up he goes, and there they locked the door, and plucked out the key; ſo I ſlipt off my Shoes, for I thought there might be more danger from ſuch people than I could diſcover any other way. So I went up ſtairs, and ſtood at the door, and hearkned, hearing my Land-lady talk ſomething to him, he wraps out a great Oath, <hi>God dam me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I care not what I ſwear, nor who I ſwear againſt; for 'tis my Trade to get money by ſwearing.</hi> Whereupon, my Lord, I came down as faſt as I could, and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſaw him go out, and as ſoon as my Land-lady came down, ſaid I, Mrs. <hi>Scot</hi> I deſire you would provide your ſelf as ſoon as you can; I would be civil to you, and I would not put you to a Non-plus, becauſe your Goods by the Law will be ſeized for not departing according to the King's Proclamation. So a while ago ſince this buſineſs of <hi>Haynes</hi>'s ſwearing againſt my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> I bethought my ſelf of ſome other buſineſſes I had heard: To find out the Knavery I went to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> where he hath a very ill Character as well amongſt the Papiſts as the Proteſtants. Whereupon I asked one fellow that was a kind of a Porter, if he knew any thing of him; ſaid he, Go you to ſuch an one—</p>

               <p>I had little diſcourſe, but what he ſaid of himſelf.

<q>Whereas one <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Thompſon</hi> had falſely and maliciouſly accuſed one <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> for ſpeaking Treaſonable Words; he the ſaid <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> doth declare that he challenges any Man to charge him with it: but he owned he had an hand, or was employed to put the Plot upon the diſſenting Proteſtants.</q>

and he came down to the Cellar which I had taken of the Marſhal to ſell Drink in; and coming down to drink in one of the Rooms of the Cellar that belong to me, he took away a Tankard, and went up with it. One of the Men followed him up; ſo I went to the Marſhal to complain, and told him of it: and the Marſhal took him from the Maſter's Side, and put him into the Common Side. That is all I know of him any way, directly or indirectly.</p>

With that, ſaid I, I do not care if I do. And the firſt thing he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan was the King's Health, then the Queens, then the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s; then he fell very foul againſt the Grand Jury, becauſe they had not found the Bill againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> who is a Gentleman that I never ſaw before in my life but once, as I know of: and he ſaid, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was a little Toad, but he would do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very ſuddenly. Then he railed upon the Parliament, and ſaid they were a Company of Rogues, they would give the King no Money, but he would help him to Money enough out of the Phanaticks Eſtates. And he ſaid, they would damn their Souls to the Devil before the Catholick Cauſe ſhould ſink.</p>

               <p>One thing more, my Lord. On <hi>Monday</hi> laſt I was at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and a Gentleman ſent his Man on purpoſe to let me know I muſt go to <hi>Colebrook,</hi> and ſtay till they came thither. When I came there, I met <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> at the <hi>Crown</hi>-Kitchin-Window, and he was ſtirring a Glaſs of Brandy, and ſweetning it with Sugar. Said he, Sir, will you drink? Here is the King's Health to you: So I drank, and I asked him how he did? Do you know me, Sir, ſaid he? Yes, ſaid I, I drank with you once. Says he, you have a good Memory. So then a Pint of Sack was called for, and after that another, and then came down Mrs. <hi>Peacock</hi>; and being very fine, all in her Flower'd Silks, I asked what Gentlewoman that was? Said he, It is Mrs. <hi>Fitz-harris.</hi> No, ſays I, it is not; they ſay ſhe is gone. But, ſaid he, it is her Maid; and Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> is to marry her. As I have a Soul to ſave, I tell you nothing but what is truth. Thereupon, ſaid I, Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> is able to maintain her; he hath a good Eſtate. But, ſaid he, it ſhall be the King's e'er long.</p>

               <p>So with that, my Lord, if it pleaſe your Honour, I clapped my Groat down at the Bar, and went out of the Room. Nay, ſaid he, let us have one Health more: and ſo he had his Tankard, and I had mine.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> I will tell you ſomething for Law; and to ſet you right; whatſoever Witneſſes you call, you call them as Witneſſes to teſtifie the truth for you; and if you ask them any Queſtions, you muſt take what they have ſaid as truth: therefore you muſt not think to ask him any Queſtion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards call another Witneſs to diſprove your own Witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>I ask him, was he the firſt time with us, when I was called out of the Coffee-houſe to hear <hi>Haynes</hi>'s Diſcovery?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Let him anſwer you if he will, but you muſt not afterwards go to diſprove him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>If he were ſworn againſt me, I would not ask him any Queſtions, for he is among them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>

               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>I deſire not if he have ſworn againſt me, for truly I can't expect a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him; but he was by when <hi>Haynes</hi> made his Diſcovery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Will you ask him any Queſtions?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>I ask whether he hath given any Evidence againſt me any where?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Tell him if you have.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Then I think he is no good Witneſs for me, when he hath ſworn againſt me.</p>

               <speaker>Ivy.</speaker>
               <p>I have ſworn againſt him and others. You know that you and I have had a great many Intrigues about this buſineſs in hand, and how we dealt with Mr. <hi>Haynes.</hi>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you; he does not call you for a Witneſs for him, you can teſtifie nothing, and ſo you muſt be quiet.</p>

               <p>As to <hi>Turbervile,</hi> my Lord, a little before the Witneſſes were ſworn at the <hi>Old Bayley,</hi> I met with Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi>; I was in a Coach, but ſeeing Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> I ſtept out of the Coach, and ſpoke with him; for, hearing that he was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I did ask him whether he was a Witneſs, or no, againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> ſaid, he would break any one's head that ſhould ſay ſo againſt him; for he neither was a Witneſs, nor could give any Evidence againſt him. So, after he came from <hi>Oxon,</hi> I met with Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> again; and, hearing he had been there, I asked him if he had ſworn any thing againſt <hi>Colledge?</hi> He ſaid, Yes, he had been ſworn before the Grand Jury. Said I, did not you tell me ſo and ſo? Why, ſaid he, the Proteſtant Citizens have deſerted us; and, <hi>God damn him,</hi> he would not ſtarve.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſay further, if any Doctor will come forth and ſay he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me of a Clap, or any ſuch thing, I will ſtand Guilty of all that is imputed to me.</p>

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> will you call any other Witneſſes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think this is not fair dealing with a man for his Life; becauſe theſe men be upon their Oaths, and deny the things again that my Witneſſes prove, therefore what they ſwear muſt needs be taken for truth: but if my Witneſs comes and ſays ſuch a thing upon the word of a Miniſter, and in the preſence of God, and which he is ready to maintain by an Oath, ſure it is not to ſtand for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nor he to be hooted out of Court, becauſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> denies it upon his Oath, I do ſuppoſe he will not acknowledge it. But, my Lord, I am the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and cannot be heard as a Witneſs for my ſelf: but God is my Witneſs, he hath ſaid a great deal more to me formerly; and he hath told me when I have ſeen him with <hi>Warcup,</hi> and asked him why I kept Company with <hi>Warcup,</hi> and others; ſaid he, I know they are ſuſpected men, but I muſt keep Company with them to get my money; what would you have me do, ſtarve. And when I lent him money out of my Pocket, and truſted him with my Horſe, I dun'd him for money and could not get it; ſaid I, will you pay me the 5 <hi>li.</hi> I lent you; he put me off, ſaid he, I ſhall have it, for the Attorney General hath made up his Accompts, and is very kind to me; why then, ſaid I, why have you it not; ſaid he, he is my Friend, and I do not queſtion the getting of it; but here is new work to be done, ſuch work as my Conſcience will not ſerve me to do; there is more Roguery, they will never have done Plotting, and Counterplotting; but they will make a thouſand Plots if they can to deſtroy the real one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Can you prove this now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>No, it was ſpoken to my ſelf; and no body was by but my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Then you ſhould not ſpeak it. But you asked the queſtion whether a man may not be believed upon his word, as well as he that is upon his Oath. Your Witneſſes are not upon their Oaths, but they may be Witneſſes, and their weight is to be left with the Jury; they will conſider how improbable it is, that theſe men ſhould come, Three men to One man, and all of them ſhould ſpeak that which would make themſelves Rogues and Villains; and that one man of them, <hi>Smith,</hi> ſhould ſay ſuch vile words, as, <hi>God damn him, he would have his blood,</hi> and, <hi>God damn the Goſpel:</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſhould confeſs he was wrought upon by <hi>Warcup</hi> to teſtifie againſt his Conſcience; and that <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſhould ſay to that purpoſe, He would not ſtarve; they have ſworn the contrary, and ſo there are all theſe Three mens Oaths againſt One mans Affirmation; but it muſt be left to the Jury.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>There is his Affirmation againſt what they three ſay. He charges every one of them, and 'tis but the ſingle denial of every one of them to his Charge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis improbable they ſhould own themſelves ſuch Villains to him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>They muſt be ſo, if they will do what they have undertaken. I hope my Word will be believed as ſoon as their Oaths.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>It is not to be thought, but when they have Sworn ſo againſt me, they will deny any ſuch thing when they are charged with it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done with your Witneſſes? Or will you call any more?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What is ſaid upon an honeſt mans word in the face of a Court, is certainly to be believed as well as what is Sworn.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a Teſtimony, that is moſt certain, and muſt be left to the Jury, they muſt weigh one againſt the other. But pray Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> will you call your Witneſſes, for it begins to grow late.</p>

               <p>There is Mr. <hi>Wilmore,</hi> that was a material Witneſs for me, who was Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Grand Jury, that would not find the Bill upon this Evidence. What he had to ſay I don't know, but I am informed it was very material for me.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. John Smith</hi> and I have had an Intimacy and Acquaintance ſeveral moneths, and ſince <hi>Mr. John Smith</hi> ſwore at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> againſt <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> and was gone out of Town, ſeveral People have talked with me concerning him, and asking me, what I thought of him? I told them, I believed he was an honeſt man, however I would not believe otherwiſe till I knew a Reaſon of it. They told me, that he had ſworn againſt <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> that he was to ſeize the King at the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that there was 1500 Barrels of Powder, and it was to carry on a Presbyterian Plot: Said I, I will never believe it, and the rather becauſe he hath ſaid to me often, there was a Popiſh Plot, but he does not believe any Presbyterian or Proteſtant Plot: and, ſaid I further, as to his giving any Evidence with <hi>Iriſh-men,</hi> I believe it the leſs for that, for I have heard him often ſay, they were a company of Rogues that had done the Proteſtant Intereſt more harm than ever they could do it good, and bid me have a care of coming into their Company, and many other ſuch things, that <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> here knows to be true. Then, my Lord, when <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> came home (for I was very impatient till he did come home to hear every day ſuch things ſaid againſt him) I went to him to ſee him. Said I, Couſin <hi>Smith,</hi> I have had great confronts about you ſince you went away, but I hope you can't be that ill man you are repreſented to be, and truly I ſhould be ſorry it ſhould be ſo: Pray Couſin, ſaid I, I have put every man off with this, that I would ſuſpend my belief of you till I had ſpoken with you your ſelf; what is the Evidence you have given? They ſay, you have ſworn a Presbyterian Plot, or a Proteſtant Plot, a Deſign of ſeizing the King at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and of ſo many Barrels of Gun-powder that were provided. Says my Couſin, I did ſwear no ſuch thing, nor never a word of any ſuch thing as a Proteſtant Plot, or a Presbyterian Plot, and pray do not believe it of me. No, ſaid I, I thought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57458:31"/>
you could not ſwear any ſuch thing, becauſe you have ſaid often to me, you believed there was no ſuch thing. I do not believe it yet ſaid he, and as to whatſoever <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid, I did not believe it, for he did not believe it himſelf. And Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> told me after his return that he did not know of any Proteſtant concerned in the Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>He does not ſay now 'tis a Proteſtant Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>So far from that, that he told me after his Return he did not know any Proteſtant concerned in the Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Thus I underſtand you. You ſay that he ſaid to you, That he had not teſtified anything of a Proteſtant Plot, nor did believe there was any Proteſtant Plot, for he did not believe what <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid himſelf: So by that diſcourſe it ſeems he did not deny, but he had teſtified againſt Mr <hi>Colledge,</hi> but he did not believe there was any Proteſtant Plot?</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>The Queſtion is Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> what you had in your mind, not what was in the mind of all the Proteſtants.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>This I do ſay, I would not ſpeak more nor leſs than the truth, he did not deny, but he had heard <hi>Colledge</hi> ſpeak thoſe words he ſwore, but he did not believe him, and I think Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſaid that, at another time before Mr. <hi>Gardner.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>If he knew of no Proteſtant Plot, it was very unlikely that I ſhould attempt ſuch a thing my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. S.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I find Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath been very paſſionate and very inveterate of late againſt other men that he hath given me a very good report of before; And when I was talking of this, I was ſaying, If it be true that people ſay of you, a man goes in danger of his life to converſe with you. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid he, I do not care for all the men between <hi>Wapping</hi> and <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> there is never a man that will forbear my company, but would do or ſay as much as <hi>Colledge</hi> hath done or ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. Smith.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, and I ſay ſo ſtill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>'Tis a contradiction in it ſelf, That there ſhould be ſuch a deſign and none but my ſelf to do it. God my righteous Judges knows my innocency.</p>

               <p>My Lord, this day fortnight I think it was, <hi>Mr. S. Smith</hi> the Gent. that was juſt now up before me, ſent for me to the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queen-ſtreet</hi> to drink a Glaſs of Wine, where when I came, I found him and <hi>Mr. J. Smith</hi> that is here, whom they call Narrative <hi>Smith,</hi> talking very briskly concerning one <hi>Colledge,</hi> I ſuppoſe that is the Gentleman, and the Jury that acquitted him, and he ſaid that 2 or 3 of the Jury-men were Raſcals and Villains, and ſays he, they talk up and down the Town as if I did intend to Sham the Popiſh Plot, and to make a Proteſtant Plot, which ſaid he, I vow to God, and I will juſtifie it before God and all the world, that I know of no Proteſtant Plot, nor is there any Proteſtant concerned in a Plot to my knowledge, but this <hi>Colledge,</hi> and upon his Tryal I believe he will be made appear to be more a Papiſt than a Proteſtant; but ſays <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> to him, Now you are known to be a witneſs in this Caſe, it will be a dangerous thing for a man to converſe with you.</p>

men from <hi>Wapping</hi> to <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> but that man that will ſhun my company will ſay and do as much to the King as <hi>Colledge</hi> hath done. But then I was ſaying, me thinks it ſeems an improbable thing, that ſuch a man as <hi>Colledge</hi> ſhould ſeize upon the King or provide 1500 Barrels of Powder and thoſe other things. Upon my word, ſaid he, with ſome paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, clapping his hand upon his breaſt, when <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> did ſay it, I did not believe a word of it, and upon my faith I believe <hi>Colledge</hi> himſelf did not believe it when he told me ſo.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I heard <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> ſpeaking of it at the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> and if you pleaſe to take notice it was thus, This Summer was twelve-month, or I am ſure a great while before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> the Alderman had invited me ſeveral times to give me a Treat, and I had not time, other buſineſs calling me off, but finding a time, I ſent him word I would come and ſee him. He ſaid he was a Brewer and troubled at home with Cuſtomers, but he would give me a dinner at the <hi>Grown</hi> Tavern without <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> that was the place fixed upon; there was <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> the Counſellor, who had been ſerviceable to me in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances I did get him to go along with me, and <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> was with us, and I heard <hi>Smith</hi> ſwearing at the <hi>Old-baily</hi> that <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> and he had diſcourſe from the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-houſe where we met, and went together.</p>

               <p>There I was invited by Alderman <hi>Wilcox.</hi>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>But my Lord I will tell my ſtory, I am not to tell <hi>Mr. Smith</hi>'s, <hi>Colledge</hi> did tell me he was invited; ſaid I, You ſhall be welcome as far as I can make you welcome. So <hi>Colledge</hi> and I went together from the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-houſe to the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern: Now indeed <hi>Colledge</hi> was very pleaſant and merry, and as I think, the diſcourſe betwixt the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-houſe and the Tavern was betwixt <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> and me; for <hi>M. Smith</hi> ſtayed ſomewhat behind or walked before, I cannot tell which: When we came to the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern we did, to divert our ſelves till dinner came up, enter into a Philoſophical diſcourſe with one <hi>Mr. Savage</hi> who was formerly a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, but this <hi>Savage</hi> is ſince pardoned by the King and is a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and hath been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Divinity and Philoſophy beyond Sea. This as I remember was the diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we dined till we went to Dinner, it was concerning the Exiſtence of God, whether that could be proved by natural demonſtration, and whether or no the Soul was immortal. My Lord, after Dinner <hi>Smith</hi> went away, I did not hear the leaſt diſcourſe of any ſuch thing as he ſpeaks of, and <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> and <hi>Colledge</hi> had no diſcourſe in my hearing from the Coffee-houſe to the Tavern; and when we were in the Tavern we did diſcourſe about thoſe two Points. Counſellor <hi>Smith,</hi> my Lord, will juſtifie a great deal of this, and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too, who was with us. But when I heard <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> ſwear as he did about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> I did really my Lord, in my Conſcience look upon him to be forſworn in that particular.</p>

               <p>My Lord, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, I do very well remember Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Wilcox,</hi> ſo they called him, did deſire to give Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> a Treat with ſome other of his Friends at the <hi>Crown</hi> Tavern without <hi>Temple-Bar</hi>; but really my Lord, as to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time I do not remember it, but to my beſt remembrance, my Lord, it was before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt, and ſome time before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt. And my Lord, I was there all the time, <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> was at that time ſomewhat a ſtranger to me, ſomething I had heard of his Name, and I did ſtay there all the while; I remember Mr. Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi> was to go out of Town that day; and truly as to any thing of matter of Treaſon, or Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, or any thing tending towards it, I am confident nothing was, or could be ſpoken, and the Room was a very ſmall Room, and our Company did fill it up, and the Table was ſo big, that there was little more than for the Servitors to go about, ſo that any man might eaſily hear from the one end of the Room to the other. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was ſome Diſcourſe betwixt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Mr. Savage,</hi> who I think hath been a Jeſuit, and it was about ſome points of Philoſophy and Divinity; but for Treaſon, I do not remember the leaſt of it, and I am confident <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid not any ſuch thing at that time, and my Reaſon is this, I very well remember <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> did ſet himſelf down upon one ſide of the Table, and fell aſleep, and unleſs he talked Treaſon in his ſleep, there could not be any ſuch thing ſaid, and if it had been ſaid, it would have been heard.</p>

But my Lord, that which I ſay further for <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> is this; I do hear ſomething pretended, as if he provided Arms to go for <hi>Oxford.</hi> I have known him this three years, or thereabouts; and my Lord, I do know that he did uſually ride with a Caſe or Piſtols before him. And before that time I had occaſion to borrow his Horſe of him, at the Election for <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the laſt Parliament that ſat there, and I had it then with a Caſe of Piſtols. I likewiſe borrowed it at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, the ſame Horſe, and the ſame Piſtols they were, I did at the ſame time ſee a Suit of Silk Armour, which he told me he did provide againſt the Papiſts, for he ſaid, he did expect we ſhould have a bruſh with them. Said I, do not trouble your ſelf for that, they dare not meddle; ſaid he, this will do no harm. And as I remember, it was a Suit of Armour made of Silk to wear under a Coat.</p>

               <p>It was ſilk Armour only for the thruſt of a Sword. And I aſſure you my Lord, I had but one Suit, but one Caſe of Piſtols, and but one Horſe, I had two before, but they did not then make a Traitor of me, that was all that ever I had, but if I had had ten Horſes, and never ſo many Armors I declare it upon my Salvation, I intended it for nothing but againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, if they ſhould make a diſturbance, and whatever I did was with that deſign, and truly by the grace of God I would not have been the laſt man then, but I ſee whatever I provided my ſelf with for that, they have turned it all another way, that it might be believed the Proteſtants were againſt the King and the eſtabliſhed Government.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>T. Smith.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I dare not undertake to ſay that, I cannot tell whether he went from the <hi>Rainbow</hi> Coffee-houſe with us, or no.</p>

               <p>He ſays after we had dined we divided our ſelves into Cabals, two and two together, I do declare it as that which is the real truth I fell aſleep behind the Table, if any body was divided it is more than I know, but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> you can tell, becauſe he ſays I ſpoke Treaſon to him when I was in the room, he and I in one Cabal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>T. S.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I remember nothing of that, nor do believe it, for I told you the room was ſo little that we could not divide our ſelves, And it is impoſſible in ſuch a little compaſs where we were ſo many as we were, 14, or 15 of us; it may be one might talk to another that was next to him, but then the company muſt hear, and whether they did ſo or no, I cannot tell, I do not remember Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s ſaying any thing to any particular perſon, but the great ingagement was between Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> and about ſome Queſtions in Divinity, and that is the great matter I took notice of.</p>

               <p>However, my Lord, I declare it, that was above a 12 Month ago, and I hope your Lordſhip and the Jury does obſerve that there was no new Arms were found, but what were provided a great while ago; All that know me, know I was never without a Caſe of Piſtols and an Horſe, though I was but a Joyner, and there is no more that you ſee now. And as to what <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid about our going into Cabals that you hear Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> denies.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, the laſt 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and my ſelf were Travelling from <hi>York</hi> towards <hi>London.</hi> We lay the 24<hi>th.</hi> at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> and the 25<hi>th.</hi> we were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling towards <hi>London</hi>: Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did ask me, if I did remember what Diſcourſe there was betwixt Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> and I at <hi>Ferry-Bridge,</hi> when we were coming up before to <hi>London</hi>? I deſired him to tell me what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and I would tell him if I did remember it or no. So my Lord he did ſay, the Diſcourſe was, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did ſay, there would be cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Parliament did go provided, ſome with 8, ſome with 6, ſome with 4 men, and they were to meet at <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and go together. This Diſcourſe I did remember, That Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> ſaid, they went with Horſe and Arms to ſecure them from High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men; and Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did then further declare, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was, there would be cutting of Throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which made them go with Arms to defend themſelves. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did further upon the 25, 26, 27, and 28<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> (and it was our frequent Diſcourſe) tell me, that he had given His Majeſty an Account of it, which occaſioned the Diſſolving of the Parliament: That Diſcourſe that was made to the King, was, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> ſhould ſay, there would be cutting of Throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Parliament-men went provided with 4 or 5, 6 or 10 men a piece; and he did tell me, he had given a further Account, that there was to be a Conſult at <hi>Grantham,</hi> wherein it was Reſolved, that it was better to ſeize the King, than to let him go on. Now, this I knew nothing of, but he would have perſwaded me to have given in this Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> as to this Diſcourſe. But I declare, I did never hear it, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was the firſt man that ever I heard it from, I never heard it before in my Life.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bolron.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; he ſaid he had given an Account of it to the King, and if I did manage it rightly againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57458:34"/>
would make me for ever; thoſe two Perſons were mentioned all along. But I do declare it, I did never hear them ſpeak Treaſon againſt the King in my Life. And he did further tell me, that I muſt ſay ſo and ſo; for if we did not agree, it would ſignifie nothing. But my Lord, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, I never heard any one ſpeak of it but Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi> My Lord, this is true, Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> was the man that was by when it was Diſcourſed.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi>

               <p>Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What do you know of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Mowbray.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I came up from <hi>York</hi> with him when I returned, after I was commanded down upon the Kings account to give in Evidence againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> he came to me the third of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and called at my houſe in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and was very importunate for me to come up to <hi>London</hi> with him, for he ſaid, he had a Letter come to him which commanded his preſence at <hi>London</hi> very ſuddenly, and he produced that Letter which he ſaid came from a Gentleman of the Court, or ſome Court dependent; ſo he read the Letter in Mr. <hi>Balron</hi>'s hearing. We ſet forward on <hi>Sunday,</hi> and upon our journey to <hi>London</hi> he told me he had ſomething of importance to impart to me, ſo upon the road he began to diſcourſe of the Parliament and of the illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and Arbitrary power of the 2 laſt Parliaments, he ſaid their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were very Illegal and Arbitrary, and he began to open ſome of the Votes as that which they voted, that thoſe that ſhould lend the King money upon the Crown lands, ſhould be enemies to the King and Kingdom, and thoſe that Counſelled the King to diſſolve the Parliament; and he repeated many Votes, and ſaid he, theſe are ſigns of Arbitrary power, and certainly they deſign to take off the King; ſo he proceeded further to ask me what was the diſcourſe of Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> when we came up before, and he did much importune me to ſay, that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> did affirm there would be cutting of throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the King was to be ſeized there. I told him I could have no plauſible pretence, becauſe I had no acquaintance with Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57458:35"/>
nor did I come up wih him, upon which he applied himſelf to <hi>Bolron,</hi> and importun'd him for the ſame, he asked me who I came up with, I told him I came up with 3 Members of Parliament, my Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hewly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stern</hi>; he asked me what Diſcourſe we had upon the Road? And he asked, whether they had any Diſcourſe that tended to juſtifie their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Votes? For he ſaid, if they did think to juſtifie any thing of thoſe Votes, or if they would not allow the King money, and ſtood upon the Bill of Excluſion, he ſaid, that was pretence enough for any man to ſwear that there was a Deſign againſt the King, and that the King was to be ſeized at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>An excellent pretence indeed, and like the reſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Mow.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>He would have tempted me to ſwear againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> the ſame. And he ſaid, it would be well if I did appear on <hi>Colledges</hi> Tryal at <hi>Oxon,</hi> for it was a thing of great Conſequence; the Popiſh Plot was thrown out of doors, and no man was looked upon that did ſpeak of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Mow.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, my Lord. When he was diſcourſing about Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> rid up to us, and he applied himſelf to him, becauſe I told him I had no plauſible pretence to ſwear againſt him, having no Acquaintance with him.</p>

               <p>Look you, here is the matter, <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> he was asked again, and again, what day it was, and he was poſitive to the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Mow.</speaker>
               <p>It was a miſtake of mine, Sir <hi>George,</hi> but my Almanack is right.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Mow.</speaker>
               <p>It was only my miſtake.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You are a raſh man to affirm ſo: If you had an Almanack, you ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted it, or referred to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ser. Jeff.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>You were examined at Sir <hi>Miles Stapletons</hi> Tryal, was you not, <hi>Mr. Mowbray</hi>?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>What can you ſay of him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bol.</speaker>
               <p>He ſent ſeveral times for my Husband and Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> to my Houſe, ſomething he would have them be concerned in, ſome buſineſs he had in hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>When was that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bol.</speaker>
               <p>Within this 3 weeks, ſince he came up from <hi>York</hi> Aſſizes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>You may ſee there was an underſtanding between them then.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Did they go accordingly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bol.</speaker>
               <p>Now and then they have gone to him, but they knew his buſineſs, becauſe they had Diſcourſe with him, as they ſaid, upon the Road, and they would not go.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Would you ask her any thing elſe? What do you know more?</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> I need not ask him whether he knows him, for they know one another well enough: But Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> that I would ask you is this, what do you know
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57458:36"/>
of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and of this contrivance againſt me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Everard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> I have been to ſee of late, and he told me he knew of no Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian or Proteſtant Plot, and when my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was tried, that is, the Bill brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he ſaid, he wondred how my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> could be Guilty, and that both himſelf and I were joyned as Evidence to that Jury, only to put a gloſs upon the Evidence, for ſays he, I have nothing material to ſay.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Everard,</hi> Do you know any thing more concerning him, what he hath ſaid at other times concerning me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Everard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have told you already, what I have heard him ſay, That he thought there was no Proteſtant or Presbyterian Plot, and that now of late within this little while.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>Pray Sir was there not ſome diſcourſe betwixt Juſt. <hi>Warcup</hi> and you in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> walks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>Is Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> an Evidence here?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis all but Evidence of a Presbyterian Plot, therefore pray Sir, what was the diſcourſe between Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> and you? what would he have had you done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is not material, there is nothing of Mr. <hi>Warcup</hi> in this Tryal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Everard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the Court does allow of it, I will freely tell it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the Papiſts deſign is to make a Proteſtant Plot to turn off their own, and they begin with me, but if I ſhould go they would not be ſatisfied with me, they would be at others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing concerning a Presbyterian or Proteſtant Plot in the Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, If there be no Presbyterian Proteſtant Plot, and others to joyn in it, how could I do it by my ſelf, 'tis impoſſible I ſhould have ſuch a deſign of Seizing the King, and improbable I ſhould ſpeak it. Now my Lord, this man was ſolicited to come in for an Evidence of ſuch a Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>That is true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you it is not material, <hi>Mr. Warcup</hi> is not concerned in your Trial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> would have perſwaded me to have ſworn againſt ſome Lords a Presbyterian Plot, but I deny that I know any ſuch thing of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>The Papiſts aim is not at me only, but at others.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. Jeff.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We have nothing to do with what you and Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> talked of; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake my Lord, let us have no diſcourſes that concern third perſons brought in here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Would he have perſwaded you to ſay any thing that was not true?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ever.</speaker>
               <p>He did not ſay poſitively thoſe words, but this he ſaid, I knew ſeveral Lords— <hi>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</hi> Now here is <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi>'s ſame traduc'd behind his book in the face of the Countrey, and it is nothing to this cauſe before us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I deſire to know what he knows of theſe things, and that he may ſpeak it out, 'tis a material thing for me and others: Here is a deſign of the Papiſts to turn a Plot upon the Proteſtants, they begin with me, and if they have my bloud who may feel the effects of it next I cannot tell.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I think it not material to your Caſe, and indeed 'tis of ill conſequence to have any man traduced behind his back, as <hi>Mr. Warcup</hi> is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>Macnamarra</hi> told me, that that man would have ſeduced him to have retracted his Evidence; upon my ſalvation 'tis true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We meddle not with <hi>Macnamarra</hi> neither, he is no evidence againſt you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macnamarra</hi> hath ſworn againſt me at the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> and at the finding of this Bill, but they have laid him by upon ſome trick or other, I deſire <hi>Mr. Everard</hi> may tell what he knows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ev.</speaker>
               <p>I would not reflect upon any perſon, nor will I anſwer it, if the Court do not think fit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Coll.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this is foul play, if I die my ſelf for my Countreys ſake, I can do it freely, and the will of God be done, I would have the truth out for the ſake of the Proteſtants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>I am very willing to tell the truth if the Court think fit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee not that he ſays <hi>Mr. Warcup</hi> would have had him ſwear that which was not true.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ev.</speaker>
               <p>But this he ſaid, if the Court will allow me to ſpeak it, Juſt. <hi>Warcup</hi> ſaid, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there was a Presbyterian Plot, and ſuch things; and that ſome Lords, ſome of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proteſting Lords muſt be guilty of it, and ſaid he, certainly you know much of it, You know ſuch and ſuch things, therefore you may ſafely ſwear it, if I knew it, ſo by argument he would firſt prove there was a Plot and Combination amongſt thoſe Lords, and then ſaid he this you may ſafely ſwear.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. J. J.</speaker>
               <p>What is this to your purpoſe <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi>? only <hi>Mr. Warcup</hi>'s name is brought upon the Stage when he is not here to vindicate himſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Would you ask him any thing elſe?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Ev.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Mr. Haynes,</hi> he told me it was neceſſity that drove him to ſpeak any thing againſt the Proteſtants and the hard P. and the gratitude he did receive from the Citizens.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>About three weeks ago. I asked him, Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> ſaid I, I would not draw you from your Teſtimony in any thing; but how can this be congruous to what you have ſaid formerly, That you knew nothing by them? The truth is, ſaid he, I will not ſay much to excuſe my ſelf, but my Wife was reduced to that neceſſity, that ſhe begg'd at <hi>Rouſe's</hi> door, and craved ſome Salary, and Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> would not give her any; and, ſaid he, meer neceſſity drove me to it.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>And, ſays he, 'tis Self-preſervation in the next place: for I was brought in guilty when I was taken up, and therefore I was obliged to do ſome things to ſave my Life.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Everard.</speaker>
               <p>Beſides, he told me there is a Judgment impending upon the Nation, ſaid he, either upon the King, or upon the People, I know not which; but theſe Iriſh mens ſwearing againſt them, is juſtly fallen upon them for their Injuſtice againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in outing them of their Eſtates.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Parkhurſt.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the latter end of the laſt <hi>November,</hi> when the Parliament ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſeveral times Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> having promiſed me his further Narrative to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh which he printed, I met him ſeveral times; one time I met him at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, and it was towards the evening before we went away; he told me and Mr. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> that he was to ſpeak with Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi>; and he told us, that this Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> did lie at Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s; and he having ſpoken the day before, and ſeveral times, of the danger he was in of his being aſſaſſinated by the Papiſts, Mr. <hi>Symonds</hi> and I offered to go with him, and we took a Coach; for we did not know where Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> lived: he had then a Rheum in his Eyes, and was not well; ſo we accompanied him to Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s to ſpeak with Dr. <hi>Tongue.</hi> It was the evening when we went; and whilſt we took a Pipe of Tobacco, in our diſcourſe we were ſpeaking of the times, and of the danger of the Papiſts; ſo <hi>Colledge</hi> took down a ſteel Hat that hung up there, which he ſaid he had, and he ſaid he had a quilted Coat of Defenſive Armor, and he ſaid he had a Blunderburſs in his houſe, and two Piſtols. But I little thought of any thing of this, neither did I know well what I was ſubpoena'd down for: But theſe Arms I ſaw in his houſe, and it was onely in diſcourſe that he was provided againſt the Papiſts; ſo I put the ſteel Hat upon my head and pulled it off again, and ſo did Mr. <hi>Symonds.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Did I ſay any thing, Sir, who I had thoſe Arms againſt?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Parkhurſt.</speaker>
               <p>At that time there was no diſcourſe in the world, but of the danger from the Papiſts; and he ſaid he was provided for them, if they did come to make any diſturbance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Parkhurſt.</speaker>
               <p>It was about the latter end of <hi>November.</hi> I have the Narrative that I printed, which was the 23th or 24th; and I have no directions but that to remember the exact time. So we carried Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> home again in a Coach, and gave him a pint of Wine at his Lodgings.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Symonds.</speaker>
               <p>I can ſay the ſame that Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> did; that I ſuppoſe is the buſineſs. All I know of it is this: I was with Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-houſe ſome time in <hi>November,</hi> I think it was about the printing of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s further Information; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was ſaying, Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> had ſent for him, but ſpoke as if he was fearful of ſome danger in going alone; ſo we proffered to go along with him, and we took a Coach at the Coffee-houſe-door, and went with him to Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> who lodged at Mr. <hi>Colledges.</hi> When we came into the Room, Mr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> and I thought fit we ſhould in civility withdraw, which we did; and Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> brought us down into another Room, where we ſat and took a Pipe of Tobacco, and talking about the common diſcourſe of the times, about the Papiſts and the danger from them, there hung up in Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Room ſome Arms; what they were, I dare not charge my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with to ſwear particularly, but I do think there was a ſilk Coat of Mail, and there was a Cap of Steel, and as I take it, it was covered with Cloath or ſome ſuch thing; what elſe I can't well ſay: I think there was a Blunderbuſs and a Caſe of Piſtols: And all the diſcourſe that I remember then, was onely this; Speaking of the Papiſts, and ſome fears as if there would be an Inſurrection amongſt them, ſaid he, Let the Papiſt Rogues begin when they will, I am ready to defend my ſelf for one. This is all I know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, how long ago was this? Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> died before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> at my houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Symonds.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot tell exactly when it was; but during the Seſſion of Parliament I am ſure it was, and as I take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>November</hi> the latter end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>But there is nothing that contradicts <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Teſtimony in all this.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Yates.</speaker>
               <p>I know that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſent for me to a Coffee-houſe to beſpeak a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol for you, and told me that when I had made the Piſtol, I ſhould deliver it to Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> promiſed to pay for it when I had done it. Now ſome time after I did ſome ſmall matter for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> cleaned his Piſtols, or ſome ſmall buſineſs; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> asked me if I would drink a pint of wine, which I agreed to; and being at the Tavern, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> asked me if Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> Piſtol were done. I told him no, it was not as yet. So I asked Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> becauſe he had promiſed to give Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> a Piſtol, what obligation there was betwixt <hi>Colledge</hi> and him, that he ſhould give him a Piſtol? to which he anſwered, that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> had been ſerviceable to him in lending him a pair of Piſtols to ride withal ſometimes. So he gave him a Piſtol to ſatisfie him for the wearing of his Piſtols now and then. I thought, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> did impoſe upon your good nature too much, not but that I believe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> is a very honeſt man, and ſtands up for the good of the King and the Government. Yes, ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I believe he does, and I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

               <p>We were talking of the Parliament at <hi>Oxon.</hi> Says Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Moſt of the Parliament-men are afraid to go up to the Parliament.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>But this were a material Evidence againſt others of the Confederates, if they had been examined.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Norreys.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was at the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Coffee-houſe the twenty third of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and there was Mr. <hi>Denis Macnamarra</hi>; ſaid he, Will you go, and I will give you a pot of Ale</p>

               <p>There is nothing of <hi>Denis Macnamarra</hi> in queſtion before us. If you have any thing to ſay againſt any of the Witneſſes that have been Sworn, go on with your Evidence, we muſt not hear ſtories of other people.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he knew me in this Country ſome fifteen or ſixteen years ago.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. T. Norreys.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> about ſixteen or eighteen years, and he hath always carried himſelf very civilly and well, and he kept to the Church for a conſiderable time as duely as any Pariſhioner did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I was at <hi>Aſtrop</hi>-wells laſt year. I believe Mr. Juſtice <hi>Levins</hi> ſaw me there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. T. Norreys.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I was there with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>We did diſcourſe commonly then concerning the Papiſts. Pray, Sir, did you find me inclined to the Popiſh Intereſt?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. T. Norreys.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpoke very much againſt them.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. T. Norreys.</speaker>
               <p>No, I never heard it; for if he were my Brother, I ſhould have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it.</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, as to the Papers charged upon me that they were mine, I declare I know not of them. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſays I owned them, and the Letter and ſeveral Prints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but truly, my Lord, I had done my ſelf a great injury if I had done or owned thoſe things he hath charged me withal. I never could make a Picture, nor never did draw a Picture in my life; and that very perſon that he ſays I owned I got it to be printed by, hath denyed it before the King and Council; for he there teſtified, that he did not know the perſon that cauſed it to be printed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, here is <hi>Elizabeth Hunt,</hi> the Maid by whom they were taken in, and who can give you an account of it. I cannot deny but that they were in my houſe; but that I was the Author, or did take them in, is as great a miſtake as ever was made. Call <hi>Elizabeth Hunt.</hi> I do not know whether <hi>Curtis</hi> be in Town; but this I am confident, he was Examined before the King and Council, and he and his Wife denyed it.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the printing of them, nor was I the Author of them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>That they were in my houſe, I believe, my Lord; and this woman will tell you how, my Lord. Pray tell the Court how theſe Papers that are called the <hi>Raree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew</hi> came to be in my houſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>El. Hunt.</speaker>
               <p>A Porter brought three bundles to our houſe, and asked whether my Maſter was not within. I told him, no, he was not. Said he, Theſe Papers are to be left here; ſaid I, Who do they come from? ſaid he, 'tis all one for that, you muſt pay me, and I muſt leave them here; ſo I gave him ſix pence, and he left the Papers, but I never ſaw the

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, it ſeems they were put in a Box, and left in my Counting houſe: I never touched them, but there they ſtaid, for ought I know, till they were taken.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I neither knew the Printer nor the Author; but I heard a man was in trouble about them, upon a By-Law in the <hi>Stationers</hi> Company.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Have you it there? I know of none was produced. But if I were a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerned, it were no Treaſon; and, my Lord, I hope you will do me that Juſtice, to let the Jury know they are not Treaſon, none of theſe Papers. And I do declare I know nothing of the Original, the Printer, nor the Author.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpend time in making Obſervations out of order of time: when you have given your Evidence, then make your Obſervations.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs I may erre as to matter of Order, for I was never in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity before. But pray do you tell the Court how the Papers came there, and all the tranſactions. For I was a Priſoner when they came and ſearched.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <p>I went to receive the Money of <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> that he owed my Maſter, and asking him for it, he ſaid, he would pay me ſuch a time to morrow morning, if I would come for it; but when I came, he had not the Money ready for me. Sir, ſaid I, I think 'tis very hard that you ſhould keep my Maſters Money from him, and yet you go and Swear againſt his Life too: what do you think we ſhall do at home in the Family, if you keep my Maſters Money and he be in Priſon? Said he, There is a great deal of do about my Swearing againſt your Maſter, more than needs; but as I hope for Salvation, I do not believe <hi>Mr. Colledge</hi> had any more hand in any Conſpiracy againſt His Majeſty, than the Child unborn. Here is <hi>Dugdale,</hi> let him deny it if he can.</p>

               <p>I told Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of it, when he had leave to come to me: I told him what the Maid ſaid he had ſaid to her, and this was three weeks ago; ſaid he, I will ſpeak with him with all my heart, if he has a mind to ſpeak with me; for he hath ſaid that he hath nothing againſt her Maſter that can touch an hair of his head, nor nothing that can touch his Life, that he knew nothing of a Plot or contrivance againſt the King; and if I could help it, I had as lieve have given a hundred pound I had never ſpoken what I have. This he ſaid to her.</p>

               <p>My Lord, ſhe came to me for money; I told her I had it not ready, but would pay her: And in the ſhop, before the Apprentice-boy, ſhe deſired of me that I would write two or three words what I had to ſay againſt her Maſter; and I told Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> of it. So, ſaid I, I cannot tell, I have not the Papers, nor what Informations I have given againſt him. So ſhe came again the next morning, and ſhe was at me to write down what I ſaid. I wonder, ſaid I, your Maſter will ſend you! had not he as good ſend Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who is his Counſel? And this was all the words we had.</p>

The next morning I came to him again, and ſaid I, I am come again; what muſt I do? Said he, I have no money; ſuch an one hath not hoped me to it. Sir, then, ſaid I, I hope you will be as good as your word, to let me know what you have made Oath againſt my Maſter. Said he, I was about it yeſterday, but could not do it: But, Sweetheart, ſaid he, (and took me by the hand) I will give you a Copy of it to day at ten of the clock; and if I do not, I will tell it thee by word of mouth. So I came to the houſe at ten, and ſtaid till eleven, but did not ſee him.</p>

               <p>Yes, I do. The Saturday after my Brothers Confinement, about eight of the clock in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I having heard of it, came into the Houſe, and in a quarter of an hours time, in comes a Waterman and deſires an handful or two of ſhavings. I knowing not who he was, nor what he deſired them for, told him, he ſhould have them; ſo he went up to the working ſhop to gather them, for he pretended that to be his buſineſs.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Goodwin.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was the Saturday after. So no ſooner had he the ſhavings, but he goes out of the Shop, and comes in again with Three of His Majeſties Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and they made enquiry after papers, and I being innocent of concealing any papers, or any thing ſaid I knew of none; ſo they came to one box that had the Tooles for the men to work with, and they demanded the keys. I told him, I knew not where the keys were. So they went to the next and found it open, but nothing did they find there; there was a Bed wherein formerly my Brothers Servants did lye. Said one to the other, Look well whether there be not ſomething hid in that bed; ſaid I, I ſuppoſe there is no ſuch thing as you inquire for: if you pleaſe, you may take off the Cloths, and gave them free toleration to look; but for the Cheſt, I would not deliver the Keys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man was not there that owned it. In their ſearching, they flung down the Wainſcote, and did a great deal of damage to his Goods. Gentlemen, ſaid I, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have Order to ſearch, but none to ſpoil a mans Goods. When they were gone, having found none, they threatned God dam them they would have them, for there they were. But I being ignorant of the concealment of the papers, I requeſted the Maid and my Brothers Son, whether they knew of any papers, and they ſatisfied me they knew of ſome prints that were brought by a Porter, to be left at my Brothers, but they knew not whence they came, nor what they were: and the ſame anſwer gave my Brothers Son, that he did not know whoſe the papers were. But ſince his Fathers Confinement, they were laid up ſure and ſafe, for they knew not what they concerned. Upon this, my Lord, my Brother-in-law <hi>George Spur,</hi> he comes into the houſe, and if it pleaſe your Honour, I requeſted him to carry them into the Countrey to his houſe, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them till we knew what they did concern, and who they did belong to. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he replyed, my Lord, That he was fearful to carry any thing out of the houſe; ſaid I, If you will pleaſe to take them of me, I will carry them out of the houſe for your ſecurity, becauſe his Wife looked every hour (being with Child) when ſhe ſhould be delivered, and he was fearful of troubling her. So I carried them out of the houſe, and delivered them to him.</p>

But taking them up unadviſedly, I put them among the prints, which I carried out; I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to my Brother-in-law. This is all I have to ſay as to the papers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have onely Innocence to plead; I have no Flouriſhes to ſet off my defence. I cannot take the Jury nor the Court with an Oratory; I am unhappy in thoſe things. But, my Lord, I do declare, as to my own particular, in the preſence of God Almighty, That as to whatſoever is ſworn againſt me, as to the ſeizing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, providing Arms, or having any deſigne either at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> or any other place in the world, to ſeize upon the perſon of the King, or to rebel againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed; I vow to God Almighty, I never had ſuch a thought in me: 'tis a truth, my Lord. My Lord, they have ſworn deſperately againſt me, and it hath appeared, I think, by very credible perſons, that they have contradicted one another. It hath been proved that this was a deſigne; that they were tampered withal; that they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were in poverty, that they wanted maintenance; and they did confeſs they were tempted to come over to ſwear againſt Proteſtants: and now the Lord knows they have cloſed with it, and they begin with me. I hope the Jury have taken notice that I have contradicted them ſufficiently in what they have ſworn; and that it is not poſſible, if I had a grain of ſence, for me to diſcover my ſelf to be ſuch an one to <hi>Haynes</hi> that was an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man, and ſhould ſpeak all the Treaſon that he hath galloped through at firſt ſight, that as ſoon as ever I ſaw him, that I ſhould ſpeak ſo to him; I hope you will conſider whether it conſiſts with common Reaſon, when there could be no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of making any uſe of him in the world. My Lord, all my Witneſſes that I have brought, your Lordſhip can, and I hope will ſum them up better than I can; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, I have been ſo concern'd, that I have not been able to write half of it down. But I think there is never a man that hath ſworn againſt me, but hath been ſufficiently confuted by perſons of integrity and honeſty, men of Principles, and men of Religion; they are ſuch, my Lord, that make Conſcience of what they ſay: they are perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unknown to me, moſt of them, as to what they had to ſay, it was what they offered voluntarily; and I am certain they have had nothing but their bare Charges, if they had that, for their pains in coming hither; and, my Lord, there is no probability that they ſhould come and atteſt any thing that is falſe, for me who am a ſtranger, for nothing: No man is a Knave for nothing, as I believe theſe men are not. My Lord, I do declare it, I was bred a Proteſtant, and have lived ſo; I am ſo to this very day; I have been a lover of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all the fundamental points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine believed in it; I own the ſame God, the ſame Saviour, the ſame Goſpel, and the ſame Faith; I never had a prejudice againſt any man in the Church in my life, but ſuch as have made it their buſineſs to promote the intereſt of the Papiſts, and ſuch I muſt beg leave to ſay there are amongſt them: for there is no Society in the world, without ſome bad men; and theſe do promote the intereſt of the Papiſts, by dividing the Proteſtants, and allowing none to be true Proteſtants but thoſe that are within the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; which is a Notion ſo wide I could never cloſe with that. I never had a prejudice againſt any man but a Knave in my life. I have heard, I confeſs, ſome of the Diſſenters, and I have found very honeſt, juſt, pious, godly men among them; men free from Oaths and all Debauchery; men that make a Conſcience of what they ſay: not like ſome perſons that ſay they are of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that carry themſelves in their lives and actions, ſo as that no credit can be gained to the Church by them. My Lord, I have been an hearty man againſt the Papiſts; I have been an hearty man as any perſon of my condition, for Parliaments, which I look upon to be my Birth-right, and under God Almighty, the Bulwark of our Liberty; and I am ſorry if any man ſhould be an inſtrument to create a miſunderſtanding betwixt the King and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57458:42"/>
Parliament: for I always thought I ſerved my Country, when I ſerved the Parliament, and I ſerved my King when I ſerved my Country. I never made any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, becauſe I thought them both one. I had the honour to be entruſted by them before, and upon that account <hi>I</hi> came voluntarily down hither. <hi>I</hi> rid my own Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I</hi> ſpent my own Money, and eat my own Bread; <hi>I</hi> was not beholding to any man for the value of ſix pence all the while <hi>I</hi> was here. My Lord, <hi>I</hi> have ever ſince the Plot hath been diſcovered, endeavoured with all my heart, and all my power, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and come at the very bottom of it: <hi>I</hi> have ſpared for no time nor pains, what lay fairly in my way, in every thing to encourage thoſe that diſcovered the Villanies of the Popiſh Plot againſt the life of the King, and for the ſubverſion of the Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed by Law. Now certainly it is not ſtrange to the world; for <hi>I</hi> think all Chriſtendom is aware how plain the Popiſh Plot hath been proved. Theſe men that ſwear againſt me, were they that uſed to follow me ſometimes; they would ſay, It was they that had come to ſave our lives and yet we let them want Bread. That Argument, my Lord, was ſo fair, that <hi>I</hi> thought it unreaſonable to ſee them ſtarve: And <hi>I</hi> have ſaid ſometimes to ſome honeſt conſiderable men, That it was hard they ſhould have this to ſay of us, That they ſhould want Bread to eat that were the Kings Evidence, to detect a Popiſh Plot wherein we our ſelves were concerned; and that when they had ſaved our Bloud in our veins, they ſhould be ſuffered to ſtarve. And one time, <hi>I</hi> think, ſome three or four Gentlemen of the City did give me 42 <hi>s.</hi> or 40 <hi>s.</hi> and 18 <hi>d.</hi> or thereabouts; which <hi>I</hi> did diſtribute amongſt them: and they never came to me in my life, but to ſeek Relief, they knowing that <hi>I</hi> had a general Acquaintance. And ſometimes they thought it might be fit to petition the Common Council of the City of <hi>London</hi> to take care of them: Sometimes they would ſpeak to me to ſpeak to particular men that care ſhould be taken of them. At other times indeed it was not this ſort of diſcourſe they had with me; but they would pretend they had ſomething to diſcover of the Popiſh Plot, and ſo they would apply to me as a man of ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. And the firſt time <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>Haynes,</hi> was upon ſuch an account, the beginning of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and it was thus: <hi>I</hi> was at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-houſe at <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> where <hi>Macknamarra</hi> did deſire me to go out, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould hear ſuch a piece of Roguery <hi>I</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did hear in my life, againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> did go out with them, and <hi>I</hi> called Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who is ſince dead, to go with me; and we went to the <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, and <hi>Haynes</hi> there diſcovered what <hi>I</hi> told your Lordſhip before, a deſigne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi>; an Army that was to land in the North, and another in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was to be at the head of them. My Lord, after <hi>I</hi> had heard all out, he did deſire us all to conceal what he had ſaid till the Parliament ſat, and then he would not onely diſcover this, but much more. He at the ſame time told us, that there was a deſigne of <hi>Fitzgerald</hi>'s againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to take away his life, and he was employed to come to his Cozen <hi>Macknamarra</hi> to get him over to joyn in the deſigne, and he ſhould never want for money, if he would but come over and do as they would have him. After he had diſcovered himſelf, Sir, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> You are a ſtranger to me; and <hi>I</hi> never ſaw him before in my days; if he had ſeen me <hi>I</hi> can't tell: But, Sir, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> either this is true, or this is falſe. If it be true, ſaid he, 'Tis all true, and much more. So he up and told us much of <hi>Coleman,</hi> and of the Reconciliation between the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and how he came to be Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how <hi>Plunket</hi> came to be Primate, and by means of whom, and the Letters that paſſed, and how ſo much a year was given to <hi>Plunket</hi> for carrying on the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; and he told us ſo much, that <hi>I</hi> did wonder to hear any man talk after that rate. After <hi>I</hi> had heard what he had to ſay, <hi>I</hi> told him, Sir, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> this is either true or falſe that you have ſaid: if it be true, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhall know it to night; for <hi>I</hi> will not conceal ſuch a thing concerning a Peer of the Realm: and if it were a colour, he ſhould know of it. And <hi>I</hi> did ſend him word that night; and, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> Sir, you ought to go, for your own ſecurity and ours too, to ſwear it before a Magiſtrate. Said he, If <hi>I</hi> ſhould, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be diſcovered. Said <hi>I, I</hi> can't think you would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; if you ſwore it before Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> or Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> they will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you. So he agreed he would ſwear before Sir <hi>George Treby</hi>; and he did go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: But he being out of Town, <hi>I</hi> cannot have the Affidavit to produce it. There was a Letter ſent laſt Saturday-night to Sir <hi>George</hi> to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> hoped he might have been here to day. This was the firſt Acquaintance <hi>I</hi> ever had with <hi>Haynes.</hi> The next time <hi>I</hi> heard of him, was upon this occaſion. <hi>Ivy</hi> comes to me in <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-houſe,

and, ſaid he, Yonder is the man that made that diſcovery, which <hi>I</hi> told you before that <hi>Haynes</hi> had ſaid to me; it was about a month or three weeks before the Parliament was at <hi>Oxford.</hi> After the Parliament was diſſolved at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Ivy</hi> comes to me, and <hi>I</hi> think it was betwixt the two Terms wherein <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> was arraigned and tried: <hi>I</hi> know not the names of them; but he comes to me and tells me he had been with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and that there was a Friend of his that would confirm all that <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> had diſcovered concerning the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>; and, ſays he, My Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hath ſent me to you to acquaint you with it. Where is your Friend, ſaid <hi>I</hi>? He is without, ſaid he. So we went out of the Coffee-houſe; and when we came out of doors, there was this <hi>Haynes:</hi> we went to the Crown-Tavern without <hi>Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>; it was in the Forenoon. When we came there into the Room, he exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the Corners, and Cupboards, and places about the Room, to ſee that no body was there. When he thought all was ſecure, he began to tell me he had been to acquaint my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> that there was a Friend of his that would diſcover the whole Intrigue of the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> all that <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> had ſaid, and much more: and he deſired me that <hi>I</hi> would intreat my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to be inſtrumental to get him his Pardon before he diſcover'd particularly. Then <hi>I</hi> told him, <hi>I</hi> think 'tis convenient, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> that you diſcover ſomething in Writing, and give under your hand what you can ſay. He was not willing to do that. Can you believe, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> that my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you? Says he, <hi>I</hi> will not truſt any body; <hi>I</hi> ſhall be aſſaſſinated. Said <hi>I,</hi> If you will not give it to any body elſe, Will you give it to Mr. <hi>Michael Godfrey,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Brother? you can have no jealouſie of him that he will ever diſcover you. Said he, If my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> will engage to get me a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>I</hi> will tell the whole truth. Said <hi>I, I</hi> will go to my Lord and acquaint him: So <hi>I</hi> went to both my Lord and Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi>; and Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s two Brothers both met me at my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s houſe. This is the thing that he tells me; he would have me get my Lord's Protection and a Pardon for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but the real truth is, he ſent me upon this Errand. So <hi>I</hi> came to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the two Mr. <hi>Godfreys</hi> were in the Room; and after <hi>I</hi> had told my Lord what diſcourſe <hi>I</hi> had with him, ſays my Lord, <hi>Colledge,</hi> Theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men have confounded all our buſineſs; and thou and <hi>I</hi> muſt have a care they do not put a trick upon us: This may be a trick of the Papiſts to ruine us; and if they have ſuch a deſigne, if they will not put it upon you and <hi>I,</hi> they are fools. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Lordſhip, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> they may; but <hi>I</hi> am a poor inconſiderable fellow. Says my Lord, I'll tell you, Mr. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> hath not onely been an honeſt man, but an uſeful and an active man for the Proteſtant intereſt. So <hi>I</hi> told my Lord how far <hi>I</hi> had gone with him, and that <hi>I</hi> deſired it might be put in Writing. Says my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> If he will put it in Writing, <hi>I</hi> will go once again; for <hi>I</hi> have been ſince <hi>I</hi> ſaw the Fellow, with my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> and my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> and my Lord Chancellor, and <hi>I</hi> have told them that there is ſuch a perſon in general, but <hi>I</hi> knew not the man; as indeed my Lord did not, for onely <hi>Ivy</hi> was the perſon between them that my Lord knew: And <hi>I</hi> told them, ſays my Lord, that he can confirm all that <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> has ſaid concerning the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and that he would prove my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> was in it, if he might have his Pardon; and my Lord ſaid, They promiſed to ſpeak to his Majeſty that it might be granted. But ſome time the latter end of the week <hi>I</hi> heard it would not be granted; and both of theſe men followed me to know what they ſhould do. Said <hi>I,</hi> My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> knows not but that it may be a Trick; and ſaid <hi>I</hi> to <hi>Ivy, I</hi> wonder why he ſhould conceal it all this while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſitous man, and 500 <hi>l.</hi> proffered by the King in his Proclamation. Why, ſays <hi>Ivy,</hi> do you think there is no truth in it? ſays <hi>I,</hi> 'Tis not my Judgment, but my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Judgment too. He anſwered me again, <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> hath deſired he may have a Pardon granted for himſelf and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and if ſo be there were nothing in it, Do you think he would move for a Pardon? Says <hi>I,</hi> Did Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> move for <hi>Haynes</hi> Pardon? How do I know
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57458:43"/>
that, ſays <hi>Ivy</hi> again: <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Wife told me ſo. Says <hi>I,</hi> Let me ſpeak with <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Wife, let me hear her ſay ſo, and <hi>I</hi> will believe you. The next day he did bring her to me to my houſe: And this was the time and the occaſion that brought <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Wife, and <hi>Haynes,</hi> and <hi>Ivy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Maid to my houſe; and <hi>I</hi> never ſaw <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> in my days, till his Trial, nor had any Communication with him. But, my Lord, ſhe did talk with <hi>Haynes,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it to me, That her Husband had deſired a Pardon for him: Why then, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> he would do well to diſcover what he knows to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>; for <hi>I</hi> was with my Lord, and he ſays he will meddle no more, unleſs he will give it under his hand what he has to ſay. And he did confeſs to me in my own Yard, for there we were together, That he ſaw my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> come into the Chappel at <hi>Sommerſet</hi>-Houſe, when the Body of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> lay under the Altar.</p>

               <p>You may obſerve what you will upon the Evidence, as we told you; but you ramble from the matter you are to ſpeak to. And as we told Mr. Attorney, that what he ſaid ſhould go for nothing, unleſs he made it out by proof; ſo muſt we ſay to you, what you ſay goes for nothing, further than you have proved it. Now you have quitted the Proof quite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not ſpoke to that, but run into other ſtories. I would have you keep your ſelf to your Proofs, and make your Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Truth! Why if yours or any man's word in your caſe ſhould go for truth, no man that ſtands at a Bar, could be convicted: for every man will ſay he is an honeſt man, and all the plauſible things in the world. Make you your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the Proof, that is proper for you to do; and urge it as well as you can, and to the beſt purpoſe you can: but to tell us long ſtories of paſſages between you and others that are not a whit proved, that is not uſual, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>

               <p>Why do you think 'tis an Anſwer to him in what he proves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath? Have you proved one jot of it? not that I have heard. 'Tis your part to ſum up the Evidence on your own ſide, and to anſwer that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon you, if you can. Do that, and we will hear you ſpeak to it as long as you can. But to tell ſtories to amuſe the Jury with that are not proved, and to run out into rambling diſcourſes to no purpoſe, that is not to be allowed, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, in any Court of Juſtice.</p>

               <p>I wonder, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> you ſhould forget your ſelf ſo much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you found fault with Mr. Attorney at the beginning for opening the Evidence, and you were told, and the Jury were told at your requeſt, that what he ſaid, and did not prove, paſſed for nothing. But I muſt tell you, 'tis much worſe in your caſe: for Mr. Attorney onely opened what he might prove afterwards, but your Obſervations are upon what hath been proved already; and yet you run out into ſtories of what hath not been proved at all, after your Proof is paſt.</p>

               <p>There is no more than his Oath againſt me; and why my Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Engliſh-man and a Proteſtant, ſhould not be taken as well as his that is an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man and hath been a Papiſt, I know not.</p>

               <p>Pray, my Lord, then as to <hi>Haynes.</hi> My Lord, I do obſerve that there was a Witneſs for me that did prove, he owned he was one that was employed to make a Proteſtant Plot, and another that did hear him Swear, dam him, he would Swear any thing againſt any body for Money, for it was his Trade.</p>

               <speaker>L.C.J.</speaker>
               <p>As to the time mentioned in the Indictment, it is not material; that is the conſtant rule in Tryals upon Indictments; as if an Horſe be laid to be ſtole the tenth, if it be proved the priſoner ſtole it at another day, it will be ſufficient, the time is not material; the queſtion is whether the Indictment be true in ſubſtance. <hi>Mr. Colledge,</hi> my Brothers will all tell you that the Law is ſo.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Dugdale.</speaker>
               <p>It was when we were talking of one of the Pictures you brought in <hi>Rowley,</hi> and <hi>Mack</hi> and <hi>Mac</hi> was the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Rowley</hi> was the King.</p>

               <p>It may be I can't remember which of them it was, it was not <hi>Raree Shew</hi>; I ſuppoſe you gave me one of them concerning the Biſhops, where you put Biſhop <hi>Mew</hi> kiſſing the Popes Toe; for it was a Biſhop with a patch on, and that you told me was Biſhop <hi>Mew.</hi>

               <p>My Life and your Souls lye at ſtake to do me Juſtice; therefore I hope you will take notice of what I have not had the opportunity to write down. I have obſerved that every one of my Witneſſes have ſpoken materially to contradict what they have ſaid, to prove that this was done for Money, and that there hath been Confeſſions from every man of them; that they were hired to do it; that they did it for a Livelyhood; and one of them ſaid, It was a good Trade, dam him, he would do any thing for Money: And I hope then you will conſider the improbability, that I ſhould ſpeak to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man who I had never ſeen before in my life; and that I ſhould at the firſt daſh utter all that Treaſon that he gives in Evidence, I think it cannot conſiſt with any man's underſtanding to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me ſo mad or ſo weak.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſtice Levinz.</speaker>
               <p>That is as to <hi>Haynes</hi> only.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>As to <hi>Smith</hi> now I ſuppoſe it does not come within the reach of the Statute; for the Dinner that was made by Alderman <hi>Wilcox,</hi> was made before laſt <hi>July</hi> was twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month; all the Witneſſes do ſay it was before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays it was in the Summer; I know it by a very good obſervation, becauſe I went to <hi>Aſtrop</hi> Waters after that, and I ſaw Sir <hi>Creſwell Levinz</hi> at the <hi>Wells:</hi> Now Sir you were there before this time twelvemonth. So then whatever he ſays I ſaid to him there, I cannot be charged withal by the Statute, more or leſs, if I had never a Witneſs againſt him; but I have Witneſſes that have contradicted him ſufficiently that he is forſworn in that; and if ſo, he is not to be believed in any thing elſe; for he ſays, he and I went to the <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> together, and we diſcourſed ſuch and ſuch things, which is not above half a Bows ſhoot, and he made it I ſay a quarter of a miles diſcourſe; if I had had all the talk, the diſcourſe could not be ſo long, tho' he had ſaid never a word: So you ſee what a kind of Witneſs he is. And Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Brother did ſay, That I did go along with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and offered to be one of his Guard, and I did ſay ſo, and went along with them, but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he came after. And as to what he ſays he is ſufficiently confuted, that is, about the going into Cabals after Dinner; for it is proved, That I fell aſleep behind the Table, and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> upon points of Divinity; but I took no notice of it, neither did I ſee <hi>Smith</hi> any more, but he went away, and ſo did the reſt of the Company. But, my Lord, when <hi>Haynes</hi> was taken, <hi>Smith</hi> comes to me that day to my Houſe at the <hi>Ditch-ſide,</hi> and ſends in a man for me, his man; I was writing in my Parlour, and drawing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for Wainſcotting <hi>Alhallows</hi> Church, a Platform for it; his man told me, His Maſter would ſpeak with me, and <hi>Haynes</hi> was taken that morning: But as I underſtand ſince, it was by agreement and his own conſent, tho' he hath pretended otherwiſe. You hear, ſays he, <hi>Haynes</hi> is taken? Yes, ſays I, I do, he hath been ever ſince 9 a Clock before the Secretary upon Examination, and he was till 5 a Clock at night examining, ſaid he: I believe he confeſſes a great deal, ſaid I: Of what, ſaid he? Of ſome deſign of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> ſaid I: What, againſt the Government? I do not know what they may affright him into; he is a great Rogue if it be true all that he hath ſaid of himſelf: He ſays, He was concerned in the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and knew of a Deſign to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> then; of a Rebellion that was to be in <hi>Ireland</hi>; of <hi>Plunket</hi>'s being made <hi>Primate,</hi> and a great many of thoſe things: So that if he ſpeaks truth, he hath been a great Rogue, and as he hath pretended alſo, he was a great Coward. So then I believe he may ſay any thing to excuſe himſelf; ſays Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> I wiſh you are ſafe: This was the very night before I was taken.</p>

               <p>He ſpake cautiouſly to me, as if he would have intimated to me, he would have had me run away. Said he, I believe you are not ſafe, I would have you take care of your ſelf, for you were concerned with him. Now, my Lord, if I had been a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I had time enough to get away; and to prove this, I can only ſay, this was betwixt him and I. But, my Lord, you hear Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, that this very <hi>Smith</hi> did ſwear he would have my Bloud, and that was upon this occaſion of my vindicating <hi>Sampſon,</hi> whom he had ſtruck and abuſed; and I asked, Why he did it? Said he, I value no man's Life, if he affront me, if 'tis any man in <hi>England,</hi> I value him not. My Lord, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the words riſe between us; and when he came out of doors, and was going away, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſaid, He ſwore he would have my Bloud, and that was the occaſion of his ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Blaſphemy.</p>

I have been Armed ready to oppoſe the Papiſts, and I did my duty in the City in perſon in the Trained bands, but <hi>Smith</hi> ſays theſe Arms were to deſtroy the Kings Guards, but he does not prove that I was Confederate with any other perſon, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that there were other perſons that ſay with his own mouth, that he did not believe there was any Proteſtant Plot; nay, he did believe I ſaid it only in wantonneſs. This is all, then how probable was it, that I my ſelf ſhould ſeize the King, or deſtroy his Guards.</p>

               <p>I dare appeal to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Charlton,</hi> in whoſe ſhop the diſcourſe was. I did not know that Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> was to be an Evidence againſt me, and truly they have taken that courſe with me, by which any man may be deſtroyed with half this Evidence, were they of good Credit, let his Innocence be what it will. I have been uſed ſo barbarouſly in the <hi>Tower,</hi> kept from all Converſation, and ſo in an utter ignorance of what was ſworn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; for elſe I could eaſily have diſproved Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> if I had been in <hi>London,</hi> and had liberty to provide for my defence; but they have taken a courſe to prevent that, and brought me hither becauſe 'tis impoſſible I ſhould here defend my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> diſcourſe he ſpeaks of was in Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi>'s ſhop, I durſt have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to him about it, for I know if he were here he would do me right. Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> did ſay the Parliament cut off the late Kings Head. We held a diſpute upon that which I was not willing to enter into; I ſaid they did not, and we did then diſpute whether they began the War againſt his Majeſty: I ſaid they did not that I knew of, neither were they the perſons, but the Papiſts that began that War and that broke off the Treaty at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> and that the Papiſts carryed it on to that ſad iſſue, and put it upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that they had the <hi>odium</hi> of it, but it was another ſort of men that carryed it on. I ſaid that I did always underſtand that Parliament to be an honeſt Parliament, that minded the true Intereſt of the Nation, and much of the ſame opinion with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that fate laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But before I ſaid this, I ſaid they were perſons altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent of the Kings murder, and raiſing the War againſt the King, I did always underſtand that ſo the Parliament in 40 were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But they were guilty of a Rebellion, and are declared ſo by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince His Majeſty came in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am unacquainted with the Law, I ſpeak only my ſenſe of it. And my Lord, I did excuſe them as to the Murder of the King, and the beginning of the War, that according to my underſtanding they were not Guilty of it, and from thence I did maintain they were an honeſt good Parliament, and much of opinion with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that ſat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which was for the true Intereſt of the Nation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>And was that the true Intereſt of the Nation, to cut off the King's Head?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I did argue that with him ſome time, and I did tell him that it was the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that did all the Miſchief.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>But he ſayes no, upon his Oath, that when he had ſaid, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begun the Rebellion, and the Parliament did cut off the King's Head, you ſaid the Parliament did nothing but what they had juſt Cauſe for, and the Parliament that ſat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was of the ſame mind.</p>

               <p>No, you did not ſay any ſuch thing. We had a great deal of diſcourſe in the Shop, and under the Arch, and the thing that was ſaid, Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> was this. You did ſay to me that you did juſtifie the late long Parliament of 40, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and you ſaid they were a Parliament that did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe for: ſaid I, how can you be ſo impudent to ſay ſo, when they raiſed the Rebellion againſt the King, and cut off his head: ſaid he again, they did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe for, and the Parliament that ſat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were of the ſame opinion.</p>

               <p>Don't you ſay ſo, for I ſaid the Papiſts began the War.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> it was ſo far from that, that I was afraid it was of dangerous Conſequence, and I gave ſome Perſons of Honour an accompt of it, and I was ſent to but on Friday laſt, to know what it was was ſaid, and I was deſired and commanded to come down hither.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I think you did ſay that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had an hand in it; but, Sir, you have left out the moſt material part of our Diſcourſe, which was, that you ſaid they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they had juſt cauſe for.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I do ſay, and it was my ſence always, That the Parliament did not cut off the King's Head, for they were long out of doors before that came to paſs, and a new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War was begun.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>The War was a Rebellion on the Parliaments part, let us not mince the matter, and ſo it was declared by Act of Parliament; and if you argued after that rate, it ſhews your temper, and that you are a very ill man; for they that juſtifie ſuch things as to the time paſſed, would lead us to the ſame things again if they could. Therefore don't go about to palliate it, <hi>ad faciendum populum</hi> here, 'tis nothing to the matter, but only to ſhew your Principles, and the Jury have heard what Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> ſays.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Levinz.</speaker>
               <p>It was the Garbage of that Parliament I am ſure, that is the <hi>Rump,</hi> but they called themſelves the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the Parliament it was that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the War.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>My Lord, I did not know, nor don't know that it is proved yet, that the Parliament were thoſe that did cut off the King's Head. I don't know, Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57458:46"/>
pleas'd to ſay this of me; but I thought no evil, nor did he underſtand it ſo I believe at that time, for he did not ſeem to take advantage of my Diſcourſe. I know he talked vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and paſſionately with me, as he uſed to do; and for Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> to ſay this of me now, is a great unkindneſs; for I thought he was ſo much a Gentleman, that if I had ſpoken any thing that had not become me, he would have taken notice of it then.</p>

               <p>Had I known of it, I am ſure Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> would have done me juſtice, and ſet things right; but this I ſay, I did firſt excuſe the Parliament from being concerned in the Murder of the King, or that they did begin the War, but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did it: If it were otherwiſe, it was more than I underſtood; and after that I ſaid, I thought that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſate laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> did ſtand up for the Peoples Rights, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the Parliament in 40. did.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>What juſt after the ſame manner, in raiſing War and Rebellion againſt the King?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>After I had diſcourſed it thus, my Lord, as I told you, it could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that I thought that Parliament would cut off the King's Head: And therefore you that are my Jury, pray conſider, and take it all together, there could be no ſuch meaning made of my words; for I did not conceive that that Parliament were concerned in thoſe things, but were a Parliament that ſtood up for the Rights of the People; Now if it were ſo, then the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were of the ſame opinion.</p>

               <p>Yes, My Lord, I take it upon that Statute.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you as to that part of the Statute which concerns Miſdemeanors, there is a particular clauſe for proſecution by order of King or Council; but as to that part of the Statute that concerns Treaſon, it muſt be proſecuted within ſix months, and the Inditement within three months after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What Statute is this Inditement grounded upon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>All Statutes that concern Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Upon the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which declares the Common-Law, and the Statute of the 13th of this King, which when you have done, I will have read to the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Then pray my Lord, let me ask you one queſtion, Whether the Statute of the 25th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. does not ſay that there ſhall be two poſitive Witneſſes to Treaſon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>No, but there is another that does.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I am ignorant of the Law, and therefore I ask the queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I will tell you, there muſt be two Witneſſes in the Caſe, but one Witneſs to one fact at one time, and another Witneſs to another fact at another time, will be ſufficient Evidence to maintain an Indictment of Treaſon; this was told you in the morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſt. <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And it was told you withal, That it was the reſolution of all the Judges in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> when he was tryed in Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>They proved fact in that Caſe, writing of Letters, and offering money to kill the King, but nothing of fact is proved againſt me, but riding into the Country with Arms that I had three years before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>We will read the Statute of the 13th, wherein words are declared to be Treaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I pray it may be read, if you pleaſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>(<hi>which was done.</hi>)</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Look you here, To compaſs or imagine the impriſonment of the King and to expreſs it by malitious and adviſed ſpeaking, when proved by two lawful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, is Treaſon by this Act.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Now, whether you will diſtinguiſh, that there muſt be two Witneſſes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57458:47"/>
places or times, or whether the Statute intends two Witneſſes to every particular fact and words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>We told you our Opinion before, That one Witneſs to one fact, and another to another of the ſame Treaſon, was ſufficient. We are upon our Oaths in it, and ſpeak not our own Opinions, but what hath received publick reſolution in Caſes of the like conſequence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>What lies before theſe Gentlemen of the Jury as done at <hi>Oxon,</hi> 'tis but upon a ſingle teſtimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Juſt. Levinz.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> both ſwear the ſame thing, your deſign to ſeize the King at <hi>Oxon.</hi> And it would be the difficulteſt thing in the world to prove Treaſon againſt any man if the Law were not ſo, and a man might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all ſorts of Treaſon ſecurely; for to be ſure he would never ſay the ſame things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two Witneſſes in one time, and the King would be no ſort ſafe; for there would never be two Witneſſes to one and the ſame thing: But that hath been reſolved often and often over and over again, particularly in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe, as you have been told.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you ſay the King is not ſafe upon thoſe terms, and no private man is ſafe in the other way.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Levinz.</speaker>
               <p>We ſay that the Law is ſo, and there is good reaſon for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>We muſt not alter nor depart from the allowed received Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay the thing hath been conſidered in other Caſes, and the Law hath been adjudged and ſetled. It was ſo reſolved in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Caſe when the Judges by the command of the Parliament did deliver their Opinion upon that point moved by him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing of fact proved againſt me but a pair of Piſtols, a Sword, and an Horſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>We have told you the Law, and anſwered your queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>But as the Caſe ſtands, if that be the Law, all Society and Converſation muſt be ruined by it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Pray go on, when do you think we ſhall have done elſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>However I do not inſiſt upon that ſo much, as that the Teſtimonies and Oaths of theſe men are altogether invalidated, by ſubſtantial perſons that have here teſtified againſt them. I do declare upon my Salvation, (I have nothing elſe to ſay) I am wholly innocent, and the Jury are my Judges, and I beſeech them, as they will anſwer me at the great day of Judgement, where they muſt appear as ſure as I ſtand at this Bar now, that they do me right, and go according to their own Conſciences; for if a man ſhall be ſworn againſt by ſuch Fellows as theſe are, no man is ſafe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</speaker>
               <p>The worſe, the better to be truſted by you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure it cannot be thought by men of common Reaſon, that I ſhould ſpeak Treaſon at that rate that they have ſworn, and to ſuch men, men of their Profeſſion, <hi>Iriſh</hi> men, and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Traitors that have declared they have been in all manner of Rogueries, Murders, Plots and Treaſons. Therefore, my Lord, I cannot do any more for my ſelf, becauſe I have no Notes, and cannot recite what hath been ſaid for me or againſt me; but I do depend upon your Lordſhip, and I hope you will inform the Jury rightly, and do me Juſtice; and I do pray the Jury that they will let their Conſciences be ſatisfied, as they are <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and as they are Chriſtians, to conſider how the Caſe lyes with me, whether there has not been more occaſion of talking of late, and whether a ſlip of the Tongue may be called a premeditated, malicious, adviſed ſpeaking, I mean, my Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Maſters.</hi> He talked with me as hot as fire, he was ſo violent, and I did diſcourſe him at that rate I have told you, and that is truth, as I have a Soul to be ſaved: I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Parliament, that as I underſtood it, they had no hand in the beginning of the War, or the Murder of the King. My Lord, As for the reſt that have ſworn againſt me ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately, I muſt ſay, that if the Jury did not as well conſider my Evidence as theirs, yet they might well conſider, whether it conſiſts with common ſence and reaſon, that I ſhould ſpeak to theſe men after this rate, when I could lay no obligation upon them, nor have any confidence in them; neceſſitous perſons, that could not aſſiſt me one Mite, men that were beholding to me to borrow Money of me, and that eat of my coſt, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been obliging to, and not they to me. But I hope I need inſiſt upon this no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the whole Nation is ſenſible what is doing, and what this does ſignifie: They have begun with me in order to the making of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, which they would carry on
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57458:47"/>
to ſtifle the noiſe of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot; and this is not the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> nor the 10<hi>th.</hi> time that they have been at this Game; how many Shams have they endeavoured to raiſe—</p>

               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>They were all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and I believe are ſo ſtill; for Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did juſtifie to me the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſeveral things: And when I told him that they were all Knaves and Fools that were of that Religion, he told me, that many of their Prieſts were holy good men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Have you proved that?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>I can't prove it, it was betwixt him and me, my Lord.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Jones.</speaker>
               <p>Then I hope you have done.</p>

               <p>If I had ſworn againſt him, he had ſtood in my place.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done, Mr. <hi>Colledge?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I only deſire the Jury to take all into their ſerious Conſideration; I expect a ſtorm of Thunder from the learned Counſel to fall upon me, who have liberty to ſpeak, and being learned in the Law, underſtand theſe things better than I, who muſt defend my ſelf without Counſel. I know not whether it be the practice in any Nation, but certainly 'tis hard meaſure, that I being illiterate and ignorant in the Law muſt ſtand here all day, they being many, and taking all advantages againſt me, and I a ſingle perſon, and not able to uſe one means or another either of writing or ſpeaking. But, Gentlemen, I do declare and proteſt, as I ſhall anſwer it at the day of Judgement, that as to what theſe people have ſworn againſt me either as to words, or as to any manner of Treaſon againſt the King, the Government, the Laws eſtabliſhed, I take God to witneſs I am as innocent as any perſon upon Earth. And therefore I muſt beſeech you be not frightened nor flattered; do according to your Judgements and your Conſciences; you are to be my Judges both in Law and Fact; you are to acquit me or to condemn me, and my Bloud will be required at your hands. And whatſoever is ſaid to you by others, you are my true Judges, you muſt give an account of the Verdict you give; and therefore you muſt ſee that you do Juſtice, as you will anſwer it at another Bar, where you muſt all certainly appear, and the Lord Almighty direct you that you do me true Juſtice, and I ask no more.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. Here hath been a great deal of time ſpent, and truly I think for no other Reaſon but to divert you from the matter that is before you, and that you might forget the Evidence that hath been given. And therefore I will briefly repeat it to you, that I may refreſh your memories about what hath been ſworn. Gentlemen, the Crime charged upon Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> is High Treaſon in imagining and compaſſing the death of the King; the proof of that hath been by a Conſpiracy to ſeize the King here at <hi>Oxon,</hi> which Conſpiracy he declared he was in, by ſhewing Arms prepared for that purpoſe, and by coming down to <hi>Oxon</hi> with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, this is the proof of his deſign to kill the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Is the Conſpiracy proved of that Mr. Solicitor?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> We have had a great deal of patience with you, you have ſpent a great deal of time, you muſt contain your ſelf now, and let them go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Do not let him do me wrong my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I will do you no wrong Mr. <hi>Colledge.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, there is no Conſpiracy proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> you have taken up a great deal of time, and we have had much patience becauſe we conſider your condition, and had rather hear too much than be hard upon you, and becauſe the Evidence was long and difficult to repeat, now we have heard you, you muſt have patience to hear what the Kings Counſel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat and obſerve upon it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>As I was ſaying the fact that is charged upon him, is a deſign to kill the King, the manifeſtation of that deſign is by preparing Arms to that purpoſe, and by coming down to <hi>Oxon</hi> to ſeize the King here, and that this was his manifeſt intent to ſeize the King, the proof of it hath been by Witneſſes, that I think by and by you will have no Objections againſt. Theſe Witneſſes were <hi>Dugdale, Turbervile, Smith</hi> and <hi>Haynes,</hi> theſe are the moſt material Witneſſes to the Treaſon, there are two other Witneſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but they are to other circumſtantial matters that I will take notice of to you by and by, and make my obſervations upon them in their proper place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57458:48"/>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was the firſt Witneſs that was produced, and his Evidence is very full, he proves that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> declared to him at the Coffee-houſe here, that he was come down with an intent to ſeize the King, that he had an expectation ſome thing would be done, that he was Armed, and that he did adviſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to be Armed too, for he was provided for the rooting out of Popery, which he explained himſelf what he meant by it, that was the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the King and all his Adherents. He came hither Armed for that purpoſe Gentlemen, and did adviſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to Arm himſelf too, that he did declare to him the King was a Papiſt, and all his Family were Papiſts, he was as deep in the Plot, and as Guilty of the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey,</hi> as any body elſe. This was what he declared to <hi>Dugdale</hi> here, and this he ſwore to you when he gave his Evidence.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and he is poſitive to the matter that is laid in the Indictment, and ſwears to you expreſly, that he did declare to him at the <hi>Chequer-Inn,</hi> that they came down here in expectation of ſome ſport, that ſomething would be done, that they did expect the King would begin with them, but if they did not, they would begin with him, and they would ſecure him till they had brought him to Complyance. He ſhewed him his Arms, that he was ready to ingage in that deſign, and adviſed <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi> to be ready too. And the rather than <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſhould not be ready he offered to procure him an Horſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Every man had the ſame Armes that I had, and I had had them long before that time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But every one had them not with the ſame intent, but Gentlemen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> interrupts me with an Objection, I will take notice of it now by the way. He ſays thoſe Armes he had before, and therefore they were not provided for this purpoſe, Gentlemen, we do not pretend to prove when this Trayterous intent firſt began, and how long this deſign hath been hatching, but ſuch a deſign there was, and ſuch a deſign he manifeſted to be in himſelf when he made the Declaration to <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and adviſed him to Arme himſelf, whether he prepared them againſt that time or no is not material, if he had them before, and if he had them firſt innocently, yet if he afterwards deſigned them for ſuch a purpoſe, and ſhewed them in a readineſs for it, that is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence to prove this Treaſon.</p>
               <p>So here are two Witneſſes you obſerve againſt the Priſoner of this matter that is laid againſt him in the Indictment, an intent to kill the King, they both prove it poſitively upon him at <hi>Oxon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſpeaks to matters precedent to, for he tells you, his diſcourſe before they came down, that they would come down for that purpoſe, that they had an expectation ſome thing would be done, and therefore he came down in an Equipage not ſuitable to his profeſſion, for you ſee he was by Trade a Carpenter or a Joyner, but Armed on Horſeback with a Caſe of Piſtols, things that don't become ſuch men to Travel with, and he did declare to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> for what purpoſe he came down. The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> is as poſitive and full to this matter of Treaſon as any of the reſt.</p>

               <p>He tells you of a diſcourſe as he came from the Coffee-houſe to go to a Dinner whither he was invited by Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi>; and the diſcourſe was, That the King was as great a Papiſt as the Duke, and much more to that purpoſe vilifying the King. That Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi> was a man that gave Money to buy Armes to bring the King to ſubmiſſion. He objects againſt this, and ſays, 'tis impoſſible ſuch a diſcourſe ſhould be, and that all this ſhould be talked in ſo little a time, as in paſſing from the Coffee-houſe to the Crown-Tavern without <hi>Temple-Barr.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But Gentlemen, when you conſider, how buſie a man he was, and how ready at talking of Treaſon, you will not think, but that this man might talk much more than this; but this I mention to do him right, it being one of the Arguments he uſed; and to give an Anſwer to it, tho' when you conſider it, I believe you will think it not to need an Anſwer. But I would do him all the right I can, and now you have heard it, you will conſider the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, he tells you of another diſcourſe afterwards that does relate to his being here at <hi>Oxon,</hi> he tells you he had Armes in his houſe, and was ready upon all occaſions, and he ſhew'd Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> his Armes, and told him, theſe were the things that were to deſtroy <hi>Rowley</hi>'s Guards, as he ſaid, which by the Evidence is made to appear he meant the King by that name, his Armes he ſaid were for that purpoſe. That he would go down to <hi>Oxon,</hi> and there he expected ſome ſport, I know not what ſport he thinks there is in Rebellion; you ſee what principles he is of, that does maintain and juſtif<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the greateſt and horrideſt Rebellion that ever was in <hi>England,</hi> and ſays they did nothing but what they had good cauſe for. He tells <hi>Smith</hi> that he thought the King would ſeize upon ſome Members, and with that expectation he came down, but he was as ready as the King, and would be one in the ſecuring of him, if he medled with any of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. This proof Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> made; and that after the Parliament was diſſolved, he ſaid, that the King ran away, and was very much afraid. This is proved by <hi>Smith</hi> likewiſe, and this <hi>Colledge</hi> did declare after he came to Town. <hi>Smith</hi> proves further, That he did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King did not conſider how eaſily his Father's Head was brought to the Block; and for Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s part he did declare, that he did believe this King would be ſerved ſo ſhortly. And this does confirm what his other Witneſſes have ſpoken of his words at <hi>Oxon.</hi> Thus then there are three Witneſſes, tho' two are enough to convict a man, if they be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> is the 4<hi>th.</hi> Witneſs, and he is as full as any of them. I do but repeat it in ſhort; you have had it ſo often canvaſſed by <hi>Colledge,</hi> that I believe you will eaſily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it. He did adviſe <hi>Haynes</hi> that he ſhould not value the King at all, for the King ſhould be called to account for all his Actions; he ſaid he would ſeize the King and bring him to the Block as they did his Father, with an undecent expreſſion of that bleſſed King not fit to be repeated. And he ſaid, they did intend when they had cut off him, never any more of his Race ſhould Raign; this it was <hi>Haynes</hi> ſays, tho' there are other matters. I would take notice of one thing more, and I need not but mention it, you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, and that is about the Libel of <hi>Fitzharris. Haynes</hi> tells you upon diſcourſe of that Libel, he ſaid, that every word of it was true, as ſure as God is in Heaven. Now that was a Libel made by a Papiſt, an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, who hath been Tryed, Convicted, and Executed for it, and the horrideſt Libel it was, that ever was Writ. And this is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel which this Gentleman, who is ſo very converſant in Libels, and Books of that ſort, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to be as true as God is in Heaven. This is the ſubſtance Gentlemen of that proof which hath been made to you; we have other Circumſtances to prove, that as he came down with that intent to ſeize the King, and as he expected what he calls ſome ſport, ſo he did endeavour to begin the ſport, he did quarrel in the Lobby of the Houſe of Lords with <hi>Fitz Gerald,</hi> ſome blows paſſed, and Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> telling him his Noſe bled, he did declare I have loſt the firſt blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be long before there be more loſt. Thus after he had come down, he endeavoured to begin a Commotion, for from little matters great things do ſometimes ariſe, and when all men were poſſeſt with an Expectation, ſuch as he himſelf did declare, he and others came down with an expectation that the Parliament ſhould be attacked; a little matter, might have begun ſuch a Commotion which no man knows what end it would have had.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this hath been our proof. Now the Objection made to this proof by Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> is, That this is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> deſign to raiſe a new Plot, and caſt it upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and that theſe Witneſſes are now to deny all the Evidence they have given of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57458:49"/>
the Popiſh Plot, and throw all upon the Proteſtants. This is that he would perſwade you to believe, but which I think when you do conſider a little of it, it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you in the leaſt to have ſuch a thought. For what are the Evidence that have <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ved this? who are they? Men of Credit, that have been Evidences againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plotters, and againſt men that have ſuffered for that Plot, men that ſtill ſtand to the Evidence they have given, and affirm it every word to be true, and one of the very men that he brought ſays, that they ſtill ſtand to it; for <hi>Turbervile</hi> who was one of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was tempted by ſome perſons to deny the Evidence he had given againſt the Papiſts, but his anſwer was, no, I can never depart from it, I have a ſoul to ſave, that was true which I ſaid, I cannot deny it. It then the Witneſſes which he would have you believe to be guilty of denying the Popiſh Plott, do confirm what they have ſaid as to that diſcovery, that objection is taken off, and they doe ſtand ſtill to if that every part of it was true, and aver the ſame thing; and yet forſooth theſe men are going about to ſtifle this Plot.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, theſe are the men the whole Nation have given credit to, the Parliament having impeached my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> upon the credit of them (for it was upon the credit of <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that they impeached him, for there was not two Witneſſes till <hi>Turbervile</hi> came in and made a Second, and upon their credit) after ſo ſolemn a Tryal where all the Objections that could poſſibly be made were made, the Houſe of Lords thought fit to find my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> Guilty, and my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſuffered for it, and dyed upon the credit of theſe men. Theſe are the Witneſſes Gentlemen, that this man thinks ought to be blown off with that frivolous Objection, that they are Perſons he would have you believe, who are Guilty of a deſign to throw the Plot upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. But becauſe he hath deſired to ſave himſelf in an Herd, by numbring himſelf amongſt the Proteſtants. I muſt a little obſerve to you what a ſort of Proteſtant he is, a man he would have you to believe, ſo popular for his Religion, that he hath obtained the name of the Proteſtant Joyner. But when you have conſidered what his Actions are, I believe you will a little ſuſpect his Religion. If the Proteſtant Religion allow any man to vilifie the King, to Arraign the Government, and to throw off all manner of allegiance, then this man is a Proteſtant: but if this be to act the part of a Papiſt, and if the Papiſts could wiſh that ſuch an infamy might be put upon the Proteſtant Religion, that it ſhould juſtifie ſuch a Rebellion as the late horrid one was, and own ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that it is lawful for any Subject to aſperſe and vilifie the King, as this man by thoſe many and ſcurrilous Libels ſeems to do; If they could wiſh this Nation overturned, and the Government in confuſion, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> deſtroyed, the Beſt Bulwark now in the world againſt Popery, and the beſt or only refuge at this day left for the poor afflicted <hi>Proteſtants</hi> abroad. Then whileſt Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> does thus act the part of a Papiſt, he does very ill to call himſelf a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Gentlemen, I cannot but obſerve one thing to you, and it was the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> when he did firſt diſcover the Plot, and without his Evidence you would eaſily believe the thing. He told you there were two ways they had to accompliſh their deſign, by direct murdering of the King, or if that failed, by putting all things into confuſion here, and raiſing Rebellion and diſturbance amongſt us, and the way to affect that Rebellion it was by having Emiſſaries ſent among us, to work us into a diſlike of the Church, and by that means into a Rebellion againſt the State. That ſome men were ſent abroad for that purpoſe to preach at Conventicles, ſome whereof were catched, and ſome did ſuffer. Now without this Evidence it would not be hard to believe, that ſuch there are, and have been, for all that know the Hiſtory of our Reformation do know that it was an early practice among them, to raiſe Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to bring confuſion firſt into the Church, and then in the State. And we have already found the ſad effects of it.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, if <hi>Colledge</hi> have all this while under the name of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> acted the part of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> though I cannot ſay he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor that he is one of thoſe Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet I may ſay he is not that good <hi>Proteſtant</hi> he pretends to be. Gentlemen, I muſt now to do him right, come to repeat the Evidence that he hath given againſt our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; for Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> he hath produced ſeveral Witneſſes, one is Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> who ſays
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57458:49"/>
he overheard <hi>Haynes</hi> ſay to one that was his Tenant, that it was his trade to ſwear, and he muſt get money by it. This he overheard him ſtanding and liſtning at a door. You have another man <hi>Lun,</hi> that is the next Witneſs, and he ſays that at the <hi>Fleet-ditch</hi> where he ſaw him, there he declared the ſame thing to him, that he would ſwear any thing for money, and dam his ſoul rather than the Catholick Cauſe ſhould ſink; and now He comes to prove a Plot upon him that is a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon all the Proteſtants of <hi>England,</hi> and this man would fain throw off the credit of the Popiſh Plot, and turn it upon the Proteſtants. But Gentlemen it is ſtrange, that Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> ſhould have this diſcourſe with <hi>Lun,</hi> the firſt time that ever he ſaw him, for I am ſure his own Witneſs <hi>Lun</hi> ſays it was the firſt time, and that he ſhould immediately talk to him at this rate is ſomewhat ſtrange: But for an Anſwer to it, this <hi>Lun</hi> we have confronted with the Evidence of <hi>White</hi> the Meſſenger, who ſwears, that afterwards meeting him at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge, Lun</hi> asked him what Gentleman that was, and did not know Mr. <hi>Haynes,</hi> and yet he takes upon him to prove, that he had ſpoke ſuch words to him before. I think there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another material Witneſs againſt <hi>Haynes</hi> except <hi>Whaley,</hi> who was an under-Officer in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>; and he ſays, that <hi>Haynes</hi> while he was a Priſoner there ran away with a ſilver Tankard, but he never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted or proſecuted for it, tho' he remained afterwards in the Houſe; and this was 5 or 6 years ago.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, I think the nature of this Evidence hath not that weight, as to take off the credit of what this man hath ſaid upon his Oath, eſpecially when this man's Evidence is ſo backed with the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of other men, that I think there is no Objection at all againſt it. For the other Witneſſes, <hi>Dugdale, Smith</hi> and <hi>Turbervile,</hi> are men whoſe credit has not been impeached, and they have confirmed in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance what the Evidence of <hi>Haynes</hi> is; ſo that he does not ſtand alone in what he here ſwears, but 'tis confirmed with concurrent Evidence with it.</p>
               <p>Then Gentlemen, for the Objection againſt <hi>Dugdale, Turbervile</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> they have produc'd Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to you, and he muſt vilifie the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of thoſe men, whoſe teſtimony as to what he gave at firſt in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Popiſh Plot, received credit by being ſeconded by theſe men. And I cannot but obſerve it as a ſtrange thing, that this man comes now to vilifie the teſtimony of thoſe, who have given evidence and been credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the whole Kingdom; that he ſhould come here upon the word of a Prieſt to declare, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a man of very lewd Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and was a perſon that had a ſoul Diſeaſe on him, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he was poiſoned. I remember this was an Objection that hath been made by the <hi>Papists</hi> to him, and I believe you have heard it often out of their mouths; but it is the firſt time that ever I heard it from any one that is a Witneſs of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, and pretends to ſtand up for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion. Gentlemen, if any ſuch thing as this could have been made out againſt him, it had been made out ere now, the <hi>Papists</hi> would have taken advantage of it; and when the wit of all that Party was bent againſt him, he could not have eſcaped the having it proved. If
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57458:50"/>
it had been true, yet Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> takes upon him now to vilifie his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and takes up thoſe Arguments the <hi>Papists</hi> have maliciouſly ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but yet were never able to make out. This looks as if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor were again returning to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> that he is thus going about to diſparage the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> which in great meaſure verified the truth of that diſcovery, which himſelf firſt made of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Turbervile,</hi> Gentlemen, I think there hath been very little at all objected that can have weight with you. Mr. <hi>Brodgate,</hi> as I ſuppoſe you obſerve, has ſaid enough to confirm <hi>Turbervile</hi>'s credit; for he hath proved to you, That when he was tempted to renounce his Evidence againſt the <hi>Papists,</hi> he refuſed to do it, he had more conſcience than to do it, he knew well enough what he had ſaid was true, and as he had a Soul to ſave, he could not go from it. This is the Evidence that he gives, and which certainly ſerves much to confirm the truth of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile,</hi> beſides the ſtrict Examination he hath been under, and beyond any thing that Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I think, has been able to contradict him in.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> condradicts <hi>Smith</hi> about his coming from the <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> to <hi>Wilcox</hi>'s Dinner. He ſays, he did not come along with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> but <hi>Colledge</hi> came along with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> followed them. But, Gentlemen, you hear what <hi>Smith</hi> hath declared upon his Oath, That they came both together out of the <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi>; and you hear what his Witneſs Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Councellor ſays: He does not poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that circumſtance, yet one would think he ſhould; for <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Lawyer walked juſt before them, and <hi>Colledge</hi> followed. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> that is the Witneſs for the King, he ſwears he came along with <hi>Colledge,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Lawyer being asked that Queſtion, he does not remember that. Then another thing is, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſayes, when they were there, <hi>Colledge</hi> was ſo far from diſcourſing of any Treaſonable matters, that he was very merry in the Company, and talking innocently, but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſayes, he was ſo far from being merry or talking Treaſon, that he fell faſt aſleep, and ſlept behind the Table. Gentlemen, theſe Objections you ſee what the weight of them is, and how little the Evidence agree one with another, but there is nothing that does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his main Evidence. 'Tis poſſible they may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member particular Circumſtances, whether Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> came together, ſo they might come together for ought they know, and they may not remember any Circumſtance about their retiring, but they can't take upon them to ſwear it is not ſo, and their not remembring it does not prove it was not ſo, and the Circumſtance it ſelf is ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, that there was no neceſſity they ſhould remember it. So then no Evidence that comes from Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> can take off that that is given by <hi>Smith,</hi> tho' if Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> were out of the Caſe, and Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> too, yet there is Evidence ſufficient from Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> who are not impeached, and are both of them poſitive, both to the Fact and to the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57458:50"/>There are two Witneſſes more that I muſt mention, and they are <hi>Balron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi>; They Swear that <hi>Smith</hi> Travelling upon the Road with them, would have Subborned them to Swear againſt <hi>John Brooks,</hi> about a Diſcourſe at ſome place; but it happened Gentlemen, they differ in point of time in their Teſtimony, the one ſaid it was the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the other was poſitive it was the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But I think I need ſay no more to theſe men, but only to deſire you to weigh their Credit. <hi>Balron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> I confeſs have been Evidence againſt ſeveral men that have been accuſed of the Popiſh-Plot, but they have been ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as never to gain Credit with any Jury. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath been believed by the whole Court of Parliament; But if there were no more in the Caſe, theſe are two men that never were yet believed, men that have been Sworn in their own Country, where they are well known, and been Evidence upon Tryals, but the Jury have rejected the Credit of their Teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But beſides that, comparing the Teſtimonies, and the difference that was between them, is a ſufficient Evidence to Confront all that they have ſaid.</p>
               <p>I think Gentlemen, this is the Subſtance of what hath been offered by his Witneſſes againſt the Witneſſes produced for the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except that of Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> who ſays ſomething againſt <hi>Haynes,</hi> that <hi>Haynes</hi> ſhould ſay he Swore for Self-preſervation; And againſt Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he ſays, that he heard him ſay, he did not know of any <hi>Presbyterian Plot.</hi> I believe that may be true, and yet it does not contradict <hi>Smith</hi>'s Evidence againſt <hi>Colledge</hi>; for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does not tell you, that he was privy to any ſuch Deſign of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that he knows of any Conſultations that they held, or the ways and means by which they would arrive at the Treaſon Charged upon the Priſoner at the Bar, but his Evidence is, that this man declared there was ſuch a Deſign, that there was a Party would do it, and that he would be ſure to be one, and Armed himſelf for that purpoſe; But his not being Privy to any Plot, or knowing the particulars, is no Contradiction to what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>This is that he hath produced for his Defence, and by theſe things he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take off the Credit of our Witneſſes, and he would have you believe that he is a very good Proteſtant, though he does that which no Proteſtant would do, and which is the Papiſts work, he hath produced you Witneſſes that he has gone to Church, but I do not ſee he hath produced any Witneſſes at all that are now Converſant with him, his own Pariſhoners in <hi>London</hi>; but if he had brought never ſo many Witneſſes of his going to Church, and of his Conformableneſs to the Church, yet if he were Guilty of theſe practices, he muſt give me leave to ſuſpect the Truth of his Profeſſion; and I think it a great piece of arrogance for him to take upon him the Title of a Proteſtant, when he hath abuſed that Title by ſuch unſuitable practices: And Gentlemen, if ſuch practices as theſe are, which we have fully proved, are ſuch as all good men muſt abhor, I cannot but reflect upon the condition of this man, whoſe only hopes is, that you ſhould now forget your ſelves, and become as ill as he is. But as that cannot be preſumed, ſo I ſhall not need to ſay any more to you; you are men of that conſideration that can judge between things, and the appearances of them, and know very well how to give the due weight to the Evidence we have given to you, as well as the Objections made by the Priſoner; and ſo Gentlemen I ſhall leave it to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant <hi>Jeffries,</hi> May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; It hath been a long time that hath been ſpent in the courſe of this Evidence; whether there has been any Art or Deſign in protracting the time, on purpoſe to obtrude upon the patience of the Court, or that you Gentlemen ſhould forget the force of the Evidence that hath been given againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, when there hath been ſo much time taken up unneceſſarily, when there was no occaſion, as I muſt needs ſay, there was not for ſuch a tedious Defence, I leave It to you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: But that which was truly intimated by the Court at the beginning of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57458:51"/>
Tryal, muſt in the end of this Cauſe be Repeated, and indeed go through it all, that we of the Kings Councel, and what the Priſoner has affirmed, that has not been given in proof, ſignifying nothing, and is not to be any guide at all to you. You are upon your Oaths, and by the Oath you have taken you are bound in Conſcience to give a Verdict according to the Evidence that has been given to you, and that is your guide; ſo that what we opened and have not proved, is no more to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved then what the Priſoner has ſaid for himſelf in his own Defence; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſays, if he make not good proof of it, is no more to be regarded, then what we who are for the King have alledged, and not made out.</p>
               <p>So then this being in the firſt place premiſed, I ſhall take care as near as I can to ſave the time of the Court, and not to Treſpaſs on your Patience Gentlemen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, in a Caſe whereupon as great a concern does depend, as perhaps ever came to Tryal at any Bar: For I ſay 'tis a Caſe wherein the Life and the Liberty of the King is concerned, and that is the great concern of the Nation; the Religion of the Nation is concerned; I would be underſtood aright, I mean the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Law; for I know of no other Religion men ought to Sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for, but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion eſtabliſhed by Law; and when theſe thing are concerned, 'tis a Caſe of great conſequence: God forbid any perſon, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> or other, ſhould attempt the Life of the King, and the Subverſion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and by Stiling themſelves by the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſhould excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from any ſuch Crimes.</p>
               <p>For the Evidence that has been given, I ſhall not enumerate the Particulars againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, other then ſuch as have been omitted, (If I miſtake not,) by Mr. Sollicitor.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place there are the things that hapened at <hi>Oxon,</hi> for you have had it already ſufficiently told you by my Lords the Judges who are upon the Bench, and who (under Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> favour) are the Priſoners Judges in point of Law, as you are his Judges in point of Fact. They have (I ſay) already told you what the Law is in Relation to Treaſons; that in Caſe the Treaſon be in two Counties, if the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſpeak to the ſelf ſame Treaſon, though to different Facts, that will be two Witneſſes to prove High-Treaſon; and that there hath been ſuch a Caſe, the the Priſoner at the Bar, who he ſays is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (for his own Souls ſake I wiſh he were a good one) muſt take notice, that <hi>Gavan</hi> the great Prieſt who was Tryed at <hi>Newgate,</hi> and Convicted, by what Evidence? By one of them that is a Witneſs now againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, that is <hi>Dugdale,</hi> his Treaſon was committed part in <hi>London,</hi> part in the Country, of which part <hi>Dugdale</hi> gave Evidence; but being both to the ſelf ſame purpoſe, by the greater part of the Judges, who were in the Commiſſion, and preſent at the Tryal, they were reckoned a ſufficient Teſtimony to prove him Guilty of High Treaſon: And I hope we do not live to that Age, that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> whatſoever ſhould come to trip up the Heels of the <hi>Popiſh-Plot</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſaying, that any of them who ſuffered for it, did die contrary to Law, or without ſufficient proof: For if Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was not a perſon fit to be believed; or if the reſt of the Judges who Tryed <hi>Gavan</hi> were out in the Law, then that man died wrongfully; for he had as much right to have been Tryed according to the Law, as any other perſon whatſoever. Therefore Gentlemen, as to that matter, we muſt ſubmit it to my Lords the Judges, who are to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what the Law is in all particulars before you; but as to the Fact whereof You are Judges, that is the great matter we ſhall apply our ſelves to, and for that it ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>Here is <hi>Dugdale</hi> that does give you an Accompt what his Deſign was in coming to <hi>Oxford</hi>; how he came to be armed as an <hi>Index</hi> (Gentleman) of his mind. And pray give me leave to put you in mind of one thing. You have firſt a Libel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57458:51"/>
and read to you; a pretended Letter, wherein there are Quaeries that have been taken notice of, and which ſeem to back the Evidence given by Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi>: for there is a Vindication in thoſe Queries of the proceedings of that Parliament of 41. which he has confidence enough now at the Barr to juſtifie too. But Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men you were told by the Court, and you know it, That that Parliament was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of High Rebellion; And even in thoſe Quaeries he aſperſes not only the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but every man that has any Concern in it; for it takes notice not only of the King, but of all His Council. Never a Judge nor an Officer in the Nation but is traduced by it; and which is moſt material, it was the Foundation of that Libel which has been mentioned to you, and which <hi>Fitz Haris</hi> was ſo juſtly condemned and executed for, that moſt Traiterous and Infamous Libel in part of it has theſe Quaeries, and a great Paragraph of this Libel makes up part of that Libel of <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi> which our Witneſſes ſay Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> was pleaſed to affirm was as true as God is in Heaven. Another thing is this, This Gentleman whoſe proper buſineſs it had been to manage his Employment at <hi>London</hi> for a Joyner, is beſt ſeen in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, uſiing the proper Tools of his Trade. I think it had been much more proper for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I believe you will think ſo too, then to come with Piſtols and all thoſe Accoutrements about him, to be regulating of the Government; what have ſuch People to do to <hi>interfere</hi> with the buſineſs of the Government, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we have a wiſe Prince, and God be thanked he hath wiſe Counſellours about him, and He and they know well enough how to do their own buſineſs, and not to need the Advice of a Joyner, tho' he calls himſelf <hi>The Proteſtant Joyner.</hi> What had he to do to engage himſelf, before his Advice was required? How comes he to concern himſelf ſo much that after he had writ this Libel wherein he is pleaſed to take notice of Tyrants afterwards ſhould go to make a Print, I mean the <hi>Rare Shew</hi>; and when <hi>Dugdale</hi> comes to inquire of him what do you mean by ſuch a thing, <hi>the Tyrant ſhall go down</hi>? Says he, I mean by that <hi>the King.</hi> And what do you mean by having them go to <hi>Breda</hi>? Why there he explains it, that he puts all the Government, the Lords and the Biſhops upon the Kings Back, and being asked what he meant to have done with them, Why the Biſhops, and the King, and all were to go to <hi>Breda.</hi> Theſe are the things that himſelf did acknowledge he was the Author of, and theſe Prints he did cauſe to be made, and he is the perſon that gives you an Account, that it was but the conception and imagination of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that <hi>Rowley</hi> meant the <hi>King</hi>; but <hi>Dugdale</hi> being called again, he tells you after ſome time, that he was under ſome difficulty to know the meaning of it; and then <hi>Colledge</hi> tells him it was meant the <hi>King</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo he expounded it to him. And ſo <hi>Smith</hi> tells you of that ſame name of <hi>Old Rowley</hi> again. Gentlemen, Thus I tell you what hath been omitted. The <hi>Evidence</hi> hath been long, and therefore we muſt be pardoned, if we can't exactly repeat it. This is the <hi>Evidence</hi> that was done at <hi>Oxon,</hi> the next is Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who ſpeaks of what was done in <hi>London,</hi> and he is an Evidence both as to the word <hi>Rowley,</hi> as to the coming with Arms, and as to the declaring to what end he came, and what he had done, Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> he tells you both before and after the ſame, and that I muſt take notice of to you, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does particularly ſay, he uſed thoſe words, which I hope every honeſt man, and every good man, that deſires to preſerve the Government according to Law, will hear with the greateſt deteſtation and abhorrence; he talked of the taking away the Life of the late King of bleſſed memory at ſuch an impudent rate, that every true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Blood would curdle at the hearing of it. And this he ſaid not only to Mr. <hi>Maſters,</hi> but he juſtified it to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> too.</p>
               <p>In the next place you have <hi>Turbervile,</hi> who gives you all the reaſons, how he did not only tell of theſe things himſelf, but encouraged him to prepare himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and he gave him a Mark, a Ribbon with <hi>No Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no Slavery.</hi> Theſe were Marks whereby they were to be known, and they were to be one and all, as they call it, that, when ſuch a blow was ſtruck, they ſhould be ready to fall in. There is one thing more that I take notice of, that is, what was ſaid by a Gentleman Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57458:52"/>
Jennings,</hi> which is a Confirmation of all the other Evidence, that Gentleman who hath appeared to you to be a man of Honour even by the Confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> himſelf, and by his own words, for he ſaid like an honeſt man, and like a Loyal man too, that he would rather engage himſelf in three dangers for the Service of the King at Sea, than come in cold Blood to give Evidence againſt a man for his Life at the Bar. And yet this man who tells you this of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom <hi>Colledge</hi> himſelf calls a <hi>Worthy Perſon,</hi> hath given you this Accompt, that when he told him his Noſe bled, he anſwer'd him, it was the firſt Blood loſt in the Cauſe, but it would not be long e're there was more loſt; an excellent Cauſe for a man to venture his Blood in. When he was told of this, he began to put it off, and to uſe his own words, had a great mind to ſham off the buſineſs, but in Truth there was no Anſwer given to it. Gentlemen, the Objections that have been made againſt the Evidence that have not been taken notice of, I deſire to take notice of. I think againſt three of them there has been only Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> I confeſs has ſaid <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis</hi> ſtrange things againſt <hi>Dugdale, Smith</hi> and <hi>Turbervile.</hi> I have only the Affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and as ill men may become good men, ſo may good men become ill men; or otherwiſe I know not what would become of ſome part of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony. And in the next place, if theſe men have not ſworn true I am ſure Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> muſt ſtand alone in the greateſt point, in which all the Evidence agree, that is the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, I muſt take notice to you, that it is ſtrange to me, that ever you upon your Conſciences ſhould perjure three men who poſitively upon their Oaths deny any ſuch Diſcourſes as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſpeaks of againſt them, I do put that upon your Conſciences whether you upon the bare Affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in this place will convict three men upon whoſe Teſtimony the Lives of ſo many as have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, have been taken away, and as we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do believe juſtly. I ſay, whether you will do it upon the bare Affirmation of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> againſt their Oaths.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, Beſides the poſitive Evidence of theſe Gentlemen, there is a Circumſtance of improbability in the very words which he ſpeaks of, Will any man tell me, that after ſuch time as men have given their Oaths, as <hi>Smith</hi> had given his that he was concerned, and ſo had <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi> too, that theſe men ſhould come and voluntarily tell Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> they were all forſworn, are theſe men ſuch great <hi>Coxcombs</hi> as he would have us to believe? Is it ſo probable a thing, that any men of common knowledge would do it? Do you think a man of that knowledge and conſideration, as <hi>Smith</hi> is an allowed Scholar, and a man of known Learning, and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> who has been reckoned by all men to be a good Evidence; do you take theſe men to be ſuch abſolute Novices, that they muſt ſeek an occaſion to tell him they were Bribed off and were Forſworn? If you can think this, and if a bare Affirmation againſt theſe poſitive Oaths can prevail; Gentlemen upon your Conſciences be it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, 'tis a ſtrange ſort of thing to believe that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould come out of a <hi>Coffee</hi>-Houſe, where a Quarrel is pretended to have been between him and <hi>Colledge,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does upon his Oath ſay he never had any ſuch Quarrel with him, and that he ſhould fall a damning and ſinking againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that there ſhould be ſuch impudence in the world in any man as to deſire or wiſh ſuch a thing? Gentlemen, theſe are ſtrange ſorts of Apprehenſions, and men muſt have very ſtrange thoughts, that can ſtrain themſelves up to the belief of them.</p>
               <p>In the next place here it is ſaid by the Priſoner, Good Lord! What a condition we ſhall be in! Here is a Plot put upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I hope in God there is no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Plot, but I alſo hope the whole Intereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Priſoner at the Bar, and all will be deſtroyed, if Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> dies for his Treaſons. Gentlemen, the Queſtion is not whether there be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57458:52"/>
Plot, we declare we know of none, but whether the Priſoner at the Bar have ſpoken ſuch words, and done ſuch things as are Sworn againſt him. And I would fain know what all the Diſcourſes we have had about <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſignifie, when in all the courſe of our Evidence, there has been but one <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and never a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> But here have been great Diſcourſes about <hi>Macnamarra</hi> and <hi>Denis,</hi> and what it hath been for, but to make a noiſe, and raiſe a duſt, I can't tell, for in this Cauſe there has not been one <hi>Iriſh</hi> man beſides <hi>Haines,</hi> and never a <hi>Papist</hi> throughout the whole Evidence: So that it is eaſie, if men think it will take with the Auditory, for a perſon to cry out, <hi>Oh Lord! we are all like to be undone, here are</hi> Iriſh <hi>Witneſſes brought againſt us</hi>; and yet after all this ſtir, there is but one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſs, and never a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And as for him, Truely Gentlemen I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that even <hi>Colledge</hi> himſelf, till ſuch time as he was taken, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him an Honeſt man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Never in my Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr Serjeant <hi>Jefferies.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It was ſo ſaid. But I do ſay Gentlemen, ſuppoſe (which I do not admit) that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> man he ſpeaks of be out of the Caſe; not that the Country is an Objection againſt any mans Teſtimony, God forbid it ſhould be ſo affirmed; for Truth is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to places, nor to perſons neither, but applyed to all Honeſt men, be they <hi>Iriſh</hi> men or others; but I ſay, ſet Mr. <hi>Haynes</hi> out of the Caſe: Suppoſe there was no ſuch man as <hi>Haynes</hi> in this Caſe; yet I muſt tell you Gentlemen, you have as great a proof as poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I muſt take notice to you of ſome Account that hath been given of him by himſelf: It is wonderful ſtrange when there was that kindneſs of intimation given by the Court, that he ſhould do well to prove his Loyalty, as well as his Religion, that he did not produce ſome of his later Acquaintance. If this man that makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Proteſtant, would have it believed he is ſuch, I wiſh he would have brought ſome of thoſe men that knew him at <hi>London</hi> to give you ſome account of him, and not to ſtretch backward 16 years to prove his Birth and Education; that is not the beſt account ſure a man can give of himſelf, to ſay after he hath been talking at this diſloyal rate, that he is a good Proteſtant, becauſe he was thought ſo 18 years ago.</p>
               <p>Again in the next place, here is an account of the Libels given by the old Woman that is his Siſter: Truly ſhe would have it, and that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Libel at the Bar, as though the man in the Red Coat with <hi>R. C.</hi> upon it, had dropped this kind of Libel in his Houſe, and ſo he or ſome body elſe put a trick upon him; and becauſe ſhe would inveigle you to ſuch an interpretation, ſhe ſays that they ſtaid behind till the man in the Red Coat had fetched away the Shavings, and ſo here is a new Sham-Plot to be put upon the Priſoner, by dropping Papers in his Houſe; a pretty kind of inſinuation. But Gentlemen, againſt the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Woman, you have the very perſon that was there, the Officer, who ſwears that he and his Fellows came before the Watermen into the Houſe: But I ſuppoſe you obſerve how that notable talking Maid and ſhe does agree, for the Maid tells you there came a ſtrange Fellow ſeven weeks before, delivered theſe things into her hands, her Maſter was abroad, and ſhe was not to enquire whence they came, or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57458:53"/>
what they were, but paid him 6 <hi>d.</hi> for bringing thoſe things. Now 'tis very ſtrange that the Maid ſhould pay for the bringing of thoſe things, and yet after that ſhould imagine that ſome body elſe ſhould put them there.</p>
               <p>But now Gentlemen, in the next place, I muſt tell you another thing which I would beg you to take notice of: Here are two Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Balron</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and they have given you an account that they have been Evidence againſt the Papiſts, they did well in it, but it hath been their misfortune hitherto they have not been belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but whether they have been believed or not before, is no guidance to you at this time, but that which is to guide you is, whether or not they have given you now a Teſtimony that you in your Conſciences can believe. Now can you believe what they have ſaid, nay can you believe it without any Circumſtance to confirm it, againſt thoſe expreſs Objections that ariſe from themſelves, and againſt the Oath of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when the one tells you ſo exactly of the 25th. 26th. 27th. and 28th. of <hi>July,</hi> and the other tells you that <hi>Smith</hi> took Poſt, and yet overtook them not till the Sunday after, which was the 3d. of <hi>August</hi>; and when the Almanack is produced, it was ſo far from making out what they ſpake of to be the ſame time, that whereas one ſaid he came to <hi>London</hi> the 28th. the others Almanack ſays it was the 27th. then pray how do theſe perſons agree, when the one ſays that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> talked with him upon the Road the 28th. and the other ſays that they came to <hi>London</hi> the 27th. Theſe are Circumſtances, Gentlemen, that you muſt weigh, and you may bring the North and the South together as ſoon as their two Teſtimonies, they are ſo far aſunder. Beſides, Gentlemen, I hope you take notice of a perſon that was ſworn, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome quality, a Scholar in the Univerſity here, that ſays <hi>Balron</hi> (though he denied it) did ſhew him one of theſe Pictures, and did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover they were Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi>; and <hi>Balron</hi> himſelf, his own Witneſs, tells you that he did acknowledge one of thoſe Pictures was his. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears then how buſie he was, and concerned himſelf in what belonged not to his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole matter, after this long Evidence that hath been given, I muſt wholly appeal to your Lordſhip and the Jury; as to the Law, to your Lordſhip and the Court; and as to the Fact, to the Jury: for I do not deſire any ſort of Evidence ſhould be ſtrained againſt a Priſoner at the Bar, who is there to be tryed for his Life. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid if he be Innocent, but he ſhould be acquitted; but on the other ſide, conſider the Murder of that great King of ever bleſſed memory is before you, and remember that baſe reflection which the Witneſſes tell you of upon that horrid Action; and as a great Evidence, remember that ſeeming Vindication of it at the Bar, which certainly no <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, no Proteſtant according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having his Bloud ſtirred in him. And theſe things are not only teſtified by <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> but by Gentlemen of known reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality; and he hath a little diſcover'd himſelf by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he hath made againſt their Teſtimony. But know, Gentlemen, that the King is concerned, your Religion is concerned, that Plot that is ſo much agreed to by all <hi>Preteſtants</hi> is concerned; for if <hi>Dugdale,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57458:53"/>
Smith</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> be not to be believed, you trip up the heels of all the Evidence and diſcovery of that Plot. Then I will conclude to you, Gentlemen, and appeal to your Conſciences, for according to the Oath that has been given to you, you are bound in your Conſciences to go according to your Evidence, and are neither to be inveigled by us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our proof, nor to be guided by your Commiſeration to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar againſt the proof; for as God will call you to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count if you do an injury to him, ſo will the ſame God call you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count if you do it to your King, to your Religion, and to your own Souls.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall detain you but a little, and ſhall be as ſhort as I can, for your patience has been much exerciſed already: It is a burden, and a neceſſary one that lies upon us all, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceſſary than that ſuch Tryals as theſe ſhould be intire and publick, intire for the diſpatch of them, and publick for the ſatisfaction of the World, that it may appear no man receives his Condemnation without Evidence, and that no man is acquitted againſt Evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there are theſe two Conſiderations in all Caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the one is, the force of the Evidence; the other is, the truth of the Evidence. As to the force of the Evidence, that is a point in Law that belongs to the Court, and wherein the Court is to direct you; as to the truth of the Evidence, that is a queſtion in Fact ariſing from the Witneſſes, and muſt be left upon them, whereof you are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges.</p>
               <p>As to the force of the Evidence in this Caſe, it muſt be conſider'd what the Charge is; it is the compaſſing the death of the King, and conſpiring to ſeize the Perſon of the King, which is the ſame thing in effect; for even by the Common Law, or upon the interpretation of the Statute of the 25th. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. that mentions compaſſing the death of the King to be Treaſon, it hath always been reſolved, That whoſoever ſhall imagine to depoſe the King, or impriſon the King, are guilty of imagining the death of the King; for they are things that depend one upon another: and never was any King depoſed or impriſoned, but with an intention to be put to death, they are in conſequences the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, in Caſes of Treaſon the Law is ſo tender of the Life of the King, that the very Imagination of the heart is Treaſon, if there be any thought concerning any ſuch thing; but then it muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by ſome Overt-act, upon the Statute of the 25th. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. but upon the Statute of the 13th. of this King, made for the preſervation of the King's perſon, if it be manifeſted by malicious and adviſed ſpeaking, 'tis ſufficient. This is as to the Charge, and as to the Law concerning that Charge, I muſt tell you there muſt be two Witneſſes in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>Now then for the force of the Evidence, the queſtion will ariſe there, whether this Evidence, admitting it to be true, is ſufficient to maintain the Indictment; ſo that if there be two Witneſſes, you muſt find him Guilty. Now as to this, Gentlemen, the Priſoner has before-hand called upon the Court, and had their reſolution; and I hope you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what hath been ſaid, and I ſhall have occaſion to trouble you the leſs. There have been ſix Witneſſes produced for the King; there are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57458:54"/>
two of them, Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> and Mr. <hi>Masters,</hi> that are ſome way applicable to the Caſe, though they do not go to the Treaſon, they are only to inferr the probability of the Treaſon. This of Sir <hi>William Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> was upon the occaſion of the bleeding of the Priſoners Noſe, after his quarrel with <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>He had loſt the first bloud, and it would not be long e're there would be more loſt</hi>; which ſhews there were ſome extraordinary thoughts in his heart, concerning ſome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, quarrels, and fighting that he expected ſhould be. That which Mr. <hi>Masters</hi> has ſaid, (beſides what he offered concerning his Principles in juſtifying the Long Parliament) was this, that when he called him Colonel, <hi>Marry mock not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I may be a Colonel in time</hi>; that ſhews ſome extraordinary thoughts were in his heart.</p>

               <p>Will not that bear a more favourable interpretation, my Lord? Muſt that neceſſarily follow upon my ſaying, <hi>I might be a Colonel in time,</hi> and <hi>that more bloud would be loſt?</hi> if I had expreſſed it ſo.</p>

               <p>Well Gentlemen, theſe are Witneſſes I ſay that go not to the Treaſon, but only relate and reflect ſomewhat to ſhew there were thoughts in his heart, but no body could tell what they were, or know what he meant by them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Colledge.</speaker>
               <p>Then always they are to be taken in the beſt ſence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>For the other Witneſſes, <hi>Stephen Dugdale, John Smith, Bryan Haynes,</hi> and <hi>Edward Turbervile,</hi> they are all of them, taking what they ſay to be true, very full Witneſſes. The Priſoner hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as to two of them, becauſe they ſpeak to nothing that was done in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> but <hi>Turbervile</hi> and <hi>Dugdale</hi> they ſpeak to what was ſaid in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> Now for that I muſt tell you, If you believe any one of theſe Witneſſes, as to what was ſaid in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and any of them as to what was ſaid in <hi>London,</hi> relating to the ſame Fact of Treaſon, they will be two good Witneſſes to maintain the Indictment, though the one is in the one County, and the other in another; for if a Treaſon be committed in two Counties, it is in the Kings Election where he will Exhibit the Indictment, and the Evidence from both Counties is good Evidence; that I take for Law, and theſe four Witneſſes, with that conſideration that they are true, as I think are full Witneſſes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Indictment.</p>
               <p>Why then the next Head is concerning the truth of this Evidence, of which you are to be Judges, and you are the proper Judges whether the Witneſſes ſpeak true or no; therefore you muſt have your own Conſciences to direct you in that caſe, and what I ſhall ſay about them, ſhall be only for your Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall not take upon me to repeat the Evidence to you, it has been long; and for me to ſpeak out of Memory, I had rather you ſhould recur to your own Memories, and your own Notes: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſhall ſay ſomething in general to contract your Conſideration of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57458:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>And as I told you at firſt, you muſt mind nothing of what the Kings Counſel ſaid, for nothing muſt have Impreſſion upon you, but what they proved; So you are not to conſider any thing of the Facts the Priſoner ſpake of, that are not proved neither; For common Juſtice is concerned in it, and no Juſtice can be done at that rate, if the Priſoners own Affirmations or Purgation ſhould be taken. No man ever can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed but he will be ready to ſay he is innocent, and ſay as flour is hung and popular things as ever he can for himſelf. And therefore theſe things muſt not weigh with you further, then as what is ſaid, argues upon the Proofs you have had. And you are to conſider upon the Proofs what the Priſoner has produced, not what he ſays on the other ſide, for the Proofs you have heard a great many Witneſſes in general produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, that ſay he was bred a Proteſtant, and has been an honeſt Man, that they knew no ill by him, that will be of little weight in a caſe of this Conſideration, for unleſs he were a Man that had committed Treaſon to the knowledge of all the World, there is no Man but can produce Witneſſes that know no ill of him, nor any Treaſon nor Harm in him, therefore the Queſtion will lye upon the credit of the Witneſſes produced for the King barely, and that will be the Conſideration you are only to have, and you are to weigh them in the Ballance againſt the Witneſſes produced againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, for theſe Witneſſes I ſhall not repeat them to you, but only this I ſhall obſerve in general, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile</hi> that are the two moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Witneſſes relating to what was ſpoken in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> have the leaſt ſaid againſt them. I do not remember I profeſs to you I do not (but your own notes muſt guide you) that there was any very material thing ſaid againſt them, except what is ſaid againſt them by Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> does ſay againſt <hi>Smith</hi> that he came out of the Coffee-houſe, and ſwore damm him he would have <hi>Colledges</hi> Blood, and when he reproved him, and ſaid it was not fit for a Miniſter of the Goſpel to uſe ſuch Expreſſions, he ſaid God damn the Goſpel, if that be true 'tis a great Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Credit of <hi>Smith.</hi> He ſays as to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that when he was expoſtulating with him about his Evidence he excuſed himſelf, that he was in want of money, and was preſſed to it, and being asked did ſay he was preſſed to ſwear againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he ſaid yes, and much of the ſame kind he ſays as to <hi>Turbervile,</hi> that he ſaid he was diſſerted and would not ſtarve. Now all theſe three Witneſſes being called upon their Oaths deny, that which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Teſtifies. Now if it were in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and probable matter to have three Men condemned, and ſet aſide by the Teſtimony of one is not equal, unleſs the Man were of mighty extraordinary Credit, and his Teſtimony of more than ordinary weight. But then I muſt tell you this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very probable, that after Witneſſes had ſworn a thing they ſhould voluntarily acknowledg themſelves to be forſworn, and that without any Provocation, they ſhould at ſeveral times come to this one Man and declare themſelves Rogues and Villaines, but if it were probable, here are three Mens Oaths againſt one Mans affirmation, this I ſay as to what concerns <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervile,</hi> I do not ſee any thing material againſt them, beſides now if you believe them, they are two Witneſſes to the full Matter of the Indictment, and two Witneſſes to what was done in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> and that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies all the Conſiderations of Law.</p>
               <p>As to the reſt of the Witneſſes <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> and <hi>John Smith,</hi> you have had many Witneſſes produced againſt them, I ſhall not undertake to repeat the Evidence, 'tis your place and duty to weigh their Teſtimony, and I ſhall leave it to your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> it is too late to profeſs your innocence, you have been tryed and found Guilty; but becauſe you ſay it now, 'tis neceſſary for me to ſay ſomething in vindication of the Verdict, which I think the Court were all very well ſatisfied with: There were ſufficient proofs to warrant it, and the Jury did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Juſtice and right. I thought it was a Caſe, that as you made your own defence, ſmall proof would ſerve the turn to make any one believe you Guilty. For as you would defend your ſelf by pretending to be a Proteſtant. It is wonder, I muſt confeſs, when you called ſo many Witneſſes to your Religion and Reputation, that none of them gave an account that they ſaw you receive the Sacrament within theſe many years, or any of them particularly had ſeen you at Church in many years,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57458:55"/>
or what kind of Proteſtant you were. If we look to your Words and Actions, it is true, they did prove this, that you were mighty violent and zealous in crying out againſt Popery and the Papiſts; but if we look to your Actions, they favoured rather to promote the Papiſts ends. For I muſt tell you, the Papiſts are beſt extirpated, and ſuppreſſed by a ſteady Proſecution of the Laws againſt them, not by violent cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out, and putting the People into fervent heats and confuſions, for that is the thing the Papiſts aim at; they have no hopes any other way to creep into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but by Confuſion, and after the Church is deſtroyed, that is under God the beſt Bulwark againſt them. But you that cryed ſo loud againſt the Papiſts, it was proved here, who you called Papiſts. You had the boldneſs to ſay that the King was a Papiſt, the Biſhops were Papiſts, and the the Church of <hi>England</hi> were Papiſts. If theſe be the Papiſts you cry out againſt, what a kind of Proteſtant you are, I know not, I am ſure you can be no good one, But truly I thought you would have made better proof of that thing, when you called ſo many witneſſes to that purpoſe, and then if we look to your Politicks, what Opinion you had of the King, it was proved by your diſcourſe, and by witneſſes, that you could have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to their Teſtimony, that you did juſtify the late horrid Rebellion, and the Conſequents of that was the murder of the beſt King in the World, that you ſhould go to juſtify the proceedings of that Parliament, and affirm that they did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe to do. I ſay he that will juſtify ſuch a thing, if there were the ſame Circumſtances, would do the ſame thing again.</p>
               <p>Then if we look upon another part of your defence, as to your Arms, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected you went armed to <hi>Oxon,</hi> and that was made the Evidence of the Overt Act when you ſaid by words your intentions what you would do, that you would make one to ſeize the King, that you did go armed, you did confeſs I expected you ſhould have ſaid, you only wore thoſe things for your own defence upon the Road as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman travelling, or went with your Friends to accompany them out of Town, and defend them from Robbery, but you ſaid, you went to Guard the Parliament. I did not underſtand what you meant by it. I do not believe the Parliament ſent for any Guard, or intended to have any Guard. I do not believe that any of them in their Hearts thought they needed a Guard; for I believe there was not a man that had any thing that looked like that, or any thing of that nature. For we ſaw, that when the King by the neceſſity of his Affairs, when the two Houſes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much, was pleaſed to diſmiſs them; they all departed quietly, not a man was ſeen to be diſturbed; there was no appearance of any ſuch thing, and how it ſhould come into your head, that were but a private man to go to guard the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I much wonder. Suppoſe all men of your condition ſhould have gon to have guarded the Parliament, what an Aſſembly had there been? what a buſtle might they have made, and what confuſion might have been on a ſudden? And though you ſay you are no man of quality, nor likely to be able to do any thing upon the Kings guards or the Kings Perſon, yet if all of your quality had gon upon the ſame deſign that you did, what ill Conſequences might have been of it, we ſee what has been done by <hi>Maſſianello</hi> a mean Man in another Country, what by <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Jack Straw</hi> in this Kingdom, I confeſs I know not what you meant by it, but very ill things might have happened upon it.</p>
               <p>So that theſe things when I look upon them, and conſider the complexion of your defence, it makes an eaſie proof have credit. But I think there was a full Proof in your caſe, yet I ſay if there had been a great deal leſs proof, the Jury might with Juſtice have found you Guilty. And becauſe you now declare your ſelf innocent of all you are charged with, I think my ſelf bound to declare here in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Country, and in vindication of the Juſtice of the Court, that it was a Verdict well given, and to the ſatisfaction of the Court, and I did not find my brothers did diſlike it. This I ſay to you out of Charity, that you may incline your mind to a ſubmiſſion to the Juſtice that has overtaken you, and that you may enter into Charity with all men, and prepare your ſelf for another Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57458:56"/>There is nothing now remaining, but to pronounce the Sentence which the Law provides for ſuch an Offence, which is this, and the Court does award,
