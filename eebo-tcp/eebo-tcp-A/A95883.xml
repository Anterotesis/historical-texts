         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Twenty admirable examples of Gods diſpleaſure againſt
Subſcribers of the Engagement, and complices with
the late Power.</head>
               <p>1. THen conſider, admire and wonder, that upon
the very firſt day of the publication of the
Act for taking the Engagement, which was <hi>January</hi>
4, 1650. in the evening of that ſame day, did that
moſt terrible and fearfull fire by Gun-powder break
forth at <hi>Barkin</hi>-Church, neer the Tower of <hi>London,</hi>
the like to which was never ſeen or heard of before,
in or about the ſaid City, in which were moſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
blown up and deſtroyed above a hundred hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and above 120. perſons moſt lamentably kill'd and
deſtroyed, and their Carkaſes miſerably torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
among whom was Lievtenant Col. <hi>Smith,</hi> one
of Sir <hi>Hardreſs Wallers</hi> chief ſticklers, to pull the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
members out of the Houſe of Commons in
Parliament. And was not this a moſt fearfull fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119618:4"/>
and heavy Harbinger of the wofull effects of
this their immediately following Engagements.</p>
               <p>2. One Mr. <hi>Mosty</hi> Miniſter of in <hi>Eſſex</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the engagement (and that in his own
ſenſe and limitations, to his beſt content, as he
thought) yet was immediately after ſo perplexed
and diſtracted in his Conſcience, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preach nor Pray, nor be at any quiet or peace
within himſelf, till he had procured liberty to race
out his name from under the Engagement: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he had ſubſcribed it.</p>
               <p>3. One Col. <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> a great favourite and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
in the Army, after his taking of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was ſo vexed and diſtracted in his ſoule, that he
confeſſed to ſome of his religious friends (himſelf
alſo being lookt upon as a very religious Gentleman)
that immediately upon his taking the Engagement,
he found by evident ſymptomes, that the Devil took
actuall poſſeſſion of him, and made him deſperately
prone to commit any notorious villany whatſoever,
even to the raviſhing of his own maid-ſervant; but
afterward gave moſt eminent teſtimonies of his true
repentance, and abhorrence of his taking of it.</p>
               <p>4. One Mr. <hi>Edward Fiſher,</hi> a very tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
Chriſtian, and godly Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> in
the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> having taken the Engagement, and
though in his own ſenſe and limitations (as he
thought to his full content) yet preſently after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extreamly grieved and perplexed in ſpirit, for
that he had done, therein laboured to Alderman <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
to have his name raced out, but could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
to the increaſe of his great grief; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
fell into great diſtreſſes and trouble of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and into pyning and languiſhing ſickneſſe,
caught a great fall in his houſe, which put his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119618:4"/>
out, of what, and lying in continuall diſtreſſe
and perplexity of ſpirit, complaining ſtill of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Engagement: thus pining and languiſhing
away, he ſhortly after died.</p>
               <p>5. One Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> of St. <hi>Needs</hi> in <hi>Huntington</hi>-ſhire,
having been a moſt eminent profeſſor of Religion,
and extraordinarily gifted in Prayer, and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
afterwards complying with the times, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Engagement, and turning a great ſtickler
with the Army; at laſt, turned a very So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

of Religion; and one night going forth of his houſe
in an out-room hang'd himſelf, and there was found
the next morning.</p>
               <p>6. One Mr. <hi>Midgeley</hi> a School-maſter in <hi>Ouldham</hi>
neer <hi>Mancheſter</hi> in <hi>Lancaſter</hi>-ſhire, having been an
Engager, and great proſecutor of his eminently god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Constantine,</hi> and having been writing
(one night) divers accuſations, and ſuch like papers
againſt his ſaid Miniſter, whereunto he was hired by
one Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> a Juſtice of Peace of the ſame Pariſh,
and by diverſe other eminent enemies of the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> becauſe he would not take the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement;
and they having paid the ſaid Mr. <hi>Midge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>

there having been a great ſnow on the ground, and
the weather very bitter cold, he was the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
found dead in the ſnow, and onely his finger

had preached twice or thrice in the Country,
he ſummoned him again to appear before him, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to have puniſhed him ſorely for his preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But in the mean ſeaſon, it pleaſed the Lord to
ſtrike this Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> (who before had been a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
naturally very healthfull, and of a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of body) into ſuch a languiſhing ſickneſſe,
as made him daily pine away; ſo as no means or
phyſick could help him, and (which is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and fearfull) before his death, he became ſo
full of Lice, continually, that all the ſhift and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that poſſible was uſed, could not cleanſe him
from this filthy Vermine; and thus either upon the
day before or the day after Mr. <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s coming

therein, that he would needs (as he did) pull them
down himſelf, and ſent the boards, on which the
Kings Arms were painted, home to his houſe, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to have made a doore of them, to one of his
rooms of his houſe; but it pleaſed the Lord preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

whereof he preſently dyed, and thoſe boards were
