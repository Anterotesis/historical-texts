            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Three <hi>CONSIDERATIONS</hi> propoſed to Mr. <hi>William Pen,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Validity and Security of his New <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for Liberty of Conſcience, by <hi>A. Baptiſt;</hi> which may be worthy the Conſideration of all the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and of all my <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> alſo that have <hi>Votes</hi> in the Choice of Parliament-Men.</head>
            <p>I Deſire you M. <hi>Pen,</hi> and all my <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> to <hi>Conſider,</hi> and then <hi>Anſwer</hi> this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, What validity or ſecurity can any pretended or deſigned future <hi>New Law</hi> or <hi>Charter</hi> have, when we ſee ſo many of the <hi>preſent Laws</hi> we already have may be, and are by the <hi>Diſpenſing Power Diſpenſed with?</hi> Have we, or can we have any <hi>Higher Power</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>King, Lords and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled?</hi> The Laws that are now <hi>Diſpenſed</hi> with and rendred uſeleſs, were they not made by <hi>that</hi> Power? Pray tell me, can your New Charter [if you had it] be made by any <hi>Higher</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Power? And M. <hi>Pen,</hi> let your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and us know your mind honeſtly. Do you think there is any <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual-</hi>Power here in <hi>England</hi> above the <hi>Diſpencing</hi> Power? And can you make it appear to us?</p>
            <p>Shall your <hi>New Charter</hi> have a <hi>Penalty</hi> inſerted to be inflicted on the infringers or breakers of it or no? if not, what will your <hi>New Charter</hi> ſignifie? Not three skips of a <hi>Louſe;</hi> and if it have a <hi>Penalty,</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Authority Royal, Diſpence</hi> with the <hi>Penalty?</hi> And what will it ſignifie then?</p>
            <p>That you need not doubt at all, but may be certain of this; you ſhall hear what <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have already told us, and judg'd is the Law in this matter; nay, and ſuch a Right ſo inherent and ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Crown, That a King cannot diveſt himſelf of it if he would, nor is bound by his Word or any Declaration he makes, no not in or by Parliament.</p>
            <p>Take it in M. <hi>R. Langhorns</hi> own words in his Book, touching the Kings Right in Diſpenſing with Penal Laws, p. 3, 4. <hi>That this Truſt, and this Power of Diſpencing with Penal Laws, are inſeparably united unto the Royal Perſon of the King, that he cannot transfer, give away or ſeparate the ſame from himſelf; conſequently it is inherent in his Royal Perſon, that is, in his Crown.</hi> Coke lib. 7. fol. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King cannot by his Grant, nor yet by Act of Parliament, Bar <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>lf of any that is inherent in and inſeparably annexed into his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46615:2"/>
for that in ſo doing he ſhould ceaſe to be King, and conſequently change and ſubvert the Government, which our Law allows not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That (therefore) when ever the King to gratifie a Parliament, doth Conſent in Parliament to any Law, by which he ſeems to ſtrip himſelf of, or depart from, any Prerogative, or Right, which in truth is inſeparable from him as King; or when the King in Parliament or otherwiſe by any Declaratory Words or Speeches, ſeems to relinquiſh ſuch Right: ſuch Conſent to ſuch Law is no more than an Agreement on his part not to uſe that Right ordinarily; but only in Extraordinary Occaſions, when in his Princely Wiſdom he ſhall find it neceſſary, and for publick good. But this Bars him not to uſe this Right again, when he ſees juſt cauſe ſo to do, Nor can any Declaratory Words ſpoken by the King, or his aſſent incerted into an Act of Parliament, Eſtop the King in any Cauſe of this nature.</hi> So far he.</p>
            <p>Now where's the aſſurance then of <hi>Will. Pen</hi>'s New <hi>Charter</hi> for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? Who can tell what <hi>King</hi> we may have after our preſent <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> whether ſo merciful or ſo juſt? Or what Sheriffs the next King may chuſe, and what Returns of Parliament-Men they may make; for you know the forfeiture on the Sheriffs making a falſe Return is no great matter, and cannot a King pardon it by his <hi>Diſpenſing</hi> Power or Authority Royal? What will, nay what can your New <hi>Charter</hi> then ſignifie, when it either is or may be (according to your own Doctrine) either invalidated, diſanulled, or anihilated in an inſtant?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Pray M. <hi>Pen,</hi> Conſider what your <hi>New Charter</hi> can ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſo long as there is a <hi>High Commiſſion Court,</hi> or a <hi>High Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs</hi> ſet up? Cannot thoſe <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> take any of your and our Preachers, Teachers, or Miniſters to task when they pleaſe? Cannot they when they have a mind to it, Suſpend Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> or <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> M. <hi>Alſop, Mr. Lobb,</hi> or <hi>Mr. Mead,</hi> or <hi>Mr. Bowyer,</hi> as well as the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> D. <hi>Sharp,</hi> or D. <hi>Doughty?</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your New <hi>Charter?</hi> Cannot the <hi>Court</hi> when they will, or ſhall think fit, or be commanded, Suſpend, Silence, or forbid any or all the Diſſenting Miniſters to Preach any longer in their Meetings, if they will not read any Declaration or Order whatever, that the <hi>King</hi> ſhall ſet forth and require them to Read? Remember the <hi>Magdalen Colledge-</hi>Men, Remember alſo that Sawce for a <hi>Gooſe</hi> is or may be Sawce for a <hi>Gander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conſideration is further grounded on the Words in their late Order ſet forth in the <hi>Gazette, For Contempt of his Majeſties Authority Royal;</hi> Now let us ſee before we leap, whether that will run no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than juſt <hi>M. Pen</hi> will have it. Can he ſtop the Current of it when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46615:2"/>
he pleaſes? If he could we are not ſure he would, for formerly he had no great kindneſs (we know) for us <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and other <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and if he could and would, we are not ſure of his life how long. Therefore it will be the greateſt piece of weakneſs and folly in the world for us to dance after his and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> pipe alone, contrary both to all common ſenſe and reaſon, and our own general intereſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And above all Conſider what Security or Validity this <hi>New Charter</hi> can be of, <hi>when there is a ſtanding Army kept on foot?</hi> Do <hi>Guns</hi> hear <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or regard <hi>Laws?</hi> Will <hi>Dragoons</hi> mind <hi>Charters,</hi> or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do you think? Pray M. <hi>Pen</hi> tell us whether they have done or do now ſo in <hi>France?</hi> We need not go far off for an Inſtance, it is ſo near us as fifty or ſixty miles, which one would think is nigh enough to open our Eye-ſight, if we are not ſtrangely infatuated and given up by the Almighty to ruin and deſtruction, which <hi>the good Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. <hi>Pen,</hi> How have the <hi>Dragoons</hi> minded our <hi>Properties</hi> (in theſe early days) in divers places here in <hi>England</hi> already? What think you of their Carriage and Quartering, will it agree with your <hi>New Charter</hi> for <hi>Liberty?</hi> The Inkeepers and Victuallers beſide many other can give you an account, now if you were truly <hi>A Friend for Liberty for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake,</hi> as you publiſh and pretend to the world, you would mind and inform <hi>us,</hi> and your <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> and the like things, and not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly paſs them over, and both delude and deceive us and them.</p>
            <p>Many perticulars more might be inlarged here, but a word to the wiſe is enough.</p>
            <p>I deſire M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Pen</hi> only to weigh ſeriouſly, and give an honeſt, clear and ſatisfactory Anſwer to theſe three points; in the mean time it appears to be highly the duty of all Men, as well <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as others who have Votes in chuſing <hi>Parliament Men;</hi> above all to chuſe ſuch faithful <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots</hi> as will take care of theſe things already hin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, and others that may be brought before them; that our <hi>Liberties,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> and our <hi>Lives</hi> may be preſerved from ill deſigning men, add from future <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wariauto's;</hi> and all the high Violaters and Infringers thereof called to an account, and juſtly puniſhed. This will well become them and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us, more than any <hi>titular Charter</hi> whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty</hi> is indeed a fine word, but remember (Brethren) what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us, That ſome there were that <hi>while they promiſe them Liberty, they themſelves are the Servants of Corruption,</hi> and obſerve what follows, <hi>for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in Bondage:</hi> how do you, how will you like that Word?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46615:3"/>
The Name of <hi>Liberty</hi> ſignifies nothing without the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Continuance, Certainty</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Let us endeavor to <hi>ſecure</hi> our <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Liberties, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties we have and ought to have, rather than to get the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>New</hi> ones, which may fatally bring us into greater <hi>Bondage</hi> in the end.</p>
            <p>Did you never hear of a certain Act or Bill for the Repealing of a <hi>Penal Law,</hi> that was loſt (when the late King was to have Sign'd it) betwixt the Houſe of Commons, and Houſe of Lords, by a ſtrange Trick of an honeſt Clerk of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do not part with a Gooſe, for the ſticking down a Feather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Children know, and can tell us, <hi>A Bird in the Hand, is worth two in the Buſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally Brethren, <hi>Let us be of one mind</hi> in our <hi>great Concerns,</hi> though we may <hi>differ</hi> in ſome <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and ſmall trivial things.</p>
            <p>Let us not in revenge (though it be ſweet) <hi>put out both our own Eyes, to put out one of our Brothers.</hi> Let us not be ſo ſilly, <hi>to deſtroy our ſelves, to hurt others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let all Proteſtants <hi>Unite</hi> in mutual <hi>Condeſcenſion, Affection,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> it is high time: Remember our Saviour hath told us, <hi>a Houſe divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi> Nothing will <hi>Save</hi> us but <hi>Union. Let Brotherly Love and Charity continue.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>Farwell and be wiſe whilſt you may, leſt you <hi>repent</hi> where 'tis too <hi>late.</hi> and your <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> will do you no <hi>good.</hi>
