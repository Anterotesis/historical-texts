         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

long and dewe examination of our owne Conſciencis, in maters of trewe and fals Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are now throughly reſolued in the trueth, by the worde and ſpirit of God. And
therefore we beleue with our heartis, confeſſe with our mouthes, Subſcryue with our

true Chriſtian Faith and Religion, pleaſing God, and bringing Saluation to man,
quhilk is now by the mercy of God reueled to the world, by the preaching of the bleſſed
Euangell. And is receaued, beleued, and defended by many and ſindrie notable Kirkis
and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirk of Scotland, The Kings Maieſtie &amp; thre Eſtates
of this Realme, As Gods eternall trueth, and onely grounde of our Saluation, as more

and now of a long time hath bene opinly profeſſed by the Kings Maieſtie, and whole body of this Realme, both
in burgh and land. To the quhilk confeſſion and forme of Religion, we willingly agree in our conſciencis in al poynts,
as vnto Gods vndoubted trueth and veritie, grounded onely vpon his written worde. And therefore we abhorre
and deteſt all contrarie religion and doctrine, but chiefly all kinde of Papiſtrie in generall and particuler headis, euen
as they are nowe damned and confuted by the worde of God and kirk of Scotlande, but inſpeciall we deteſt and

rebellion to Gods lawe. Our iuſtification by Fayth onely. Our imperfect ſanctification and obedience to the lawe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the nature, number and vſe of the holie Sacraments. His fyue baſtard Sacraments, with all his rytis, ceremoneis, and

Infants departing without the Sacrament, his abſolute neceſſitie of Baptiſme, his blaſphemous opinion of tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
or reall preſence of Chriſtis body in the elements, and receauing of the ſame by the wicked, or bodeis of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
His diſpenſations with ſolemnet othes, Periureis, and degrees of mariage forbidden in the worde, his crueltie againſt
the Innocent deuorced, His diuiliſhe Meſſe, his blaſphemous Prieſtheid, his prophane ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the
dead and the quick. His Canonization of men, calling vpon Angels, or Sainctis departed, worſhipping of Imagrie,
relicks, and croces, dedicating of Kirks, Altars, Dayis, Vowes to creatures. His Purgatorie, prayers for the deid,
praying or ſpeaking in a ſtrange language, with his proceſſiones and blaſphemous letanie, and multitude of Aduocats
or Mediatouris. His manifold ordouris, Auriculare confeſſion, his deſpered and vncertaine repentance, his generall

ioyned therewith, his warldly Monarchie, and wicked hierarchie, his thre ſolemned vowes, with all his ſhawellingis of
ſindrie ſorts. His erroneous and bloodie decreis maid at Trent, with al the ſubſcryuers and approuers of that cruell
and bloody band, coniured againſt the Kirk of God. And finally we deteſt all his vaine allegoreis, Ritis, ſignes, and
traditiones broght in the kirk without, or againſt the word of God and doctrine of this trewe reformed Kirk. To the
quhilk we ioyne our ſelues willingly, in doctrine, Faith, Religion, Diſcipline and vſe of the holie Sacraments, as lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
