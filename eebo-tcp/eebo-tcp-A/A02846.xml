            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But with hope of better acceptation, I offer my counsell here following vnto thee, that see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>If thy greefe and wearines be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by any troubles of this life, if it grow from any secular &amp; worldly cause, I haue reduced all such burdens vnto fower heades. Because either it is some want in our worldly estate, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is the burden and trouble of the multitude: or, if wee bee that way well stored, it is some trouble domesticall and neare vnto vs, either in our selues or in our house habitation or kinred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if we haue peace in our habitation, ioy in our kinred, friends and seruants, with life and health as we desire, then there is some more remoued person, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued accident, that is the cause of greese care and feare vnto vs: or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

aswell as at home, and among strangers aswell as among friends and neighbours, we liue without disturbance, yet we often finde difficulties in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our callings, or we meete with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and are wronged with mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, &amp; are euill rewarded for our well deseruing. Within the compasse of one of these foure heads fall all such secular and worldly burdens, and in the first place, I haue giuen aduice concerning these: perhaps not altogether such as some wise men, well seene and traded in worldly causes would giue, but surely such as an honest man should giue, and such as he must obserue, that looketh to obtaine ease and helpe from God.</p>
            <p>If thy trouble and greefe be of another kinde, if thy burden be spirituall, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:4128:7"/>
hast sinned against him as thou shouldest not, and fearest punishment for that sin: these troubles I haue reduced to two heades, for either the lustes of our flesh fighting against our soules, doe crosse vs in the waies of trueth and righteousnes, so that we cannot doe the good we would, and the euill we woud not, that we doe: and our desires being as the desires of the children of light, our deedes become as the deedes of the sonnes of darknes. Or else, hauing in time of our securitie, giuen way vnto our owne lusts, vnto the worlds allurements, and to Satans temptations, our sinnes are called to remembrance, are set in order against vs, with full mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the wickednes of them, &amp; of all that wrath that they haue kindled ni heauen, and of all that punishment that they haue deserued in hell, to the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible terror of our conscience. Vnder these two heades of the lustes of the flesh, and accusing thoughts, of the dominion
<pb facs="tcp:4128:8"/>
of sinne, and the reward of sinne, fall all those spirituall burdens, that are heauie to the honest minde and to the humbled spirit. And of these I haue giuen aduice in the second place, that if it happen to be last learned, yet it may be longest remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
            <p>And because the burden of accusing thoughts is euen as the gates of hell: for it is true that Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter multiples humanae animae tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationes, among the manifold tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the soule</hi> of man, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numberable troubles of afflictions, <hi>Nulla est maior quam conscienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:4128:8"/>
               <hi>the closet of his heart,</hi> there calleth vpon God where no man seeth: yea also he shutteth the dore of his heart against these assailing troubles, &amp; keepeth peace within. <hi>But malae conscientiae tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationem perferens, in arcano cordis, deum non inuenit: He that indureth this tribulation of an euill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> of a wounded conscience still accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>findeth not God in the secret of his heart,</hi> hath not that free, as a retiring place, where quietly he may conser with God: but the plague beginneth within his heart, and the fire is kindled in the mouth of the spring, where the liuing waters of comfort should flow.</p>
            <p>Therefore in that argument I haue laboured to be more full, and not onely in a direct path haue led the afflicted sinner to see his sinne to bee pardonable, and himselfe to be allowed, yea comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to craue forgiuenes of it, and God also bound by promise to grant it: which

But because the old serpent is subtile, and the poore sinner is weake, and that cunning craftsmaster of all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and snares, doeth sophistically frame many dangerous arguments, and putteth them into the minde and mouth of the affrighted and distempered sinner, making him ouer wittie to disclaime his part in God, and his inheritance in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and ouer confident in his feare, and ouer resolute in his doubting, so to driue him (if it might bee, and which the diuel doeth most desire) into finall despaire; therefore haue I at large answered those arguments out of the word of God, and with the sword of the spirit I haue eat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder the cords of those snaring obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the enemie had bound more

               <p>And because in some of these burdens we haue immediatly and at the next hand to doe with worldly matters, and with men, in things belonging to this life: in others we haue immediatly and at the next hand to doe with spirituall matters, and God himselfe, in things belonging to our soules, and the life to<note place="margin">Burdens secular &amp; spirituall.</note> come, therefore I will diuide them into <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>spirituall</hi> burdens.</p>
               <p>The <hi>secular burdens</hi> shall againe be<note place="margin">First secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares.</note> reduced to fower rankes, whereof the first shall be the burden of <hi>worldly cares,</hi> when a mans charge is great and his maintenance small, and he taketh care how to pay his debt, how to get meat and clothes, and other necessaries for him and his; which burden is made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy vpon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometime by the immediate hand of God, sending times of dearth,

and losses by fire and water, and other waies: sometime by other men, as by oppressors, deceiuers, theeues, bad deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, false seruants, and riotous chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: sometime it is increased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by our owne fault, through idlenesse, through plaie, through foolish bargains, through daintinesse of fare, costly apparell, and other courses of riot. And this burden may be called the burden of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>The second ranke shall be of <hi>domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>

                  <hi>troubles,</hi> either in thy selfe, thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thy kindred, or thy habitation. For where there is wealth at will, and that way no cause of care, yet <hi>Iob</hi> may lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish being full of diseases, <hi>Dauid</hi> may haue a scornfull <hi>Michol</hi> to his wife, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigail</hi> may haue a churlish <hi>Nabal</hi> to her husband, <hi>Rahel</hi> may mourn for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren because they are not, the sonne may be riotous and disobedient, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be dishonest, and between <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aon, Absolon,</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> the father of the family may haue griefe enough: ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants may be vnfaithfull, and perhaps maintaine factions, thy kindred may be vnkind, or fall into some calamity, and

thy next neighbour may bee thy neare and great enemy, or thy house may bee visited with sickenesse, so that thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shall breed euen in the nest of thy rest, in thine house, at thy table, in thy bed, and in thy bones, and there, and from thence shall thy vexation grow, where, and from whence thou didst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise thy selfe comfort.</p>

                  <hi>troubles more remote,</hi> growing from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and occasions further of.

yet become heauy burdens vnto vs. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these foure heads I suppose all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and worldly burdens may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>There are other burthens, wherein we haue to doe immediatly with God, in things that belong to piety, to peace of conscience, &amp; to the life to come. Those may be reduced to two heads. The first<note place="margin">1.

This is no smal burden to the man that wold please God, and doe his dutie, that hee becomes his owne troubler against his owne will, and crosseth himselfe by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in that wherein he taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by sanctification. This made <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:4128:23"/>
the Apostle to crie out in these words, <hi>O wretched man that I am who shall deliuer</hi>

                  <hi>me from this body of death?</hi> It was death to him that such corruption was so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent in his fraile body. And in another place he calleth the same law of sinne, <hi>a pricke in the flesh, the messenger of satan to</hi>

Another time laden with this burden as he was before, he complained<note place="margin">Psal 40. 12</note> of his load as he had done before, saying <hi>Innumerable troubles haue compassed me: my sinnes haue taken such hold vpon me, that I am not able to looke vp: yea they are</hi>

               <p>See it in him that had the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of all the sonnes of men: when the glorious sonne of God, our blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ, for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to take vp, and beare the burden of our sinnes, it did put him to vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paine, and was vpon his mighty shoulders a mighty burden.

               <p>These rules being obserued, then he promiseth in all things ease of our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. First he promiseth sufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, saying; <hi>Thou shalt be fed assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly.</hi>

the businesse, he laid all vpon God, and left it to the disposition of his good pleasure, saying, <hi>God will prouide;</hi> so must we doe: and this is to <hi>cast our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon the Lord.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Iacob,</hi> to shunne the fury of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> from whom hee had won his father <hi>Isaacs</hi> blessing, and also to the end that hee might marrie in his kinred, and not with a daughter of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as <hi>Esau</hi> had done, was sent by his father <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi> in poore estate, with his staffe in his hand toward his vnckle <hi>Laban,</hi> by the<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20</note> way he <hi>vowed a vow, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if God will be with me &amp; wil keep mein this iourny which I go, and wil giue me bread to eat, &amp; cloths to put on, so that I come againe vnto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house in safetie, then the Lord shall be my God, &amp;c.</hi> And vpon this vow and praier ma le, <hi>Iacob</hi> went forward.

Such burdens wee are not here warranted to cast vpon God.</p>
               <p>These burdens are of two kinds, by<note place="margin">First is a formality without pitty.</note> two kinds of men prepared. The first kind of these burdens is the <hi>ceremonious worship of God,</hi> not accompanied with true reuerence in our hearts, nor with the conformable practise of godlinesse in our liues.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4128:31"/>
were formall in the outward seruice of God: therein they did well; but because they wanted the reuerend feare of God, and their hands were defiled with the bloud of their oppressions and cruelties, therefore their dutifull formality was abhorred of him that loueth truth in the inward affections: though the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of that formality had been appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himselfe.</p>
               <p>This burden is the pleasure of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and by them prepared to weary the Lord withall, by such as feare men more then they feare God: and loue the praise of men more then the praise of God: and draw neare vnto God with their mouthes, and honour him with their lips, but they remoue their hearts far from him, and are like vnto painted Sepulchers, shining without, and stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, so they appeare vnto men to be holy, but within they are full of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and in secret commit all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               </p>
               <p>The second kind of these burdens is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4128:32"/>
                  <hi>an open wicked life,</hi> when men cast off both the feare of God, and also mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, so that they neither make conscience of their doings in regard of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their make dainty of doing open euil for feare of the opinion of men. Of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Lord complaineth by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos,</hi> saying: <hi>Behold I am pressed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 2. 13</note> 
                  <hi>vnder you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues.</hi> If a Cart be ouerladen, it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heauy vpon the Axeltree, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a whining and groning noise, and sometime breaketh, laying both Cart and loade in the dust. So presse they God with the loade of their sinnes, vntill hee grone vnder them, and complaine by his Prophets, and at last ouerthroweth them, casting both them and their sins by his iust iudgement into hell.</p>
               <p>This burden is prepared by bold and contemning sinners: by men that rise early to follow drunkennesse, and are strong to drinke strong drinke: by men that commit adultery, and assemble themselues by companies in harlots houses, and rise in the morning like fed horses, euery man neighing after his neighbours wife: by men that lay wait
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4128:32"/>
as he that setteth snares, and maketh pits to catch men, and fill their houses with the fruit of deceit as cages are filled with birds: by men that haue two kinds of waights and measures, and vse to sweare falsly: by men that say desperatly, we will doe whatsoeuer thing goeth out of our owne mouth, and our strength shall bee the law of vnrighteousnesse: by mockers that say where is the hope of his comming? and as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 5. 19.</note> testifieth of them, <hi>draw iniquitie with cords of vanity, and sinne as with Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes.</hi> Of which audacious men that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare God nor man: and are neither religious to regard conscience, nor ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, to regard good name, the world is full.</p>
               <p>These are the two kinds of burdens, the <hi>ceremonious worship of God, without truth and piety,</hi> prepared and throwen vpon God by dissembling hypocrits: and the <hi>bold transgression of all law and order,</hi> prepared and cast vpon God by wicked contemners: these are those particular burdens, which by way of caueat I thought fit to warne you of, that you meddle not with casting these
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4128:33"/>
vpon God, least he cast both you and your burdens into eternall destruction in hell.</p>
               <p>But our heauy burdens that presse our soules, and breed feare, care, and griefe vnto our mindes, whereof we desire to be eased, those wee may and must cast vpon God, and are, not onely allowed, but allured also to turne them off vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>

                  <hi>cares,</hi> when a mans charge is great, and his maintenance small: the common burden of the poore; though somtimes also wringing the backe of the rich. This burden groweth heauy, sometimes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4128:33"/>
by the worke of Gods hands, sending more charge, lesse gaines, deare times, and vnexpected losses: sometimes by the malice of other men, some oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by power, some deceiuing by fraud, and some wasting by riot whom thou didst trust: and sometime by thine owne fault, as by sloth, by sumptuous courses in apparrell, diet, building, and by foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish bargaines. This burden makes men grone out these words, what shall wee eate? what shall we drinke? wherewith shall we be clothed? how shall I pay my debts, maintaine my credit, and answer the charges of my place?</p>
               <p>To cast this burden vpon God is to<note place="margin">What it is to cast this vpon God.</note> proceed by these rules: First to consider the bounty of God that giueth to all both life and breath and all things. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, vpon consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to fall to praier, that he will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to extend that bounty vnto thee. Thirdly, to apply thy selfe diligently and faithfully in some honest calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God may blesse thy hand to fill thy mouth, fleeing all vnlawfull shifts. Fourthly and lastly to take heede of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. This excesse is double, first the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4128:34"/>
of desire, which we calcouetousnes when a man is not content with that that is sufficient: secondly, the excesse of spending which we cal riot, when a man hath a humour to waste intemperatly.</p>
               <p>The first rule is to acquaint our selues<note place="margin">First to learne Gods bounty.</note> with the bounty of God that we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This shal bring ease to his soule, for this is to cast his burden vpon God, while for Gods sake he is willing to beare his good pleasure.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And if it seeme to any man a hard thing to bee patient in trouble, let him not feare to attempt, euen by this course of patience, to cast his burden vpon the Lord. For there are many reasons, that perswade thereunto. First, the burden, while it continueth, is a sure testimonie of Gods loue vnto thee. <hi>Paul</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Hebrews saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 5</note> 
                  <hi>despise not the chastening of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loueth he chasteneth, &amp; hee scourgeth euerie sonne whom hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</hi> The chastisement of the Lord by these troubls, is an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue: and therfore we ought with the patience of children to beare it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while God out of his loue continueth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4128:43"/>
the burden of this trouble vpon thee, he doeth it only for thy good. As the same Apostle teacheth vs in the same Epistle,<note place="margin">Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. 10</note> saying, <hi>Hee chasteneth vs for our profit, that wee may be partakers of his holiness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The effect of those troubles intended of God, is our benefit, that wee may bee brought to haue neerer fellowship with God in holinesse; and therefore they are to bee borne with patience. Thirdly, though God seem to continue our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den long, and in the meane time to shew small kindnesse vnto vs, yet sure the end of them will be with a blessing. As <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> saith of the worke of God, leading the children of <hi>Israel</hi> for many yeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether through a wearie wildernes, that he did it <hi>to prooue them, that he might doe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 16</note> 
                  <hi>them good in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter end.</hi> And if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion of our trouble, like the wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Iacob,</hi> shall be with a blessing, it is to be born with all patience. A fourth reason there is to be regarded aboue all other reasons, &amp; of force to make a man patient euen in the fire, namely, that if wee suffer with <hi>Christ,</hi> wee shall raigne with <hi>Christ,</hi> and when we haue indured patiently a while on earth, we shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4128:44"/>
honourably for euer in heauen. Hereof the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> thus speaketh; <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>causeth vnto vs a furre most excellent, and an eternall weight of glorie.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall bee rewarded with most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glory: light affliction with a weight of glory: and momentanie affliction with eternall glorie: therefore to bee borne with all patience. He that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth these things, that if God do send trouble, it is of his fatherly loue vnto vs as vnto sonnes: that in these troubles he onely intendeth our good, to bring vs to haue fellowship with him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that our troubles shal bring peace and a blessing in the end: and lastly, that GOD will bring vs from a Crosse to a Kingdome, and turne our Crowne of thornes into a crowne of glory: He that considereth these things will bend his heart to beare his burthen patiently. Whereby hee certainly turneth his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon God for his great ease, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a heauy burden to be light, (which while it is patiently borne) melteth and falleth off from the heart, like raine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the high grounds: so that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4128:44"/>
a while he despiseth the troubles, that at the first were fearefull vnto him; and they seeme vnto him moale hils, that at the first shewed (a farre off) like moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. This is the first common rule of casting our burden vpon God, alwayes to be obserued.</p>
               <p>By this rule, if it be <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vse of this patience in domestic all troubles.</note> that causeth vnquietnesse, we are taught to suffer their vnquietnesse, whome wee can neyther reforme nor remooue, and not to make a great flame of a small sparke, by prouoking the vnquiet to more vnquietnesse. If it bee <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> that cause vnquietnes, <hi>Parents</hi> must be honoured, and <hi>Children</hi> must be cared for, though in some things they grieue vs: and God may amend them at the last, if wee in the meane while, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring patiently their infirmities, continue our duety to them, and our prayers for them. If it be <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Seruants</hi> that cause vnquietnesse, the <hi>Seruants</hi> in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience must bee subiect to their <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> with all feare, not only to the good and curteous, but also to the froward: they can not shake off their Maisters, while the dayes of their seruitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4128:45"/>
and the maisters in patience must do vnto their seruants that which is iust, not omitting any meanes whereby they may reforme them: and in the end, the master hath power to ease himselfe of an incurable euill serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by dismissing him. If it be neighbour against neighbor that causeth vnquietnesse, this rule teacheth, not to render euill for euill, nor rebuke for rebuke; but contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iwise in patience to blesse, and to doe all good offices in neede, whereby thou shalt haue peace in thy heart, howsoeuer thy neighbour bee disposed to contention. And if thy home-trouble be painefull sickenesse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon thy selfe, or vpon some of thy houshold, or some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other neare and deare vnto thee: this rule teacheth thee (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer other meanes for recouerie of health be vsed) to beare thy visitation meekely, humbling thy selfe vnder the mighty hand of God in euery thing. If thy trouble bee the death of any whose life thou didst desire, this rule will teach thee (knowing the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to bee vnto them the beginning of true life) to giue glorie to God with a quiet mind. This patience in all things
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4128:45"/>
will giue thee ease of thy burden, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of our Sauiour; <hi>Take</hi>

               <p>A second common rule in all these<note place="margin">The second generall is prayer.</note> troubles, pertaining to the right casting of them vpon God, is, that we pray vnto God, crauing his helpe, who for ought wee know, hath therefore layed these troubles vpon vs, because we haue been negligent in prayer: that now feeling sensibly in our sorrow, our neede of his helpe, wee might amend our old neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and fall to praier. And surely, whether God did send our troubles for that cause, or no; yet this is most sure, that prayer is a most profitable course for the easing of our trouble: which God commandeth with promise of ease, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Prophet, <hi>Call vpon me in the</hi>

               <p>And let no man say, there is no need<note place="margin">Need of praier.</note> in these troubles to trouble God with our praiers, because he knoweth both what we suffer, and what himselfe hath determined to do, for these reasons thou oughtest the more gladly to pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God doth vnderstand thy want before thou complaine, and is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to succour before thou intreate him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy labour with such a God cannot be in vaine.</p>
               <p>And this know, thou hast great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment for thy praiers in these and such like troubles.

And if thy domesticall trouble be sicknesse in thine owne body, how necessary it is to pray vnto God, to giue thee patience to send thee health, to forgiue thy sins, and to prepare thee for death? when <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle exhorteth to reioice for temptations, and to continue in patience, till patience haue her perfect worke, because these things require an extraordinary wisedome, he further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiseth vs to pray vnto God for that wisedome saying; <hi>If any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sometimes hath no care at home to teach his seruants to know and feare God: and if he goe to the house of God himselfe, he careth not to bring his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants with him: or if he bring them with him, hee looketh not whether they stay there or no: or if they stay, whether they marke and learne any thing or no: these are not the studies of his heart.

Sometime also an vndiscreet man, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by a neighbour of peaceable dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, presumeth vpon his neighbours softnesse, and offereth him wrong in such manner, as ouercommeth patience, and makes the quiet man to stir againe: and then hath he trouble in his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and feeles himselfe compassed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4128:53"/>
with troubles more then he looked for: in all these and like cases, the grieued man is the occasion of his owne burden, in these domesticall troubles.</p>
               <p>When he findeth this: then to cast his<note place="margin">How to cast those wrongs vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</note> burden vpon the Lord for his case, is to reforme the errours of his owne misgo. uernment, and to looke better to the waies of his family: and to reforme the errours of his owne life, that hee giue better light vnto his owne houshold, and draw them backe to goodnesse by his example, whom hee had corrupted before, and to giue satisfaction to his neighbour whom hee had wronged, and to abstaine from after-wronging of him. Thus stopping the fountaine of cause giuen by himselfe, the streame of offence take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by others wil soone drie vp (the common rules of patience and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty praier to God, withal not neglected.)</p>
               <p>If thy vnkindnesse to thy wise, and thy bad husbandry made hir vnquiet, vse her more kindly, and proue a better husband, and she shall be quiet. So let the wife by more dutifull and modest behauiour recouer hir husbands loue.</p>
               <p>If neglect of discipline, with too much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4128:53"/>
remisnesse in gouerning children and seruants, and thine owne euill example among them were cause of their disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, vse thy fatherly and masterly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity better, and giue a better example, and thou shalt haue them in better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

               <p>And if thy neighbour were prouoked to vex thee, because thou hadst first iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously vexed him, make thy peace with him for the first wrong, and abstain from offering a second, and hee will liue in peace with thee.</p>
               <p>Surely if the occasion of a mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall trouble grew from himselfe, this is to cast his burden vpon God for his owne ease, in the feare of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the occasion, to reforme the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in himselfe, to giue satisfaction, to seeke reconciliation, and to hold a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter course afterward: and to doe this in patience, ioyning withall praier vnto God, that he wil giue, both to himselfe, and to them that were his troublers, wisdome and grace, that hee may no

               <p>If God by death remoue the troubler from thee, it is his mercy to thee.

And that is a thing that thou must looke vnto somewhat more then only to thine owne quiet, that thou maist be able to answer God for their soules. If any member of the body be diseased and out of temper, putting the head and whole body to paine, a man will not at the first cut off that member, but first he vseth all meanes to cure it, and doth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4128:65"/>

And children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants are members in the body of thine house; therefore he is but a bad head and gouernour, that presently, because chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and seruants are troublesome, that thrust them out of dores to seeke their ease. By remouing them must be the last attempt. But if other attempts first made by thine own authority and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then after by the counsel of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and friends, and lastly by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and countenance of the magistrate, will doe no good vpon them, but they persist in their wickednesse, and proue incurable, to the hurt of thy selfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in thy family; <hi>Then the eie, the hand</hi>

First that it is the common condition of all <hi>Adams</hi> children, in this world to haue troubles; as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh most truly, <hi>Man that is borne of a woman is of a short continuance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 14. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and full of trouble.</hi> And if it be common to all, without exception of any (how great how godly soeuer) thou shouldst be too delicate to desire to be exempted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in a more neare manner, it is common to all the Saints of God to haue troubles in this world, more then the wicked, by reason of the enmity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4128:66"/>
that the wicked world beareth to the godly, being vnto them a step-mother, while like a naturall mother, she affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the delight she can vnto her own. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, thy troubles, if they should continue vnto the last hower of thy life, yet are they but short, for life it selfe is short, &amp; no trouble, but is shorter. They end and giue place one to another, and God interposeth between trouble and trouble spaces of quiet and gladnesse, and they are mixed with much cause of reioycing, not only in regard of future mercies hoped for, but also in regard of present mercies possessed. Which mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as good and pleasant, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of troubles: and therefore they are to be esteemed short: as also the Apostle calleth them, saying, <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and he that shrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for short troubles, is but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted.</p>

               <p>Fistly, let him consider that those troubles that disquiet his life, were not raised vp against him without Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: as <hi>Dauid</hi> said of <hi>Sheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

at the hands of the offerer, yet receiue them without griefe, and put them vp without disdaine at the hands of God, and for his pleasure sake.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let him consider that troubles auile much to the practise of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, they make vs remember God more often, and pray to him more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently then otherwise we would. They make vs remember our selues that wee are but dust, and haue offended God: they pull downe pride, and prouoke vnto repence: they worke in vs bowels of compassion, causing vs to pity others in trouble: they make vs lesse to loue this present world, and more to desire and long for heauen. These considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions put together, are of great power to make any Christian man to beare them patiently, and to esteeme them no burden, though God in his wisedome suffer them to lie long vpon vs. The rules hitherto deliuered, teach kindly how to cast our burden of domesticall troubles vpon God. When our trouble is caused by the wrong offered vnto vs by others, in their vnthankfulnesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, vniustice, or frowardnesse.</p>

                  </gap>eth his burden vpon the Lord. First hee will consider that it is common to all <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>earth:</hi> therefore death ought not to seeme fearefull to thee, that is common to all.

of death is taken away by the death of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and death vnto the Saints is made the gate of life: the Apostle say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>O death where is thy sting? O graue</hi>

But thankes be vnto God, which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Lastly, for his ease, of feare in the approach of death, yea for the filling of his heart with all true comfort in death, that he may rather desire and long for, then any way feare the houre of his death, he will consider, that his death shal be the gathering of him vnto Christ his redeemer: as the Apostle saith, <hi>Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>to bee loosed, and to bee with Christ, which is best of all.</hi> For while we liue in the world, we are absent from the Lord, and we walke by faith and not by sight. But when we depart this world, wee are gathered vnto him to dwel for euer with him. And that is performed which hee promised, saying, <hi>Though I goe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>

made easie to a beleeuer: and in all these considerations doth hee cast his burden vpon the Lord for his ease.</p>
               <p>If hee therefore feare his owne death, because others shall want him: his wife shal be a widow, his children shalbe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse, his seruants shalbe orphanes, and many shall misse him, that now haue a helper of him; and for their sakes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for himselfe, hee is afraid to die. This burthen is to bee cast vppon God, by commending them vnto his prouidence, who giueth food to al flesh, because his mercy indureth for euer: and who is the keeper of <hi>Israel,</hi> that neither slumbereth nor sleepeth.

Then the Elders of his house arose, to come vnto him, and to cause him to rise from the ground, but hee would not, neither did hee eate meate with them.</hi> Thus while there was hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he gaue way to the sorrow of his<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>dead: for they said, behold while the child was yet aliue, we spake vnto him, and hee would not bearken vnto our voyce: how shall wee say vnto him, the childe is dead, to vex him more? But when Dauid saw his seruants whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: Therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid said vnto his seruants, Is the childe dead? And they said, hee is dead: then Dauid arose from the earth, and washed, and annoynted himselfe, and changed his apparell, and came into the house of the Lord, and worshipped, and after came to his owne house, and bade that they should set bread before him, and hee did eat.</hi> His sorrowing ended when hee once sawe, that there was no hope of enioying any longer the company of his childe. Now this course seemed to his seruants a new and strange kind of philosophie, that he should mourne in the danger of death, and yet reioyce, or at least comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with any content in death: and therefore his seruants saide vnto him, <hi>What thing is this that thou hast done?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sa. 12. 21</note> 
                  <hi>thou diddest fast and weepe for the childe while it was aliue: but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eate meat.</hi> And

what reason had hee for this strange and vnwonted behauiour? <hi>Hee said, while</hi>

                  <hi>the childe was yet aliue, I fasted and wept: for I said, who can tell whether God will haue mercy on me, that the child may liue: but now being dead, wherefore shall I now fast? can I bring him againe any more? I shall goe to him, but he shall not returne to me.</hi> Behold, the same thing that maketh thee to mourne, namely, that thy dead shall not returne to thee: the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <hi>Dauid</hi> made the ground of his quiet and content, and thereupon he comforted his heart, and would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in heauines for that that could not be helped. So that it is (to a right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding man) ground enough to build content and quietnesse of heart vpon, that God hath done his worke, which thy sorrow cannot reuoke.</p>
               <p>But, for the further quieting of thy minde, know that thy dead shall liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And while he striueth to goe on in this course, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindereth him more then the root of sin, that is deeply fastened in his owne flesh. The Diuell offereth a temptation, and his false flesh yeeldeth presently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. The flattering world presenteth showes of vanity, and the flesh greedily imbraceth them. Occasions are offered and presented to our eies, and our traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous flesh suddenly apprehendeth them; and our actions fall out to be sinfull and euill, sometime at vnawares, before wee haue leisure to consider what we ought to doe.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4128:94"/>
of their burden, these things are to be considered. First, that where God hath giuen an heart grieued for these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, he neuer imputeth vnto them the sinnes that they so vnwillingly, and grieuedly commit, their broken and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased hearts being a pleasing sacrifice to him. According to the saying of the<note place="margin">Psa. 51. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Prophet, <hi>The sacrifices of God are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite spirit, a contrite &amp; a broken heart O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> So that God taketh more pleasure, to see them sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their committing sinne, then he doth displeasure for the sinne that they commit: for to commit sinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all mankinde, and we cannot chuse but to doe amisse, while we liue in this flesh: but to mourne, and to be grieued for sin, to striue against it, and not to commit it, but with dislike &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence taken for it, is proper onely to them that truely loue the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto such perfect holinesse vppon earth as they desire, nor vnto such an absolute conquest ouer their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such a full measure of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that sin shal haue no life nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

Therefore is it that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the heart, saying, <hi>My sonne giue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</note>

                  <hi>righteousnesse of God, and seeking to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish their owne righteousnes, haue not submitted themselues to the righteousnes of God.</hi> A single good intent without knowledge, is the deuotion of fooles, it hath no true comfort tied vnto it, it saueth not from destruction, it leadeth men blindefolde and sleeping into hell. But when men haue learned out of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4128:95"/>
word of God, what hee requireth, and what is their duety, &amp; vnto that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ioyne a true desire to doe their duetie, then vnfained desire is before God esteemed a perfect worke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>That loue is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Thirdly, to him that thus in heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, while he liueth here, full perfect and absolute holinesse (being grieued, that the lusts of his flesh should stand vp in his way with such strength as they doe) that which hee desireth shall in due time be granted, with increase of grace in the meane while. For when death comes, in which hee pulleth off sinfull flesh, he shal put off sin &amp; al corruption togither with the flesh, and thenceforth hee shall offend his God no more, nor

               <p>For the casting of this burthen vpon<note place="margin">To cast this burden vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, first study the Scriptures.</note> God, these are good rules and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, seruing to procure case, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by strength against the corruptions and lusts of the flesh is obtained. First, let him be diligent in the study of the word of God, which <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth, <hi>A lanterne vnto our feete, and a light vnto</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 119. 105</note>

                  <hi>our paths.</hi> Because in the spirituall darkenesse which ouershadoweth our souls in this world, so that of our selues wee cannot see nor finde out the paths of righteousnesse wherein wee should walke, if wee take vnto vs the word of God, it like a shining light, will reueale vnto vs the old way, which is the good way, that we may goe forward in it. It will teach vs what to doe, and what to leaue vndone, and will guide vs aright, against the dangerous seducings of our owne euill lusts</p>
               <p>And great force it hath to keep vs in our way, euen in those men, in whom their lusts and corruptions are most strong. As for example, in yong men, in whom there is more pride of wit, and more stubbornnesse of wil, then in men of other ages: in them, the word of God is powerfull, to make them adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and to humble them. <hi>Dauid</hi> asketh this question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Wherewith all shall a yong</hi>

                  <hi>man redresse his wayes?</hi> and hee giueth answer in the next words, saying, <hi>In ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed there to according to Gods word.</hi> Such an excellent help, against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing lusts of the flesh, is the word of

God, for the redressing of our waies. So that if a man burdened with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptues, &amp; desiring to obtain strength against them, doe giue himselfe to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the word of God, and do take heed vnto it, though he were as prowd wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as stubbornely wilfull, as were those yong men, the sonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the outrage at <hi>Shechem,</hi> yet the word of God will bring downe his prowd wit, &amp; reclaime the forward wils of the very dissolute gallants of the world.</p>
               <p>And this doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> being yet but a yong man, out of experience in himself affirme, saying, <hi>By thy commandements</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 119. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>thou hast made mee wiser then mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for they are euer with me:</hi> that is, I am a continuall student in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>I haue more vnderstanding then my teachers, for thy testimonies are my meditation:</hi> that is, my minde is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vpon thy testimonies. <hi>I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand more then the ancient, because I haue kept thy precepts:</hi> that is, age tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth much by obseruation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but Gods word teacheth more. So that while a man is carefull to study
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4128:97"/>
the Scriptures, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them his meditation, hee shall soone become more wise then his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and more able to direct himselfe, then the ancient, that think themselues able to giue councell. There shall not moue nor stir a corrupt lust in his heart, attempting to draw him aside to sin; but he being exercised in the study of Gods word, shal presently be able with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to checke that desire of his heart, &amp; to oppose against it Gods owne will.<note place="margin">Secondly, vse the company of good men.</note>

                  <hi>all,</hi> why should I doe so great wrong, either to my owne present misery, or vnto Gods infinite mercy, to beleeue otherwise, but that God hath holden me thus long shut vp and fast bound in the prison and fetteres of my owne vnbeliefe and naturall infidelitie and wickednes, (which now I see) to the end that I might the more dearely esteeme of his mercy in freeing mee (which I will now call for) and that his mercy might bee, euen to his owne name, the more honorable in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me. Thus may the afflicted sinner troubled with this generall &amp; confused kinde of accusing thoughts, cast his burden comfortably vpon God, for in this kind of temptation, there is this hole in the wall, wherein while hee dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by continuall prayer, it may &amp; will proue a dore of mercy, easie to be entred.</p>

If therefore the body be crazed, it will make the mind also to be disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and where the humor of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is predominare, &amp; is not kept in any euen proportion in vs, it naturally dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs into deepe and dull, into sad, heauy, and fearefull thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and causeth doubtings and distrust: and with a little helpe of the wicked aduersary, it will quench all comfortable hope, and breede wofull dispaire in vs; and the Diuell is cunning to iudge of our distemperature, and where he findeth such weaknes, he will worke vpon it; as he worketh vpon the sanguine and pleasant mans dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, to make him wanton and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of God: and as he worketh vpon the cholericke and hastie mans disposition, to make him wrathfull and sudden

in mischeefe: &amp; as he worketh vpon the fleginaticke to make him slothfull, colde and negligent of doing his dutie, &amp; a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of sloth &amp; idlenes: so he will not faile to be busie with the man, in whom me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy aboundeth, to make him full of feare, and void of hope. And lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table are the effects, which often follow, where he findeth such matter to worke vpon. The wise Christian therefore, that is affrighted with this confused kinde of temptation, in termes of generall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, must not neglect to releeue his body, and to remoue from Sathans hand that euill humour that he maketh so dangerous vse of. This is a thing that the afflicted man often contemneth as carnall counsell: &amp; indeed it were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counsell, if it should be required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without recourse vnto God by prayer: but it hath beene found by the mercy of God, to haue beene profitable counsell. And it is not to be neglected of him, that in this confused kind of tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, desireth ease to his soule. And to take this with the former prescribed course, is to cast this burden vpon God.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4128:116"/>
and necessarie for him to persecute the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and to cast into prison them that called vpon that name: as hee said before King <hi>Agrippa; I verely</hi>

for such an one sheweth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of his reuealed will, which the ignorant man cannot be charged with all: hee groneth only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of humane errour and frailty, but the other lieth vnder the burden of malice and presumption.</p>
               <p>Therefore when our afflicted man, pressed distinctly with some particular sinnes, findeth that they were the sinnes of his ignorance, let him not thinke himselfe thereby free: for to be ignorant of that which is our duty, required of God, is of it selfe a great sinne: and if his ignorance be affected ignorance, as in them that refuse to be taught, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the meanes of knowledge, when God doth offer them, such ignorance differeth little or nothing from malice.

               <p>And the anger of heauen, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<note place="margin">To the first part of it.</note> iust euen and holie, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shaddow the vnderstanding, nor disorder the iustice of God, that hee should not be able to discerne the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things that are not the same, or infold them rashly, and disordered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the same sentence. Anger is not in God a disturbing passion, as it is in men:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4128:142"/>
But it is the most euen and holy carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his iustice, as becommeth the righteous Iudge of all the world, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his plagues vpon sinners, and executing vengeance vpon contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, according to the rule of his owne word, where with hee hath made vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand acquainted, and according to the merites of mens workes, against which their owne consciences (iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in his iudgements) shall not be able to make any exception, to say, that in any thing hee hath erred from the streight rule of iustice. And this iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is that, which (in terms agreeable to our conceit) is called his anger. His eie therefore cannot bee deceiued in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming of mens sinnes. I remember a good speech of Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> to this purpose, <hi>God lieth not open to passion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>that he should be angry, seeing hee is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to no passion: but because hee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, he seemeth to be angrie, to vs this seemeth, because we vse to reuenge with a troubled minde:</hi> So that as anger sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a disturbed passion of the mind, troubling our vnderstanding, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting our iustice, there is no anger,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4128:143"/>
there can (by this Fathers iudgement) no anger be in God: but Gods iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge wee call anger, because our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is mingled with anger. Away therefore with this conceit, that the anger of Heauen should not discerne betweene thy sinne, and blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy-Ghost. The anger of Heauen is nothing else but the iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of Heauen.</p>
               <p>A second branch of thine obiection<note place="margin">To the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of it.</note> is this, that though the blasphemy of the holy-Ghost be the onely sinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, yet it is not the only sinne vnpardoned. It is not the onely sinne punishable, nor onely punished: thine also is a sin punishable, and may proue a sinne punished. I confesse all this to be true, what then? Doth it follow, that needes thou must be punished, because thou maiest be punished? that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence must not be granted, for then it would follow, that there should bee no place for any forgiuenesse at all, for sinnes are punishable, and deserue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. To reason so, were to spoile God of his honour that hee obtaineth by forgiuing sinne, where of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:4128:143"/>
                  <hi>Micah</hi> speaketh, saying; <hi>Who is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mica 7. 18</note> 
                  <hi>a God like vnto thee, that taketh away iniquitie, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage, &amp;c.</hi> It is Gods great honour to pardon sins that are punishable. And it is an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniurie offered to the riches of his grace, to affirme that hee will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue in mercy, because hee may punish in iustice. And such reasoning as this, would also make false all his promises, and make vaine and vnprofitable the hope of all his saints grounded vppon those promises, for there is none of them that hath not committed many punishable sinnes, which yet they hope shall neuer be punished. Yea it would make void the passion of our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and depriue him of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due vnto him by the saying of <hi>Iohn Baptist, Behold the Lambe of God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>that taketh away the sinne of the world.</hi> For verily euen those sinnes for which this Lambe was slaine and sacrificed, and which by the vertue of that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himselfe he taketh away, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable sinnes, sinnes deseruing the most heauy wrath of God, and the most
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4128:144"/>
cruel torments of hell. Away therefore with this idle reasoning, my sins are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, and therefore it helpeth mee nothing to heare that they are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Where sin aboundeth to deserue punishment, there grace aboundeth much more to remit punishment.</p>
               <p>The last branch of thy obiection is<note place="margin">To the third part of it.</note> this, that lesse sinnes then thine, and sins more easie to be excused, are often punished; then why not thine? There is no reason that this thing should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, that smaller sins are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. The Creditor may see reason to forgiue to one debtor many pounds, and yet not to forgiue another a few pence. The punishment of hell is due to all sinners, leaue God the Iudge to the freedome of his owne will, to shew mercy where it pleaseth him to shew mercy, and to forgiue, where, and what and how it pleaseth him to forgiue. Little sins, when men continue them, and regard not to repent of them, are brought to iudgement as well as great ones. And great sins, when men forsake them, &amp; are carefull to repent of them, are put out and forgotten as well as the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4128:144"/>
smallest. It is not the greatnesse and smallnesse of sins that makes them to be retained or remitted, but it is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>reeth from al together. This is plaine by the words of <hi>Esay,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing called for repentance, that the people should <hi>cease to doe euill,</hi> and, <hi>learne to doe well:</hi> immediatly addeth,<note place="margin">Esay 1. 18.</note> saying, <hi>Come now, and let vs reason to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>Though your sinnes were as crimson, they shall be made white as snow, though they were red like scarlet, they shall be as woll.</hi> Though the spots of them were neuer so foule, and though the staine of them were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so deepe, yet God will forgiue the sinne, and forgiuing it, he will cleanse and purge the sinner, This great mercy for the forgiuenesse of most great sins is promised to repentance. Where repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is wanting, the smallest sins shall bring the transgressour to iudgement; but where true repentance is found, the greatest sinnes shall be done away.

The one sort is, the Apostles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who by their doctrine doe beare witnesse to the outward man, and the other is the holy-Ghost, who opening the vnderstanding, and leading into all truth, doth beare witnes to the inward man.</p>
               <p>Now for seed, we know that when it is cast into the ground, it doeth not presently bring forth ripe fruit: nay, it doth not presently spring vp and shew

it selfe, but it resteth for a while in the wombe of the earth, hidden from the eyes of men, till conuenient time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: and if any man in the mean time should say, I see no fruit aboue the ground, therefore there is no seede in the ground, hee might be deceiued, and the Husbandman and Gardner that had sowne the ground, would censure him both of ignorance and boldnesse, and time would disprooue him.</p>
               <p>And as for witnesses, we know, that they do not speake, so soone as a man is prouided of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet so soon as they appeare in publique place; but being first prepared, and after brought to the place where they should giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they yet stay, and keep silence: and when the Iudge or Examiner is at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then they are called for, and speak their knowledge.

thee, to say, that because thou yet hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest not the testimonie of the Holie-Ghost in thy heart, witnessing with thy spirit, that thou art the child of God, therefore there is no such witnesse at al to speake when God shall appoint.

saluation, that I yet know not, and not knowing it, it is very like I haue it not, and not hauing it, I remaine still vnder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, and must perish eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And I feele it so in the feare of my soule, for notwithstanding all that you haue spoken to put life and hope into my soule, yet the burden of my sinnes, and the feare of damnation is no lesse heauy vpon me, then before you began to speake vnto me. I confesse indeede that the things that haue beene spoken, offer great comfort, but I want a right hand to take it withall. Help me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thorow, and shew me what are the conditions vpon which God forgiueth sinnes: that hearing them, I may know whether I bee capable of that desired happines: and if I be not presently, that yet I may indeuour in time to be, and so at the last obtaine it. For though you haue not deliuered me from al my fear, yet you haue wrought in mee a great desire to recouer, and get out of it, not without some hope, that it may one day, by the mercy of God, bee happily effected to my saluation.</p>
               <p>This obiection is tempered with some

               <p>The conditions required at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,<note place="margin">Conditions vpon which God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth promise to forgiue sinnes.</note> if we thinke to obtaine forgiuenesse of sinnes, are in number three. The first of these three concerneth our selues and our renouation. It is called repentance; a departure from sinne, and a returne to God in holines and righteousnesse: for it is meete for him that would haue his sinnes past to be forgiuen him, to cease from sinne, and hate the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherein he tooke pleasure before. Which ought to be hated, first in regard<note place="margin">Repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance is the first condition.</note> of God, because they are displeasing to him that is most holy, and hee that is most glorious is dishonoured by them: Secondly, they are to be hated in regard of our selues, because they cast vs out of Gods loue, into his iust hatred, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:4128:167"/>
robbing vs of true peace, doe fill our hearts with feare and horrour. And for thine owne part, I hope thou findest that the workes of darkenesse are to be hated, and hast a will also to hate and abhorre them, seeing what wofull feare and danger they haue brought thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And this repentance, and turning to God, will surely deliuer thee from thine old sinnes, so that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee laied to thy charge. It is a true saying of Saint <hi>Augustine, Non nocent</hi>

And this saying of his is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the Scripture, which must be thy stay before all the sayings of men. The Prophet thus speaketh, <hi>If the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi>

sinne, where it had stained as deepe as Scarlet, and like Crimson double died, in a colour not easie to bee changed, yet there will God clense the sinner, and make him as white as snow, &amp; as cleane as the fleece of wooll new washed and skowred.

thy heart to hate sinne, and to loue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and reforming thy life, to slie sinne and practise vertue. A second that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth most directly thy brother, that is, charitie and compassion to forgiue vnto him the wrongs done vnto thee, &amp; to comfort him, and to doe good to him, as thou wouldest that God should forgiue vnto thee the wrongs that thou hast done vnto him, that God should comfort thee, and doe good vnto thee. A third that concerneth most directly God himselfe, reuealed vnto vs in his sinne <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> namely, our faith, that wee neither thinke basely of the mercy of God, nor of the merite of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> as if there were some person that it could not releeue, and thy selfe that person; and some sinne that it could not do away, and thy sinne that sinne.</p>

Secondly, they haue no care of charitie and compassion to their neighbour, they regard not the rest, the credit, the prosperitie, the peace and safetie of their neighbour: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of pride, of wrath and furie, they prosecute the least wrong, till they be reuenged. Thirdly, they regard not to know how ample the Lords mercie is: and the death of Christ, and doctrine of saluation are foolishnesse to them: they pray not for faith, and they stoppe their cares against the word of God. And hereby it commeth to passe that they perish in their sinnes: not that their sinnes are so great that they cannot bee pardoned, or God so mercilesse, that he will not pardon them, or <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> so defectiue in his mediation, that he hath not done and suffered enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

them, but themselues are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, so prowd, so contemptuous, so desperate, that they will not leaue to sinne, they will not loue their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they will not know God, but they will goe on in their courses, like them whom <hi>Ieremie</hi> complaineth of, saying, <hi>They are all adulterers, and an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4128:178"/>
how great need thou hast of mercie and forgiuenesse, to keep thee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternally miserable. Learne to bee tender hearted toward thy brother, and afford him thy forgiuenesse, that thou maist obtain the same measure of mercy at the hands of God. And let it bee the chiefe of thy daily studies, to vnderstand more cleerely then yet thou dost, how infinite and boundlesse the mercie of God, and the merit of <hi>Christ</hi> his bloud is. In the word of God thou shalt finde these things. And while thou are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with desire in these studies, faith in the mercies of God will grow apace, and in a short time bring thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that happy quietnesse, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, saying, <hi>Being iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>

vnto vs, neither bringeth forth sinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, except a man be inticed, and drawne away by it. For when the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yeeldeth, and is corrupted by it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing as good, that that is euill, and approuing as true that that is false: and when the will yeeldeth, and is seduced by it, intertaining the motion with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and liking: then from the first thought there is a progresse made vnto some sinfull action, and in that action, men continue sometime impenitent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. This is indeed a dangerous course, and if thou giue such way vnto these euill thoughts, and first sinfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that thou allowest their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without checke, and sufferest their daily returne without controuling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and harknest vnto them with pleasure, or at least, with patience; then thou art (as <hi>Iames</hi> saith) inticed, and drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and then it is likely that those thoughts will conceiue (by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy will) and bring forth some monstrous birth of sinne; whereunto when thou art once entred, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and doubtfull, whether thou shalt finde grace to returne by repentance or

The first of these foule births, namely sinne, is thy shame: and the second of them, namely death, is thy snare and destruction, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>What fruit had</hi>

The Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> sent forth seuenty Disciples to preach the Gospel, sending them two and two together: and after their ministerie was fulfilled, <hi>the Seauentie returned with ioy, saying, Lord, euen the deuils are subiect to vs</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 10. 17</note> 
                  <hi>through thy name. And he said vnto them, I saw Satan like lightning fall downe from heauen.</hi> The preaching of the Gospel is a ministerie of power, it is the strong arme of God to destroy the kingdome of Satan. Where it is preached truely and diligently, the walles of Satans kingdome are vndermined, and when the people hearken vnto it, the deuill is cast out of them, and he falleth with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:4128:192"/>
from his soueraignty ouer them, euen sodainly, as the lightning, which breaking forth in the East, is sodainely seene in the Weast. Therefore, if Satan had that full power ouer thee that thou fearest, thy diligent attendance to the Gospel preached, will surely worke thy freedome. Let <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> therefore find thee a diligent hearer in the Temple, and thou shalt find him a mercifull Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in thy heart, and thou shalt bee freed from all power of that aduersary. And though he trouble thee with many wicked thoughts, yet thou shalt be as a prey plucked out of his pawes. And it pertaineth to the casting of this burthen vpon God, that thou do attend to the preaching of his word. And thereto ioyne thy humble and heartie prayer vnto God, and in due time hee will giue rest to thy soule from these euill thoughts.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, if I should offer to pray, I must pray without any promise: but so to doe were to pray idly, for then only doe men pray according to the will of God, and with comfort to be heard in their praiers, when they ground their praiers vpon the promises of God. But I neuer tooke heede to the promises of God, and at this time I cannot call them to remembrance, and if I could call them to remembrance, I were neuer the better, for God is not bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promises to any, but to them alone, that out of their loue to him striue to keepe his commandements.

               <p>Fourthly, I know not how to pray, how to begin, and how to make any proceeding: and if at any time I incline my heart to pray, I am disturbed I know not how, and other thoughts draw away my minde. While I thinke to aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, my minde runneth out into a wilde remembrance of my sinnes, with much pleasure to thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. While I thinke to pray for grace to assist mee against the power of sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the lusts of my heart call backe my thoughts, and I am deuising how I may compasse it to commit sinne, and my will wholy inclineth that way. While I thinke to pray for the inheritance of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:4128:200"/>

And euer my good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that should lead my minde, are crossed and put downe by my bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and I cannot raise vp, or if I raise it, I cannot hold vp my heart to God and holy things with any staiednes, I know what is requisite vnto praier by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And being so vnskilfull, and so vnable to pray, how can I pray, to preuaile by my praiers?</p>
               <p>And lastly (which is my greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe) when I thinke to pray, or when I doe pray, or when I haue praied, there is something within mee, that giueth mee my answer, assoone as I haue praied, and sometime before I haue praied, and I am
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:4128:201"/>
farre from attending vpon God, till hee doe giue mee answer, as if I did not pray vnto God, but rather vnto my self. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Wait patiently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:4128:213"/>
First, the thing whereof thou presumest to pronounce, is a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from mans iudgement, and whereof no man hath leaue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, till God by some euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens doe manifest his owne purpose. Three things there are (saith one) which are exempt from mans iudgement. The first is, the word of God, what hee hath spoken, that must stand; man hath no power to iudge it, otherwise then in humilitie to reuerence it. The second thing is, Gods eternal counsell, which is onely knowne vnto himselfe. And no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n can say, it is thus, or thus, vntill God by his apparant worke do manifest it. The third thing is, the reprobation of particular men, whereof no man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pronounce, nor indeed ought to iudge, either himselfe or any other to be of that number. God saueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth whom he will, not whom we assigne and nominate. Oft times they are vile in the sight of God whom wee approue and honour, and oft times they are honourable and precious in Gods eies, whom we thinke meanly of. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of him, <hi>He hath mercie on whom he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18</note>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:4128:214"/>
                  <hi>will, and whom he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will, he hardeneth.</hi> It resteth wholy in the will of God, and it is not as we fancie, thinke, or iudge. Of euery particular man the same Apostle saith. <hi>Hee standeth or falleth to his owne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Master,</hi> that is, as God our Maister shall be pleased, either to shew mercie, or to execute iudgement, so shall euery man stand or fall, escape or perish, not as either he himselfe, or any other shall iudge and pronounce of him. Therefore this point of particular reprobation, being exempted from mans iudgement (for God sheweth mercie, and giueth faith and repentance at his pleasure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen while the thiefe hangeth on the tree) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ust exception lieth against this vnkind obiection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the matter were such as man might iudge and pronounce of, yet I may without offence (if I see reason for it) deny to credit thy words, because as all men are, so art thou (when thou art in best tune) apt to be deceiued, and prone to receiue, imbrace, and deliuer a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thirdly and lastly, I haue at this time iust cause of exception against thy words, because thy present disease, thy disquietnes of mind, thy feare that thou art in, trouble both thy vnderstanding and speech, that thou canst neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things as they are, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them as thou vnderstandest them. And thou laborest vnder a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, directly bent against thy faith, perswading thee those things that are preiudiciall to thy soule. And out of some violent fit of that temptation, thou makest this vnkind obiection against thy selfe.

The Prophet by his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quickly found him out where he was hidden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at the crie of that praier, he heard and came forth to his succour. I might heere adde the example of our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who hanging vpon the crosse, and being vnder the same temptation for other mens sins, which thou art vnder for thine owne sinnes, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same words that <hi>Dauid</hi> did, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>My God, my God why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken</hi>

If hee should answer, that he thinkes hee was eternally forsaken, and that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ere an absurd answer. For the history is plaine and cleare, that though he were forsaken vnto the death, and lest vnto the will of his enemies, and sealed vp in his graue, yet as the Prophet, in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, had spoken to God before, saying; <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in the graue,</hi>

Forty daies after that hee ascended vp into heauen, euen with his body, and now in all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of glory and maiesty, he sitteth at the right hand of God. So that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would fully bewray it selfe, if he should answer, that <hi>Iesus</hi> was eternally forsaken, and that God returned not to deliuer him from his feare. And if hee answer (as truth will compell him) that he was forsaken onely for a time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inioyed againe, and still inioyeth the fauour of his father: then it will follow
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:4128:218"/>
by his owne confession, that all that are forsaken, are not eternally forsaken, and some are onely left for a time to be tried, exercised, and humbled, and after triall taken of their faith, after patience perfected, and true humility wrought in them, hee that had forsaken them, doth gather them againe into his lap, he that had left them to themselues, doth again receiue them into his charge. And why then may not our sinner, that crieth out thus, that he is forsaken of God, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himselfe to be onely forsaken for a time.</p>
               <p>And if our sinner, complayning that<note place="margin">He cannot say that he is eternally forsaken: reasons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> hee is forsaken, thinketh otherwise, as namely that God hath forsaken him for euer. I answer him, first, that he speaketh foolishly, and out of ignorant feare, that being a matter of Gods secret counsel, where of it is not possible that he should haue certaine knowledge, that hath not so much knowledge as hee should of Gods reuealed will. Let him goe first, and make himselfe better acquainted with Gods reuealed will, let him study to learne and know the promises, the threatnings, the precepts and rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

of the world) that he might haue had no cause to feare sinne: so long as the prodigall sonnes prosperity lasted, hee neuer thought of returning home to his fathers house. That surely is the way to scale vp sinners in their security, and to keepe them from all thought, or all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, or at least, from all resolution with speede for to leaue sinne: And so vseth God to deale with them whom hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh for euer: As <hi>Iob</hi> obserued, saying<note place="margin">Iob. 21. 7.</note> vnto God; <hi>Wherfore doe the wicked liue, and wax old, and grow in wealth? their seed is established in their sight with them, and their generation before their eies.</hi> Marke in the next words what followeth, <hi>Their houses are peaceable, without feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them.</hi> They are not troubled with any temptation like thine. <hi>Their Bullocke gendereth and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Cow calueth and casteth not her Calfe.

of a King, it was a point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable wisdome. Then for the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the fat cattell it might bee said, would you haue had him make war with flockes of sheepe, and heards of kine? That had been rather to play the part of a mad man, then of a noble warriour. And if they must be slaine, was it not better to kill them, some to day, and some to morrow, so as they might be meate for the people of God, then to kill them at once, and so to leaue their carkases to rot and stinke aboue the ground, and to be meate for dogs, and for the fowles of Heauen? And was there not many a poore man in <hi>Israel</hi> that was not worth a Cow, and many a poore Widdow in <hi>Israel</hi> that was not worth a sheepe, that might be inriched, at least releeued with this pray?

Then <hi>Dauid</hi> seeing that this deuice would not helpe him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued vpon a more wicked and cruell course, and sends <hi>Vriah</hi> to the Campe,

and writes by him to <hi>Ioab,</hi> the Generall, that hee should place <hi>Uriah</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of the battell, and in the time of danger should with-draw all helpe from him, and leaue him alone in the middest of the enemies, that he might be smitten and die by their hands.

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore say, I am a reprobate, for I haue sinned more vilely then <hi>Saul</hi> that was a reprobate? this were first to step too presumptuously into to the throne of Gods iudgement. Secondly it were to be vnthankfull vnto God, for that faithfull and most constant loue of his, that euen with such sinnes was not extingushed. Thirdly it were to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and iniurious to his owne soule, denying vnto himselfe the hope &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he might and ought to seeke in the infinite mercy of God: therefore though our afflicted sinner haue sinned
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:4128:234"/>
more vilely then many reprobates, it followeth not that hee himselfe must therefore be a reprobate: and though they that be reprobates, doe by their sinnes after committed, deserue the damnation, whereunto by the decree of reprobation they are appointed, yet hee and others committing sinnes worthy of condemnation, are not therefore to be iudged reprobates: and his sinne though grieuous, (as he affirmeth it true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be) is no signe nor euidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
               <p>Secondly hee alledgeth the wrath of<note place="margin">Gods wrath vpon me for sinne is no euidence of reprobation</note> God, now heauie vpon him for his sinne, to be another euidence of his reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which likewise must not be granted. For if this should bee a true rule, that wheresoeuer Gods iust wrath falleth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men for their sins, they vpon whom this wrath falleth should be reprobates, then would these great absurdities fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. First that all that suffer with <hi>Christ</hi> in this world should be reprobates. For there is no calamitie that falleth vpon men, in bearing whereof they become sufferers, but it falleth vpon them for their sinnes. And the calamitie so falling
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:4128:234"/>
is a stroke of Gods wrath. For the first thing, that the calamities that make vs sufferers, fall vpon vs for our sinnes, the words of <hi>Ieremie</hi> are plain, saying, <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>is the liuing man sorrowfull man suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth for his sin:</hi> we suffer no calamitie, but our sinnes (deseruing more) hath brought that vpon vs. And for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing, that the same calamitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vpon vs for our sinnes, is a stroke of the wrath of God, that is, of his holines abhorring sin, &amp; of his iustice correcting for sin, appears by the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micha,</hi> speaking thus of God, <hi>Hee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mica. 7. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>retaineth not his wrath for euer, because mercy pleaseth him: he will turne againe, and haue compassion vpon vs, he will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sinnes into the bottome of the sea.</hi> That is, for a while he punisheth in wrath the sinnes of his people, and after some short affliction indured, he forgiueth their sinnes, and receiueth them againe into fauour. In that saying of the Prophet, the worke of God in laying calamitie vpon his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for their sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is called his wrath. So that all the euils that fall vpon men, which suffer with <hi>Christ</hi> in this world,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:4128:235"/>
come vpon them for their sinnes, and are the stroke of Gods wrath against sinne, (not to destroy, but to correct) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it were a true rule, which our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted sinner speaketh, that where Gods wrath falleth vpon men for their sinnes, that wrath should be an euidence, of the reprobation of the person vpon which it is fallen, then those men which suffer with <hi>Christ</hi> in this world, should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates: which is most absurd and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, for that suffering is rather an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their election vnto saluation, because it is written, <hi>It is a true saying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 11</note> 
                  <hi>for if we be dead with Christ, wee shall liue with him: if we suffer, wee shall also raigne with him.</hi> But no reprobate shall reigne with <hi>Christ,</hi> that is the blessed preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them onely that are the elect of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if all that beare the wrath of God for sinne were reprobates, and that wrath an euidence of their reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then this absurditie would follow, that God should neuer bee displeased with his elect whatsoeuer they doe, &amp; should neuer lay any iudgement vpon them, that might be interpreted to be an euidence of his wrath, and iust displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:4128:235"/>
against their sinnes. Whereas the contrary is most true, and God often lets his wrath fall heauily vpon his elect for their sinnes. To that end heare the words of Gods Church, speaking to the malignant company of her enemies, that<note place="margin">Micah. 7. 7.</note> reioice at her trouble, <hi>I will look vnto the Lord, I will wait for God my Sauiour, my God will heare me. Reioice not against me, O mine enemie, though I fall, I shall arise; when I shall sit in darknes, the Lord shall be alight vnto me; I will beare the wrath of the Lord, because I haue sinned against him, vntill he plead my cause and execute iudgment for mee: then will hee bring mee forth vnto the light, &amp; I shall see his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</hi> The Church confesseth that she bare the wrath of God, shee confesseth that that wrath fell vpon her for her sinnes, and therefore promiseth to beare it patiently, because she bare it iustly, and she takes not that wrath of God for any euidence of reprobation, neither ceaseth to esteeme her selfe the chosen of the Lord, that shall inherit his fauour. And therefore she exerciseth her faith in looking vp vnto the Lord, and out of faith promiseth her selfe all gratious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:4128:236"/>
with God in her praiers, &amp; shewes her selfe rich in hope, that God himselfe will in due time plead her cause, and bring her out of the darknes of her trouble into the light of ioy, and so magnifie his loue and fauour to her, that her aduersarie the malignant congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shalbe ashamed. Therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God doeth often let his wrath fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the elect for their sinnes, and the manifest strokes of Gods wrath cannot bee said to be infallible euidences and signes of reprobation, as our afflicted sinner affirmeth to his owne great hurt. And if hapily vpon hearing of these things thus spoken, his diseased mind should begin to cauill and to say, that if other iudgements and strokes of Gods wrath be not euidences of reprobation, yet that iudgement and stroke of wrath that is fallen vpon him is a plaine eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reprobation, his iudgement being accusing thoughts &amp; a wounded conseience, the most heauie of all Gods iudgements, whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>A</hi>

therefore is most certaine, that euen this stroke of Gods wrath, when hee setteth our sinnes in order against vs, is no more a signe of reprobation, then any other stroke of Gods wrath whatsoeuer. This part therefore of his obiection, when he calleth himselfe a reprobate, is a bold and desperate speech, wherein he shews himselfe presumptuous against GOD, and vncharitable against himselfe, and whether he be a reprobate or not, hee ought not to pronounce himselfe to be one, the name of reprobation hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference vnto the vnknowne and secret counsell of God, not vnto the knowne and manifest sinne of man. And though our sinnes deserue reprobation, &amp; Gods wrath falleth vpon them that are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, yet neither the sinne that wee are guiltie of, nor the wrath that is fallen vpon vs for that sinne (though it be this particular stroke of a wounded consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) can be said to be arguments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.<note place="margin">Our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers are such as will stand before Gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seate.</note>

But if thou canst not giue life, presume not to take away life, thou shalt therein violate the worke of another; and if thou maist not kill any other, thou maiest not kill thy selfe, one God made thee and them: and if thou shalt be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of bloud in killing thy neighbour, thou shalt be guiltie of bloud in killing thy selfe: if thou maiest not touch the life of thy neighbour, thou maiest not touch the life of thy selfe.

I haue loden and ouer charged the earth with the burden of my sinnes, it groneth vnder that burden and can no longer beare it, therefore it must bee eased by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of me. And forasmuch as I haue beene the man that haue laied this load vpon the earth, it is meete I should also be the man to remoue it. This latter part of thy reason, that thou shouldest be the man to remoue the burden, that hast beene the man to lay on the burden, I hold to be most reasonable, he that did the wrong, ought to make the mends. But let vs agree of the true burden that hath beene laid on by wrong, and must be remoued by right. That burden thou speakest of in the first part of thy reason, wherein thou arguest thus; I haue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the earth with the burden of my sinnes, which it can no longer beare:
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:4128:266"/>
therefore I must by death be remoued. Doest thou not behold and see an error in this arguing? yea a wicked and most deceitful fraud of Satan seeking subtilly to destroy thee, while in the antecedent of thy argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thou speakest of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that presseth the earth, thou namest thy sins, and they indeed make the earth to grone: and when thou commest in the conclusion of thy argument, to speake of remouing this burden, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aiest nothing of remouing the sinne, but speakest altogether of remouing thy selfe: thy sinne is the burden, and thou concludest not to remoue the sinne, but to remoue thy selfe. If a man wounded by another, and desirous to be healed, should apply his meanes to the party that made the wound, and not to the wound it selfe, doest thou not see, that man that made the wound may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, and the wound remaine still as dangerous as it was at the first: but if he apply his meanes to the wound that was made, the wound shalbe healded and so remoued, the man that made it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still. Thy case is altogether like it, thou hast giuen the earth a wound by
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:4128:267"/>
the burden of thy sinnes, if the meanes for the easing of the earth, be applied, not to the sinne to take away it, but vnto thee to take away thee, thou maiest be remoued, but the guiltines of thy sinnes shall remaine vnto iudgement. But if meanes be rightly applied to take away the sinne, the earth is eased of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and thou also remainest in safetie, thy argument therefore should be fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus. The earth groneth vnder the burden of my sinnes, therefore these sinnes must be remoued. Hee is vnwise that cannot, &amp; he is vniust that will not discerne betweene the man that sinned, and the sinne by him committed. It is a true saying of Saint <hi>Gregorie.

So howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy sinne doe deserue death, yet if thou kill thy selfe without authority (and God neuer gaue authority, nor wil giue to any to kill himselfe) thou sinnest presumptuously, and insteede of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, doest dishonour him, first in committing wickednesse, and secondly in preuenting the noble honour of God, which he might haue won in forgiuing thy sinne. Gods glory is sought and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wrought by aduenturing thy life in his seruice, yea by loosing thy life in his seruice: this hee often requireth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rewardeth. Therein a man truely sheweth that he preferreth Gods glory before his owne life. Thus the Prophets
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:4128:275"/>
and Apostles, and all holy Martyrs haue glorfied God by aduenturing first, and loosing at last their liues in his seruice. It is their comfort, their glory, their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so to yeeld vp their liues to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the giuer of it. But Gods glory is not sought nor wrought by them, that in their discontent, and impatience, grudging at the troubles that hee hath laied vpon them, and despairing of his helpe to support and deliuer them, doe kill themselues, because they will not suffer. Therein they truely shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues enemies of Gods glory, grudgers at Gods will, preferring (euen to the losse of life) their owne wil before Gods will, their owne vniust will, refusing to beare the correction of God, before his iust will in correcting them. Can there be a more proud, a more wilfull, a more wicked and obstinat opposition against God then this? that a man shall say, I wil die before I will indure this at Gods hands, and after to doe it because hee may not haue his will against God. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any Prophet, neuer any Apostle, or holy man euer did so. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort nor glory in it, but dispaire, horror
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:4128:275"/>
and eternall confusion in it. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a most false and wicked reason. Thou shalt truely glorifie God if thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy life, thou shalt but dishonour and offend him in ending thy life.</p>

Let vs looke into the acts of God, and consider his reall proceeding: wee haue a notable example commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> to whom the father hath committed all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore hee should not bee ignorant of Gods carriage.

               <p>But in what case did death leaue him? our Sauiour telleth vs in these words. <hi>The rich man died, and was buried, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hell in torments, hee lift vp his eies and saw</hi> Abraham <hi>a farre off, and</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>in his bosome, then he cried and said, father</hi> Abraham <hi>haue mercy vpon me, and</hi>

Ther was his answer, stoping his mouth, &amp; leauing no place for any further hope of any good. While he liued he was wel, if any thing were a little amisse, it was fully recompenced with many pleasures: in the end he died, and in that death his troubles (if he had any) ended and his pleasures also. And where did death leaue him? in Hell: in what estate there? in torments: with what hope of helpe? he had liberty to crie and call, but there was no reliefe: and it seemeth the man vnderstood and feared so much, and therefore in his request he was very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate (if I may call it moderation, which was rather the faint request of a despairing heart) for hee desired not to be taken out of Hel, to be placed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where <hi>Lazarus</hi> was: he desired not to bee quitted wholy of his torments, and to possesse the ioyes of Paradice: he knew it was in vain to hope for or craue any such thing: And therefore like a saint-harted, fearing, doubting, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing creature, hee begged a drop of colde water, a thing of nothing, soone dried vp in the heat of that Fornace of fire where he fried. In the measure of his

are the words of the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> promising in Gods name these his blessings to the people, and requiring their thankes for them to bee returned vnto God, saying, <hi>The barnes shalbe full</hi>

This is Gods meaning in sending them and thou wilt not receiue them, thou wilt not eate that thou maiest be satisfied, thou wilt not vse them to the comfort and gladnes of thine heart: is there not in thy course manifest contempt of Gods goodnes? as if thou didst say vnto him, let him keepe his guiftes to himselfe, let him giue me none, I care not for them, I will

surely the second, that absteined from the good things that he might &amp; ought to haue vsed, for hee prolonged his first greefe, and ioyned a second greefe (euen the teeth of famine) to it, and so with a double prolonged plague consumed himselfe: whereas the other made quicke dispatch, this fondnes therefore in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to vse the good guiftes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the conceite is entred into thy phantasie that thou art vnworthy of them, is not a fruite of Christian humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, inspired by the Holy Ghost, it is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes, it is extreame dotage: yea if I should call it by the right name, I should say it is high crueltie against thy selfe, besides that, it is vile vnthankfulnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and the aduiser was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the old serpent that deceiueth the whole world.</p>
               <p>Lay all these things together: first the<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the answere to this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> bountie of God that giueth his blessings not onely to the worthy but also to the vnworthy, because the necessitie both of the worthy and of the vnworthy doeth require it: and by vnworthy, I doe not meane the godly, that in true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie doe iudge themselues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Secondly, the behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all the wise and well aduised sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> who euen then when they see and acknowledge their vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, yet in the feeling of their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wants, doe make hearty praier vnto God, that hee will be pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his blessings vpon them: and it is not onely a libertie that nature taketh to seeke for helpe in time of necessitie, but it is the libertie that God in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy giueth to his seruants, and which in pietie and faith they doe vse, namely to fly to God their helper in all necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thirdly the purpose of God the giuer of all good things, who giueth them not in vaine, but for our seruice and helpe, that we might vse them, and being cheared by their vse, might returne vnto him with thankes for his goodnes, so that whosoeuer refuseth to receiue them and vse them, deludeth as much as in him lies the good purpose of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth

Lastly the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the thing it selfe, namely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing of good things that God giueth and thou needest, it is a wilfull killing of thy selfe, while thou doest obstinately refuse to vse the things that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thy life: &amp; it is a most cruell kinde of killing thy selfe, while thou doest consume and waste thy selfe by little and little, tearing thine owne bowels with the teeth of inforced famine, continued and increased from day to day, for it is a more grecuous thing to be slaine by famine then by the sword: lay all these things together, and thy doc proue, this abstinence of thine grounded vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of vnworthines, to be a foolish, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and a cruell course.

And if we vse praier vnto God, that it will please him to blesse vnto vs his owne gift, which the word of God alloweth vs to vse, he will sanctifie it for our good: For God that giueth these things is good, the things themselues that God doth giue are good, therefore the effect of them being Christianly vsed cannot but bee good.

And this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of death (considering my present woefull estate) is fearefull vnto mee two manner of waies. First I feare lest death<note place="margin">First least he die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this temptation cease, that were to die without faith.</note> should take mee away before I be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from this temptation, as it may well doe; for I may die to day, or to morrow, yea I may die presently. And if I should so hastily die while this feare (directly contrary to faith) lieth yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my conscience, I should die in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, I should die without faith in <hi>Christ:</hi> and so to die without faith in the sonne of God, is the high-way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> saith, <hi>he that beleeueth not, is condemned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>because he beleeueth not in the name of the only begotten sonne of God.</hi> Secondly<note place="margin">Secondly, least the accusation be renewed after death</note> if there should be any ceasing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of these accusing thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my death, yet I feare death, because after death this accusation may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and the precedent ceasing proue no doing away for euer, but onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:4128:296"/>
for a time of this plague. And I haue cause to feare such a thing, because the right time of preferring accusations against sinners, is the time after death, when men must come to iudgement: as the Apostle saith, <hi>it is appointed vnto men</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27..</note> 
                  <hi>that they shal once die, and after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the iudgement.</hi> After death the soule commeth to iudgement, the book of conscience must then be opened, and accusations then or neuer must be heard: and if these accusations now be so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto mee, now while iudgement is far off, while there is place for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and hope of forgiuenesse, surely they will then be much more fearefull, woefull, miserable, horrible: therefore the remembrance of death, come it soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or come it later, come it before or after the stay of this temptation, is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto me.</p>
               <p>This obiection is not hard to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; <note place="margin">Answer to this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> thou fearest death two manner of waies.

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:4128:297"/>
is because it is possible that it may so come, for we may (and must if God cal) die presently: another because it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous so to die, thou takest thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to bee directly opposit to faith, therefore if thou die before it bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thou diest without faith, and to die without faith is sure damnation. Thus thou fearest deathes hasty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and to thy feare of death this way growing we will first make answer.</p>
               <p>Against thy feare of death comming<note place="margin">There is hope that thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall end before death come vpon thee.</note> before thy temptation be ouercome, God giueth comfortable hope, that death shall not come before thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be ouercome. And it comes not at all, but by the appointment of God, neither sooner nor later then he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.

comfortlesse nights. And in the meane time, while this temptation hath lasted, for thy further strengthening thou hast inioyed many mercies of God, both in thy soule, and body, and estate, and friends; for hee hath not smitten thy soule with the stroke that fell vpon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> thou hast had, and stil hast thine vnderstanding free, to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and harken after his mercy, and he hath not smitten thy body with the bile of <hi>Aegypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The condition of a Christian man in his holy calling from darknesse vnto light, is like vnto the appearing of day after a darke night.

Now we all know, that when the day begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to breake, there is remaining a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of darkenesse a long time, and that first growing light, is farre from the cleare and ful light that shineth at noon day.

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so, God shewing mercie to them that were shut vp in infidelitie, giueth them faith, which beginneth to growe like the day light, in the first breaking forth of it, and with some faith there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth much infidelitie. Shall any man therefore say, that because there is some infidelitie still remaining, there is no

faith at all; that saying were iniurious to the new conuerted and weake Saint, and it were an vnthankefull censure of Gods gracious worke begun. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what thou hast read in the Gospel, of the honest man, that came vnto the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> to intreat for his sonne that was possessed with a diuell: he said vnto our Sauiour, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi>

Such altogether is thy case at this time, weake faith oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by strong infidelitie, strong infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie keeping the vpper hand of weake faith: say vnto the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> as that man did, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi> And if thou thinkest his prayer to be defectiue, because hee onely craueth helpe against infidelitie, and desireth not increase of his faith, vnto the words of his petition, ioyne the words of the

petition, that the Apostles together<note place="margin">Luke 17. 5</note> made vnto the Lord, saying, <hi>Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our faith.</hi> These words put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make a perfect praier for this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar grace, that the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> of whose fulnesse wee receiue grace for grace, will bee pleased to increase our faith, which we finde to bee weake, and to weaken our infidelitie, which wee finde to bee strong.

Hee telleth vs of a heauie case, his sleepe he saith, is not quiet, but mixt with fearefull dreames:
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:4128:309"/>
at his table his minde taketh in more sad thoughts, then his mouth doeth bits of meate: the voice and face of his old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and former friends doeth now reuiue his greefe, so oft as he doeth either see them, or heare them: the fairest roomes of his house, which he had trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vp for his delight, if hee come into them, doe strike him with grieuous ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and all those things that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in before, are new matter of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heauines vnto him, and it is his onely content (though without) to sit alone in darknesse. This hee taketh to be some curse of God folowing him, and an euident signe of Gods iust and fearefull anger following him: for what should make Gods good creatures, (other mens comforts) to be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to him, but the onely displeasure of God?</p>
               <p>To this I answer, that it is very likely<note place="margin">Answere to this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that it is so, and will continue to bee so with him, so long as this burden of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing thoughts lies heauy, remaining vpon his wounded conscience.

In the meane time, giue place to this griefe as little as thou canst, and striue to reioyce in the Lord, and in the good blessings hee hath bestowed vpon thee, &amp; pray him that bestowed good things vpon thee, to giue thee a free heart to take comfort in his guiftes, that thou maiest be prouoked to praise his name.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ling of this burden vpon God, are these. First, that without deniall, excu sing, or extenuating of his sinne, he doe ingenuously and fully confesse vnto God his sinne, saying with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the Psalme, <hi>Against thee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4,</note> 
                  <hi>thee onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy sight.</hi> For hee that seeketh by any meanes to hide, extenuate, or excuse his sinne before God, as if he had not offended, or had not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wrath by his offence, shall not bee pardoned, but he that freely confesseth,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:4128:312"/>
shall finde fauour. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 13.</note> Prouerbs, <hi>He that hideth his sinnes, shal not prosper, but he that confesseth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh them, shal haue mercy.</hi> Secondly, let him patiently beare, and without all murmuring, the stroke of Gods hand, which his confessed sins conuince him to be most worthy of, and let him say with the Church, <hi>I will beare the wrath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Lord because I haue sinned against him.</hi> For murmuring &amp; impatience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh God more. The Prophet saith thus of God, <hi>With the froward thou wilt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 18. 26. 1. Pet. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>shew thy selfe froward.</hi> But patience win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth fauour at Gods hands for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith: <hi>Humble your selues vnder the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he must now hate sinne that hath bin so chargeable vnto him, and inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the will of God, and do it. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> likewise teacheth vs saying, <hi>amend</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>your liues and turne, that your sinnes may bee done away.</hi> For hee that continueth with delight in sinne shal neuer finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but heapeth vp more wrath vnto himselfe, against the day of wrath: the<note place="margin">Psa. 11. 5.</note> Prophet saith, <hi>Him that loueth iniquity</hi>

                  <hi>doth his soule hate.</hi> A fourth aduice is, that hee haue compassion vpon his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low seruant, and forgiue the offences of his brother, putting from him all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of seeking reuenge for iniuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aduiseth saying, <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiuing one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>another, if any man haue a quarrell to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> For he that hath no pitty vpon his brother, and exacteth satisfaction of him, shall finde no pitty with God, and shall be solde to pay the vttermost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his owne debt. As the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> hath plainly said, <hi>If ye doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue</hi>

                  </gap>orme himselfe daily more and more of the mercy of God, &amp; merits of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by searching the Scriptures, that doe beare witnesse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that he may by this meanes grow to beleeue in God, whereunto the written word affordeth great helpe for the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iohn</hi> is true of all the Scriptures. <hi>These things are written that yee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi>

               <p>For a perfect conclusion of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that God will nourish them, that in their wants doe wait vpon his hand for their food and maintenance, I will adde that diuine sermon of our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> in the Gospel of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi>

giuen vs our life more worth then meat: and finding him bountifull in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater things, why should wee distrust his goodnesse in the smaller things? Then follows in the same place, <hi>Behold the fowles of heauen, for they sow</hi>

His second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this: our distracting care can effect nothing, therefore it is vaine for vs to take care: and it is good and safe quietly to rest vpon him. He addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that speech, <hi>And why care yee for</hi>

                  <hi>I say vnto you, that euen</hi> Salomon <hi>in all his glory, was not araied like one of these: wherefore, if God so cloathe the grasse of the field, which is to day, and tom rrow is cast into the ouen, shall hee not doe much more vnto you, O yee of little faith?</hi> For apparrell, one part of our care, his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is as before for food: God beautifully clotheth the grasse, that hath not skill to prouide or fashion apparrell for it selfe, and it is also vile in his sight: then why should wee that are precious in his sight, and haue both meanes and skill to prouide and fashion clothes for our backes, why should wee distrust his prouidence.

for Christians to take such care. Secondly, the giuer of all things, that careth for vs, knowes our wants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee neede not to afflict our selues with care for them. Lastly, the sure way of obtaining these things at the hands of God, is (not to take thought for them but) in our calling to obey God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that hee may reigne in our hearts. If we take care of this, then God without our care will prouide vs of all necessaries. Such is the Diuine sermon of our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> assuring vs that God will nourish vs.</p>

The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> doth tell vs, that when the righteous perish (for so the world censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their death) and when mercifull<note place="margin">Esay 57. 1</note> men are taken away, then <hi>the righteous is taken away from the euills to come</hi> r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> their death is a full deliuering of them from al troubles, and therefore a lifting of them vp from all the miseries into which they were fallen. And for proofe hereof, it is most cleere, that the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in the gospel of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that man was fallen lowe into the pit of pouertie, so that hee was compelled to begge for his maintenance at other mens doores: and he was fallen as deepe into the gaping gulfe of sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and diseases, for hee was full of sores, and the dogges licking him were his best leeches, his pouertie could not purchase the helpe of any other (to cure him) in this world. And during this life

he was neuer raised vp from this fall, and yet God did not suffer him to fall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For at the last hee died, then ended all his miseries, then came glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,<note place="margin">Lu 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22</note> for <hi>he was carried by Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Abrahams bosome.</hi> Where, of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement (farre differing from his late condition in this world) <hi>Abraham</hi> said to the rich man, <hi>Now is he comforted</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25</note> 
                  <hi>and thou art tormented.</hi> So that if GOD doe not raise the righteous from these miserable falles while they liue, yet hee will surely doe it after death: and if hee doe not exalt them, and set them vp on high in this world, yet he will surely lift them vp, and exalt them in the world to come, and place them together in the heauenly places, farre aboue the reach of<note place="margin">Reuel. 21</note> all miserie (where <hi>there shall bee no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more paine</hi>) and where among the queeres of holy Angells, and in the middest of all true and eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, they shall for euer reioyce and praise god.
