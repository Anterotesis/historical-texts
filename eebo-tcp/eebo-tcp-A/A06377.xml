            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with great, earneſt, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
ſuyte, and rather by prayer

of the king or of the quene.
The ſayd lord prince after a greuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
ſickenes, toke hys leaue of the
king and the queene, in hope to reſt
him ſelfe a whyle at his houſe.</p>
            <p>In the meane tyme newes were
broughte of the cruell and horrible
but cherlye ſlaughter committed at
Waſſye in the preſence and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of Guyſe, where were
moſt tyrannouſly ſlayne many of the
kinges ſubiectes, as well men as
women and children, whiche were
aſſembled togyther to heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and to pray vnto God, folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

god, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd lord prynce main
tayneth with them, and truſteth to
mayntayne vnto death, by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
lawfull.</p>
            <p>This cruelty thus reported at Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ris,
moued in ſundrie wyſe, the one
partye and the other, in ſuche ſorte
that there was euen at that tyme
<pb facs="tcp:8171:4"/>
greate likely hode that ſome greate
miſchefe woulde enſue of it, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
being ſpredde abrode that the
ſayde Duke of Guyſe came in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
&amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great company beyng
determined to roote vp and deſtroye
all the congregations whiche they
call of the newe religion, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
alſo for their part, conſydering
that the kings decre and ordinance
ſemed not to be able to maintayne
them againſt the force, violence and
rage of their enemies, ſtode at their
defence hauinge firſte ſente to the
Quene certayne men of learnynge
and vertue, for to demaunde of her
iuſtice for the murder committed in
the ſayd place of waſſy. Thys was
the cauſe why the ſayd lord Prince
beinge at that tyme in good houre
arryued at Paris, for to goe to his
houſe, and deſyringe to remedie the
inconueniences that threatened the
towne of Paris, went at the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement
of the Queene to meete
the king &amp; her at Monceaux, where
he told them what he feared, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed
them that for the auoyding
<pb facs="tcp:8171:5"/>
of trouble it ſhould be good that the
Duke of Guyſe whom men ſayd did
come with great power, and with a
great company armed withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge
the kinges decree and ordenaunce,
at the leſt ſhoulde not paſſe through
the ſayde towne of Paris, whyche
thing was found good by the quene
and vpon occaſion ſhe wrote vnto
him with her owne hand.</p>
            <p>Now the ſaide Prince hoped that
the ſaid duke of Guyſe woulde haue
obeyd the Queene, and whiche is
more, that in laying a ſyde his wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pons
would haue ſubmitted himſelf
with all his companye, to the order
of iuſtice equalye obſerued in this
realme, as well in the behalfe of the
leſt as of the greateſt when they be
accuſed of anye crime, and that he
woulde haue come ſtraighte to the
kinge and the quene with al humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
according to his dutie: But it
chaunced clene contrary, for making
no other anſwere, but that he was
buſyed at Mantuil in feaſtinge his
frendes, he went ſtrayght to Paris
with a very great companye of hys
<pb facs="tcp:8171:5"/>
kinſfolke and frends, and ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and others, with open armour.
And he may not go about to excuſe
him ſelfe for taking the ſaid armour
and gathering ſuche a company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had of them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
reformed churches w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> men call Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots
whiche is as muche to ſaye
as heretikes. For it is wel knowen
that before the murder at Waſſye.
he marched with weapons forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the kinges decree and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.
Alſo that the moſt parte of
them that did accompany hym had
bene longe before called together
by him, and by others, out of al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this realme, ſo that longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was no talke at Paris
but of that, and of his comming.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, knowing that thoſe
of the reformed churches tooke the
way of lawe and iuſtice accordynge
to their duetie, it appeareth playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that if he had not ſought but hys
owne ſaftie, he woulde haue gone
ſtrayghte to the courte accordynge
to the commaundemente of the
Kynge and Queene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8171:6"/>
It appeared alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this comming
was practiſed of longe tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
becauſe that not onely the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
of the Conſtable and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which in the meane time were
gathered togither, did ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with him but: alſo the prouoſt
of the Marchauntes with a greate
troupe of the ſaid towne went to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue
him, and this entrey was
made in open armoure with great
acclamation of men hyred and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned,
as if the kinge him ſelfe had
entred in perſon. The Duke
of guyſe nor anye of his bande not
ſhewing any ſigne or toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thei
were diſpleaſed any thing at it.</p>
            <p>Nowe the ſayd lord prince beyng
retourned from Monceaux the daye
before, as is ſayd, fully determined
to goe on his iourney towarde hys
houſe, and being ſoddenlye aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the comming of the ſayd duke
of Guyſe with ſuch a companye and
route armed, determined lyke a
prynce of the bloode royall for the
ſeruyce of the kynges Maieſtie, and
the profite of the common wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:8171:6"/>
to ſee and prouyde for that whiche
the ſodeyneſſe of ſuche a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
folowynge the prayers and

in his company a certayne ſmal nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

The morowe after, bycauſe that

dyd alſo the lyke for the defence of
thoſe of the reformed church y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
ſemed (with Iuſte occaſion) to think
that all the ſayde force and ſtrength

late deede of Waſſy, and that there
was in this realme no warre beſide

            <p>Beſydes all this, you muſte note

very ſtrange, and ſuffycient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

            <p>On the other parte alſo, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal

            <p>More than this, the ſayde Duke

neuertheles hauinge obtained that
whiche he had moſte inſtantly requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
he ſturryd not for all that from
Paris: and helped him ſelfe wyth a

Lorde prince was there alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
wyth a greate number of
gentyll men, and that the towne
fearinge to be ſpoyled and ſaccadged
had deſyred and prayed hym to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

<pb facs="tcp:8171:8"/>
doynge he hathe priuilye rebuked

the contrarye was ſone perceyued.</p>
            <p>For the ſayde lorde prince to take

            <p>And than afterward being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertyſed
that the Queene deſyred
that bothe the companyes myghte
goe oute, and that for thys purpoſe
the King of Nauarre ſhould be come
into the towne of Paris, he was
ſo readye and willynge to obeye this

            <p>Nowe the ſayde Duke of Guyſe
cleane contrarye ſheweyng in effect

a thinge truly, not ſene nor

and that the Queene hys mother

of ſufficient profe maye bee made by
the teares that fell from our kinges
eyes, and by the talke that he had
being forced to ſuffer him ſelfe to be
caried to Meleum theſe dayes late
paſt. The which it ſhall pleaſe them
to remember that were preſent. So
that ſuche a comminge of the ſayde
Duke of Guiſe, and ſeaſynge vpon
the perſons of the King, and queene
his mother, and of the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans
his brother, ioynynge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

not be, nor ought to be eſtemed other
than a takynge and captiuitie of
them, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt hurtful, moſt
miſerable and ſhamefull, that euer
chaunced or coulde chaunce to this

pleaſe the Queene (mother) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the admonicion and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
that was gyuen her by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

<pb facs="tcp:8171:10"/>
And to thintent that this may be yet
better knowen and vnderſtode of all
true ſubiectes and faithful ſeruants.
The ſaid lord prince beſides that he
declareth things paſt deſyreth al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be aduertiſed of the enterpriſes
which is very eaſy to coniecture and
gather, which the fordſaid men doe

let them haue ſo much the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

That is, that hauing beſet, and then
caried to Meleum y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinge, the quene
the yong duke of Orleans, and thoſe

<pb facs="tcp:8171:10"/>
and whereof the ſayde lorde Prynce

            <p>And if the ſayde Duke of Guyſe
